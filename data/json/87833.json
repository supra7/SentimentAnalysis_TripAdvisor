There are two wings, the newer ones and the older ones. The older ones are really in need of renovation. Very run down, we had 5 rooms so we had a little of everything. The 2 bedroom rooms in the older wing are much better I think it's just the hotel studio rooms get much more use. The new wing was decent, beds are the best part of this hotel which is a very big plus. I rated this a two instead of a 1 only because a manager after he lied to me allowed me to pay for a half day stay after he told me someone was checking in. Then he tried to give me a guilt trip telling me that I was responsible for having his next guests wait for their room. Un real! I was lied to on 3 separate occasions by the front desk staff, I asked for a late checkout and to extend my stay a couple of more days. in all 3 cases they told me someone was checking in, when I offered to pay they said no problem and all of a sudden these rooms were no longer booked. Amazing, This hotel has a mandatory 8:30am bang on your door policy to make sure you're awake and out by 10am. we had 5 separate rooms and we checked in and out throughout the week and in every room this happened.

The resort is set back off of busy International Drive in a secluded quiet area. The location is very convienent to Disney, Universal and most all Orlando has to offer. We had the unit for a full seven days and only left the property one day to visit a water park, otherwise we just relaxed and enjoyed all the ammenities of this wonderful resort.

It was very convenient for us. The layout of the place was important too. You walk in to the villa and there's the kitchen. It's attached to the living room, including a large tv.

During the planning process we looked at several options; staying at a Disney property, staying in a local hotel, or using Marriott Vacation Club's new destination points program to stay in a time share near the Disney properties. We opted for the last option for a number of reasons. While staying at a Disney property package is probably the easiest option because it includes all the transportation to and from the Disney properties, it is also the most costly, which is big negative for most families. Another negative is that if you do not take a Disney package, you cannot have access to the Disney meal plan, which is extra but pretty good. So if you want to pay handsomely for convenience, then taking one of the Disney vacation packages is the way to to. We decided to stay off site at the Marriott Grand Vista, which is basically part of the Marriott Vacation Club timeshare properties. We chose a two bedroom suite. The property and physical layout is similar to many other MVC properties, although it seemed to me that the second bedroom (the \"lockout\") was somewhat larger than others we've stayed at. The kitchen working space seemed a bit smaller, but that did not bother us because basically all we had was breakfast every day in the room. What was a little disturbing was the description of the hotel on MVC Web site. One of the major reason we chose this site over some others in Orlando was the hotel's emphasis about being close to Disney and other attractions. Be be fair, it was very close to Sea World (which was basically down the road and where we spent one day), but getting to any of the Disney Parks on a \"Park Hopper\" ticket required a car ride of approximately 10 minutes without traffic (which during peak hours can get pretty backed up). But since we went the second week in February, the traffic wasn't bad. I figured that the cost savings of staying at the timeshare was worth the inconvenience of driving and parking at the Disney properties every day (parking is $14 a day and you are only charged once regardless of how many Disney parks you visit in one day). The timeshare and many activities and a golf course, but to be fair we used it primarily as a hotel and did not use any of its facilities, which bummed us out a little bit because the grounds were very nice. In fact, we talked about possibly visiting Orlando again without the family and stay just for the facilities at the time share. We found though that many of the people staying here were \"Disney tourists\" similar to us. Another tip if you are going to stay outside of a Disney property is to shop around for a car. Since there was four of us, we figured we needed a decent size car for all the luggage going to and from the airport. But while traveling to and from the Parks, you really don't need that size of a car, which was a dilemma for us. So I settled on shopping around for a smaller size SUV that could handle four suitcases comfortably. What I found was amazing. I started off finding an SUV for $640 a week with everything included (e.g. tax, and all the other tons of surcharges added to rental cars). As I continued to shop that price dropped from $640 (at Avis) to $245 all in from Enterprise, which I thought was a pretty good price for the 9 days we were there. Staying off Disney property with a car has another advantage in that you can visit a number of other sites and amusement areas at will. With a Disney package, since you spend much more for your vacation, you feel almost obligated to use all of the Disney facilities, which quite frankly after a while can get a bit tiresome. We had a great time and this timeshare property delivered a comfy homelike place to stay for the 9 days we were there. I would easily recommend it to any family visiting Orlando.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cJust the Right Everything!\u201d", "Author": "Sydneygirl22", "ReviewID": "UR125508315", "Content": "Really enjoyed our stay at this property!

We are not Marriott Vacation Club owners, however we are Marriott Rewards members. We took advantage of a Marriott Rewards offer of 20% off their Leisure Rate (normally $309 per night) for a rate of $247 per night. I came upon this property on Tripadvisor. We have relatives in Orlando and have stayed in numerous places over the last twenty years. And this one is a keeper!! We drove through the entry at 11:00 PM after a late flight. In the dark, the place looked beautiful. Check-in was swift and the man at the desk was very friendly, giving me a map of the property and explaining many of the things that the resort offers. The Grande Vista is huge - it has lots of condo type buildings that are six stories high. We had a 2 bedroom villa and it was lovely. It had a master bedroom with king-sized bed, jacuzzi tub and separate walk-in shower, 2 sinks with granite tops, own screened-in lanai with table and 4 chairs, flat screened tv and chaise. It also had a second bedroom with two queen beds, tv, own lanai, and beautiful bathroom. It also had a nice updated kitchen with granite tops, stools, dining area with table and 6 chairs, and lovely living room area with tv and sofabed. The place was clean, nicely decorated, and super quiet. We were given toiletries each day and a complimentary box of Tide to use the stackable washer and dryer. Because we were paying a nightly rate we received housekeeping (making the beds, tidying, swapping out the towels, etc.). I think it may be different for the timeshare owners. The place is a walker's paradise. They have a nature trail that is 1.9 miles that I used one morning. Another morning I just walked around the massive grounds. The property has 4 pools - we used two and they were both very niceand had ample lounges for the guests. They also have grills for guests' use - gas and charcoal. We had lunch at the pool one day and found the food to be good quality and priced reasonably for a resort pool. We also ate at their restaurant (Nick's Grill) twice. We had a great breakfast with omelettes and Belgian waffles one morning. We also had dinner and it was great (we weren't expecting it to be that good either) Service at the restaurant was fabulous too. They have tennis courts, a basketball court (my son rented a free ball for a while), boats for rent (pedal and motored), a Butterfly Garden, a Spa, etc. We also went to their on-site ice cream store once. The resort was located just off International Drive, near Central Fl Pkwy and close to SeaWorld. We found the location to be convenient for Disney and Universal Parks. They gave me a free gift that I never claimed because I was afraid of the timeshare sales pitch. But no one ever hassled us about that and it was nice. So, to sum it up, from a person who has traveled to Orlando a lot, this place was wonderful!!", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "long Island New York", "Title": "\u201c2nd stay at Grand Vista\u201d", "Author": "DonnaMari525", "ReviewID": "UR125153114", "Content": "This was our 2nd stay at the Marriott Grand Vista.

We just returned from our 2nd stay there and were a little disappointed. It was not quite as good as our stay in July. We had a very late flight and arrived at the resort after midnight. Check in was smooth and easy, however once we drove to our assigned room, there wasn't a parking spot to be found anywhere. We drove up and down, back & forth and finally found a spot 4 buildings away. This was horrific. We now had to drag all our luggage 4 buildings down and 5 floors up (yes, there is an elevator) This was the only time parking was an issue. They were repaving the parking lots so this is what caused the issue. To start out with, we had a 1 bedroom this time around. We again asked for a refurbished room. The front desk told us it was refurbished in 2008 so we figured it would be fine. The room was okay. It was much more worn looking than our room in July and not quite as clean. The countertops were not clean to the touch and the bathroom sink was gritty and had soap scum in it. Obviously, this did not make me happy as I felt that I had to clean before I unpacked. For some reason, we were given a handicapped equiped room and the bathroom shower had bars and a seat in it. The shower leaked all over the bathroom floor as there was nothing to stop the water from spilling in the bathroom. The shower had no lip on it at all and the shower curtain did absolutely nothing so everyday we had to roll up pool towels before we took showers to avoid the entire floor from becoming soaked. This was a real hassel as we were constantly dealing with large soaked bath towels. Everything else was fine in the room. I do really enjoy the Grand Vista. The grounds are beautiful, the pools are outrageous, however this time around my room could have been better.

The hotel was close to everything (if you have a car), and we usually left early in the morning and came back late at night. A couple of issues. First, the housekeeping service lacked a lot. When we got in the room, we actually found a pot stash left by the previous guests, in the top shelf of the kitchen (we threw it out). Then, the third day we came back to the room, and our room (the king bedroom of the two-bedroom unit) had not been made at all. They actually said that because the door was locked, they didn't come in. Mind you, the main door of the unit was open and the connecting room was open. We asked for fresh towels. Then the next day, the room was made, but there wasn't a sing towel in the bathroom! And we also had other issues later on. The convenience store was good enough, we got all the basic groceries there. But hte cafeteria was a very basic counter with a small menu to choose from. Not that great. Finally, you really need a car at this hotel. Just going from your room to the lobby could be a 15-20 minute walk, and the shuttles to the parks would be difficult to schedule around.

That being said this resort is beautiful. It is clean, up to date and well maintained. Everywhere you go you pass by multiple hotel employees going about their duties, all who are very polite. The pools are gorgeous and have some fun stuff for kids, but quite areas to relax as well. Okay I guess I can say 2 negative things, because of all the Marriott resorts I've stayed at in Orlando this is the only one without a playground?? It does have a huge indoor climbing area called The Maze, similar to what you might find at a chukee cheeses. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great way to entertain the kids if the weather doesn't cooperate. The resort amenities are also beyond what most of the other Marriott resorts in Orlando offer.

You can also eat at the pizza hut/fast food area that is for quicker less expensive meals. The resort also has a sit down indoor rest. which I can't comment about since I never ate there, but again something the other resorts don't offer. There are activities for kids, but not a ton.

We are now completing a four week visit during which we have been in four different apartments. Several of the apartments have foam mattresses which are too large for the fitted sheets, or is it the other way around? In any case the sheets come loose from the mattress in a night or two. Marriott has, like most hotel chains, adopted heavy comforters for their bedding which are much too warm for tropical climes, unless you turn the thermostat to 68 degrees, or lower. If you do this you might wonder why you are coming to Florida. Marriott claims to be going green so you may wonder why they don't encourage less air conditioning??? To save paper (or money) they have dispensed with daily delivery of the 'USA Today' directly to the rooms. Instead, they require that we trek to the main office, which can be as much as 0.3 miles distance. However, during the first two weeks of my stay they were out of papers by 10 AM. almost every day. A visit with the management resulted in them holding a copy in the office just for me. Too bad about the others who have not made special arrangements. We have had several visits from the maintenance personell regarding the use of the TV sets. They have installed fine flat screen TVs with DVD players; but after a year still do not have instructions for their use in their \"Vacation Experience Guide\". Their suggestion is to call for instruction! As a topper, the TV's channel guide does not include the new HD stations, therefore you have no idea what's playing! Marriott has not yet figured out how to provide a good night's sleep for an adult on one of their convertable couches, at least for a good sized adult. It's little wonder. As couches they sag in the middle and are extremely difficult to sit in, or get out of. During this four week stay we have also experienced doing without the only elevator for a day. We've had two toilets stopped up by normal useage, had a telephone replaced and reported lights burned out. (Do you begin to share our concern for the aging of the facility and lack of attention to interior maintenance?) From a positive viewpoint...... The location is excellent, the grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The lake is pretty, as is the golf course and the Tuesday evening entertainment with the dueling piano's is great.

I am writing this review from our villa. I know many reviews have been written and although the resort has a Wow factor upon arrival, the reviews should be better, one would think. Marriott just needs to make a few changes to give this resort a better showing at Tripadvisor. We are Marriott owners at two other resorts and so this was a trade. We tried to get into Cypress Harbour ( our favorite) but no room there for this week. I like this resort very much but have not had the same consistent service from the staff as at Cypress Harbour. That is what gives this resort a lower rating. It mostly comes from the front desk upon ck in, spending on who you get. I called 3 months ago to put in my request for the building we wanted.....we like to be near the Copa Loca outdoor poolside restaurant. Any of those buildings will have a panoramic view of the lake with the fountain or the pool. You need to look at their map. This time we requested the newest building, #77, or #78, right next to it. We thought it would be nice to be in the newest units, thinking they would be in the best working order. We own 2 bdrm units at our other resorts so that is what we requested. The agent at the front desk was very nice and saw my request on the reservation asking to be in either #78 or 77 and ABOVE the 2nd floor in order to have great views of the lake. She said she had a lakefront unit for us on the 2nd floor. I asked if there were any units above the first floor.....she then promptly put us on the 5th floor upon the 2nd request.....great.....you just have to ask twice, I realized to get the upper floor. Our 2 bdrm villa was beautiful upon arrival, but there was a strong smell of fresh paint and we had to open the patio doors to air it out. The building had recently undergone a soft goods renovation. Building 78 next door is undergoing a renovation right now, so there is occasional noise from hammers and workers hauling things or power washing. the view is spectacular from our terrace, so no complaints there. The difference between buildings # 77 and 78 are the second bedroom suites. They do not have the lock off feature. They do have a balcony. The biggest problem for us are the new mattresses Marriott is installing in the units when they refurbish. They are VERY hard and no pillow tops or memory foam as in the past. Also, the pillows are way too soft...no choices of pillows as before. The 2nd thing is that they no longer deliver a USA TODAY newspaper to your door each wk day morning. they told me that in an attempt to go \"green\", they are only offering the newspaper at the front desk now or in their Marketplace store. I understand this, however, this is a very large property and a long walk for some people, especially seniors. My suggestion to them would be to at least have a newspaper stand by each elevator . Minor issue: the hand towel racks in the bathrooms are placed too low on the wall so that the towels drag on the counter. The safe is not working...needs a new battery or something. So we take our valuables with us each day, based on other reviews I have read of room theft. Also, the master bathroom shower door does not shut properly....I mention this because on our last trip here, we had the same problem in a different bldg. Other than the above issues, the resort is lovely and so much better than staying in a hotel. the location is so convenient to Disney parks , Sea World and Convention Center. Would I stay here again?

We were a family of 4 with 2 small kids and the two bedroom suite gave us plenty of room. We were on the 6th floor in a newly renovated room in building 79 which overlooked the big swimming pool that also had the outdoor bar called Coco's. The room essentially was a one bedroom suite with an adjoining door to basically a normal type hotel room. The \"hotel room\" had a king size bed and a fold out couch. It also contained a mini-fridge, coffee maker and toaster. The bathroom was quite small and I would not recommend anymore that 2 people stay in this if you get a basic hotel room here. The connecting 1 bedroom suite was quite large. There was a jacuzzi tub in the bedroom room with a dressing table and the bathroom was large enough for 2 people to get dressed in. It had a large living room with a couch, 2 chairs and a dining room table big enough to seat 6 people. The kitchen contained a full size refrigerator, dishwasher, toaster, microwave, coffee maker, oven / stove top and a washer and dryer. It had basically everything you needed. We basically used the kitchen to make breakfast and pack a lunch for the parks, but there were plenty of utensils and cookware to make dinner. I believe they had a few grills downstairs as well to use. Both bedrooms and the living room had flat screen TV's with some HD channels. We had 2 patios, one of which was screened and the other was not. As several other people said, there is no maid service, but there is a place to take out the trash and it isn't too big of a hassle. They do provide one packet of soap for the washing machine and a couple for the dishwasher. They also have a couple of paper towel rolls and maybe 2 trash bags. We used all of this and had plenty but if you are spending more time in the room you may want to buy some more. The resort itself is huge. Building 79 was across the lake from the main resort so the only time we went to the main area was to check in and check out. We did swim in the huge pool we overlooked the last 2 days in the afternoon. There is a great shallow kids area that is about 2 feet deep that had toys that sprayed water so you young kids can have a place to play safely. We ate at Coco's which is the restaurant / bar at the pool the first night. Typical bar food and it was ok. They do have an outside bar there that has 5 or 6 beers on tap and TV's to watch sports on. For Sunday night football they had a huge inflatable TV they broadcast the game on by the pool. We also at one night at Nick's which is the golf course grill. We bought a $50 groupon for $2. The food here is pricey otherwise. The steak was great and the fish was decent. It was also kid friendly which is a plus. The resort is near the outlet mall off International Drive. It basically is right around the corner from Sea World. We spent our time at Disney and Universal and it was about equal distance to both (15 minutes give or take). Its a perfect location for visiting those two parks. There is a CVS and grocery store nearby (we didn't visit either one as we flew into Tampa and drove over and stopped in Lakeland to do our grocery shopping). We didn't really find any other good restaurants close by...one of the reasons I do not like Orlando is everything is a chain there it seems. I did have a couple of minor issues that most people have already mentioned. The internet service is so spotty. I stay in Marriott's all the time and this has to be the worst wireless service I have experienced at a major hotel. Some days it worked and others not so much. They should be embarrassed. The beds are hard. I really didn't mind it and we were so tired at the end of the days from visiting the parks it didn't matter, but if you have to have a soft bed, then forget it. Not sure when they updated the rooms why they did not do anything about the beds. The one last thing that was annoying was karaoke night at Coco's. We overlooked the pool where Coco's is located and they had the speakers for karaoke turned up quite loud. It was a beating. Thankfully they turned it off at 10 pm because we had to get up and run the Disney Half Marathon the next morning. Despite the above issues, I would stay here again. My decision is basically because of the room size, the amenities in the room and the location of the hotel. Overall for the amount of time we spent in the room we had a good experience.

The weather was a bit chilly but the pool was heated to the perfect temperature so we were able to enjoy the pool (even in Jan in FL)! The hot tub was fantastic and also heated to a perfect temperature. The grounds are beautiful and very clean.

They have a gift shop, restaurant(s), ice cream shop, Starbucks and other such amenities that were extremely convenient for my friend and I. For the price we paid we were extremely pleased with our accomodations. I will be back over Spring Break and the summer with my family! I LOVE this place!!

We did not take advantage of any of their facilities as it was just to cold and we ate at the Parks. The Marriott service was great as if we had any problems, they were very quick to address; additional towels, and spraying for bugs. We did see a couple of giant cockaroches in and around the room.

Our stay was for the week before Christmas and the resort is very full, but you can't really tell, it's quiet and seems very family friendly. The Nick Faldo golf institute is on the property and it's a fun 32 par 9 Hole course, great for beginners and/or serious golfers. $35.00 after 1 PM, and play as many holes as you like. The staff here is also great, you can store your clubs for free or rent them. There are lots of activities for families, kids and adults. And it's close to all the Disney action and almost next door to Sea World. We have stayed at Vistana Villages and Hilton International Drive in the past and so far this resort is the best of all, especially if you are a golfer.

Accommodations excellent. We were first time visitors and no one at the resort reviewed anything with us, so we found ourselves \"exploring\" more than usual. At check-in we were surprised by things not being as we had been told by Marriott's customer service. No problem, the desk clerk worked with us and was very friendly. We were invited to attend a 90 min presentation in exchange for $100 gift card, which turned into a 4 hour hard sell. We did however receive the $100 gift card, but not after much aggrevation. In reviewing our bill the night before checkout we discovered a duplication of charges approximating $350. No problem, the desk clerk admitted the error and refunded the money to our account. On Saturday, our check out day, we decided to obtain a final bill with a zero balance given the earlier incidence. Good thing we did, because when we got back home yesterday and checked our bank account we discovered that Mariott had re-charged our account for the funds they had already refunded to us as a result of their first error in accounting. Now we are having to work with our bank in denying the charges as well as Marriott to get them to once again fix their mistake. While we had a wonderful vacation and the accommodations being beyond expectation, losing 4 hours of one of our days to a '90 min presentation' and having to stay on top of the resort's accounting dept. put a real damper on our stay. Our advice to future visitors: don't believe everything Mariott's customer service tells you, check your bill at least three times, get a final bill before checking out (they'd prefer you just drop your room keys in a box and leave), and check your account when you get home. Check, check and double check.

Check in was a breeze, as we were placed in building 100, 4th floor which overlooks the practice green, driving range and clubhouse of the nearby golfcourse, facing south, so that you get plenty of sunshine on your porch and in the room. We reserved and received a studio unit with a king size bed and a efficiency kitchen (microwave, coffee maker and small fridge) with a fold out couch. Bathroom was good sized and well lit with a pleasant shower head spray and height. There was good channel selection on the flat screen tv, including high definition channels. In the closet was a large (big enough to hold a laptop) safe. The HVAC was easy to use and cooled well, aided by the ceiling fan. The downfall of the room was the hard as a rock foam mattress. We can't say anything about the pillows because we've learned to bring our own. We would've been better off sleeping on the pullout couch (we all know how comfortable those are). The grounds are well kept. There are numerous pools around the property, but we used the main one behind the main office, since we walked there from our building. There is a pool bar here, next to the overpriced store (but is good for forgotten items), the Pizza Hut/chicken stand and ice cream shop. But we found the better restaurant (Copa Loca) was across a nice bridge walk across the lake by buildings 79 & 84. The pool water was warm, but seemed to fluctuate day by day, but the hottubs were inviting. Pool towels were supplied in your room or can be gotten near the pools. Paddle boats could be rented to check out the lake. Be sure to stop at Nick's Grille, in the clubhouse building for a meal. We had breakfast outside, in the warm sun watching the golfers get going for the day. The breakfast was very good and had a good selection. They also offered lunch and dinner, but we didn't partake it either of them.

The stove was a coil burner type which only three worked, not the flat top stoves that I have seen and used before in other Marriotts. The microwave was a counter model that took up valuable counter space. The resort has a indoor play area which is nice but it is restricted to 52\" in height. While my 6 year old could play, his 8 year old cousin could not because she was a 1/2\" too tall. There are not any outdoor play areas that will allow kids from about 8 to 12 to play. Teens have the arcade and table games. My biggest complaint was how hard the master king bed was. The two queen beds in the second room were much more comfortable. The unit was clean and quiet. The resort was pretty full but we did not hear our neighbors either next to or above us. Since we were cooking the Thanksgiving meal, we needed additional cookware. A call to the front desk and we had what needed in about 10 minutes.

Our first day here there was a torrential downpour that lasted for more than 24 hrs straight. I don't mean some rain, I mean a run-to-your-car-and-you're-still-soaked downpour. I'll start by saying our 2-bdrm. unit was very nice. A large living/dining room, and nice kitchen. We also had two bathrooms, and the master bedroom was quite large with a nice whirlpool tub. We also had two covered patios -- one screened in -- which was nice with all the rain because we could still sit \"outside.\" I'm glad the room was nice because there is not a lot to do at this vacation club and everything is a very long walk (which would have been impossible in the rain) or short drive. We decided to drive to the \"main area' and still got soaked due to renovations/lack of parking near doors. THere is just not a lot of indoor activities. There's a kids' area, which my 8 yr old used for 1/2 hr and got bored. There's a couple pool tables outdoor under cover, and it was very crowded. Luckily, we had a big room to relax in, and we were tired after 3 days at Universal. Otherwise we would have been bored silly. Food choices are also lacking. I was happy to hear upon check-in that there was a restaurant with all the NFL games showing on Sun. But the restaurant is really a glorified food court with no ambience whatsoever. There's Pizza Hut and Boston Chicken, yuck. I did have a nice salad. THe manager was very nice and put on the game I wanted to watch, but not a place I wanted to sit for 3 hrs. Imagine a mall food court, without the selection. As the rain was still not letting up Sun. morning, my daughter and I did work out in the gym, which was nice. I also had a facial at the spa and it was the highlight of my trip. Sue went out of her way to treat me well, and gave me a wonderful treatment. As the rain let up we went over to the \"boating\" area which is just a small manmade lake with pedal boats. The lone employee here decided I looked like I wanted to hear all about how much he hated to work at the hotel, and decided to corner me and complain about his bosses while I watched my family play pool. Apparently no one told him people are on vacation to get away from that kind of stuff. So -- to sum up -- if you want a wonderful room and aren't looking for a variety of activities or food, stay here. The rooms are great.

Check it was VERY busy and even though we got there after 2pm, our room wasn't ready. The lines were long for the check-in process. We did check in, but didn't get our room keys. They told us to come back after 4pm to get the actual room keys. Now, if checkout is at 10am, why the 6 hour wait to check in? Anyway, we went to the fast food place right next to the lobby and got some quick food to eat outside. When we were done eating, the line at check in was still incredibly long so rather than wait in line, we called to see if our room was ready - no sense waitng in line only to be told that it's not done! So we did get our room keys and finally were able to get into our room. We had a very nice 1 bedroom with a pull-put sofa for the first 3 nights of our stay. It's great to have a full kitchen, regular size refrigerator, stove with oven and washer/dryer. They did provide us with enough dishwasher detergent for the week. They did not give us enough Tide for laundry! Here's a side note about the washing machine - it's small! It one of those stacked wahser/dryer combos, so it doesn't hold nearly as much as your regular machine at home. Also, the dryer seems to only have 3 settings - hot, no heat and off. I usually use the lowest heat temperature on my dryer at home, so I had to adjust the drying time accordingly. Otherwise, the whole kitchen/laundry area was neat and functional. They seemed to have taken a full inventory of the items in the cabinets so you didn't end up with 1 small spoon and 6 large spoons and there were 6 of everything - plates, cups, glasses, silverware, etc. There was some bakeware and a few Tupperware items so you could put leftovers away in the refrigerator if you wanted to. The dining area and living area had plenty of room for the four of us. My kids slept on the pullout sofa the first 3 nights. It's a pullout sofa - if you're looking for superior comfort, a pullout isn't the place to get it! Quite honestly, when the kids are that tired, they don't complain too much if it's not the most comfortable bedding on the planet! Nice sized flat screen television which had most channels - network, TWC, HGTV, Food Network, Disney, Nickelodeon, etc. My only complaint about the living area was the lack of outlets to plug in laptops and iPads so that you could use them while charging! Also, I did find the lighting to be a little tricky - some things you needed to turn on the wall switch then turn on the lamp switch. The wall switches were all over the place, so it was trial and error to see which switch worked the lighting you wanted. The master bedroom area was nice. Two closets - one with ironing board and iron, the other had the wall safe. Both closets were on the small side, but we stuffed our carryons and other smaller bags in the one and shoes in the other. There was a dresser/built-in that we used for clothing. Not huge, but enough for each adult to put one week's worth of clothing in. One thing I can say is that the mattress was hard - very hard. I like a very soft mattress, so I had alot of trouble sleeping on a mattress that solid. There were three feather pillows, so we eneded up calling down for more (which were delivered very quickly). The bath tub is in the master bedroom instead of the bathroom, which I'm not a big fan of. It's big and takes up alot of room. We didn't make use of the bathtub so I don't know how good it is. There was a sink included also, so it was nice to have two bathroom sinks. The bathroom was nice and functional - sink, toilet and shower. Sink had plenty of counter storage and storage underneath. Shower was ok - not a whole lot of water pressure, but the water was hot enough and stayed hot. There was only a small soap holder in the shower, so all other items needed to be left on the floor. We did have a toilet problem where it wouldn't stop running - for the entire day! From that point on we were very careful when we flushed that it shut off rather than waste all of that water! On day four of our stay, we added the lock-off as the second bedroom for our kids. We were told it was going to have 2 full/queen sized beds, but it only contained a king. Oh well - the kids had to sleep in the same bed! I will say this - before we got the lock-off, we could hear everything going on in that room: parents fighting with kids the first 2 nights, then a couple arguing about sports (at 2:30am) and dropping the f-bomb quite a few times! So if you're staying in a lock-off, be aware that the noise travels under the doors!!! The lock-off/second bedroom had a little kitchenette - mini refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, etc. The bed was just as hard as the other bed, but it didn't bother my kids! The second bedroom had a nice balcony that wasn't screened it. The master bedroom balcony was screened in, so I guess if you wanted to you could leave the door open and get some fresh air inside. We used 3 of the 4 pools on site. The pool by check-in, the kids pool area and the pools over by buildings 91 and 92. All pools were very clean - no trash around, no trash in the pool, no mess anywhere. Water temperatures were all about the same in the pool - not too cold, not too hot. The hot tubs were either roasting hot or cool! We commented one night that if you threw in some veggies, you could make soup on the hot tub - that's how hot it was! Not a whole lot of pool towels around though. There were supposed to be pool towels in your room, but we didn't have any in ours. I think on the second or third day we ended up with a whole stack of pool towels - I don't know if housekeeping picked up all the wet ones and finally realized that we hit the pool every evening or what! I think I only saw towels by the pool once, so I don't know where you're supposed to get them from! The staff was all very nice. The check-in staff was nice, even though they seemed a little slow! The concierge staff was nice and very helpful. They do offer discounts to area attractions and they do ask if you'd like to sit for a timeshare presentation. We didn't, but heard from other guests at this location who did attend the timeshare presentation and said it wasn't bad. There is a good amount of security onsite - gated entrance, security driving around in golf carts, etc. So when you walked around at night you did feel safe. Housekeeping staff was good, although there were times that they didn't come in to work on the room until well after 3pm. I prefer my room done in the morning, but what can you do? They did put the dirty dishes from the sink into the dishwasher and wipe down the counters in the kitchen area. I don't remember if they ran the dishwasher or not. Now for the negatives... Everything is far once you turn off International Drive. This place is huge so if you're looking for a small, intimate place, this isn't it! Sometimes it seemed like the ride to Disney was quicker than getting from the entrace of the complex to our building. Also, the speed limit inside the complex is 6mph. That's right - 6 mph! I don't think I go 6 mph in my driveway!!! If you get behind someone going 6 mph, be prepared to be awhile! This place really was great and we had a wonderful time here - close to shopping, dining, Disney and Universal.

I shared a two bedroom condo with a colleague and there was more than enough space for the both of us. My room had a large Jacuzzi tub which was most welcome after a long day at the conference! The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you would need to cook and be self-sufficient. One thing that did annoy me slightly was the fact that coffee was provided, but with only two little pots of creamer- after one cup we had to drink the rest black. Other than that, the room was great. Unfortunately since this was a business trip there was no time to test the vast array of amenities and activities, it seemed like there was lots to do here. We did however have pizza delivered to our room one night from the onsite Pizza Hut but this was over-priced and we still waited 30-40 mins for the pizza. The resort is very large - too large for my liking. At check-in, the friendly front desk clerk gave us directions to our room and pointed it on the map. The directions she gave were a little off however and we ended up driving around for 10-15 mins trying to find our room (which actually happened to be the building directly adjacent to the registration building which the front desk clerk failed to tell us). With a resort this large, it is hard to give great service to such a vast number of guests and it showed at this resort.

The posters experiences are in total contrast to the experience we had. We returned this year (October) having had a great stay last October and enjoyed our stay just as much as before. Our 1 bedroom villa was immaculate on arrival and housekeeping maintained the good standard throughout our stay (by the way I am extremely fussy when it comes to cleanliness, I am not easily pleased). All staff were helpful and friendly. We were greeted each morning by a cheerful friendly housekeeper. In the elevator we met the maintenance man doing his round who introduced himself and asked if everything was OK. He told us he wanted our stay to be like home from home and even asked if the water temperature was OK for us. At the pool bar 2 members of staff introduced themselves by name saying \"it's nice to meet you\" , they would have a chat and ask if we had enjoyed our drink. We did not encounter any loud unruly behaviour from other holiday makers. There are people from all walks of life at this resort, you'll see retired couples, the average 2 kid family and families with 3 generations having a grand gathering vacation! It is not at all stuffy which is what we like. I think it has the perfect balance of being a higher end beautiful resort with great accomodations while creating a down to earth feel, a place where you can be at ease and kids can be kids. What I love about this resort is the fact that you get all the living space and mod cons of a villa with all the amenities/facilities of a hotel. Although I NEVER cook on holiday I love the convenience of the full kitchen. I used it to prepare cereal, pastries, fruit etc for breakfast and having the washer/dryer is a God send. No more suitcases full of dirty clothes to contend with when you get home! By the way, I personally find the size of the washer/dryer and the cupboard it's in to be perfectly adequate and there was more than enough storage cupboards for our use. In fact the majority of them remained empty!

The first night simply terrible, we were put in building # 90 in room 124, when we walked in we hit with a wave of mold and mildew, it was horrific. I find it unbelieveable that Marriott would even rent the room, it was that bad. We turned the air down low thinking it may have been something we could take care of as the front desk had told us that the resort was sold out. But the smell did not go away, before we went to dinner around 6:00pm I called the front desk and they said they would send someone to the room while we were gone to check the mold. I called in the morning to get moved they finally said they would move us. I spoke with the front office manager Ethan Hauser, who treated me like I was an idiot, as if they did not know there was mold and mildew, the smell was so intense it had to develop over a period of several months, in fact the bell boy who helped us move told us building 90 has had serious mold and mildew problems for a long time and everyone is aware of it. The manager finally gave us a 100.00 credit to our room, after a 15 minute conversation of him giving me the run around, however I do not feel that was appropriate as the entire cost of the room for that first night should have been credited to us.It is unbelievable that they would actually rent a room that is in the condition of that room, not to mention the room was NOT clean, I picked trash on the floor, and there were hairs in the bathroom and the mattress was extremely bad, very very very hard. We were moved to building 80 on the 4th floor and it was very nice and up to the standards that a paying guest has the right to expect. After the first night we did enjoy Grand VIsta, the room was nice and the mattress was very comfortable. I would like to go back but I would be worried about being placed in one of the older buildings. If you stay here make sure you are in a refurbished unit.

As I've experienced with other Marriott timeshares, the mattress seemed rather soft to me. But with the help of lots of pillows, I was able to get comfortable. This resort is very large and spread out, with multiple 3-4 story buildings on the property. We used the small but very pretty and clean pool right behind our room a couple times. It was not very crowded and had a nice hot tub next to it. It had a small area for toddlers with sprinklers that shot out of the ground. We also went to the main pool one day. The kids enjoyed the multiple water cannons, as they got to shoot their parents with water over and over! The main pool had a baby pool, two hot tubs, and a chldren's area with lots of water jets and water cannons for them to play with. The thing it lacked, which would have been the icing on the cake, would have been some water slides for the kids. The resort has a very nice workout room located next to the front desk. I've stayed in multiple timeshares, but this was definitely one of the better workout rooms, with the amount of space and the new equipment, both machines and free weights. There is plenty for the kids to do, with the large play structure for kids 52\" and smaller (strictly enforced and socks must be worn), a roomful of video games, an outside ping pong table, fuze ball table, and billiards. Take-out Pizza Hut is also offered on the premises. DVD's can be rented for something close to $6.75 a night, which was too expensive, I thought. My biggest gripe with the Marriott Grande Vista was the cell phone service. I have Verizon cell phone service, and never, ever have issues making calls. Plus, I updated my cell phone when I landed to find the closest cell phone towers here. However, I could not get cell phone service in my room. I had to step outside, and still had a weak connection. It was really annoying. To summarize, I believe this Marriott is a solid choice. It's very clean and the grounds are well taken care of. Everything was in very good condition. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend. However, with the amount of competition for timeshares in Orlando, I will check out some other timeshares as well before returning.

I would think this hotel would be great if you are a golfer-period. We also did not have a car and there is NOTHING, you can walk to. There are not even sidewalks on International Drive where this resort is located. The resort is very large and very spread out. There are several pools, but if you have kids and they want to be close to the larger pools, that are more geared towards kids, do not stay at the back of the property. Stay in the back if you want peace and quiet, but be forewarned, that the back buildings (at least #90) are in need of attention. I was disappointed in the food choices here and there is no where to walk to if you don't like it. We had dinner in Nick's the first night, mediocre at best we thought. The food by the pool was from The Cove and was basically pizza and fried foods. We did not try the other on site restaurant. We had a one bedroom villa. The layout is odd, with the tub in the bedroom and the bathroom door in the bedroom as well. It was very loud if someone was in the shower or flushed the toilet. The toiletries were basically non-existent. They did not even supply hair conditioner. It has been a long time since I have been to a hotel with no conditioner or at least conditioning shampoo. The kitchen was well equipped. Maid service was disappointing. They knew there were three of us in the villa, yet each day we only received two towels. Some times, the coffee pot was not cleaned out. We were left a new coffee packet, but never any creams or sugars. The most positive report would be for the bellhops. These guys were great, driving us to the main entrance off International Drive to catch a trolley or back to our room from there. We took the trolley to Sea World, which was easy.

Housekeeping did not come to our condo suite until the 7th day of our 9 day stay. During those 7 days, my son played with his DSi whenever he had free time. He left the game system on a table in the bedroom. On our 7th day at the resort we were out all day and upon returning we saw that housekeeping had come in (beds were made, linen and supplies were replenished) and the DSi was gone. After a thorough search we called the front desk the next morning and someone from Loss Prevention came to take our report. He seemed completely disinterested and unsympathetic. After a day of no response, my husband made several calls to different hotel personnel but no one seemed to be able to address our problem. We had to deal with 3 different people from Loss Prevention before someone called us back. He told us that the housekeeper who came to our room was questioned and she said that she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not see any DSi in our room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

We have stayed in many hotels before and usually a card is left with the name of the housekeeper.

We will not return to this resort again nor recommend it to anyone due to their shoddy handling of room theft. This could certainly happen again to us and other guests.

Firstly we stayed in Bldg 77 Costa Brava, 2 Bed Villa, 7544. 2 Adults and 2,19 year old boys. A month prior to staying phoned the Marriott to confirm that the boys would have separate beds, was told no problem with the first week but may have to change suites for the 2nd week. Having exchanged with Interval this was down to the availability at that time. Nevertheless, was assured that they would try their best to get it sorted out prior to arrival. Unfortunately, when we arrived there was no record of my phone call but that they would do what they could at that time but could promise nothing. Thankfully when we phoned through to reception the night prior to the 2nd week commencing all had been sorted and we could remain in that villa. Reading through the remainder of this review you could ask why we did not insist on changing villas. COCKROACHES!!! The very first morning we had a visit. Phoned through to reception they sent someone up to spray the room when we went out for the day. 2 days later we had another visit. Just got rid of it ourselves on this ocassion. A week later yep, got another visit. Not happy this time so phoned through again and the room was resprayed. Thankfully after that we had no further visits. Packing and then re-packing was just a bit of a hassle when we had a tight schedule of things we wanted to see and do. The villas are extremely spacious and tastefully decorated, however the master bed did not have an awful lot of storage space for hanging clothes. Could have been cleaner too some food stains on furniture, peanuts under the TV cabinet and hair on floor in master bath. Not all the items on the inventory were present in the villa but not sure who checks that in any event. We were missing a cookie tray which would have proved useful on a couple of ocassions. Towels and tea towels were not all replaced when the cleaner came in mid stay. Several changes have occurred since we last stayed. The lighthouse bar is now a sweetery. Never looked busy so don't know why its there. Can now sit down in the Pizza Hut, previously it was just take out. The Copa Loca bar is far better than it was on our first visit and there is a new bar area at the pool near Reception. Did not go to Nick's Grill so cannot comment on that. The boys made use of the Gym and the Basketball court and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. The pool, spa pool and sauna were well used by all of us both first thing in the morning and late into the evening. We did not take part in any of the organised activities so again cannot comment. Location is ideal just off I-Drive. Shame resort does not offer Park Shuttle service. However, if you do not have a car you can still manage to get around on Lynx bus and the trolley. Used the concierge for some tickets they offer the same price as the discounted tickets at Orlando Visitor Centre on I-drive.

Anyway, the first room was a one bedroom villa in a building directly across from the registration office ... it is so nice to have access to a washer and dryer, particularly when nothing really dries in the humidity! It was also nice to have a stove for making breakfast. Everything was fine except for maintenance's response to our clogged toilet ... we called just before 11 pm and no one arrived until almost midnight. I really liked the second room we stayed in. It was a studio, but still a good size for a family of four ... one bed plus a full size sleeper / pull out couch. Unfortunately, no W/D, dishwasher or stove. Don't remember the name of the building but it was attached to the Copo Loco Lounge (the name might not be right, but it's close). Anyway, there were two building plus the lounge so if felt like a smaller resort and the pool was GREAT for the kids. The pool was broken up into two halves. One half was the kid side (water cannons, sprayers, etc) while the other one was the adults side (no playthings and closer to the lounge). One thing I should point out is that if you're interested in partaking in the resort activities, staying closer to reservations is probably better as you're closer to the \"action\". Rooms on the \"far side\" of the resort are by no means remote, you can get to the other side in 5 minutes time by crossing a bridge; it's just not as convenient. If you're planning on spending time at Sea World, Aquatica, the outlet mall, this resort is very convenient.

Forbidden Journey was a cool ride, not sure if really worth the 80 minute wait, but if you go it is something you have to do at least once. Walking through the Castle was amazing. We ate at the restaurant right in Harry Potter world, for $50 for a family of four, we got a nice big salad, ribs, chicken, roasted veggies and roasted corn on the cob served family style. A little pricey but lots of food. Better than a cafeteria style meal elsewhere in the park. So much food we really only ate once the whole time we were at the park, so go hungry! We also visited Cocoa Beach. it is a little more than an hour from Orlando. Nice drive out. You can drive right onto the beach at Cocoa and park right there on the sand.

It was about a 10-15 minute drive to the front gates of Disney. Depending which park you were headed to, it can take up to 30 mins to get to the parking lot. It is VERY close to SeaWorld. Closeby are several restaurants and a couple of grocery stores. Had a 2 bdrm, 2 bath and it was perfect for our family of 5. The property is HUGE. After the turn into the Marriott property it is quite a drive to the main building. There are tennis courts, basketball, as well as the pools. We had asked to be in a remodeled room and close to the main pool. We ended up being in the most recently remodeled room, but a few buildlings away from the pool. The villa has most of the kitchen things you need. We really appreciated the tupperware so we could bring food to the parks. This saved us a lot of money! Yes, there were tons of bugs, but it's Florida. What can you do? They would have several activities going on every day, but we were wiped out from Disney and only did some Easter activities by the main pool. There were just a few things that prevented this hotel from getting more stars. For some reason, one of the pools were partially blocked off when we went at night. Every time we went to the pool they ran out of towels. We had to wait for them to bring more towels. Also, I realize this is a timeshare, but they should put out a cart with supplies in the hallways so people can take what they need. I've stayed at other timeshares and this is common practice. But overall, it is a good value if you are trading your week in and want to do Orlando.

Unlike other facilities of this type the buildings do not look like barracks, they are attractively painted, they are clean, and VERY well maintained. Every building or grouping has its own pool that is also attractive and well maintained with an adequate number of chairs, tables, lounges, umbrellas and clean towels at each site.

The Shine Dims (A) Room Control - What the Grande Vista refers to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Room Control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is abysmal. In fact, there is no control at all! There appears to be no coordination as to what rooms are being reserved for whom and no control of the time for room availability. It is all random. We made our reservations for 3 villas 90 days in advance and requested early check-in and that our villas be somewhat near each other as we had two children to deal with and visit with. It is true that they say they will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TRY to honor requests\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when, in reality, they make no effort whatsoever to do so. Out of our 3 visits to this Marriott we NEVER arrived where our villa was ready for occupancy and only one time were we even on the same floor as the other people in our group.

Well, at least we were in the same building. FORGET ARRIVING BEFORE 4:00PM IF YOU WANT A NO HASSLE CHECK-IN (B) Cellphone Service - If Verizon is your cell phone provider you can forget using your phone for texting to coordinate the activities of your group; their service is, at best, pitiful. Messages are either not sent at all, or sent unreliably. In many on-premises locations there is no service at all. All-in-all, given the above, we were angry for the first day.

Based on the reviews I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing that those who rated the resort as excellent were given a new unit. My family was assigned to units 6600 & 6601 near the front. The furniture needed to be replaced as it was tears and stains on both the furniture and the carpet. The unit was infested with ants and my son was bitten on his back while lying on the sofa watching TV. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say anything to my family but the first night I was sitting on a chair in the living room and I felt as though someone was biting me. I next day I put a beach towel over the chair before I sat down. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to alarm the family. But the real shocker occurred in the master bedroom when my husband and I witnessed live roaches crawling from the nightstand. Ok I realize from traveling to Florida over the years visitors might see cockroaches because o Florida's warm climate etc... But domestic roaches are just unacceptable. I immediately called the front desk and spoke with Abby. She sent someone up who came with a can of hot shot. Hmmm. The representative told us that an exterminator would come by the next day for more extensive treatment. Of course that never happened. In reference to my son's ant bite, a resort representative delivered sting pads for him to place on his bites. The kitchen floor had scuff marks; the tile in the kitchen was separating from the floor. The ice maker did work and parking is horrible. Also in my opinion the restaurants are overpriced. If I was an owner I would be livid. We had lunch at the Copa Loca Bar & Grill and spent $95 for 3 adults and 3 children (ages 2, 2 & 4) on just sandwiches. The Disney parks prices were better than that. For example we had breakfast with the characters and only spent $100 for all of us which also included a generous tip for Ms. Judy our server.

This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't one of the most accessible unused plugs - internet connection was slow and unreliable sometimes - we had a room overlooking part of the golf course.

This is Florida known for many pesty insects. I do agree that the water did have some kind of odor to it but not worth mentioning. The golf course is beautiful. Didn't have time to play so I can't comment on it. The drinks and food are a little pricey but I expected it. They allow you to bring your own drinks throughout the resort as long as they are in a plastic cup. The only negetive comment I have is that they had a band playing across the street at the Golf house with Free shuttle service but when you get there it is one guy playing. Not a band. I would like to see a band play near the pool area one night a week. I wish they would offer shuttle service to the bus stop.

However, the Marriott Grande Vista didn't measure up to the standards met by their other resorts. First, let me say that the grounds and common areas were very well maintained. I wish the same could have been said about what apparently was an old building. Given the fact that timeshare owners may a yearly maintenance fee that is supposed to keep the units in great shape, there is no excuse for the complete lack of attention given to our unit in Building 96. The refrigerator was rusted all around the door seal and the crisper drawers fell out the first time we opened the door. The cabinet doors were well worn and the door to the trash under the sink was slightly sprung open. The shower in the mast bath has had probems with water leaks. Rather than fixing the problem they just attempted to cover everything up with huge amounts of sloppily applied caulk. The metal corner bead on the drywall around the shower was rusted and chunks of drywall and paint were coming off. The unit came with a DVD player, which was nice. However, the normal procedure is to hook it up prior to the guest arriving . I ended up pulling out the TV cabinet and TV in order to run the power and video cables. I assume that because we exchanged in there rather than own at that resort we were given the old crappy units. However, it doesn't speak well for Marriott and I say nothing that would entice me to purchase there. Do yourself a favor, if you plan to stay at a Marriott timeshare resort in the Orlando area, select a different location. The overall staff was very friendly. However, once you move into a unit and your days are already scheduled, you don't want to spend your time unit shopping.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cStay Here!!\u201d", "Author": "LaurenMass", "ReviewID": "UR91154546", "Content": "This was our first stay at the Marriots Grande Vista in Orlando.

We went with our 2 teenage sons for a Disney/Universal vacation. Our unit was recently refurbished. We had approx 1200 square feet with a screen porch and a deck. This unit overlooked the lake which was beautiful. The unit had 2 master suites on either sides of a living room, dining room and kitchen. My husband and I had a large 2 person whirlpool tub which I used everyday after walking the parks for 10 hours. Our boys also had a king size bed and their own bathroom. (no large whirlpool tub). We had 2 pull out queen size sofas which we didn't use but we could have brought 4 more people with us and been comfortable there. One of the sofas was in our sons room and the other in the living room. There is a granite breakfast bar that seats 3 and a dining room table that seats 6. The furnishings are very attractive. I was a little concerned about the bed because it seemed to be a little to firm, but I slept very well on it and they have great feather pillows. If you have a pillow top mattress at home, or need more padding you may want to call and ask if they have rooms with softer mattresses. I did notify them that it felt a little to firm and they said they were all new mattresses and had just been replaced. They sent me 2 additional mattress pads which I did put on the bed. We had 3 LG flat screen TV's. There is a washer and dryer in the unit and we did all our laundry the night before we came home. The only thing they could do to update the unit is to put stainless steal appliances in it. Currently they have white appliances and they are all in good condition but feel a little like the 90's. The pool and hot tub area is beautiful. We used the hot tub as well, and my boys swam in the 84 degree pool and enjoyed themselves. Overall I would give this place a 9 out of 10.

I just got back from a stay here and I have nothing but phenomenal things to say. Distance: The hotel is right in the middle of the action. It is about a 15 to 20 min drive to WDW and same distance to Universal Orlando. Sea World is literally across the street. A car is needed as there is nothing within the immediate walking distance. Parking is plentiful and safe. Check In/Staff: I arrived at 4pm. I was at the front desk for a grand total of 3 minutes. I was in and out!! No sales hag, nothing. Everyone at the front desk was polite. The staff on the property was top notch. I walked around the property several times and was greeted with smiles all the time!! I was highly impressed with the staff (I thought kindness only existed at Disney) Room: I booked a studio through Interval timeshare. I was worried about the space because studios can be small and crowded. I had also requested a view of the lake. When I opened to the door to my room - I was in shock!!! The room (while a studio) was pleasantly spacious. And the view (look at my photos). I had a view of the lake and the pools. I was on the top floor and it was just perfect!!!! If you want this type of view, put in your request 10 days prior and ask for Madrid top floor. In contrast to Disney selection of 10 channels, Marriott has about 100 channels with HBO!! I loved coming back from a long day at the parks and getting in my bed with full cable tv and free internet!!! Grounds: HUGE resort. However, I know because its Orlando, you may be off to the parks. Take at least one morning and walk around the resort. It is aesthetically one of the best appointed properties I have ever stayed at. I have stayed at Disney resorts countless times but Marriott is spectacular!!! The lake alone is worth the stay!! It is absolutely relaxing and beautiful!!! Pools: What can I say? The best!!! The pools all have great water features and waterfalls. Tons of beach chairs to lay around and be lazy. They open at 7am and close at 11pm. Take at least 2 hours to enjoy the pool - you will not regret it!! Sauna and whirlpools are also available. Activities: Nonstop!!! I did not get to part take in any of them though but they have things going on all day to keep guests entertained. Other comments: There is an ice cream shop on the lake in the lighthouse as well as a full service food court (pizza hut and pretty much standard flare). Both were inexpensive and delicious!! Rock climbing is also available; as well as boat rentals and fishing for a fee. This was my 2nd vacation at Marriott. This time was perfection!! I have no complaints about the property whatsoever, it was sheer relaxation!!!

We are Marriott time share owners and have been staying in Marriott time share properties for 20+ years. This hotel is only a few miles from Disney property and is located near a grocery store, gas stations, a huge upscale outlet mall and lots of great restaurants. It is on the same road as Sea World. The property is well-maintained and the pools are large and very clean. Both pools have bars with a good drink selection and a restaurant for quick, moderately priced meals (chicken quesadillas and buffalo chicken salad were delicious). The rooms are spacious, but a little dated. When I checked into my room, I noticed that the counter in my bathroom had not been cleaned. However, everything else in the unit was clean. We stayed in an older unit so the cabinets and appliances were dated and showed wear, but the counters, furniture and furnishings had been updated. The air conditioning unit in the bedroom was VERY loud and woke me up during the night each time it turned off and turned back on. Otherwise, the room was very quiet... no noise from the front or back (my bedroom faced the golf course... a beautiful view). Our unit was located right across the street from one of the pools and close to the front desk... very convenient. There was ample parking: we had two cars and found parking near our unit upon returning each night. This could be considered trivial, but the TV remotes for all three TVs in our unit were TERRIBLE! The remotes barely worked when held close to the TVs and did not work at all from the bed or couch. Cell phone service is also non-existent on this property so be prepared to drive off-property if you need to make a call or send a text. In addition, I found the sales staff at this property rude and impatient. Upon check-in, we were directed to the \"concierge desk\" to pick up a \"gift.\" This turned out to be a sneaky sales gimmick: the \"concierge\" was really the sales desk and in order to pick up our \"gift\" (a cheap reusable bag), we were subjected to a tenacious sales pitch. Even though we are already Marriott time share owners, the sales staff tried to hard-sell us on attending a sales seminar during our vacation (we did not attend the seminar). This sales gimmick was one of my first impressions of this property and I was not happy afterwards. Outside of our negative experience with the relentless sales people, the staff at the hotel was very nice and helpful. I had to send a number of faxes during my stay and the front desk staff was very accommodating. The restaurant and bar staff were also friendly and attentive as was the room cleaning staff.

Our guest services representative was very kind and offered us discount cards for the spa and restaurants since we were Marriott owners.

My only complaint - the kitchen could have been laid out better (the fridge was hard to open if there were more than 2 people in the kitchen at one time.) But other than that, it felt like home. The resort offers 4 pools, including a kid's pool with fountains and cannons - very fun! It also boasts a spa and kidnasium area - when we go back, and we will, we will be taking advantage of these amenities!

The grounds were gorgeous and the pools were superb. My family loved the ice cream shop and we loved the fitness center. Now to why this property did not get 5 stars- Roaches! We saw our first roach the first morning when we woke up. I called the front desk and they promptly sprayed our room. The next morning we awoke to several dead roaches in the kitchen, bathrooms, and living rooms. We called again and they said they would send someone to spray. This continued throughout the week with live and dead roaches being found on a daily basis. We called everyday and we were never offered a room change just told that they were sorry and that the roaches were bad at that time of year. The last straw was seeing roaches climbing on our food! Luckily, that was the day we checked out anyway. I know it is Florida and roaches are more common there, but come on! We should have at the very least been given a different villa. Our biggest concern with the roaches was with our special needs son who still crawls. We hated seeing him on the floors and we were constantly washing him.

We have never had a poor timeshare exchange in 20 years of doing this. This is a big resort though with several separate buildings - if you want a small one don't go for this. We weren't bothered our room wasn't around the main pool, which is big, as we didn't have any children with us and wanted the quiet. Having said that we faced one of the \"satellite\" pools which played music 12 hours a day (the only thing I could complain about) so we kept the windows closed and didn't hear it then. This pool however was not heated so to swim in comfort we walked down to the main pool which also has a heated lap pool. This was brilliant as never crowded. The unit would have slept 8 but only 2 of us - lock off room not used at all. In our unit it had everything you could possibly need (except EGG CUPS!) perhaps you don't use them in America?? Washer, dryer, full kitchen, 2 big flat screen TVs, a massive (for 2) jacuzzi bath and a Very comfortable king size bed. We always find the beds in America are SO comfortable! Could not fault anything about the staff, and everthing was kept very clean. The bar around the pool has happy hours, so use it then, but it looked like it could do with an update - Marriott take note - this was not up to your standard! We used the pizza hut at the resort and was excellent. It is actually situated next to the pool! which will tell you how big the resort is to have its own!

It was a magical experience. Staying at the Grande Vista was definitely a contributing factor. I was very surprised at how reasonably priced the resort amenities were. I have stayed at many resorts and often end up spending more on food and drink than on what I actually spend on the room itself. This was not the case at this property. They have a convenience shop, a restaurant that serves Pizza Hut and Boston Market-like food, a mini ice cream parlor, and a pool side bar. Like I said, everything was very reasonably priced, I was very content as I am extremely budget conscious. We also ate at Nick's Grill twice for lunch, and that was also reasonably priced. Dinner is more expensive, but the selections are more elaborate. We stayed in a one bedroom villa; very roomy, and a great layout. It had a dining room table, a full kitchen, a washer and dryer and two separate TV's which was great when my husband didn't feel like watching Tinkerbell for the fifth time. There was also a DVD player, which was great, because we brought some movies. When we are on vacation we probably spend more time in the room than the average family. If we have a long day of walking around, we usually spend the next day just hanging out. I really loved that the decor is updated, and the rooms were really clean. My only issue with cleanliness was the shower. I think the water in Orlando smells like sulfur (obviously not the resorts fault as I have stayed at other 4 and 5 star properties in Orlando, and they also had stinky water) and I think that the shower tiles need to be re-grouted more frequently than they are. There is no mildew growing per se, however, it did seem a little dingy. I am not sure why this would be as I was told that the rooms are refurbished every 55 months. This fact would not dissuade me from staying there again because I am super picky about bathrooms. Anyway, for the days we did not do Disney, we were perfectly content to stay at the hotel. They had a great pool and they offered so many activities for the kids. They had a build-a-bear type workshop, a campfire where we roasted marshmallows, candy bar bingo, and so many other activities for smaller children. They also have a huge indoor playground which my daughter absolutely loved. This is a Marriott Vacation Club property, so you can opt to do the preview of Marriott's timeshare program. I would say our preview was informative, but it wasn't. I really left with no more information than I came in with. Once our salesperson (Paul Diaz) determined that we weren't worth his time, we pretty much got the obligatory power point presentation and tour of the model room, but we were never given a range of prices for their program which was the type of info I really wanted. I think between checking his i-Phone (or Droid) and throwing out Marketing 101 terms such as equity proposition and Einstein's Rule of 72, he figured out he couldn't reel us in. To be perfectly honest, once he checked his phone in front of me (which is the rudest thing I think someone who is trying to sell you something can do) I would have never bought anything from him anyway.

Why? Well... day 1, we arrive at midnight. I check in, everyone was super nice. We get our room. The room was wonderfully located. We open the door and immediately my bf says \"Don't come in, Don't come in!!!!\" (I seriously thought he saw a dead body or something!). Come to find out he said that because there was a HUGE cockroach right at the entry way inside the room. I have a tremendous fear of cockroaches and he knew this so he tried to keep it from me. I handled it well though, called the front desk and the Marriott said they would take care of it immediately and they did. A woman came with a can of raid and sprayed around. Now I understand this is Florida where cockroaches are equivalent to rabbits where I live, but that's beside the point. I still don't want to sleep with them. Day 2. We didn't know it but they had ordered a real exterminator! He came in with the hard core stuff and started spraying. I was talking to him and telling him how FL was weird because we had our AC on 63 all night (and I am someone who is ALWAYS cold) and that it still felt the same as when we walked in. He told us that the other rooms were much cooler and that we should call the front desk because it is not typical. So I call. They say they'll send someone immediately. Someone came eventually but it kept us from going out and starting our day of our 6 day vacation so we got a really late start. He said something was wrong with the AC and he fixed it. Day 3 We found another cockroach in the kitchen. I seriously had to wash everything before using it. Day 4 I'm taking a shower and my eyes are shut and all of the sudden I hear a weird noise while lathering my hair. I open my eyes and the shower had a hole in the tube and was squirting water at the roof. Within seconds the stream became huge so I hurried up and rinsed my hair out and got out and called the desk (trust me I am NOT high maintenance and I was embarrassed to call again!) They said they would send someone immediately, and they did. Problem was the 2 people with me hadn't taken a shower yet. The bathroom was SOAKED. The maintenance guy came, said the hose was old and changed it, meanwhile he tracked his shoes through the puddle and the floor became filthy (not his fault I know). So then we all wait for them to clean it so they can shower and nobody comes. After 2 hours and another late start of our 6 hour trip my bf decides to sop up the water with the towels that we had and take a shower. He took one and so did my son. The maid didn't come until much later. When the maid did come they failed to provide us with the things that we lost in the shower explosion, like new toilet paper because it was completely soaked and we didn't have anymore, also we didn't get enough towels. I could have called again. Day 5 another cockroach, flipped over dead. Other than that I really don't know what to say. We were rushing on this vacation to begin with, because there's so much to see in Orlando, and yet 2 out of the 6 days were started extremely late because of how long it took them to fix stuff and when you're dealing with Disney World park hopping tickets this was not cool. Also, the place could have been cleaner. The floors weren't very clean. I want to like this place, because they tried hard, but I can't. I LOVED our room. The location was amazing! Everyone that worked there was nice.

We love all-inclusives and this resort offers the no need to leave characteristics. Unfortunately, they just don't quite get it. The best way to describe this resort is it is like a mirage. You can see what you want, but just can't seem to get there. A few examples of the small but more than anoying issues. On every floor there seems to be a centralized located cleaning locker. Every morning (early) the maid gets started by opening the door and letting it slam shut. Not just once or twice, but at least once every minute. When you come to a resort like this it is to relax and SLEEP LATER than you would while at home going to work everyday. During our last stay, the cleaning crew began steam cleaining the carpets at 05:30 (yes 5:30 in the morning). We happened to be checking out that day and stood behind others who also complained. We also complained about the early morning activities. Neither of us received so much any consolation. Item 2: You constantly need to call to the front desk to have people bring things that should be in the room. (i.e. no (yea ZERO) towels. You can have a TV in you room but don't expect batteries for the remote. There is a full kitchen, but no hot pad. (Seems superficial until you realize that you have something in the oven with no way to retrieve it.) Item 3: Very quick to close the pools due to wx, but not so quick to re-open. I write this understanding that this is an issue of safety, however, they appear to be VERY conservative on the issue while not so conservative about the room rates. Speaking from the point of view of someone that is required to shut projects down due to wx, They are extremely conservative. If you come, you better hope that there is no rain in the area (highly unlikely for Orlando). The pool will be shut down from 2:30 until 6:30 everyday during rainy season. Although, the pool should be shut down for safety reasons some of this time, not the whole time that a black cloud is in the area. It appears that is too inconvenient to re-open the pool as wx permits. Long story short, the general attitude from hotel staff. Too bad, you are here, you have paid and there is nothing you can do about it. Just for reference point, I spend approximately 50 nights a year at Marriotts.

I said you couldn't have given me preference or call my cell phone as stated?? An apology from her and off to the one bedroom villa. Villa was clean and had no problems, all appliances worked. Maid service was terrible. Because we were guests we were entitled to service however they came everyday after 4:00pm exactly when we were back from theme parks taking a break. So my wife declined everyday and we swapped towels and anything else we needed with maid then she was on her way. Resort is huge and pools were small and crowded. However didn't mind the crowd as much as the walk from our villa to get to a pool. We just drove and parked near the pool it was easier then walking.

Arrived earlier than 4 p.m. and our 3 bedroom villa wasn't ready. We headed to Downtown Disney and hung out there. I had my choice of 3 different buildings (none of them were located near either of the two \"main\" pools but I chose Building 90 due to it being a first/ground floor unit. I had read how the elevators were so slow if they were working at all. I have a bad leg. We had a 2 bedroom unit with a connecting studio. I liked that we were connected between the \"walls\" not like when you are only connected by breezeway. Rooms were clean and spacious. Building 90 was refurbished in 2007 and it still looks new. Plenty of room for 3 teens and mom and dad. Lanai area was screened in, that was a plus. Our view was a \"pond/lake\" and a fairway. Very quiet. That was one nice thing about not being in a building by a main pool. There was a quiet pool in the next building but we never used it. We didn't use the \"cannon pool\" either. All our pool time was at the main pool due to the kids playing volleyball, ping pong, etc between swimming. We never had trouble finding chairs as some people had said. True, the pool was always busy but never ridiculously crazy. Parking was fine. Lots of spaces to park by buildings. That was never an issue. Wanted to try a spa service but prices were really high (for me). Fitness center was nice and plenty of equipment. You MUST be out by 10, in fact, housekeeping came at 9:30 and asked when we were going. She acted put out. That ticked me off, we were going to be out at 10. They don't need to bother people when we know it is 10! Another thing that aggravated me was the problem with cell service inside the units. It was impossible to make a phone call from inside the villa. If I went out on the lanai and stood by the screen I could do it. Perhaps it is a Verizon thing but I saw several others doing the same thing. We had an issue with our stove not working. Called maintenance and they quickly came to fix it. The value for us was great because we were gifted a week from my parents timeshare and we only paid the exchange fee. If I were paying cash I would NOT stay here. Why? There were VERY FEW organized activities for teenagers. My teens were very disappointed in this. In fact, we saw very few teenagers here. Lots of little ones. If it weren't for the volleyball net, they would have been bored as there is only one ping pong table and one pool table. We stayed at Vacation Village Parkway last year and there was so much more for the kids to do there. Overall though, the price was right this time and we had what I always want more of--FAMILY TIME!!

We are Marriott owners of a Gold Week in St. Thomas, and traded our week for Grande Vista so we could take the kids to Disney. We have stayed previously at Marriott vacation resorts in St. Thomas, Breckenridge, and Aruba. We had done a tour of Grande Vista in 2007 before we purchased, and it was advertised as one of the nicer properties. Here are some of the things we liked/disliked: The grounds were very nicely done and the amenities (pools, tennis courts, etc.) were nice. I liked the central courtyard area with the store, gym, and activity center(s). Although the kids prefer pools with slides, they enjoyed the water cannons and fountains at the pool we used. The resort is within a couple of minutes from shopping dining and grocery stores, and within 15-20 minutes from Disney parks. There are 2 main pools and 2 smaller pools at the proprty. The 2 main pools have poolside bars/dining, which is nice. We had a couple of minor problems with the room upon check-in (a missing sprayer at the kitchen sink, and there were roaches on the back patio). The maintenance staff were there within an hour and fixed the sprayer and sprayed the patio. On the downside, we were hoping to get a room close to the one of the main pools, but the only thing they had available was one of the older buildings on the fringes of the resort. We had a view of part of the golf course, but it was a LONG walk to get to the main area. Even though we arrived early and told them we were Marriott owners, the front desk said all the good buildings were reserved for Grande Vista owners. The design of our building could have been better, as well. Thare was one elevator for the whole building, and not only was it very slow, but there were many times we had to wait for cleaning crews to get on and off with their carts. They could have added a service elevator for the guests' convenience. Also, we stopped by the poolside bar to grab a drink before picking up a pizza, and the female bartender was pretty rude. She was doing a 'wheel of fortune' game with a couple of other folks, and they must have been tipping well, because she treated my wife and I like major annoyances. Another female bartender we had at the kid's pool area couldn't have been nicer, though. There was a thunderstorm that closed the pool, so we camped out under her awning and had a couple of drinks and she was extremely nice.

We paid for an additional night (incl $30 food and beverage credit) at the start of our stay to work around our flights from the UK. Resort check in attentive and courteous - we had travelled for 24 hours thanks to the effects of the Icelandic volcano. Despite check in staff's efforts we had to move rooms on the first morning from block 83 to 78. The move was dealt with quickly and someone came to help us move our cases. In light of the negative comments on this site we were fearful that our second room would not be as lovely/well appointed and furnished as the first. We should not have been concerned the only difference was that we had a beautiful lake view from our new room in block 78! Excellent sized and appointed accommodation with good quality furnishings and equipment. The only niggle is the lack of reasonably priced cleaning/housekeeping services. When asked the central Housekeeping staff were unaware whether we would have a full clean at the end of the 1st week's stay before our 2nd week started, and were similarly vague about the cost citing approximately $80. We ordered a full clean on day 6 - which was not as comprehensive as the name suggested e.g. sink counters not cleared and cleaned, towels were removed and not replaced with clean ones etc. We then got a further \"full clean\" on day 7. This standard of resort deserves a reasonably priced bed and towel change service midweek for those guests who choose to stay in excess of a few days. There was a washing machine and dryer in the apartment and I used them so that I came home with cases full of clean clothes. However, I do not expect to have to wash my bedding on holiday. The grounds are beautiful and constantly manicured. The range of organised activities for all ages is excellent. Our 3 year old was a little too young for some of these yet, but he thoroughly enjoyed running around in the indoor a/c play area. The pools were very attractive and we had no issues with people reserving (and then not using) sun loungers during our stay. The pools were open until 11.00 pm and so if you have little children you may want to be based in blocks away from the immediate vicinity of the pools. We used the pool a couple of evenings to refresh our aching limbs after long days in the parks! There is a small convenience shop on site which had a reasonable selection of goods at a slight premium - but you're paying for the convenience of not having to get in the car and go and find Publix etc. There is also a Pizza Hut which will deliver to your door but we didn't have time to try it. We ate breakfast in Nicks Grill once - food was good (except the very uninspiring fruit cup) but it was a little pricey, and the staff there were miserable and disinterested. I used the on site spa 1 day but the staff member was not especially friendly or communicative, and snuffled her way through my treatment. I think there are probably better pamper options off site. The location is brilliant - away from the hype of I-Drive proper but incredibly close to Seaworld & Aquatica, and the joys of Disney are only 10-15 mins away.

Boy it was cheap...cost wise. We paid under $300 for 7 nights for a studio which is all we needed for the week (I was fairly busy at meetings from morning till 9 pm) Marriott's Grande Vista is exciting when you enter the property. The drive in from International Dr tells you that your stay will be quiet...the best point of the resort. You are off the beaten path so you know you will have a chance for a good night sleep...till you find out that the pool areas are loud and stay open till 11 PM. The guest services are very good including the guards who raise the gate for you. They greet you well and keep it up all week long. The registration is slightly faster than that of Sheraton and very helpful. The guards at the entrance really make you feel at home. We only had one meal at Nicks Grille. It was very good but kind of pricey for the portion size. The girl at the pool we used surprised me by making a mixed drink for a girl who was probably under age. She never carded her. The girl who ordered brought one of two drinks over to her father and she took the other one. Florida has a drinking age of 21. That is a pretty serious legal violation. Someday they will get caught and it will cost them. There were a few things about the property that were kind of issues or just off. First, there is NO wireless reception in the guest services area. I got a gut feeling they do that on purpose. Second, wireless service on the property was somewhat limited. My Verizon Droid did not work well here. Third, the bathroom vanity had water damage on the base of it. Needs replacing. The sinks and counters seem old. Fourth, for some reason the closet was rather small. Fifth, there is only one elevator for the building we were in, #92. This place has 6 floors of people! The elevator also has no air conditioning in it and is steamy from all the people coming in from the pool. Sixth, they have way too few pools for all the people here. Sheraton has tons of them and they are larger, or seems that way. Seventh, there is no washer/dryer in the unit. There is a set down in the pool area which was not too bad to use. Finally, the unit bathroom had no air conditioning vent. We had to keep that door open all the time to keep it cool. One excellent thing about Vista is that there is good parking. Lots of cars but good parking. Be careful when turning left onto International Dr. Very hard to get out. It would be best to turn right and use the u-turn lane just down the road.

Location: we really liked that its off the beaten path, no highway noise. Very close to the outlets, super market, sea world and only 15 mins from the airport. Disney its about 15-20 min drive depending on which park. Summary: I honestly can't believe people can complain about this place.

Being a Marriott TS owner in NJ we exchanged for Grand Vista. Our flight landed in Orlando 45 minutes ahead a schedule so we got to the the resort earlier than expected. As we pulled into the driveway the grounds of Grand Vista were impressive. The tree and flower lined drive was manicured and tidy. The place is huge but we did see the tennis courts, golf course and lake on our way to check in. We got to the front desk and the staff were courteous and friendly. After reading reviews I asked for a newer building close to the pools so I wouldn't have to walk far with my kids. The woman at the front desk said no problem but I was told the room that they had for us was newer and close (Bldg 94) which it was. They automatically upgraded us from a 2 bdrm to a three bdrm that slept 12! Now the only draw back at check in was we were told our room would not be ready till 4:00 and it was only around 1:00. They said we could make full use of the resort so we went to the pool and had lunch. After some lunch and swimming we were told the room was ready ( hour early).Upon entering the room we noticed it was very clean (smelled of bleach) and very spacious. Granite countertops, flat screen tvs and jacuzzi tub were very nice amenities. Our screened in porch was right on the golf course and with the exception of some landscaping was pretting quiet. I didn't know that housekeeping wasn't complimentary so finding out prices for tidy service ($44.00 a day) and full room cleaning (117.00 a day) was kinda surprising but having a washer and dryer helped. The pools were clean and had plenty of water activities for kids which was great. After going to the parks we would go down to the pool (Open till 11:00pm) for drinks and let the kids swim for a couple of hours, They had some cool theme nights at both main pools like reggae, cinco demaio, and calypso complete with live music and shows. Food was good but a little pricey, great to have pizza hut (on Site) deliver right to your lounge chair! Overall the place was great and we would have spent more time there if we weren't visting the theme parks everyday. This resort exceeded our expectations for our first trip to Disney with the kids.

The location is not all that convenient to anything, except SeaWorld. The check-in person I had was quick, almost robotic in her quest to get me checked-in and out of the lobby. The hotel wasn't even busy! The room we had was dark with outdated and damaged furniture. It consisted of a too soft king bed, a small kitchette, a sofa bed, a small table with 2 ugly chairs and a very small screened porch. When I asked to be moved or upgraded, I was told that in order to do that it would cost more money. Our view was supposed to be the golf course but we looked out to a small patch of grass and trees. The pool area is nice but they run out of chairs fast. Parking can be a problem also. The grounds are nice but there was a stain on our walkway to our room, a large stain on the cement that was never cleaned up. The staff is not very friendly and overall we decided to eat and play elsewhere. Basically, this resort has seen better days.The timeshare presentation was at another location and was very professional with no pressure whatsoever to buy a thing.

Suites were spacious, especially with both sides of the lockoff. Check in was very accommodating - I called about 12 hours before we arrived because we would be checking in late - 2 a.m. and I wanted to get a 1st floor suite because our daughter often runs around or jumps - they were very accommodating - it later turned out they were sold out, too. Suites were well furnished with all necessary kitchen equipment, coffeemaker, etc. Barbecue tools can be ordered from housekeeping. Maid service is by extra charge only. Our suite did have a faint musty smell, which caused us to leave the windows open most of the time - this was not a problem in early April, but I could see how it could be a problem at other times of the year. The room safe (key locked, not code) was broken. The biggest \"problem\" if you can call it that, was the water temperature. In both the shower and the sink, the water temperature could fluctuate between scalding and cool without changing the setting - apparently similar to plumbing in some houses where the temperature changes when someone else uses a faucet or toilet - except here, that person could be in a completely different suite! Oddly, I found this to be a problem even in the hotel spa when I showered after a massage. At least they're consistent, I guess. Also, our suite (Building 100) looked out on the golf course, which was very nice, except that the landscapers mow every morning or two at about 7:00 a.m. The larger suites have a washer-dryer, but it is small - we could only launder about 4 shirts/pants at a time. Parking when they are sold out or almost full is a problem if you return at night. On our first night, there was no parking near our building. There was a staffer on a golf cart who helpfully suggested I park at the restaurant parking behind our building and guided me there and drove me back - it took all of three minutes and I could have walked, but I was fortunate not to be disabled or unable to walk a distance. At less crowded times, this is probably not a problem. The pools appear convenient to all buildings and were clean and large. Deepest area was 5 feet or so, so most older children can stand throughout. There appear to be barbecues near each building, but gas only in two locations. The property is huge - I got lost once going to the exit. There is an indoor climbing/play area for children under 52 inches, and they actually enforced the size limit, insisting on excluding our autistic daughter who is tall for her age. But the monitors appear to be there only part time. There are numerous activities each day that would appeal to all different interests, if everyone wasn't in Orlando for the theme parks. There is a large man-made lake in the middle of the property with paddle boats, kayaks, etc. The one annoyance related to the activities is that one or more times a day, every day, there is a voicemail to all phones about all the activities of the next day. A schedule is provided when you check in, so this is unnecessary, and the voicemail does not indicate how to erase old messages. Within a few days, your voicemail box is full from these unnecessary and redundant messages, making it inconvenient if you have messages from others. Note cellphone reception, at least throughout our building (100) was consistently terrible. Fine on the grounds, but bad in the building. WiFi is free, but slow. The location is convenient to the freeway and airport (15 minutes) and Disneyworld (20-25 minutes without traffic). Seaworld is less than 5 minutes away, and the convention center is only a few minutes more. There are Publix and CVS Pharmacy about 1 1/2 miles away, and a Whole Foods and Winn Dixie about 7-8 miles away. The spa was mediocre as resorts go - clean, but with the minimum typical conveniences - there were towels, lockers, robes, a steam room, but I couldn't tell if the \"body wash\" in the shower was even soap - it seemed like water, and there were no extras in the men's locker room such as hairdryers, combs, shaving gel, etc. that one might expect. I had a 50 minute massage which was very good, but not outstanding by any means. 18% gratuity was included automatically.

We own a Marriott property in Arizona and swapped here for a 2BR stay over our spring break and Easter Weekend. Please note that this is a time share property primarily although they do offer rooms like traditional hotels too. The biggest difference for people not used to timeshares are their are a number of 6 story buildings spread out over the property, not a single building. And if you do the timeshare swap, you don't get housekeeping service during your stay. We stayed a week but used it primarily as a place to stay to take the kids to Disney each day, so we didn't use all of the amenities. Location: It's right off International Drive, a main drag in the Theme Park areas. Plenty of restaurants and shopping in the area including the Premium Outlet mall about 3 miles from the facility. You will need a rental car to stay here. It's a good central loction between Disney World, Sea World and Universal Studios. Room: We stayed in a 2BR condo in building 91 overlooking the smaller pool. Great layout, BRs on different sides of the condo, so you can keep the noise down between different rooms. The master bedroom had a king bed, small sitting area, big bathroom with jacuzzi tub and separate shower only. The other bad had the combo shower/tub like most hotels. The 2nd BR had two queen beds. Full kitchen with full sized appliances, stacked washer/dryer (work great, but are the smaller sized one). Nice dining area with 6 chairs and nice living room with pull out sofa and two chairs. Great 42 inch LCD TV (may be a little bigger) in the living room and other LCDs in the BDs. Balcony had small table with 4 chairs. Ours overlooked the pool and a golf course. I'm not sure when it was renovated, but liked the room and layout. The walls are a bit thin, especially by any connecting door. We could hear our neighbors at time (another family) Amenities: I know there are at least 2 pool areas (may be more). We didn't use the main pool since we were so close to the other one. Great little store, ice cream shop, pizza hut on property. I think I saw a workout room, but after days at Disney, didn't need the treadmill. There is also a Maze room for kids, but we didn't use it. There is a daily list of activities for adults and kids (mainly kids). Some are free, some have nominal cost. Free wireless internet. Service; We weren't demanding at all and since this is a time share, we really only dealt with employees at Check in and stopping by the store. They were all nice and helpful. We did get a call for the timeshare presentation but told them we weren't interested and they left us alone. I think this is a great property for families when you need a little extra space.

Although the front desk told me they could not accomodate my request for a new or renovated space, our building (89) seemed to have been renovated -- kitchen had granite countertops, new looking appliances, etc. The decorations were very nice. Unlike the experience of some other reviewers, our unit was cleaned (new towels, made beds, even new coffee) every day. We took full advantage of the amenities for families -- my kids (6 and 9) had a great time at \"Kid's Night Out\" (extra $$), which gave my husband and me a chance to go out on our own. They took part in pool games one afternoon, built battery operated cars another and used the climbing wall on the beach. The 9 hole golf course was quite nice, and did not charge greens fees for juniors after 3:00 when accompanied by a paying adult. The pools were heated, which was great since the weather was a little on the chilly side. We ate at least once at all three restaurants. Nick's grill is nice but pricey for dinner. The other two aren't really restaurants - one is cafeteria/fast food style, and the other is outside and part of the pool bar. We wished there was one indoor pub style restaurant, but other than that we thought the accommodations were exactly what we were looking for. Location is very close to Sea World. We had purchased (through AAA) 14 day return tickets, and the close location allowed us to return a couple times (although we paid for parking each time). We were about 10 minutes from Universal. We didn't do Disney this time, but I think it too is only 10 minutes away. There is a desk right at the resort to buy Disney and Universal tickets.

Note it is confusing and I am surprised no one else mentioned the difficulty of finding our building. There are building numbers which do not correspond to your building. The room numbers do not as well. Keep your eye out for the small sign in the front of each building to find the right place. This place is HUGE! We lucked out and stayed in the building facing the lake near the copa loca bar. Our room was a newly rennovated one which I requested and was terrific! The swinging benches under the pergola were a definite plus. The room had 2 flat screens, although only the living room had a dvd and not a blue ray one to note. There was a surprising 2 seater jacuzzi tub that was enjoyed by hubby and I. Granite counter tops in kitchen and double sink vanity. We had a screened in patio that was nice for evening drinks or morning coffee. There is plenty to do onsite from free pool table and rock climbing, a faux beach, paddle boats, fishing, an arcade. We did not eat at the onsite restaurants except for the food court Market place and we DON'T reccomend the chicken although the pizza hut pizza was good and can have it delivered to your room. They have a little sundrie shop much overpriced but convienient. There is golf although we are more of the mini golf variety. Pirates cove is a short drive and highly reccommend doing the full course. Bahama Breeze nearby is a good dining choice. We also ate at OCharleys which was a steel with a restaurant.com coupon. The food was very good compared to my expecatations. We do not have children but if we did would definitely take them. There are many many onsite activities for children even encouraged them to participate in the bar karoke which was surprising. This location was pretty well centrally located for the activities we did and that was appreciated. Staff was nice whenever encountered. Start your ice maker as soon as you chekc in and also ask at the marketplace for a complimentary bag of ice. The only cruddy thing was the shower stall had a little mold around the outside but not a big deal. We didn't use maid service as I only needed it once and they actually didn't come anyways so I cannot comment on that. The spa has specials if you book ahead of time but we didn't try it. We had a very relaxing trip seeing sights off the tourist trap such as Rivership romance cruise (recommend if over 60 but food was good), winter park and tiffany museum nice, and we made a jaunt on the way out to Cassadaga (Spiritual community) which was accurate.

The front desk gave us a pool view with a balcony (which the kids LOVED). The room itself seemed small. It was a king sized room with a pullout. Very cramped for a family of four. The bathroom was small also. Room had a fridge, coffee maker, hair dryer, micro (I think). While putting the kids to bed we noticed a big reddish brown stain on one of the sofa cushions. My boyfriend said it looked like they didn't bother cleaning it, just flipped the cushion over. GROSS!

We got a \"deluxe guest room\" that supposedly sleeps 4, but there is no room to move around (or sit) with the queen sofa bed opened up, and there is no room for suitcases/clothes for 4 people. This was a time-share sales special that we travelled on, and every time they called to confirm, they noted a room for two - and each time I corrected them that there would be four of us (to no avail, as our accomodations would only be suitable for two). Some people we know stayed the same week, but got the full suite for their family of four and enjoyed their room. The staff was generally friendly, but not overly helpful. Worse part was the New Year's eve \"celebration\". There are lots of activities at this resort, and daily phone messages to inform you as to what is going on. They advertised to \"come spend New Year's Eve at one of the poolside bar/grills\", so we made plans to do that. Well, New Years eve apparently ends early for Marriott employs, as they closed the poolside bar at 10:20PM, even though we were told earlier in the day that they would stay open if there were guests present and it didn't rain (there were still 20 or so people there and no rain when it closed). To make matters worse, we stayed there enjoying our last call drinks hoping to ring in the New Year without Marriotts beverages, when security arrived at 11:00PM and told us we had 3 minutes to leave! Bad enough that they were evicting us before midnight (on the one night of the year you'd expect to be out), but to give us the bum's rush of 3 minutes notice was just unbelievable. Again, we expect great customer service from Marriott, but we didn't get it here on this stay. The timeshare sales pitch was generally good, but they never told us the purchase price, and instead only discussed monthly payments (based upon rediculous terms) - this was a big red flag for us, which turned us off from something that may have otherwise been an interesting prospect. The idea that we got a deal to stay here to entice us to buy, but then got crummy accomodations is somewhat ironic as well - I expected to be put up in a room that I would love to return to - definitely not the case for us. The pool areas where VERY nice, however. There are several pools with different set ups for adults and children, all heated, which was necessary at this time of year.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta", "Title": "\u201cChristmas was ruined with a flood, poor customer service, and dirty room!\u201d", "Author": "blavie", "ReviewID": "UR52136061", "Content": "My husband and I checked in on Dec. 25th to a 1 bd Villa in Bldg 83 on the 3rd floor and upon inspection the bathroom and kitchen didn't appear as clean as we would have like, so I proceeded to disinfect the entire two rooms. Within an hour and a half arriving and sanitizing the whirlpool, bathroom, and kitchen a pipe in the hallway burst which sent water gushing into the hallway and shortly thereafter into our room with full force! We were credited $50 for the inconvenience and moved to Building 90 but once we arrived we were disgusted by the lack of upkeep on the building, the dirty rug, and the remote location of the the room. So we packed up again, and this time went to the main bldg and spoke to a manager who apologized and credited us with an additional $50 but honestly I was not satisfied because at that point we were not able to attend a show at City walk (Blueman) in which the tickets costed us $140 and we had not had dinner and as a pregnant woman you can imagine how uncomfortable I felt. In addition, I had a bag of wet clothes and they had no way to dry clean them so I was stuck to deal with the mess. At this point, it's Christmas day around 9pm and we're pissed! We've been moved twice, left with a bag of wet clothes, wasted money on unused tickets and the attitude of the front desk was not that accommodating. So finally, we were moved to building 82-room 2525 and the space was in better condition but also not clean to our standards. For instance, the bathroom shower door had water stains-it appeared someone had taken a shower and it was not cleaned thoroughly after. The other area of contention was that I previewed the property on a timeshare spiel last year and was shown a room with stainless steel appliances, flat screens, and granite countertops. We were put into a room with plastic appliances, big older model TVs, and an older room with less appeal. In addition, we had to go to a 90 minute presentation even though I paid $680 for the 5d4n stay. What a rip off!! On Day 3, I asked a house keeping employee for a new bed spread and she informed me that she would not give it to me because I was not scheduled for a full service and that I needed to call room service. I've never met such rude, unpleasant staff like the housekeeping staff at this place. On day 4 we over heard one staff yelling from the 4th floor down to another on the ground floor-how unprofessional. By day 4 my husband and I decided to leave a day early. We had enough and wanted to go home. Why stay another night in a dirty, uncomfortable room when we could drive home 9 hours to the comfort of our place? I think all things considered, the hotel should have given me adequate compensation to have my clothing laundered and to cover the cost of our Blue man tickets. Even a fruit basket would have been appreciated as a gesture. Also fyi the main restaurant, Nick's Cafe is horrible. The food is over processed and they can't even make a Cappuccino correctly! We ate there the first night and the lobster bisque tasted worse than something you'd get from a can. I didn't even touch the crab cake because my stomach was shot after the soup. The next day we had breakfast, and even the pancakes were rubbery and more bad cappuccino. Anyhow, the pros of the hotel include the close proximity to International and a washer/dryer in the room (which comes in handy when your room is flooded and you need to rewash all your clothes). If you're considering buying a timeshare at the Grande Viste- beware I can inform you that it would be a bad decision.

There were also many grills that we could use. It is definitely a very family friendly resort. The pool area over by Copa Loca featured a mini splash park of sorts that is great for kids. There are also water cannons and waterfalls cascading into the pool. Also the bar area had a decent selection of food and a great selection of drinks. Then there were several pools over by the main building. A pool designated as a lap pool, a huge family pool that the depth was a constant 3 1/2 feet, a toddler pool with a fountain in the middle and another pool that the depth went to about 5 feet. There were also I think 3 whirlpools surrounding the pools. What was convenient especially our first night was the ability to have room service. After all the travelling we were able to order chicken fingers with french fries, a whole rotisserie chicken, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes with gravy, creamed spinich, an apple juice and a 2 liter of Sierra Mist including delivery and taxes for $35. Hubby of course was excited that the golf course was right there and he received discounts because we were staying on the property. They also have activities!!!! There is something for everyone. They activities just for teens! They have a storytime for toddlers with cookies and milk! They have arts and crafts for the kids. There were a ton of activities. They even had mojito making for the adults. Oh there was also a Caribbean night where we were serenaded by steel drums and there was a polynesian night! Every night the activities desk would leave a message informing you of the activities for the next day. You could also rent movies for about $7.50 for 24 hours. They also had a pretty decent game room with arcade games. There there was the maze. My 4 year old son was absolutely in love with the maze. After an hour he was exhausted however still determined to explore. Also you could rent paddle boats and take them out on the lake. In the lake there were several turtles and really huge fish. We stayed in a two bedroom lock-off which had a screened in porch, LG flat screened tvs in the living room and in each bedroom, 2 person jacuzzi, standing shower and tub. The room was immaculate and smelled of bleach when we arrived. There are so many good things to say about this resort! The grounds were well-maintained. We were convenient to everything.

We recently exchanged our one bedroom for a two bedroom two bath at this resort. We asked another couple to join us (the primary purpose of our trip to Orlando was to hang out at the International Food and Wine Festival at Epcot/visit the other parks at WDW). The unit (villa) was very, very nice. We were placed in Building 86, which is a bit far away from the main action of the resort (pools, restaurants, lobby) BUT it was extremely quiet, which we prefer. We were on the third floor in an end unit and, in general, did not hear much noise from any other guests. The villa was equiped with a more than decent kitchen and a huge (glass) dining room table (I shudder to think about what young children might do to this table, as well as the coffee table, which was also glass!) Glass cleaner was provided! A safe was in the closet of the master bedroom, which was large enough for two laptops and several other items (complimentary in villa wi-fi was very much appreciated). Check in was fast and easy. It was no problem to add our visitors to our reservation so that they could get through the guard gate. We ended up inviting one other person to come stay one night; ditto that process. All cars are required to have a parking pass displayed while parked/when coming into the resort; I was pleased that the parking/passes were free (some resorts charge for parking). The check in staff/guards were nice. We found the house keeping staff to be a bit \"surly\" but we didn't have to interact with them at all (room cleaning was an extra charge; I did think they should have cleaned the room once mid-week, included). What I mean by surly is; they did not hold the elevator for my husband; looking blandly at him as he raced to get to it (he had luggage or else he would have taken the stairs). One other time I saw a maid going into an nearby room, I smiled at her; she just looked away. We ate at one of the small outdoor pool restaurants (Copa Loca) once; service was fine and food was good if a bit expensive ($9 for frozen cocktails, about the same for a sandwich/wrap). The other time we were at this pool (one of four; the closest to our villa), we had hoped to get pool side service but there didn't appear to be anyone. No matter, really; the bar tender was nice. We ate in several nights, utilizing the huge nearby Publix (on Vineland in a shopping center) to obtain provisions. The kitchen was stocked enough such that we had a pot roast, salad, biscuits, and a pie (although I did have to bring my own springform pan!) The grounds of the resort were lovely; we were near a golf tee (not sure which). Sort of park-ish. Since we were at WDW most of the time, we didn't explore as much as we might have. My husband called to get directions to an ABC (liquor) store; they provided them but first tried to direct him to a much more expensive Sony store (don't do that; their prices are a rip off!) We received a daily (recorded) message from \"Staff\" with the next day's weather forecast and activities going on at the resort (again, a lot to do for people that would care to). We did get one call from someone attempting to talk us into a timeshare presentation in turn for $75, but, we're wise to this and just told them \"No thank you\" and never heard anything else. We've found that, if you own or are exchanging, they know that you know what the score is and so give up pretty easily. Each of the bedrooms had its own private balcony; very nice. Word to the wise; NO SMOKING is allowed in the rooms, on the balconies, or in the pool area. I had called to ask where smoking WAS allowed (one of our friends is a smoker); the answer? The parking lot! We did see many people in the parking lot/area smoking. She opted for a small table near the parking lot where a friendly racoon kept her company most evenings. There was a spa on site but we didn't use it. Our bathroom had a HUGE jetted tubs, which we did use a few times. First time in my life that I've been in a jetted tub with the jets underneath me. Sort of an odd experience but it was relaxing. My only complaints are minor; the surly house keeping staff, the additional charge for room cleaning, one screen on one of the windows was not on correctly and the pillows were awful (either too soft or rock hard). All in all, nothing to really complain about but I cite them for others information. We get to Orlando every three or four years; we'd definitely try this resort again.

Speaking of renovation, a lot of buildings are being worked on. You see a lot of construction, but it was not invasive. The room looks like it was really nice when it was first built. However, it is showing its age. The furniture is all study and well built, but stained, scratched, chipped, etc. The kitchen stove and cook-top had about 2 temperatures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on and off. The refrigerator had rust on the door. The list can go on. We had to have maintenance come and fix the garbage disposer, a ceiling fan, and the sink stopper. That plus the multiple housekeeping requests (Garbage bags are rationed like sugar during the war) were all quickly responded to and they have a nice touch of following-up to ensure the item was addressed and if anything else was needed. However, I would just rather have everything be there and to not need to be fixed. We planned to cook a lot in the room and we did, but it was a challenge with the quantity and quality of the cookware. The remote pools did not have any towel service or staff around. This made them quiet, but a little low service. They were really warm though. The main pool was a little too cool even in 95 degree weather. We spent a couple days at the main pool. This had towel service, bars, etc. Very nice area, but it could have used better pool skimming and pool side clean-up (Glasses, etc). There was also a lot of fire ants. You needed to shake out any bag you had on the ground. The poolside frozen drinks are about $9, but are large portions and taste great! The main village area is nice. The convenience store, child play area, pizza hut, etc are all right there and very nice. Some reviews mention a shuttle available to SeaWorld. That was not the case while we were there. The only shuttle was the public bus. We took a pass and drove over. On a side note, the Shamu show continues to be amazing. I do not think you can see that show too many times.

I have to say that while we were there the fire alarm in our building went off in the wee hours of the night due to some maintenance issue. Although rather annoying (and initially scary), I was extremely surprised and impressed by the response from Grande Vista management. The following day we received a apology letter, including a monetary credit for the incident. Kudos to Marriott for still being a class act in a culture of greed. A small and appropriate gesture, but one that will make me choose Marriott for my travel needs.

This was our second trip to the GV and we absolutely loved it. Our travel party consisted of my wife and me, our twin 2 year old boys and grandma and we were very comfortable in a 2 bedroom villa. We originally requested to be close to the Copa Loca pool in a renovated room, but they couldn't accomodate that request (due to a couple of building closures for renovatons). Our building (#94) was a 15 second walk across a parking lot to the main pool area, with a golf course view and just fine for us. There were some large improvement projects underway (painting, etc) but all facilities were open for business. Our 2 year olds loved the very-cool indoor play-yard..suitable for toddlers (especially during the early morning toddler time 8-9 AM). Older kids 4-10 would get more out of the playyard than 2 year olds, but it was still a nice safe, indoor activity. We spent a week there including 3 full days at the resort and hopped back and forth from Copa Local and Main pool, and spent some time on the sandy beach. The only thing that would have improved it, is if they had a shaded area or umbrellas on the beach - from 11 AM until sunset that beach is soaked in the sun, and hot for the toddlers.We got our beach time in before noon and it was fine. We also visited one of the \"satellite\" pools where we found the water to be warmer although there were no bar services...it was a nice place to spend the afternoon. The staff was great, especially the Copa Loca bartender lady. We used Starbucks almost dvery day, and ordered pizza from the Cove. We were also impressed by the reasonable prices of things at the Marketplace...they weren't as cheap as the grocery store but snacks were cheaper there than I expected. We knew we'd be spending a lot of time at the resort because our kids can't go all day everyday to the parks. We spent a few days at Seaworld and AK, and a road trip to Clearwater beach, but really loved the \"downtime\" at the GV. I know there are a lot of other resort options in the International Drive area, some newer than GV, but I am not sure why I'd even try one other than the Grande Vista for our next Orlando vacation.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington Park, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNot what I was expecting, nothing special.\u201d", "Author": "SolidStateS15", "ReviewID": "UR45882935", "Content": "I was here on a business trip with 2 other work colleagues. We booked our stay online and had never seen this place before so we were only going by what we saw on the website. They make it look like an awesome place, but it's really not that special. For the price you pay here I was expecting much more. Who would ever own a timeshare here is beyond me when there are way better places in the area. This is just a regular marriott hotel on a larger scale, meaning speard out over many buildings and large property. The scenery is very nice though, and the on site lake and golf course are nice. There are a few different pools, but they are always packed with kids and families. The on site restaurants are way overpriced for what you get and so not worth it. Being on I-Drive all you have to do it travel a few mi up the road and there is every kind of restaurant you could want. Avoid the on site eateries unless it's an emergency, or otherwise order delivery from a local place in town. The room itself is just average to me, as far as a marroitt goes, or other similar grouped hotel. Personally I would have rather stayed at a Hilton or Hampton Inn even. I don't need all the extras they have here, just a nice room. The room is a good size with plenty of space, but they bed was a cheaper mattress which was too hard and not very comfortable. There were like 8 freaking pillows on the bed which is just overkill when you only need 1 normally, however their feather pillows are not supportive at all. Luckily I found a couple traditional pillows in the closet and I found the best to be a combination to be a feather on the bottom with the regular one on top. There is only a small round table in the room though and it was just big enough for my laptop. I would have rather had a larger table or desk in the room. There was a small kitchenette which was nice because most marriotts anymore you have to specially request a mini-fridge. Already having the micro and fridge was nice. The bathroom was just ok, nothing nice or fancy. I was also disappointed with the small selection of toiletries. Only 3 items were given, 1 shampoo, 1 facial soap bar, and 1 body bar. No lotion, no conditioner, etc. I would have expected a better selection of items. Even the Hampton provides better toiletries. One nice thing though was they included a full spare set of towels, seperate pool towels, extra toilet paper, tissues, paper towels, kitchen supplies inc plates & silverware, and even a sponge & soap for dishes. Of course you wouldn't know unless you look in every drawer and cabinet, but they are there. I didn't have to call room service at all the whole 2 weeks I was there because they had enough on hand. I am not one who uses the maid service every day at a hotel. Usually only once a week or so, just for new towels and other items, but there was enough here to not need service. This place is very family oriented, and has many activities for everyone. There's everything from yoga and fitness classes, to kids crafts and sporting events. There is a new scedule every day with activities. The annoying part about it, is they call you every day to tell you wether you care or not. I have gotten more calls here than anywhere else I've ever stayed, and they were all from the staff!! Plus if you refuse daily cleaning service like I did, they call you again to tell you that you refused service? I think I realized that when I put the sign on the door. I'm fully aware that I won't get any new towels, so I don't feel like I should have to be daily remided over the phone. Their voice mail service is also the most complicated thing I have had to use in a while. I am a very techical oriented guy and am up on all the latest electronics and computer type things, and their system was very confusing even for me. They should have just used the standard voice mail service that the cell phone companies use. Oh yeah and you also have to watch out for all the staff member flying around on their golf carts. They are always zipping all over and don't watch where they are going or pay attention to traffic. They will pull right out in front of you without looking and you have to hit the brakes. There are also speed bumps all around the place which are annoying if you get put in one of the farther buildinds. It will take you 10min just to get back there because there are many stop signs and speed bumps to get though. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, unless you really like golf, and or have small children that need entertaining. I don't see why anyone would be hanging around the hotel all day though and using any of those activities when sea world, disney, and universal are right down the road. You are better off staying in a Disney themed or regular style hotel. Preferably one which includes free Disney bus shuttles. I don't know why the marriott for all the money you pay doesn't have free bus shuttles, when the cheap cockroach inn down the street for $34 a night does have a shuttle!!!

We spent 4 days in the parks. It was a perfect amount of time. My DH played golf on one of the off days and enjoyed the course across from Grande Vista (I believe that's where it was). My daughter had an accident in the bed one night, so early the next morning we requested a total bed linen change on her bed. Got back from the parks later that evening and it still wasn't done. Poor thing was so tired and ready for bed, but we had to wait for them and come change the linens. About 20 minutes later it was done. Staff was friendly upon arrival and we got free t-shirts. We didn't really participate in any of the resort activities, but we've always loved them at other Marriott resorts. At lunch at the poolside restaurant the last day and that was good. Huge sandwiches if I remember correctly. We never took advantage of the bar due to kids needing to get to bed at the end of busy days.

It had a dishwasher, full size refrigerator, oven, microwave and also a washer and dryer! Everything was clean and in place. The bedrooms were nice as well. One room had a king bed and a Jacuzzi tub along with a full size bathroom. The other room had a queen bed with a queen pull out sofa in it and again its own full size bathroom. The adjoining room was the kitchen/ dining room/ living room. The dining room had a full size table and seating for 6. There was also a breakfast bar with swivel chairs. The living room had a pull out sofa and a couple of comfy chairs and of course a flat screen TV. Off to the right of the living room was a screened in porch with a table and chairs. The property was great. For children they have a playroom called the Maze that was fantastic... there is a huge jungle gym like structure for the kids to play in for hours. There was also arts and crafts and different activities offered throughout the day for the children. An example was they had a build a bear workshop and also offered kids cooking lessons! The staff there was super friendly and lots of fun. There were also various pool areas throughout the property. I think there were 4 but we visited only 2. One had a toddler pool, and lap pool along with a huge family pool to hang out in. The other had a really fun \"kid\" type pool with squirting guns etc... and also another family type large pool. Both areas had food available. One was like a bar and grill.. the other had a pizza hut and sandwich shop along with a bar... both fantastic! The ride to Disney from the property is about 15 min and the ride to the airport is about 15 min... It's located right in between and very convenient!!

She checked us in quickly and gave us a quick tour of the huge property through a little map, then sent us on our way to the building we were staying in. Building: We stayed in building 85, Cristobal, in the west village, which consisted of about 5-6 buildings. Our building had a lake view, and it was the next building over from the 2nd largest pool area and a bar called Copa Loca. The building has 6 floors, each with about 7 villas on each, 2 stairs on each side, and an elevator in the middle. Our room was on the 2nd floor, right near the stairs on the right side. We thought we might have trouble with noise, but this was not the case. In fact, the whole stay any time of the day at the resort, it was quiet, with the exception of the pool areas obviously.

There were 2 sinks and a huge whirlpool tub near the bed and further into the bathroom with a door was a toilit and a huge shower. The 2nd bedroom was on the other side with 2 queen sized beds, a flatscreen tv, and a balcony off of it. It also had a bathroom which not only connected to that bedroom, but it connected to the kitchen and living area, therefore 2 doors in this bathroom. The bathroom was the usual,but it was a nice size. The kitchen, dining area, and living area seperated the two bedrooms. The area was a nice size also. The kitchen had everything you need for a weeks stay and more. Nice fridge, microwave, toaster, coffeepot, sink, dishwasher, dishes and silverware and much more. It was decent sized for a kitchen on vacation. It also had 3 barstools and a counter to eat a quick snack. The dining area had a huge table with 6 chairs.

The villa also had a washer/dryer combo next do the double door bathroom and a closet right across from it. All in all, this was one of the nicest rooms we have stayed in.

The property has a huge lake with a bridge that connects the west village with the main side. You could rent paddle boats for the lake also, and fishing poles. The property had basketball and tennis courts, a restaurant near the golf course called nicks grill, a bar in a pool area called Copa Loca, and it had a market place in the main building with pizza hut pizza and other items. There was also a store in the main building with starbucks coffee, donuts, and food items like a tiny grocery store. There was a small bar in the main pool area and finally a lighthouse that has an ice cream parlor at the bottom. The property also has a fitness area, and full spa with tons of spa services. 4 pool areas are in the resort, including 2 large sized areas and 2 smaller areas.

I traveled with my sister a couple of our friends. I have stayed at other Marriott properties in Florida and this one was similar to the others. We are timeshare owners and traded to get MGV. We called 10 days in advance to request a specific unit in Building 78 in the West Village and upon check-in our request was honored. We actually had an early flight and although check-in is not until 4 pm, by 1 pm our room was ready! Check in and out- no problems very smooth Customer Service- great! Front Desk called to make sure all was well and that we were well taken care of. Rooms- smaller than other 2bdrm 2 bath units at other Marriotts but comfortable. Clean, well appointed, and 2 balconies which was very nice! Housekeeping- my only problem with the resort. Although they were friendly- they never came to give us fresh towels during the week. Since its timeshare and not a hotel- I am used to getting fresh towels just one time for the week but that never happened. We called housekeeping and within 30 mins we had fresh towels! Staff- Everyone was VERY friendly and helpful! Amenities- the resort is HUGE! 4 different villages- each village has 6 buildings, each building is 6 stories high. 6 pools, more than 4 hot tubs, a sauna, nice gym/workout center, rock wall, tennis, basketball, volleyball on small sand beach, large lake with paddle boats, etc. There seemed to be a lot for young children to do. Overall- nice resort for vacationing families, close to all parks and shops and restaurants. If you want peace and quiet at this resort request to stay in the west village (which is located across the lake from the main village and all the ammenities) as this affords a more quiet atmosphere (away from young children-especially at night) but is just a short walk across the gorgous bridge to the stores, activities, and restaurants.

We're owners at another location and traded into Grande Vista. Evidently there are different codes for 2 bdrm villas versus lock-off units. We wanted a 2 bdrm but got a lock-off. Wasn't really a problem, just had to prop the lock-off door open during the day. Location Great location. 10 minutes to Disney, just up the street to Sea World. Tons of other timeshare/condo resorts around the area. A Wal-Greens and Publix are just down the street along with a McDonald's. Wal-Mart isn't too far...although we went on Saturday night to get groceries and Wal-Mart was a madhouse. Could barely walk for all of the people. It was worse than shopping at Christmas. Most must have been new arrivals in town doing the same thing we were. I'm sure Friday and Saturday are big check-in days. Upscale outlet mall is just down the street on Vineland. Very close to lots of restaurants on both sides of I-4. The resort sits back off of International Drive, you can't see it from the road. That makes it very quiet from a traffic and business standpoint. It's not in the congested part of International Drive either, so we never had a problem getting out of the resort. The trolley does go by if you want to take it up and down that main stretch. Size This is a huge resort. We've been to several other Marriotts, but this was the biggest. May be at least 10-15 buildings, 4 pools. We were in building 84 next to the Copa Loca pool, which is the kids' pool. It was pretty crowded even in the morning at the pool. At night I guess teenagers and others come out because we could hear noise and talking from the pool in our villa. But Marriott was good about closing the pool and all of the noise stopped right at 11pm every night. We never made it across the large lake to visit the other side of the resort since it is so large, and we were so busy going to the parks. Villa Our villa was on the first floor of Bldg 84. The bldgs around the kids' pool have been remodeled somewhat, but not completely overhauled like some of the other bldgs. Staff said since those bldgs are so popular they can't shut them down to do the work. So you could see the age on the villa but it also had some nice upgrades too with granite counters, down bedding, etc. Floor tile is older, shower and jacuzzi tub are older, some of the light fixtures had loose parts, dining room chairs showed wear on the wooden part, etc. But everything worked and what didn't work was fixed within 24 hours. The villa didn't have all of the kitchen utensils and pans that the other Marriotts have had, but we had enough for what we needed. You can always call and request something that's missing. Guests This resort had a broad range of guests staying there. Many were foreign tourists. I'm sure it's because of the theme parks that you have such a variety of demographics. Many more teenagers than we've seen at other resorts and some of the guests were a little rougher than what we've seen at Marriott's beach resorts. But no one caused a problem. The crowding at the pool was the least favorite part. By 10am, there were already several families there. The teenagers came out closer to noon. One afternoon some guys were floating in tubes in the pool drinking beers. Would have preferred that they keep the drinks out of the pool. Again, we were only at the pool a couple of days since we spent most time at the parks. We did notice that the resort did not require anyone to have on a wristband noting that they were a guest like we've had to do at other Marriott beach resorts. Amenities Nice golf course surrounds the resort, beautiful lake sits in the middle with paddle boats you can take out on the lake (it was too hot for us to do it). Cute lighthouse with a dessert/sweet shop under it. Nice workout room. Good kids' program with lots of activities (as if you needed more being in Orlando). Small beach by the lake with a volleyball net and a rock climbing wall. Nice store/small restaurant with Starbucks by the registration building. Bar/grill next to the kids' pool called Copa Loca. Four pools. The kids' pool has four fort/tower type structures that have water cannons the kids can spray into the pool. You never know when you're going to get hit with water, but my 6 year old son loved it. They didn't work all of the time, but we did see Marriott staff coming out to try and fix them so they were all working as much as possible. There's a sidewalk around the lake and the map shows the distance and paths you can walk if you're wanting some outdoor exercise. They also have nice sets of swings overlooking the lake. The grounds are secured so everyone has to pass through the guard before entering the property or have a room key to access the gates. It's not a brand new resort like Marriott's place in Myrtle Beach, but it's still a nice place that we enjoyed. It worked great for us. We could easily go to the Disney parks in the day and quickly come back for a few hours in the afternoon to swim or eat before going back again at night. Disney makes parking as easy as possible, and you only have to pay for parking once each day so you can go and come as you please.

Got it. Requested to be at main pool - did not get. But, we were at what they called the \"kid's pool\". Another WOW. Not your ordinary kid's pool. There were 2 jacuzzi's - One was quite hot, the other was toned down a notch. Two swimming pools, one with 4 little water falls. Both went up to 4ft 9 in. Plenty of lounge chairs. The Copa Loca bar and grill was mmmmm. The wait staff were right on top of things. Drinks were a little pricey (Mixed were $8.00, but hey, we were in Orlando. Gotta expect it. My room keys were constantly disabled, possiblilty that they kept coming in contact with my cell - hmm not sure. Anyway, each time I called to replace or if we had a problem maintenance or housekeeping wise, they were there within 3 to 4 minutes. FANTASTIC! When you have kids and are on vacation, the less stress the better and Marriott Grande Vista in Orlando really performed and met all expectations. The beds were so wonderful. Due to my size, I have a hard time sleeping in most beds. True to Marriott's standards, they produce the best beds. The in room jacuzzi tub is big enough for 2 people and the jets work like fire. The kitchen had all the emenities of home. If you run out of ice, no going to the store, just go up to the 2nd floor and get free ice. Can't get that anywhere else. Flat panel tvs that kept the kids entertained. Another one of those thank goodness moments. The only 2 drawback that I actually have were the pull out couch. You could tell someone had sat on it for awhile and all the pillows kept sinking down, Not a comfortable couch but hey, they more than exceeded my expectations on eveything else and the rooms were lockouts. We were in Bldg. 84 overlooking the pool. Rooms 4109, 4110, 4111 & 4112. Stepped outside our door and we were overlooking the lake.

I was wrong, the unit room 4403 (building 84) was brand new (flat screen tv, king size bed, queen pull out sofa, granit countertops) with a patio overlooking the lake.

When I called the Marriot to confirm our reservations, I asked if it was possible to be placed close the kiddie pool and our request was granted. Yes, it is true that they don't provide daily housekeeping services like at other Marriot timeshares, but it was so easy to get fresh towels everyday and all the extras you need. There was a housekeeping room on our floor and all you had to do is go and drop off your used towels and pick up new ones. They always asked if I need anything else, like soap, coffee ....... There was also a trash room on the floor to dispose of our daily garbage. For the kids the pool (not the main pool, we played at the other pool across the bridgel) was clean and fun (you can get clean pool towels by the bathroom, they keep a ton of them there), if you didn't want to go to the pool they had a hugh indoor jungle gym for them to play in, my kids totally loved the jungel gym!! Plus a game room and outdoor rock climbing, ping pong and whole bunch of other stuff. If you have teenagers, it is also a good pick, but you might need a bigger unit. I felt it was in a great location to all the theme parks (down the block from sea world, 7 miles from disney and 7 miles from Univerasal Studios) but the next time we visit we will be only visiting one theme park, it is really too much to do all of them in one trip.

The resort store, dining establishment, service staff, and concierge desk, and peacefulness of the resort more than made up for the condescending front desk staff, ensuring all questions, inquiries, and requests were fulfilled promptly, in a friendly and courteous manner.

We vacationed there with his brother and wife in a two bedroom, lock-off king bed suite in Bldg 93 on the 5th floor facing the golf course. We are owners at Horizons, Orlando (currently renamed Harbour Pt), but traded in to stay at the Grande Vista this year. Horizons is really best for families with children. We have previously stayed at Marriott Cypress Harbour, but could not get in this year. I thought that I would be disappointed with the Grand Vista since it is a much larger resort and didn't seem to have the homey atmosphere and lake views of the former. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised and enjoyed my stay at the Grande Vista even more than at Cypress. We requested and received a renovated room and it was just beautiful, quiet, comfortable, with a beautiful view of the golf course and a water view as well! There is granite everywhere in the kitchen and baths and of course the whirlpool tub in the master was great. There are three flat screen TVs in the unit. One in each bedroom and a 40 ft screen in the living room. There is a large screen-in dining area off of the master bedroom and living room areas and a private porch also off of the second bedroom. The second bedroom had it's own sitting area, dining table, bath and bar/fridge area and could be locked off from the main dining area for more privacy. I would recommend this arrangement for couples. As always, all of the cooking utensils, plenty of bath and pool towels, as well as an in-suite stacked washer and dryer are provided. The free in-room WIFI worked well for my purposes. We usually just vacation for relaxation and quality time together and don't visit the parks. We do always go to Olde Towne in Kissammee (about a 15 minute drive with traffic), which I do recommend for either couples or families with children. I believe that it only opens on weekends. There are lots of shops, rides, games, live music, an astounding bungee-jumping ride thats even fun to watch. They also feature a huge antique car show, as well. It's a cross between a carnival and a state fair and there is no charge for admission or parking. We also drove to Tampa to visit family and they also have a fairly large casino, The Hard Rock Cafe Casino, there as well. Otherwise, we just shop, eat-out at the area restaurants, play golf (at the Resort) or miniature golf in the area, or just cook in our rooms and view Netflix DVD's, which we bring along. Also, the Grande Vista has recently opened a spa on site. I highly recommend the Grand Vista Spa Pedicure, the best that I've ever had (I typically get mine done in Richmond every one-two months). I believe that my therapist's name was Bernadette, with whom I also received a very gentle and relaxing waxing service. The resort also has a nicely appointed fitness area with the typical cardiovascular machinge (elliptical, treadmill, bikes...all with flat screen TV's), weight machines and free barbell weights. They also have an aerobic exercise room, a child play and child care area, all sorts of games (ping pong, billiards, tennis, boating, fishing), three separate pool areas throughout the resort with spas, gas and charcoal grills spread throughout, beautifally landscaped and perfect for walks. The facility has a 24-jpir manned security gate into the living area, a nice formal restaurant on site, and other smaller eating areas, including a free cotton candy station, and a candy shop. The Market Place is expensive. We recommend that you either go to the Publix grocery store which is a couple of miles away or the Wal-Mart which is probably about 5 miles away. We always bring a car and recommend one since there is so much to do in the area. We also recommend the Bonefish restaurant for fresh reasonably priced seafood- the coconut shrimp were superb! We found everthing at the resort to be clean and in excellent repair and the services from check-in to check-out were great. Although we are Marriot owners, we also do the timeshare presentation. They are opening a new facility that now offers waterfront townhomes over by the Ritz-Carlton (which is also owned by Marriott). Owners there also get to use some of the Ritz facilities. We find their timeshare presentations to be very low-key and informative compared to others. They pick you up from the door of yourvilla and return you there and were very good about keeping to the 90 minute presentation, unless you wanted to see more. We opted not to and took the $75 Marriott card (per couple) good at any Marriott facility. We used it to pay towardsr our overnight stay at the Marriott Courtyard in Florence, SC on our way back to Richmond. Negatives? Our flatscreen blinked out during about day 5. However, they sent up a repairman within about 30 minutes to troubleshoot and ended up bringing in another new TV. However, I really couldn't really register this as a complaint, since one never knows when the flatscreens will die. I had a similar problem with my own one at home after two years....and the important thing is that the Grande Vista staff addressed the issue quickly and with many apologies....so I couldn't complain.

I love the Cypress Harbour as well but nothing compares to the Grande Vista. The grounds are beautiful. The entrance into the resort is GRANDE. Before arriving to this resort, I called the front desk a week before to request a certain building(s). I asked for building 77 or 78 because when we stayed here back in 2006, I remember they were just building those two buildings and they were located in a perfect spot for me. And of course they were \"newer\". I am not a Marriott owner (at least not yet), so my request wasn't guaranteed. But of course, we received just what I asked for, which was either of those buildings in a corner unit on an \"upper\" level (nothing under 2). The view was beautiful. We arrived just when the weather was getting almost perfect again, between the dates of 05-29 thru 06-05. The first four days we had NO RAIN at all. Sunshine, warm and breezy!!! The last few days there was a bit of rain in the afternood for no more than an hour at most, then it went right back to being beautiful out again. The service was great. We stayed in a 3bedroom villa and whenever I enter for the first time, I have to do \"my inspection\". The only problems we had was in the second bedroom the cable wasn't working and the lightbulb on one of the lamps in the master bedroom was out. I called the front desk and within 10 minutes a maintenance man had the problems fixed. This man was so friendly. He gave us tips on where \"the best\" of everything was located. About an hour or so later, the front desk called to make sure our problems had been fixed. Great service. The only complaint that we had was on the last evening there, our neighbors just above us were really having a good time at around 1-2 a.m. in the morning. How annoying when you have to catch a 9am flight. We tried very hard to let it go, but after it seemed it was getting louder, I called the front desk and I guess it was taken care of, because the next thing I remember was the alarm clock going off. I immediately went into a major depression because I DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE!!! I have read several negative reviews about this resort, but I do believe that where your villa is located and the newness or at least it being recently upgraded is a major key in having a better stay. From what I understand, all of the villas are undergoing upgrades and renovations, so I think this resort is only getting better. Keep in mind, this is a HUGE resort with a whole lot of buildings, so do your research before coming and ask for a recently renovated building. They have the flat screens and other little bells and whistles some of the olders ones don't just yet.

We exchanged our timeshare through Interval World for a stay at this resort in a three bedroom. We had three families consisting of 9 people, so each family had their own bedroom. The 3 bedroom was HUGE!! We had plenty of room, and the place was clean and had all the regular items found in a timeshare. The master bedroom consisted of a king bed, two sinks, whirlpool tub, seperate shower, big screen TV, DVD, and a chaise lounge. Very large room and bathroom. An adult and a small child shared this room. The second bedroom consisted of two queen beds, big screen TV, DVD, one sink and tub/shower combo. This room was a little small for four folks, but bigger than your average hotel room. The kitchen and living area consisted of a table for six, large couch, and two chairs. It had a big screen TV with DVD also. The kitchen had a full size refrigerator and dishwasher, and had dishes/glasses for eight. We were supplied tissue paper, paper towels, dish liquid, dishwashing powder, and trash bags. It also had a coffee pot and toaster. Plenty of cabinet space for your groceries. We just had to move a few dishes around. There were also wine glasses, but no cork screw. The washer/dryer was the stackable kind, so very small loads only!! We kept it going the entire time!! This area also had a very nice screened porch with a table and chairs. The third bedroom was a studio unit with a separate entrance door, but was attached to the second bedroom by a set of connecting doors and a foyer area. This bedroom had a king bed, sofa sleeper and a table and chairs for two, two ottomans, and a balcony with table and chairs. It also had a small refrigerator about half the size of a regular sized one. It was not your typical mini- frig, it was larger than that. It had a coffee pot and toaster. The bathroom was one sink and a tub/shower combo. The bedrooms had plenty of drawer space for clothes and closet space was good too! The closets did not have many hangers.Each closet had a small safe for your valuables. You are provided towels, but they only change them out once during the week, so we had to wash them to have enough for a week. Building: Our unit was located on the third floor of building #80, the Main Building where you check-in. It was a great location. There was a huge pool area, kiddie pool and splash area, plenty of lounges and umbrellas. This area also had a Market Place to get a few groceries, wine, beer, souvenirs and snacks. They also had Krispie Creme donuts and Starbucks coffee. There is also a Pizza Hut and a small Deli type eatery in the buliding and a full service bar. The fitness center, playground and boat rentals were also in the building. Location: It took us about 20 minutes to get to Disney and about 5 minutes to get to SeaWorld. Outstanding location!!! Negatives: Pizza Hut Delivery was terrible! We finally had to go down and get it and they didn't have it ready! We got FREE Pizza for that one! Hot Water: At night, we rarely had much hot water, it was only lukewarm.

Both the husband and wife team sing. Lots of interactivity with the singers. They played the funniest birthday song I have ever heard for one of the guests. The karaoke monitor was cool, it had videos playing in the background behind the lyrics. While we were there, we met a Canadian couple that has stayed at the Grande Vista for 8 weeks and they said they have gone to the karaoke show every week that they were there. The dj even gave out raffle prizes to the singers. The dj said that the pictures that the wife takes, sometimes end up on their website. I checked it out, but I didn't find mine.

Got to the property four hours early and was allowed to check in far earlier than the 4pm advertised time, which was fantastic as I'm with 11 month old twins. I asked for a renovated room (2 BR - with lockoff) and was sent to Building 96. Not sure I got a renovated room, as the bathroom looked somewhat dated and different from some of the pics I saw here, but since I got in 4 hours early I wasn't going to raise the issue. Service at the front desk was excellent and the 2 pack-n-plays and 2 high chairs I requested were provided at once and free of charge - very nice and kudos to the staff for being prompt. Room is fine (I'm writing this on \"rest\" day while here), though the kitchen appliances are old and worn (microwave dated 1998). Seems a bit out of place since the living room area is obviously re-done. But the appliances are functional so not a big deal. As I said earlier, both bathrooms are in need of some updating. Plumbing a bit iffy, hot water was on demand - no waiting. Hot tub works great. Can't hear a sound in our \"main\" bedroom, though foot traffic in the corridor is heard pretty easily in the lock-off room. Doesn't wake up the twins, though. Patio is screened and we have had breakfast out on it every morning, which again is nice. Wireless internet free but very spotty. I have to check in to work every day, unfortunately, and the internet is hit or miss at best. If you need reliable access, forget about it. I had issues for one whole day and the staff basically blew me off - Wayport fixed the issue by calling the desk on my behalf. But it is free, so - again - not that big a deal. Wished the service in regard to the net was better (from the staff). Grounds very nice. I like how the property is about a mile off I-Drive via a nicely landscaped road, which makes it seem more secluded. Have a pool next to our building (the clerk called it the \"country\" since not many people are there - and he was right) and we have visited the other main pools. The main pool near reception was great for young kids - the \"outer\" main pool with the water cannons was better for older kids. Haven't had to fight for a pool chair which was better than I expected. Pool had a bar area which was a bit overpriced, but good. Food at the fast food place (clerk compared it to Boston Market - I guess I can see it) was fine if you want something quick and aren't concerned about price. The location can't be beat, really. Only minutes to Disney and Sea World. Haven't made it to Universal. But great proximity to lots of things to do and have had no problems getting around. Publix for groceries and the Premium Outlet Mall is about 5 minutes away at most. You won't have to travel far to do things or get something to eat at a nice place. The thing with the Grande Vista is this - if you plan on staying at the resort with your family and having lots of stuff to do here and rarely leave the site - look elsewhere. Sure, the pools are nice but they aren't big at all, and that's really about it. There is a wall climbing thing, paddle boats, a golf course, and some grills - but there aren't any other activities. All this is perfectly fine with me, though. To compare - I have traveled with a family member to Orange Lake (apparently called Holiday Inn Orange Lake Resort now) and that place has a ton of pools, a tubing river, mini golf, several restaurants, arcade, and more. They never leave the property. However, that place is wall-to-wall people, which makes the Grande Vista nice - it hasn't seemed overcrowded. As we like to get around and see things and enjoy the resort, but not live at it, the Grande Vista made a nice destination. Can't give the place 5 stars since they are some nagging issues, as outlined above (and the tiled kitchen floor was terribly dirty - no excuse for that, really). To compare, the Marriott Surf Watch in Hilton Head blows the place away in terms of room quality - if that's your thing. However, if you like a nice place to stay and will get around, has some nice amenities on site, a great location and service, and can tolerate some minor issues (what place is perfect, anyway?) then the Grande Vista is worthwhile.

We had waited months and months to enjoy our time in Orlando. We were there celebrating our daughter's 4th birthday which turned into a nightmare. Here is what happened from start to finish: I received a call from Marriott to take a 5 day 4 night promo visit at a low rate. When they first called, they only offered west coast stays, so I declined because it would not be possible for us to easily get there. After a few MONTHS of calls from them, they finally told us that we could stay in Orlando for the rate of around $200 for the entire time (not bad I thought) as long as we attended the sales presentation. I agreed and bought the time. When I eventually went to reserve the room at MGV, they told me that I purchased time in Hawaii and could not stay in Orlando (I NEVER AGREED TO THIS), so the sales thief must have gotten some commission on booking us in Hawaii. Nonetheless, I argued it and after spending over an HOUR on the phone, being transferred many times, I finally got them to agree to 'letting' us stay in Orlando. I should have known we were being scammed at this point, but silly me..... When I booked the room, they told me that I could no longer get the studio (THAT was what I agreed to when I bought - again.... lied to), and that I had to pay MORE for the 1 bedroom. So far, really not a good experience. We stupidly agreed because we figured we could save the difference in money by having the kitchen and cooking food there rather than eating out. I called ahead to request no down in the room because of severe allergies (both my husband and I can't breathe with down bedding) and also requested to stay closer to the central pool area since we were so far away the last time we were there and our little one has a tough time walking that far. We were told no problem on both, but when we arrived, we not only had down in the room (and were not offered any alternates), but also were in the SAME building that was so far away as the last time we stayed. We were told it was because it was a refurbished/updated room with the latest amenities and that it was in tip top shape. If you call missing dinnerware, a broken garbage disposal, huge holes in the screens, hornet nests, non-working lights, missing towels, and ant infestation refurbished/updated, then I guess that was what we got. We spent hours waiting for maintenance to come and fix all of the issues. Unreal. Come to find out, the sales person at the presentation told us that refurbished rooms have plasma tv's and ARE in tip top shape. She also told us that Marriott sometimes tells guests that the rooms are updated to make them feel more excited about their stay... NOT impressed. Did I mention that the concierge was VERY RUDE? That was the least of our problems. So, are you ready for the icing on the cake? We left for the Magic Kingdom at 10 am on 4/23. Before we left, my husband put his Dolce and Gabbana eyeglasses into his Ray Ban sunglasses case, which he then set in the drawer under his shorts in the nightstand next to the bed. He wore his prescription Ray Ban sunglasses to the park that day because he didn't want to risk losing his eyeglasses. I don't drive, and we drove all the way from New York to Florida for this trip (HE did the driving, bless his heart). We returned from celebrating our daughter's 4th birthday at the Magic Kingdom at about 11 at night, put our sleeping birthday girl to bed, and my husband went to put his sunglasses away and put his eyeglasses on. GONE! The housekeeper who came in to 'clean' our room took them. I am certain of it. They didn't clean, they barely made the bed and didn't replace towels, but they ruffled through our property and STOLE FROM US. I saw him put them in the drawer that morning, we discussed whether or not to bring them, and made the choice to leave them tucked away! UGH! Nonetheless, we literally turned the room upside down as well as our car to look for them. NOTHING. We called Loss Prevention and were dealing with them until 2:30 am. We were told someone would contact us - lie - we had to call and call and call. Of course, we were supposed to check out that next day and were hanging in limbo because we were told to wait for a call (which never came). I could go into further detail about what happened next, and what is STILL happening, but why bother. You get the point. They have been terribly rude to us, never even offered an apology, AND have told us that they refuse to submit the claim to their insurance! We even have family that owns with Marriott, and told them that - they could care less. They RUINED our first vacation ever. Is THIS what VACATION is like? If so, I don't want to vacation! I can certainly tell you that I will NEVER stay with Marriott again. By the way, did you know that they have some kind of agreement where they can't accuse their housekeepers of theft, even though they know that it happens every day? BEWARE! By the way, upon returning home, we also realized that we are missing other small items that would typically go unnoticed.

My family and I have stayed at 4 of the MVC properties in Florida. This was our second trip to Grande Vista. The Pluses Very clean and kid friendly. The Pools were very nice, and there always seemed to be plenty of chairs. Pond was GREAT for fishing and Tennis Courts were clay. The room had granite counter tops, and you can request the second bedroom to have 2 queen size beds. Pools were always busy. I got the sense that Grande Vista was the destination for people rather than the theme parks. But maybe that was just the economy. The negatives. Nothing major. Make sure you request a building close to one of the two pools. There were units that are at least a 10-15 minute walk from the pools. For how many units they have, they really need to put in a third major pool area. Maid service is 'lite' at best. Beds get made, and dishes washed, and thats it. They didn't even replace towels every day, and I didn't see them carrying vaccums. The advertise basketball and rock climbing. The rock climbing wall was open for 1 hour the entire week we were there. There is a half court basketball, but it's way off by itself. Lots of kids wanting to play. Seems like a pretty cheap addition would be duplicating the two full sport courts they have at Cypress Harbour. Compare between Cypress Harbour and Grande Vista Grande Vista rooms are nicer, but quite a bit smaller. The queen size beds in second bedroom is big advantage for Grande Vista. Overall I'd prefer the Grande Vista rooms. Pools- While both are nice, my kids greatly prefer Cypress Harbour. They seemed larger and better layed out. Grounds- Cypress Harbour hands down. They have the sportscourts, more spacious pools, minigolf, and overall just seemed nicer. You can't go wrong with either, but my kids really liked Cypress better Both are nice properties, and much less hectic than staying at Disney.

The restaurants, ice cream shoppe, and small market made it almost not necessary to have to eat or shop off site. But there was a grocery store and many restaurants nearby if you did venture out. We went grocery shopping at the beginning of our stay for breakfast items, since we ate at the parks most days, but if you did plan to make a large meal, there was more than enough pots, pans, etc. to get it done. Plus a fullsized coffee maker, toaster, etc. Location was perfect and easy to find. Almost adjacent to the entrance to Sea World and Aquatica. Disney World was a little further, about 15 minutes.

Great views from our room.

This is a timeshare resort with condos. We normally stay at Disney Vacation Club but we ran out of DVC points and 2 we wanted to see what else Orlando had to offer and by staying onsite at Disney we don't venture offsite often. Also, coming from California we stayed our 1st night at All Star: Movies because our flight did not arrive until 11 pm. Spent the morning exploring All Stars: Movies which my kids loved. Great place for kids. Then, we drove over to Marriott Grande Vista around 1 pm to check-in. To our surprise our room was ready. That was AWESOME but we realized afterwards that resort is HUGE. We were assigned unit 6625 in building 86 overlooking the golf course. We got a 2 bedroom non-lock off unit so, the guest bedroom had 2 queens in it. The unit was very spacious. It came with tons of dining seating. The kitchen even had a walk-in pantry. This one of the largest Marriott units we have ever stayed in. I loved the space. Everything was clean. There was internet available. The washer and dryer combo was VERY small. It took me 2 loads to do one days worth of clothes. We used the washer/dryer alot as it was colder than we expected and we didn't have enough warm clothes. The hair dryer in the master bedroom did not work. Actually, the entire outlet did not work. There was no screened in porch on the guest bedroom side. Awesome unit! Activities onsite included several pools. We had to walk to our pool but not too far. There had these little pedal boats in shapes of ducks, swans, dragons, etc that you could rent. It was like $10/2 seater per half hour or $15/4 seater per half hour. They had a rock climbing wall that was free. It was not up a couple of days because of wind. There was also other boating things you could rent. They had a motorized mini-jet things you could rent. Looked like a lot of fun. There was a sand volleyball area. There were several pools. The main check-in area had the Marketplace & the Maze and the gym. The Maze was closed for remodeling. I saw one bar area restaurant. I believe there were more but the place is so huge I think, I needed to drive to it. They had a BBQs onsite but they were charcoal only. I never saw anyone ever using them. Personally, I would not buy charcoal while on vacation. I think, gas would be better. The Marketplace was HUGE and had a huge assortment of stuff that you could easily skip the grocery store but the prices are high. Our trip consisted mainly of visiting Disney parks, Space Kennedy Center & a gulf side beach. We did not make it to the beach as the weather wasn't the best so, for our next trip we will. We did not like our location from the front gate. You had a maze of parking lots to drive through. We even took the short cut and it still was annoying. The location is great for Seaworld and Discovery Cove. As for Magic Kingdom the location wasn't the best but any offsite location would not be. To get to MK you had to drive about 20 minutes, then, pay for parking, then, you drove into your parking spot, Then, you waited for the tram to take you to the transportation center. Once there you either took the ferry or monorail to the gate entrance. This whole process could take you anywhere for 60 minutes to 90 minutes to do. We liked staying onsite at Disney as the buses take you right to the gate. We also liked that if staying onsite you can split up as a group. I needed to do some Christmas shopping but that was impossible to do with the kids around. I had no way of requesting packages to be sent back to my room nor could I go ahead and go back to the room to hide the packages. I didn't realize how much that would bother me. We really didn't eat in the area. I found the area had a lot of chain restaurants that we have at home. So, we really didn't want to do that. We ate mostly at Disney. I wish I had made reservations at some of the fancier restuarants in the Orlando area. I don't think, I researched this enough but our main goal was Walt Disney World so, it didn't really make sense to leave the parks to eat. I'd say this a great location for visiting Orlando but probably not if your focus is DisneyWorld. This would be a great area for toddlers, teenagers, adults only. It was very quiet. We never heard our neighbors nor did we see them. It had more of condo feel than a resort feel.

I was told my room would be ready at the check in time - when I arrived to my room - housekeeping was still in the room cleaning the oven. She stressed that a housekeeper had cleaned the room earlier in the day but that she did not clean the oven well enough and left the room dirty - so she was cleaning after the original housekeeper. She then told me that I could come back in a hour and she could finish cleaning or she suggested we call the front desk. I called the front desk to complain and they were rather oblivious about the situation (this was at 630pm at night) and after a long day I was furious that the front desk was not more helpful. In the meantime, the housekeeper disappeared - never to be seen again. I called the front desk again and they said, they would get on it ASAP. The 2nd day, I went to front desk to remind them about my oven needing to be cleaned (it was filthy) - they said they would personally go to the room after a housekeeper went there to make sure it was up to \"Marriott Standards\". However, when I got back to the room that night, the oven was not touched. It was ridiculous. My other complaint is that the whirlpool tub in the room did not work really well - after several calls to the front desk, they sent a maintenance person who got it working but several minutes after he left, it stopped working again. A minor beware- there are ants in the room. I found a whole bunch of them by the balcony area before we left and did not realize they were there. The grounds are beautifully maintained. The main pool area is stunning as is the lake and other pools. Construction shut down a lot of the amenity areas but those were not missed. Oh yea, one more complaint: Every morning between 6am and 10am (automated calls came in from Marriott Vacation Club about going on a tour. Im not talking one call, im talking several calls all morning long and to top it off, all day long with additional calls from the MAZE about their activities for the day. It got very irritating.

Other interaction with the front desk staff was met with the type of response that led me to believe I was bothering them. This is something I am unaccustomed to at a Marriott property. The hotel itself is motel style and has larger than average rooms meant for extended stays. It is averagely appointed but probably not as much as a Courtyard, which I think are better than this. It is probably more on the lines of a Fairfield Inn. The amenities are difficult to use unless you are driving back and forth to the front area. This property is spread out and large.

Myself my wife my 3 year old, my mother and my mother-in-law stayed in a 2 bedroom villa, with a standard room attached. Plenty of room and great amenities. The place was clean and well maintained and staff were freindly and helpful. It is big and I did have to request something close to a pool. Stayed in building 100 on the third floor and had a pool right accross the parking lot although we mostly walked to the main pool ( about a 3-4 min walk). It's much larger with a kids pool and gets sun all day long. Our units overlooked the golf coarse which was nice in the morning to sit out and eat breakfast on the balcony overlooking the coarse. I'd recommend something on a lower floor because of the stairs, although each building has an elevator, but if your room is at one end it makes for a bit of walking. Rooms are super quite, did not hear a noise the entire week we were there. Got a deal on line so price was good, but there are other places all around there with similar villas that are a lot cheaper than the regular advertised prices of the Grande Vista. Shop around, but if you can get a good rate here it's a great place to stay. I read some reviews on here that were not so good, but I wouldn't pay too much attention to them. The place is clean and well maintained and currently being renovated. The only real downside I agree with is the place is very large and spread out and if your too far from one of the main pools, (there are 2 accross the lake from each other attached by the bridge you see in the pictures ) that would be inconvient. Didn't do the timeshare sales seminar because i\"ve been on them before and it doesn't seem like that great a deal to me. I stayed at the place for a week for about $1500 for a 2 bedroom villa, and a standard room. I could do that for the next 15 years and still not have recovered the cost of the timeshare, not including the yearly \"maintence\" fee. Publix is right down the street on the corner of Vineland and International Drive South, which is great and Sea World is a 3 minute drive down the street.

Our hotel block was not near the main pool but right next to one of the smaller pools which didn't bother us at all, but what we couldn't understand was the fact that in being July and being very hot, the poolside bar was not open which meant a bit of a trek to the hotel shop to buy something cool to drink and some food. There was a drinks machine by the pool but unless you had the correct money it was rather pointless. Also the toilets by the pool weren't cleaned regularly enough.

On the whole there was nothing that would stop us staying there again For one of the best value for money all-you-can-eat buffet restaurants, you can't beat Sweet Tomatoes. 4 of us ate for \u00c2\u00a324.00. Their range of food was phenomenal - salads, pizzas, jacket potatoes, soups, pastas, many choices for desserts and their chocolate brownies were to die for!!!!! Breakfast buffet to fill you up before the parks - Ponderosa. \u00c2\u00a33.00 each all-you-can-eat. Some reports havent been very good about this place but we didn't have any problems - no its not 5 star but it's clean, friendly and fills up teenagers with hollow legs for a few hours!!!! Other fab places we ate were Magiannos, Outback Steakhouse, Bahama Breeze and Cafe Tu Tu Tango. Those were our favourites but there are many others to try but hope this gives someone a few ideas. As for the weather - we had a few days out of 14 with afternoon thunderstorms but that's normal according to everyone. It was certainly nothing to worry about.

However, the property is 11 years old and shows much wear and tear in the rooms. Cleanliness and maintenance were the main issues from my experience. Some of the rooms have been 'renovated' with the Marriott bedding package, nice art work, granite countertops etc. But what is the point of these renovations if the rooms have bug problems, musty/mold problems, and cleaniness issues? In our first room (1 bedroom unit), my husband was bitten by a nasty bug with scorpian like pinchers while sleeping in the sofa bed (which by the way was the most uncomfortable sofa bed he every slept in). My daughter was right next to him when it happened and she was very upset trying to sleep at night for the rest of the vacation. Someone from Marriott declared the bug harmless but said they would fumugate the room. We said do what you need to do, but we are getting out of there. We had to push a little bit but finally obtained another unit (2 bedroom unit). This unit was suppose to be in one of their newest buildings but it was extremely moldy, especially the master bedroom. We have mold allergies and were not feeling so great after the 2 days we spent there. We were too exhausted from our park days to contemplate requesting another room. One other note: both rooms had a grimy feel to them. I had to clean black finger print marks and other dirt marks off of doors and walls in both rooms. In both rooms, there were stains on the carpet and all of the dining chairs. Most annoying was the sales presentation. There was no pressure and our sales person was very nice but after our experience it just did not sit right to hear this nonstop stream on the wonders and consistency of the Marriott brand.

Upon arrival, I was assisted by front desk staff who seemed quite indifferent to accommodating my request and as it turned out, not only did he NOT meet my special phoned in request, but did not accommodate our reservation confirmation for 2 double beds in the 2nd bedroom. Thankfully, he didn't meet the 2 dbl bed request because the room we were assigned was sub par. It strongly smelled of mildew and one bathroom was filled with an odor I hate to describe. The furniture had seen better days. The door was located at the end of the corridor near a trash can and the overflowing trash on the ground attracted a pair of raccoons who were gathering a feast only raccoons would love!

The new assignment was a distinct improvement all the way around. Our new room was wonderful. Here are some notes regarding our 8 night stay: Room quality: Very good. Beds and pillows were great. Kitchen appliances and utensils good. TVs great, but remote controls were a problem. Maintenence required twice. Bathrooms a bit small but fine. Balconies: All ground floor balconies are screened and various balconies on floors 2-6 are screened. Neither of our balconies were screened and we preferred that. Our balconies had a table, four chairs, ceiling fan and light. Marriott staff: We really liked all the grounds keepers, housekeeping, and maintenence staff. The folks at the Marketplace were always personable. Pools: Really nice. Nature Trail: There is a wonderful nature trail on the grounds of this property. I highly recommend exploring it--with closed toed shoes. It is definitely a NATURE trail! Ease to travel anywhere off property: It is best to have a car. Marriott does not have a courtesy van/shuttle to/from theme parks, etc. Apparently it's a 35 dollar cab ride to a Disney park. Preview tour stuff: What a pain! We received 3 calls and one request in person to sign up for a preview tour. I was so disappointed in their assertiveness--they must be desperate!

It's nice enough - nothing of any significance to be of particular concern - but it didn't blow us away. It's a large resort but the only decent (ie non park quality) food was in Nick's Grill, which was very nice with good staff. We therefore spent most of our week going off-site for decent restaurants. We booked a 2 bedroom villa which comprised a standard double room with en-suite connected to a larger double room with larger bathroom, larger kitchen area, lounge, two balconies and a jacuzzi bath. Big plus points were the spacious accomodation, which for us was more than adequate, the in-room facilities (including full washing machine and dryer, large fridge, small fridge, 3 tv's and dvd players etc etc) and the jacuzzi, which after a long day walking around the parks was fantastic. All of this adds up to good value. The downside to the 'villa' was that it was on the sixth floor and, as we found out to our annoyance, close to the large air conditioning units on the roof.

I really appreciated the room's red and gold decor, since it was elegant and not the typical Florida timeshare pastel. Since we have kids, we chose to be by the main pools. If we come again w/o kids, I'd still want to stay in bldg 82 again. It was one bldg away from main pool, so it was quiet. All the rooms around the lake are set up to overlook it, I believe. We arrived near noon, and were able to check in by 2pm and get our previously made special request to be near main bldg. This was important to us, since we often went back and forth from room to pool with the kids for food. I'd recommend stocking up the kitchen with meals, as the restaurants are, of course, expensive. The Pizza Hut had decent prices, though. The room had everything we needed. I'd recommend bringing a little, collapsable cooler to hold ice to keep drinks/snacks for pool days. I used the room's ice bucket for pops and Freezies. We would come here again.

What an amazing vacation. We were all sad to go home! Check in - Our room was not ready when we arrived at about 1:30pm. They kept our bags for us while we went to have lunch at the Copa Loca Grill on site. I always pack our bathing suits, shorts and sunscreen in our carry-on bag so we can change as soon as we get there and hit the pool. This is exactly what we did this time. As promised our room was ready by 4:00pm (the set check-in time). The staff at the check in counter were very friendly and informative, and we did not need to wait in line, as it was not very busy at the time. We were assigned a 2-bedroom unit as requested. A bellman drove us in one of the Marriott vans with our luggage to our room because it was a bit too far to walk with all our luggage. As it turned out it was not far at all to the lobby if you don't have several suitcases to carry. The bellman was also very friendly and helpful. Room - We were in building 83, which was not one of the newer rooms, but was still VERY nice and well appointed. As I mentioned, we did get a 2 bedroom, which was actually a 1 bedroom with a lock-off (adjoining) door to a second 1 bedroom. The first 1 bedroom suite had a full kitchen, bathroom with a large Jacuzzi tub and sink in one area and a second bathroom area with a shower, toilet and second sink. Very clean. There was also a screened in balcony, TV, and king size bed. There was a second TV in the living room, a large dining room table (seats 6) and a breakfast bar (seats another 3). The kitchen had granite counter tops and there was a stacked washer/dryer in the pantry of the kitchen (which we used a lot). There was also a pull out couch. The second bedroom had another king size bed, a pull out couch, balcony, bathroom, mini fridge, microwave, toaster etc. It was MUCH more than we needed, but was great to have. There was another TV in this second bedroom too. Our kids loved having their \"own\" space! We did not have a single problem with anything in our room. We called the front desk to request a jug so we could make our own lemonade and a brand new Rubbermaid jug was delivered shortly after we called. We even had a non-stick frying pan, which is something that we used daily. From our experience this is something that is often not provided. Facilities - There was so much to do at the resort. We spend most mornings at the beach area where the sand was beautiful. There was a volleyball net, which we used with our beach ball and one morning we went fishing off the beach, but didn't even get a bite. We went on the paddleboats, climbed the rock wall which was free. Anybody 45-250 lbs could try it. Our 9 year old loved it and went almost every day. It is located on the beach. There were bikes that you could rent but we didn't get a chance this time. We spent everyday at one of the pools. There are about 5 different ones. The 2 we tried were heated. One of the pools has a great splash pad with water cannons that the kids loved. The water was not as warm in that pool, but the other pools were a very nice temperature. There were hot tubs in each pool area, which were nice too. There was an incredible kids climbing area (similar to the ones at MacDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), which was great for the kids if they wanted to get out of the heat. This was free too. There were several children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, adults and teens organized activities daily. Some were free and some were not. There is a schedule at the front desk that tells you what is on all week. We went to the campfire where we made smores. They provided everything for free (stick, marshmallows, chocolate and graham crackers). They lit a nice bonfire and had some music. It was very nice and fun for all. Restaurant - The Copa Loca Grill served sandwiches, burgers, fries, cocktails etc. Food was good but rather pricey. It was convenient when you were swimming and got hungry, but we usually packed lunches in our cooler to take to the pool. We shopped at Publix and bought lots of groceries so that we could make most of our meals. This saved a ton of $$$$. Nicks Grills was excellent and I highly recommend it for dinner. The food was great and so was the service. We had dinner there twice. The prime rib is fabulous and you get a large portion! Good value too, but not cheap. Golf - My husband went every morning to the Faldo Golf institute to either play a round or 2 (9 hole course), or use the driving range/putting/chipping facilities. It is beautifully manicured and the grounds are amazing. Because we didn't have a vehicle some mornings instead of walking he would call the bellman at the front desk and they would pick him up at our room and drive him to Faldo's. He also got a ride back some days if he didn't fell like walking. He never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a ride. He also played a round of golf at Grand Pines, which is across the street from MGV. We did not have a car there so he got a ride from the bellman from our room to the golf course. He said Grand Pines was amazing too. There was so much to do right at the resort that we didn't go to any Disney parks or SeaWorld (which is 5 minutes away). Also, it was so hot (over 90 degrees) while we were there that we proffered to be by the pool this time and our kids did not once ask to go! Transportation - Many travellers mentioned that a car is needed. If you stay at MGV, we don't think you need a car. We took the I-ride Trolley to Publix for groceries, which was about a 5-minute ride. It stops right outside of the entrance (across the street) to MGV. You will need to get a bellman to give you a ride to the bus stop because the entrance from the rode to the buildings/lobby is too far to walk. When you return there is a phone right at the gate, which is a direct line to the front desk. We used this phone to call for a ride back to our room. The bellman never kept us waiting longer than 5 minutes. Our first trip to Publix we took a taxi ($10 each way) because we knew we were going to buy a lot of stuff - too much to take on the bus. The next time we took the I-ride Trolley. Almost across the street from Publix are the Premium Outlets, which was fantastic. We took the I-ride there a couple of times too. Lots of great shops! Next to Publix is a Walgreens too. Service - We experienced excellent service from all staff at MGV. Everybody was very accommodating, helpful and friendly. Overall I would rate MGV 5 out of 5 and recommend it to anybody wishing to take a vacation in Orlando. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I missed anything, but if you have any questions do not hesitate to ask. I have posted a few photos of some of the things that I did not see photos of when reading other reviews. Enjoy. We are already planning our next trip to MGV.

First I will share the positives about the property. The property is quite large with many options to keep busy during the day including several pools, boat rentals, kids play area, video arcade, and beach with volleyball net. Rooms in the newer section are nicely appointed with updated furnishings and down comforters on the beds. There is a washer/dryer in each unit, and a hot tub (without jets, only bubbles) in the master bedroom. The 2 bedroom villas are nice for traveling families. The downsides of the property really overshadowed the positives: The resort, as I stated earlier, is quite large........meaning HUGE. There are 24 separate buildings in which you could be housed. You can request a specific location 2 weeks prior to arrival, but there is no guarantee once you check in that it will be granted. If you are unlucky and are placed in an older building (as we were when we first arrived), you will be disappointed. The room had updated furnishings, but had very dated floors, showers and appliances. The A/C did not work properly, and the room was quite musty. The service at check in was less than stellar as I requested building 82 or 83 2 weeks prior, but was told at check in that was impossible because they were sold out, and was given a room in building 97 (the oldest part of the property). I was not happy, but was assured by the clerk that it was his favorite building because of the great view and updated decor. As you read above, I checked out the room and went straight back to check in. Miraculously, after 15 minutes of B.S., a room was available in building 86 (the newer part of the property). The thing that bothers me is that I stopped at the front desk twice during our stay to ask questions, and overheard, both times, 2 different clerks tell unsuspecting guests that building 97 is their favorite. (no joke) It's pathetic that MGV trains the staff to sell guests on the crappiest part of the property, to leave newer parts open to those with more points (more on that later). On the second night of our trip, we were awoken at 3:30 a.m. by drunk college kids in the villa above ours shouting on the porch and ,what sounded like furniture being moved around. I contacted security, and it took 30 minutes for the noise to subside, which was long enough to wake up the kids. For the size of the complex, the pools areas are not that large. We only visited the pool a couple of times, as it was very cool the week we stayed, but we always had an issue getting a single chair to put towels on. Also, the pools seemed very crowded with kids playing on top of each other. MGV is part of the Marriott Vacation Club which is a \"points\" timeshare. Being a timeshare, I only can compare it to one other timeshare that I have stayed at regularly ,which is the Royal Sands in Cancun, MX. Apples to apples, the Royal Sands blows the MGV away in all categories. First, if I were to buy a timeshare, I would never buy into a \"points\" property. At the Royal Sands, my in-laws own a specific villa for a specific date. WIth points, you need to request your date well in advance, then you have to fight with whom ever is at the front desk when you check in to get the best room possible at that moment in time. When we go to Cancun, we know exactly what were are getting: how far the villa is from all of the amenities, and the quality of the furnishings and decor. At the MGV, it's a crap shoot. Second, we rented this week from an owner for only $950. (which is why I have mixed emotions). According to the sales rep, you can get into this property from anywhere between $15,000, and $40,000! If I were an owner at this property, I would have buyers remorse, as I don't think it is worth owning. But, the accomodations were sufficient for the price we paid for the week. Overall, I would not stay at this resort in the future, as there are many options in Orlando with similar accommodation.

We were told to look on line but could not find what was in the studio room. Many times prior to our trip we requested a larger room but were told no availablity. The day we arrived and complained about having only a wetbar instead a real kitchen, all of a sudden an upgrade was possible for way more money. We opted to keep the room we had since there was no telling what we were getting. The bed was very nice, but for us that was the best part. Since we did not have a kitchen we ate out a lot. The last night we decided to use our Marriott travel card at the Copa loca lounge. We approached the bar to be served and sat down. No one offered a menu so we eventually had to ask for one. We then had to ask to order. After taking our order, we had to ask for our drinks again. Then shorlty after we got our drinks our appetizers were served. As we sat, we noticed several people served effeciently. As we continued to wait for the rest of our order, the bartender finally remembered to check on our order which was not completed. We think he ended up making the order himself,(after disappearingin the kitchen for about 10 minutes) because when we took it back to the room it was wrong and the kitchen was closed. After waiting an hour for service and food (as we sat at the bar in front of the bartender), he advised me that our travel cards do not work at that restaurant. A supervisor finally came by after my protest and charged the card properly. Our toddler spilled something on the down comforter and when house keeping came to replace it, it was full of wet feathers. She tried to refuse it back stating the it was dry.

We chose to stay their 5 day/4 night deal at the Marriott Grande Vista in Orlando and we recently returned from this trip. We had a 1 bedroom/1 bath villa for $ 329.00 total (all 4 nights) - but the stipulation was that we were to attend a 90 minute sales presentation. Overall, we thought the $ 329.00 deal was pretty good for 4 nights as at the time we stayed there, a 1 bedroom/1 bath villa was running $ 289.00 per night. The villa had a lot of room and was decorated nicely - but compared to other Marriott Vacation clubs that we had rented at before, MVCs in Virginia, Hawaii, and Hilton Head, this villa looked shabby. The walls were dinged up, kitchen and bath cabinets were badly scratched, the bathroom vanity appeared to have water damage as the veneer was raising up, the living room entertainment center was damaged, and all of the villa doors were dirty with finger prints - could have used a Mr. Clean sponge and the stove was rusting. However, for the price we paid, can't complain. On the good side, housekeeping was very good and responsive, grounds were very nice as were the common areas such as the lobby and the pool. This was the first time in 8 family trips to the Orlando area that we didn't stay within the Disney property and I have to say that we found this Marriott complex to be quite convenient to get to a variety of Orlando attractions, including Disney, which we drove to at least 3 times during our trip. Our children are now pre-teens and perhaps this is why it wasn't too bad to drive back and forth to Disney now. I could see where it could be inconvenient to do so if they were smaller. This Marriott is very, very close to the various Sea World parks - within a few minutes drive - which is very nice. Another nice thing about this complex is the various activities they offer - called the MAZE program where every day there are different activities for children, teens and adults - a lot of variety. As for the sales presentation - ours wasn't too bad - lasted about 120 minutes as opposed to the 90 minutes, but we had an 8:15 a.m. presentation, so we still had a full day at Sea World after our presentation. Our presentation wasn't high pressured either. So overall, a nice trip at a good price.

The tables were glass (strange considering they cater to families with young kids). We did however ask for a crib & were given a pack & play which is somewhat of a trouble bc my 2 year old likes to climb out. The check in process was slightly out of control bc the so many people were checking in at once but the staff was really accomodating. Parking was very convenient & the housekeeping was very responsive to our requests. We had also heard that they Marriott time share sales called the rooms constantly, so we were prepared to take the phone off the hook but we never got one phone call. The resort was beautiful & very convenient to all the parks. The pools were crowded but manageable. The Copa Loca restaurant was great but the menu is limited & the service is very slow. The playspace for the kids was terrific. We were fortunate to have great weather & we still used it. They also have an activity center for the kids as well as some events when the parents can leave the children but the min. age is 5. They have swan/duck paddle boats that you can rent, which sounded like a good idea until you are in the water which is really swampy. As a note about the parks----I would recommend going to Animal Kingdom & SeaWorld in the beginning of the week & Magic Kingdom at the end to avoid the crowds. The busiest days at Magic Kingdom are M/T & Animal Kingdom busiest days areThurs & Fri. Even knowing this ahead of time, we ended up at Animal Kingdom on Thurs & it was a nightmare.

The pools were OK and not too crowded even though we stayed during Easter. The complex is huge but very quiet.

As is so often the case in America the staff and service was great. I would certainly visit again. We spent three days at Disney and one at SeaWorld and thought that they were both very expensive and of course packed. Our children loved every minute. The only advice I can give is plan your day, prioritise the rides that you would like to do and go early. We had some success at Magic Kingdom before midday, after which the lines were brutal.

Most of the pools ranged from 3ft to 5 ft, however there were 2 zero entry areas that my 4 year old could easily walk around and play in water waist deep. The pools do not have lifeguards or any staff at all. However, since most of the patrons were families (with parents) it was not a problem. The food options, while a little pricey were good for families. We did not have a chance to try Nick's grill. The indoor play structure was a real hit with the kids. There were plenty of other activities provided by the resort, had we had the time. Our one gripe was the slow service, whether we were calling a restaurant, the front desk, or the concierge, they did not always answer the phone. We would have to let it ring 10-20 times to get someone to answer. They only had two bellman to serve the entire (large) resort.

They have booked a 2 or 3 bedroom villa at the Grande Vista for the last two or three years, with various relatives joining them for their stay. They love the Grande Vista, and find it much nicer than several other villas they have tried in Orlando. The villa is perfect for them - the group is generally in their 70s and 80s, and they enjoy the ability to prepare breakfast or even lunch in the villa, taking full-day or half-day excursions, and having space to socialize in the evening. The villa itself is very nice, with the master bedroom opening onto a screened porch, and the second bedroom opening onto an open-air porch, and a spacious living room/kitchen/dining area. The villa overlooked a lake, which had a nice lighted fountain at night. The beds were comfortable, and the bathrooms reasonably large. My mother loved being able to leave the breakfast dishes in the sink for the maid to clean up. The resort is huge and attractive, with a children's pool that looked fun for kids, but the pool area was rather noisy (even in the morning on a cloudy day), and the pool loungers were crammed in very closely together. Because the resort is a gated community that is set back quite a way from the main roadways, they feel safer here than they did at other villas they've tried. The villa works very well for their type of trip, where they stay for several weeks with the main goal of simply being in warm and sunny Florida. It does not work as well for a shorter trip focused on DisneyWorld. We went to Epcot one day, and while we were tired out by mid-afternoon, it was simply impractical to return to the hotel for a break before dinner. I usually stay at the Swan or Dolphin on Disney property, where I can easily take a break in the afternoon, and head back to dinner and the parks refreshed and ready for a great night. We had to just stay in the park all day, and wound up heading for dinner at the California Grill utterly exhausted, and too tired to stick around for the fireworks. You do miss out on the Disney experience here - while they returned to the villa after dinner the following night, to sit on the porch and watch the fountain or sit inside and watch TV, I returned to the Dolphin and was able to take a lovely walk around the lake, watch some of the street entertainers at the Boardwalk, watch the Illuminations fireworks from my balcony, listen to the piano player in the lobby, and take in some great views of Disney at night -even without going into a park.

I had some interest in the Marriott Vacation Club, but I will just rent at this point, save $20,000.00, and get treated better. Other guests that paid nightly also complained that there were few amenities, such as lotion in the rooms and ice machines were available in only two out of approximately 20 buildings.

Our building (#95) was lovely, towards the front of the property and had a great view over one of the golf tees. I stayed in a regular room, not one of the suites, but it was wonderful. I had a mini-frige, sink, microwave, dishes, toaster and coffeemaker. Perfect for me. The housekeeping staff even replaced my dirty cereal bowl every morning...even though they supplied me with dish soap and towels. The beds are wonderfully comfortable w/ nice linens and squishy pillows. Each room had either a screened in porch (first floors) or a balcony (upper floors) with a small table and 2 chairs. I loved having breakfast out there each day! The staff was very friendly with the exception of one security guard who wouldn't let my friend on the property until she could give him a room number.

The lake is tiny so the boat rentals are nice but you can canoe around it in about 15 minutes at a leisurely pace (why do they say it's large with boats of all sizes?). The setting is lovely though.

The washer/dryer were ready to pack it in too. They did arrive to fix things quickly although they ended up getting us a different (also old) fridge after three tries.

My daughter and I did a few of the activities - I did a step class and we tried latin amercan dancing!! It was fun. We went and enjoyed a Polynesian night around one of the pools, they had dancers and singers - it was fun - didn't cost us anything.

They said they had no other rooms to move us to until the next day. We had a scheduled time share presentaiton the next day and explained our concerns to the sales person - who buy the way was more concerned about the rating we were going to give him on our survey than assisting us. We spoke with the sales manager who spoke with the Front Desk person who said he had made arrangements to have us moved to another room. When we came back the next evening to get to our new room they could not find anything in the computer. After 20 minutes of trying to find our room and 2 very tired kids from a day at Disney they finally found us a new room. Our next room was absolutely horrible and even worse than the first one. The smell of mildew was so incredible we had to sleep with the balcony doors and windows open to get some fresh air. The stove handle was also broken along with the cupboards. There was also black on the ceiling coming from the air vents.

I even went back into the marketplace refrigerator to retireve the groceries took the bell cart and moved these myself. After calling the front desk again to try and get someone up to the room to inspect it for themselves this was to no avail. After 2 nights of no sleep and countless hours of trying to get someone to help we gave up and tried to make the best of it and spent as little time as possible in our room and at the property.

No one came the first full day at all and after that, we received limited service (bed made and new towels provided), but no vacuuming, etc. Finally, one elliptical machine in the fitness center was functioning but had a wobbly handle. Bottom line: This place has some good features and was fine for what we paid. I would not have been pleased if I had paid full price. The presentation was fine, and relatively low pressure. One slightly disturbing thing is that we left our daughter in the supervised playroom during the presentation. When we checked in on her after an hour, she was very upset, and later told us that the lady there said she could not talk to Mommy and Daddy. She's not always a reliable source of information, but I put it out there as what was reported to us.", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "malta", "Title": "\u201cGreat Holiday Resort\u201d", "Author": "polmiz", "ReviewID": "UR8749105", "Content": "Was undecided if I should choose this hotel after reading some of the last reviews about this place. But after 4 weeks I was glad we stayed at this incredible hotel. We were allocated a villa really close to reception area and also to the pool and market. The Good: ALL Staff were very professional. On two occasions we had water leaking from the shower ceiling during our stay but the fault was repaired immediately (within 1hr-2hrs) with the least inconvenience. At the market you may find most of the essential things you need. If you want to spend the evening in after a tiring day at the parks Pizza Hut outlet is ideally situated in front of market. The pools, jacuzzis, saunas, gyms and games room are of really high standards. The landscaping is breathtaking and so are the views from the room we were in. We had a villa that overlooked one of the golf courses. Rooms are well kept and the full kitchen with laundry equipment are really useful to have especially if you are there for a long stay. Some minor refurbishing was needed in the room we had. The location is very close by to Sea World and also Disney/Universal Theme Parks. The Not So Good: The resort restaurants are only open till 21:00hrs - 22:00hrs so if you return late from the parks you might have to stock up on some food in your room. You might still buy something from the market up till 23:00hrs. Night time entertainment is lacking so you will need to head someplace else in the late evenings. The Bad: The resort advertises that the I-Ride IS SITUATED IN FRONT OF PROPERTY. If you need the I-Ride you do not have a car. To be fair the resort offers complimentary transportation by bell hop from/to the reception/front entrance and vice versa but to say that in the evenings (after 22:00hrs) the service is lacking would be an understatement. It is closer to non-existant. It is more than a two minute drive so I will let you think how long it will take you to walk it in especially after spending the whole day walking/running at theme parks like Disney or Universal. Overall: It is a remarkable resort to spend with your family and I would suggest it to anyone with one rule in mind.

CHECK-IN: We took the Auto Train from Lorton, VA to Sanford, FL, which arrived at 9:00 a.m. and we had our car by 10:00 a.m. The drive from Sanford to the Grande Vista was approximately 45 minutes, with no traffic, probably because it was a Sunday. Knowing we may get in early, I had requested early check-in. I requested a room on a high floor near main pool. When we arrived around 11:00 a.m., I asked if my room was ready, really not expecting it to be ready since regular check-in is 4:00 p.m. The very friendly lady at the front desk said the building I requested is very popular and probably would not be ready for a couple hours. She said other rooms are ready if we would like to take one not close to the main pool, but we declined (hindsight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we should have taken one since we really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be so close to the main pool and Market Place shop as we thought originally). She offered to store our luggage and also informed us we were welcome to use the changing facilities if we wanted to wait near the pool. She also said she would call us on my cell phone when our room was ready. We ate lunch at one of the pool bar/restaurants, Copa Loca, and hung around by the pool until our room was ready at 4:00 p.m. ROOM: We stayed in a 2 bedroom timeshare unit in building 81 (or 83 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember) on the 2nd floor in room numbers 1207/1208. Not the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high floor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we requested, but it was in the building we requested and not on the 1st floor. This building overlooks the main pool area, near the Lighthouse pool bar, Market Place shop, and the ice cream and pizza shop. It really is a very convenient location. The pool closes at 11:00 p.m. so there is no noise and doubt there would be if your patio doors are closed, because the doors are thick and heavy. These 2 bedrooms are what Marriott Vacation Club calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lock-offs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because one side could be made into a studio and the other side a 1 bedroom. When you rent the 2 bedroom you can enter either side and open the adjoining doors between them. What struck me when I entered the rooms were the colors Marriott chose to use to decorate. Not your typical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Florida\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pastels, but more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153formal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd darker colors. Granted, the place was very clean and did not show any sign of wear. Both sides had the very comfortable new Marriott bedding, which is just wonderful! The studio side had a king bed, pull out queen couch, TV, balcony with 2 chairs and small table, small fridge, microwave, 12 cup coffee maker, small table and 2 chairs, servings for 4, and sink (no washer/dryer, oven, or dishwasher). It also had a full bathroom. The 1 bedroom side has an apartment size washer/dryer, full size fridge, oven and stove, dishwasher, microwave, bar/counter with 4 stools, table and 6 chairs, servings for 6, pull out queen couch, TV, DVD player (you can rent movies in the MAZE for $5), large screened in balcony with table and 4 chairs and ceiling fan, a ceiling fan in the master bedroom with king size bed, sitting chair, 2 person whirlpool tub with a single sink, and then a full bath with toilet, sink and shower. Knowing this timeshare rental does not come with daily maid service, and since we were staying 4 nights, we ordered a $23 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tidy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd service where they vacuum, take out the trash, make the beds with the same linens, and change all the towels. We thought it was worth it, since the unit looked nice when we got back from the parks that evening. My only complaint or shall I say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcannoyance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 because it really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect our vacation, was with the maintenance staff. When we got there, a hair dryer was missing, the ceiling fan did not work, and two lights in the bedroom did not work and we immediately called them in on Sunday. After getting back from the parks on Monday, things still were not fixed, and you could only get hot water out of the shower on the studio side, so we called them in again and added the water problem. They immediately brought up a new hair dryer. Tuesday morning they called to check to see if everything was taken care of and we told them no. When we got back from the parks on Tuesday evening, the ceiling fan was fixed, but the water problem and the lights were not, and we just gave up since we were leaving on Thursday. POOL: There are 2 main pool areas, and both are usually crowded because both have access to bar/restaurant areas. There are other smaller pools scattered throughout the large complex. Part of the problem at the larger, main pool areas are the people that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153save\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd seats then go somewhere for hours while other people are looking for seats. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how you prevent this because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen this at other places, not just here. OTHER AMENITIES: We did not get to use any of these because we did not have enough time, but I thought I would just mention them. The Nick Faldo golf course is right on property, they also provide lessons. There are tennis courts, bicycle rentals, paddle boat rentals, a rock climbing wall, a child care center and activities (MAZE), and an arcade with pool tables. LOCATION: The Grande Vista is in a great location. You are about 2 miles off I-4 and the entrance to Grande Vista is on International Drive (I Drive), 1 mile from Sea World and Discovery Cove, 2 miles from Publix grocery store and many restaurants, about 5 miles from Universal, and 10 miles from Disney World. If you are going to the Disney World parks, I would highly recommend having access to a car. Otherwise, there is a trolley/bus that makes the I Drive loop with a stop near the entrance to Grande Vista.", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cThe best of the best\u201d", "Author": "EgerTravler", "ReviewID": "UR8280004", "Content": "OH MY GOODNESS!

We always ask for the top floor, so that was nice to be able to get it upon request. We took pictures of our room and they are included in this review.

I called immediately, not willing to hear that for more than the next 5 minute it woul take to pick up my stuff I had just brought in. The staff at the front desk were helpful and we were switched from building 83 to 95, top floor room again. One thing I don't care for is being in a lock-off room. Sometimes you can't hear anything, other times you can hear, which was evidenced by the first room. I felt bad for anyone who came along after us into that room. Our next room, we didn't hear too much except for some slight banging around when they would come back after a day out in Orlando. This Marriott seems to have 1-bedrooms with a studio suite lock-off as the only option for room choices. So we had the studio part, which is enough room for 2 adults for sure. So the first room had granite in the kitchenette, the second did not. The first had a pond and tree-line view, the second had a golf and other hotel buildings view. The rest of the room was nice and the same overall in both. Large king bed with very comfy pillows, sheets and bedding; a sofa; tv; kitchen with micro and small fridge; bathroom. We used the pools on the property and found them to be nice (lots of families with kids however if you do or don't enjoy that, take note). The hot tub near building 95 was very hot, but the jets did not seem to be working, so not much to actually massage us with. But the kids were in the other part of the pool area, so it was nice to have all to ourselves. There seems to be about 4 pool areas on the property, we hit 2. There is also a golf course, marketplace store (where you can get free large bags of ice) and some boat and bike rentals. We only got the free ice, didn't use the other things. There is a large lake and we were told you could fish in there, but we didn't bring equipment. This Marriott is right around the corner from Sea World, a grocery store and about 2 miles from Hwy 4, so easy on and off. Nearby, Downtown Disney is fun for people watching and the Rain Forest Cafe has a great Cobb salad, big enough for 2 to share (we suggest that!) Nice place, definitely family/kid friendly.

We decided to do a nice, long family vacation since we had a lot of Marriott points to redeem. By staying almost 3 weeks, things are bound to go wrong at some point, and they did (for one, burned-out light bulbs not fixed after repeated requests) however, we did have a terrific time. My biggest disappointment with this hotel is that there are some things in need of major repair. Since we have been going here, we have seen the main pool decline. Many of the tiles are cracked, missing or moldy and the tower where there is a waterfall is very rusty. The other large pool is also falling into disrepair. The large rubber/plastic rings on the children's spray poles in this pool are also getting rusty and moldy. It would seem an easy fix to replace those. Definitely not what I would expect of a hotel/vacation ownership of this caliber. As mentioned above, certain things were not tended to after repeated requests. Also, we were on a first floor and for some reason, someone's underwear was on the grass in front of our patio. The day we checked out was day #4 of underwear on the grass. Yes, we could have called someone but other requests fell on deaf ears and we wanted to see how long before someone would attend to this. On the plus side, our 2-bedroom was very spacious and gave us our necessary space from our kids! The bed and furniture was comfortable and clean. Also, the staff is very nice. Everyone always had a smile on their face and seemed willing to help. The 4th of July parade they all put on (each department had a golf cart to decorate) was really cute and they gave lots of treats to the kids. The 4th of July carnival they had was also really fun. They really went all-out to make the holiday special for everyone. There is definitely a lot to do at this hotel. They added a rock-climbing wall (free) and their kid's activity area was great. There was an activity every morning for the kids and we took advantage of their Parent's Night Out where they watched the kids from 5-10 PM. My children loved it!! In my personal opinion, the activity staff is absolutely fantastic. They really enjoy working with the kids! Overall, a great place to stay in the Orlando area.

We stayed through an exchange with Interval International. Never having been to Orlando and trying to choose a resort, I did my research which included Trip Advisor. After finally deciding on The Marriott Grande Vista, once we arrived, I knew we had made the right choice. The entrance is a long curving driveway lined with beautiful trees and surrounded by a natural wildlife preserve. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and nice. We stayed in a 2BD Villa in the Ibiza Building and it was great. We were not to close to the pool which was fine because we spent almost every single day at the parks (Disney/Universal). We only spent one full day enjoying the main pool and resort ammenities. We rented a car which I strongly recommend and on the day we skipped the parks and stayed at the resort to relax, we just drove on over to the main pool and had no problem with finding a parking spot. In fact, we got back late each night and never ever had a problem with finding a parking spot by our building. I mention this as I read complaints about this from others here on Trip Advisor. Our 2BD had a full kitchen with granite countertops, a large pantry for all of our groceries, refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, etc. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the necessary appliances, cookware, dishes, etc. We were able to enjoy breakfast every morning out on our terrace with a very nice view of the lake. We had a washer and dryer which we used. It was nice returning home with fresh and clean clothes. Also, they only give you one detergent packet in your welcome package but the on-site Market Place sells more travel size detergent. The master bedroom had a VERY, VERY comfortable king size bed and a hot tub which we very much enjoyed at the end of our very long days at the parks. Keep in mind, this is a vacation club property, not a standard hotel, so we did not have regular housekeeping service. However, you can purchase a tidy up or a full cleaning. This was fine as we were only two couples and had no problem cleaning up after ourselves in general. We did decide to go with a tidy up halfway through the week. We ordered the tidy up the night before and were told housekeeping would come by the next day after 10 am. The next day, we left for the parks and returned to discover housekeeping did not come by. We called and complained (nicely) and they apologized. They assured us housekeeping would come by the following day for a full cleaning at no extra charge, which they did (Great Marriott Customer Service). It was great to come back to a fully cleaned villa. In fact, we realized it was worth going with the full cleaning halfway through the week regardless. In addition, we also did the Marriott timeshare presentation, got some Disney Dollars and felt the presentation to be very low pressure. The salesperson was very courteous and professional and did not make us feel uncomfortable after we declined and requested to take the information home to review. All in all it was a wonderful experience. I must mention that this is a family oriented resort, lots of families with children which was fine with us. We were a party of 4 (two couples) and really spent most of our time at the parks, but enjoyed coming back to the very, very comfortable Marriott accommodations. My only suggestion would be an adult only pool for those of us not traveling with children.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Linden, MI", "Title": "\u201cFamily Fun in the Sun!\u201d", "Author": "rchud", "ReviewID": "UR8108093", "Content": "My family of four and I stayed at the Marriott Grande Vista from June 23 - 30th. This really is a wonderful place for families. The resort goes above and beyond to provide activities and treats for kids. Here are some specifics: Room & Rates: First of all, we got our reservations from EBay - the family who owned the unit was not able to use it this year. Fantastic deal - less than $900 for a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit. Based on previous TripAdvisor reviews I asked for a renovated room - which I think is a good idea. I never saw any other rooms - but ours was delightful. We were in Building 80 on the second floor. Ask for this building... it is the building right above the MarketPlace, lobby, main pool, etc. The convenience was such a bonus. Not that the resort is so overwhelming in size - but we could literally run to our room in two minutes, run down for a coffee, ice cream, you name it. Also, the room itself was wonderfully furnished - fully stocked kitchen, two screened balconies, 3 TVs, tons of room. It really was such a nice place - we were thrilled. Activities for Kids: The list here could go on and on, but here are a few things we actually participated in and enjoyed. Free rock climbing wall, poolside temporary tattoos and hair braiding, kids club called MAZE - we tie-dyed tees, played on the playscape, participated in poolside games, bingo, and hula-hoop contest. There was soooo much more to do - we really did not scratch the surface. Every morning in elevators you could get a list of activities - most are free - a few cost a bit. There was also Kids Check-in most days beginning around 4:00 - free ice cream, face painting, and balloon animals. Most parents did tip the staff - but still for a few dollars the kids really get a kick out of it. Food and MarketPlace: We got poolside drinks once or twice - About $35.00 for two adults and two kids. So, a little pricey, but very yummy. You can bring coolers to the pool and snacks - most families did. We got the ice cream, Pizza Hut, and a wrap sandwiches at the store. All were good. Grounds: I thought the grounds were really nice - good condition & beautifully landscaped. Lots of water - just like the pictures. The pools were in great condition - I did see the occasional loose paver, but frankly with a resort even 24 hour maintenance could not keep up with everything. Overall we all really enjoyed the resort - would recommend to our pickiest friends, and will look to return in the future.

The boys had their own room, own beds and own TV and bathroom. We, of course, had our own room as well. The full kitchen with W/D was just as we have come to expect from Marriott timeshares. We were in building 83 on the 3rd floor overlooking the lake - this was a renovated unit which we had requested when booking. The furniture had been newly recovered and the carpet was new. Bathrooms could use a bit of work and lighting was insufficient. Since the focus of our trip was Sea World and Discovery Cove, this was the best location - a very short drive. We were able to be at the parks when the gates opened, hit the best shows and rides before the crowds and come back for lunch in our home away from home. The boys enjoyed a respite in the air conditioned unit and explored several of the nearby pools. Fountains and waterfalls made the pool visits more fun. We enjoyed frou frou drinks by the pool while watching them swim and snorkel in the water. One night we ate dinner at Nick's near the Faldo Golf Institute. Not crowded, very nice service to the children and a reasonable children's menu. We did not feel that the adult food was particularly good, but adequate and the restful atmosphere was welcome at the end of the day. Service from the desk staff was excellent. Always a friendly smile and willingness to help out and answer questions. The night before we checked out, the desk clerk printed boarding passes for us!

The Room: We stayed in a \"studio\" villa, which has a very comfortable bed with new, white down linens, a small kitchenette (small refrigerator, sink, microwave and dishes/silverware), and pull out sleeper sofa. It also had a large, separate bathroom. The room was very clean and had all the amenities to make your stay comfortable. We had a nice view of the lake and a balcony on the 6th floor. Our main complaint with the room is the water smells terribly like sulfur. Taking a shower, or brushing your teeth, caused the whole bathroom to stink horribly. The Resort: The resort has a total of 4 pools. We only visited 2 of them, the main one near the front desk building, the other next to our hotel. They had a grill/bar poolside to our building, which seemed overpriced. The pools were disappointing. Always crowded with tons of kids! It wouldve been nice to have an adults only pool. Also, the water smells of sulfur. There seemed to be enough lounge chairs for everyone. They had daily scheduled activities, and a marketplace and Pizza hut on site. The pizza was very good. Transportation/ Location: We did not drive down or rent a car. We wanted to save money not renting a car. At the entrance of the resort there is an I-Ride trolley stop (stop G13- you can find route maps online) and a Lynx stop (Orlando public bus transportation). To ride the i-ride is $1 per ride, $1.50 for the lynx. The Lynx route 50 will take you to Magic Kingdom where you can take free Disney buses to any park, as well as the airport (route 8 to route 42). To get to the Lynx route 50 stop, just get on the route 8 bus at the front of the resort to Sea World for the transfer. We were pretty happy saving money taking the buses, sometimes you have to wait up to a half hour, which is an inconvenience, but you can't beat the price! Also, the hotel offers shuttle service to Magic Kingdom. The price is $13 per person, roundtrip. It is a towncar service called \"worldwide-something or another\". BEWARE. We got took for a ride with them! The driver, named Steve, gave us his card the first day with his number in case we wanted to contact him directly for transportation. If booked through the hotel they will only pick you up for return from Magic Kingdom at 830pm, 1030 pm, or 1230 pm. We contaced steve the next day to get a ride to the park. Once he dropped us off at the gate he said the fare would be $26 for my husband and I ONE WAY- double the fare the day before. He did not notify us prior that contacting him outside of the hotel on our own would double the price. We really felt decieved as he did not notify us of a price difference. Then, the ride he arranged for us to come back that evening did not show up. We had to catch another cab after waiting for his other driver who was a no-show. I would not recommend using this company for your transportation needs. The location of the resort seems far away from everything without your own car. It took work and planning to get around anywhere, and the resort is huge, so walking all the way to the front to catch the bus is a hike. The bellman at the front desk can take you (tip expected), but we waited 45 min one day in the blazing sun, with groceries, to be brought back to our room- they never came so we walked. Overall: We thought the resort itself was OKAY. The timeshare presentation was very, very LOW pressure. Great presentation, great vacation club from what we could tell! The rooms were beautiful, besides the stench of sulfur water.

We then asked for a ground floor room and got building 83. I asked if it was renovated and after some prodding the receptionist admitted it was not.

Helpful service (highchair, towels, etc) but give them about 1-2 hours to fulfill your request. The bad: the outlet in the kitchen didn't work, the water line to the fridge ice maker was unattached and leaked water -- which the ants loved but not us, the wrought iron furniture has sharp corners and glass tops (hazard for active children), and did I mention the CONDOM wrapper under the nightstand found by the 3 year old. DVD player failed. Almost no shelf space to store groceries (maybe they want you to eat at the restaurants?). The Marriott Grande Vista is an enourmous facility holding thousands of guests.

A family member had a free week at a Marriott timeshare that they gave to us. We chose the Grande Vista over a couple of other Marriott resorts in the area and we couldn't be happier that we did. While I understand that everyone has different expectations when they first stay at a resort, I just cannot understand some of the negative reviews this resort received. We had a 2 bedroom villa on the 6th floor in the San Moreno (?) building near the main pool and lobby. The room had minor flaws (one lightbulb out in the dining area, weather stripping under one outside door was non-existent), but it was very clean and there were no major issues like the ones mentioned in previous reviews. The room was also had more space than 3 people need, but we like to have our space and we also like that our daughter (7) had her own bedroom (and so did she). It felt more like home than a hotel. We had breakfast in our room everyday before we hit the parks, which saved us some cash for dinners. On our first day, we got a feel for the property and we were impressed. It was well kept and it actually reminded us of some of the resorts we stay at in the Caribbean. I can't really comment on any of the activities or all of the restaurants since we didn't use the facilities all that much. We were at the parks virtually all day each of the 7 days we were there. The shop that they have where you can get food and drink items is limited and a little pricey. My wife forgot her toothbrush and they didn't sell them there. I would suggest going to Publix anyway which is only a few minutes away. It would be nice however if they sold the single packs of detergent for the laundry. They give you one when you check in, but if you wanted (needed) to do more than one load before you left for home, then you have to bring your own or get the smallest possible container at Publix and leave it behind. I can honestly say that if there were no theme parks in the immediate vicinity, we would have still been able to stay at this resort and not been bored based on the activities sheet that we saw posted in the elevator each day. We received the call to listen to the timeshare opportunity and we took advantage of it (free Marriott Rewards points). They knew that we were brand new owners at Marriott in St Kitts, as did our salesperson and rather than giving us the typical tour, we sat in his office and he gave us some great information regarding how to take full advatage of our timeshare and it's trading possibilities. This to me showed how professional Marriott is in their approach. Our salesperson knew he wasn't going to get a sale out of us, yet he still took the time to give us some very solid advice. I've been to other timeshare presentations and when you decide not to sign up some of them act like you are taking food out of their children's mouths if you don't buy with them. If this type of treatment and overall experience is what we can expect out of our St Kitts property and all the other Marriott resorts, then we made the right choice.

It seems a little over-kill to get a 2-bedroom unit (which is quite large), just to have 2 normal beds. The place is very, very clean, though in need of updating (i.e. 19 inch TV's). I liked the fact that it offers free internet. Most amenities (other than pools and sunbathing) are chargeable. When I go to a resort, I don't like to feels as though I'm being nickel and dimed. They should provide Non-motorized watersports and bikes for free (in my opinion). The pools were not crowded when I went there, but I have to wonder if they could be over-crowded during a spring break due to the high unit to facility ratio.

We were in a one bedroom villa from May 3rd through May10th. We had recently bought a 2 bedroom timeshare through Marriott Vacation Club, and the MGV is our home location. We split our time into one week in the one bedroom villa, and we still have a week \"in the bank\" at Interval Intermational. The MGV is about a 20 minute drive from the Orlando airport. The long driveway into MGV is beautifully landscaped, and we were excited when we arrived at the office. Our check in was smooth and only took a few minutes. The room was great, and it looked very much like the model we had seen when we bought our timeshare (we made the purchase in Absecon, NJ) The property is beautifully maintained, and the rooms can overlook the lake, or one of the pools, or the golf course. Ours overlooked the lake, very quiet, with a nice screened in porch. The MGV has a great location. It is about 5 minutes from SeaWorld, and maybe 15 minutes from DisneyWorld (Epcot at least). There are six or seven pools, each with a few hot tubs nearby. Two of the larger pools have activities for kids, and one has lots of fountains and water cannons etc. Several other pools seem more attuned to adults; quieter, etc. In other words, there is something for everything. We agreed to attend the 90 minutes sales presentation, mainly to get $100 Disney Dollars to spend at Epcot. It lasted exactly 90 minutes, and once we told our sales rep we were new owners, he spent most of the time answering our questions, as opposed to trying to make a new sale. The $100 Disney Dollars came in handy, and were accepted everywhere in Disney. Can't say enough about the friendliness of the staff. My wife has some dificulty walking around, but whenever one of the ubiquitous golf carts drove by with an employee behind the wheel, they would stop and offer her a ride. We did not purchase any of the house keeping options. With just my wife and I, our room was fine for a week. There is a Publix supermarket nearby. We had most of our breakfasts and lunches in our room (we like to keep it simple!). The on site Village Market also has a Pizza Hut in it and serves Starbucks Coffee. I saw many families getting pizza for dinner. One pool had poolside waitress service, which is great. The drinks are pricey, but having a cool frozen drink delivered poolside is worth it! The resort was larger than I originally thought, 900 total units, but I never felt crowded ( I have no idea how full the resort was.)

Our room was spacious although it looked like it needed a good cleaning (not dirty, just not extremely clean). For example, the kids uncovered a few hairballs behind some of the furniture.... granted they were behind the furniture but there were a few things like this.

Now onto the selling point of the resort - the grounds! The resort itself was absolutely beautiful, and the common area was very well maintained. They had two main pool areas, each with its own kiddie pool and fountains. I think that the resort has a total of five pools, but I am not sure about that. The satellite pools were not crowded at all during our stay. For families with little kids, they have an indoor playground (and a really nice one at that)! This may have been the highlight of our trip as we could take the kids over there for a little bit each day to help them spend a little extra energy. The also had planned activities each day (some free and some at a small cost), but we opted not to do any of those. One last note - the staff was extremely friendly.

I noticed that not all of the units have a screened in porch area, so you may want to consider this if you have young children. Some of them are open, and it is a far drop down. We booked our unit thru Interval International. Our room had a few little things wrong. The outside light at the front door was crooked, the foyer light was crooked, the refrigerator was crooked and the door would bang on the wall when you closed it. It really didn't make-or-break the trip, but it took away from the \"wow\" factor. Only two complaints. First, for such a large bathroom in our 1 bedroom unit, I wish the layout had a powder room set up for the toilet. We had a non-family guest with us, and she couldn't use the toilet when I was showering, and I couldn't when she was. It wasn't that big of a deal, but again, the bathroom was just huge. They easily could have partitioned the toilet off. I have seen this in other places. The other thing was the lack of a dedicated parking lot for the market section. The walk wasn't all that far from our unit to the marketplace, but far enough. At the end of a long Disney day, I just wanted to treat my kids to an ice cream cone, and didn't want them walking thru the parking lots. Unfortunately, there was no parking just for the market area, and spots were pretty hard to find in that area. We've been to the Orlando area about 6 times now in the past 10 years, and we've stayed at a different place each time.

We brought our MSU student with us and decided to go to Orlando because our oldest son now works and lives in Orlando and we could combine some R&R with a visit with him. We had done the Universal/Disney thing several years ago, so this visit was a getaway from the cold, white north without the lines and cues of paid for amusements. We were there to relax and enjoy the warmer weather. We had a one bedroom suite. It was very nice with all amenities, full kitchen, whirlpool tub, shower, couches, table...etc. We stayed in the 'main' building. Our balcony/patio overlooked the large U-shaped pool and was spacious and comfortable for reading, relaxing and viewing. There was no daily maid service unless you want to pay for it. We declined. Below us was the Marketplace, with Starbucks, Pizza Hut, Eddies Ice Cream and a convenience store...which was very convenient for quick needs. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The grounds were very well manicured and kept very clean and organized. Parking was never a problem, occasionally you might have to walk a little but nothing dramatic...not a problem. You can take some nice stolls aroung the place, the ponds were nice and there was also a conservation area walking path. The people staying there were rather diverse...colleges students who were well behaved, families of all ages, older and younger couples...it appeared to a mixture of everyone. They had lots of activities for both adults and kids but mostly for kids. We rarely ventured far from our building while at MGV, so activities in other areas I can not comment on. Now for the nuts and bolts...Drinks were a bit expensive. We made most of our refreshments in our room and it was never a problem to carry them about. The Lighthouse bar made some good tropical concoctions which we did partake on several occasions. We never ate at Nick's Grill which is the MGV's nice restaurant, so I can't help you there, it looked very nice. The pool grill had a limited menu and was slightly overpriced but the food was pretty decent. A good place to go for a snack to hold you over before going out for your meals. We did buy some necessaries at the Publix grocery store, but it was mostly for snacking and drinks. We did the timeshare presentation, for 1.5 hours. No real hassles, we got $100 Marriot cash to close out our bills from the pool grill and bike rental. We were in a very nice location because we requested a room near one of the main pool areas. I highly recommend that you request this. Some of the buildings were a walk from the two main pool areas and although I think all the rooms overlook either the pools, golf course or lakes, we were in a prime location (for us). We called ours the 'Presidential Suite'. It appeared to be a very nice place to relax or rest from the amusement parks which we presumed many people were doing based on the abundance of Mickey stuff the kids were wearing. The MGV is a short drive from all the restaurants and putt-putt and other activities on I-Drive. We did go to Lakeland and watch the Tigers play Atlanta. We even got Gary Sheffield, Justin Verlander and Curtis Granderfield's autographs. We did a casino cruise and won some money. Went to the Science Museum to see the Our Body exhibit and we ate a many nice restaurants. Texas de Brazil was awesome. It was a fun time and a nice place to stay. You should be happy with it.

Really, if you have your own car, this is a great location for all attractions (Disneyworld 15 minutes, SeaWorld - within walking distance - 1/2 mile away, major mall - 7 minutes, Outlet stores - 5 minutes drive). They give you a map with very thorough directions to any attraction you want to go to. The property also has a person that can help you purchase attraction tickets...the one we purchased was 2 days at 2 different Disney theme parks plus a water park or Pleasure Island. Unless you plan on doing those things, it may be better just to buy your attraction tickets online or at the park. After doing 2 full days at theme parks, we were tired of being around a lot of tourists, bright lights, loud noise, and waiting lines and we decided not to use the Pleasure Island ticket...so we lost some value of the tickets.

The grounds are gorgeous and the \"at your service\" staff is well-trained to communicate empathy about your complaints. If only there were action behind the professional sympathy! Business travelers beware: This is not the facility for you. All rooms are adjoining rooms, meaning you can CLEARLY hear the little ones next door rise early anticipating Disney World. Because the doors open onto a cement verandah/hallway, you also hear every passerby, every slamming door, and every screaming kid on the way to the elevator. The tile floors and hard surfaces of the rooms make every sound reverberate. Female travelers beware: The room security is quite lax. I moved rooms twice and each time, the locks on the sliding glass doors were broken. Twice I came back to find my front door standing open, which is disconcerting. The front doors appear to shut here, but unless you slam them (thus adding to the cacophony), they don't actually shut and will eventually blow open. Maintenance took an entire day to come fix the back door locks--after assuring me they were \"right on the way\"--and housekeeping just decided not to show up at all one day. Yet, in the space of 48 hours here, I have already received numerous marketing voicemail messages FROM THE STAFF promoting this property as a vacation club. Not on your life. These \"villas\" are merely shot-gun studios. But I will give them this: They have upgraded to the Marriott \"dream beds\" and they are truly superb.

The complex is quite large with many amenities- golf, tennis,pool table, aerobics, etc. with a live band which plays by the pool most nights. A family could easily spend a few days here with all the activities and never even bother with the theme parks. The highlight in my opinion was the waterpark with faux-cannon towers, mini-waterfalls and a great waterplay area for toddlers. Extremely child friendly. The kids loved it and I don't even have kids. Almost all the other vacationers I encountered at the Grande Vista seemed especially happy and in a good mood. This place seems to have a wholesome, feel-good aura which is contageous. Close by, you also have Sea World practically across the street. Be sure to check out Thai Thanee right next to the Denny's on Internationational Drive- excellent Thai food in a resturaunt that is more like a museum stuffed with asian artifacts- great place. I believe this is largely a time-share type deal but I paid $140 a nite- an amazaing deal, especially considering Disney has the gaul to charge almost $400 a nite in high season for it's theme hotels which are hardly alot better than the Grande Vista.

While we were put up at the Gaylord Palms (also a very nice property) a cocktail event was actually held at the Grande Vista's main pool area, which is absolutely stunning. Even though several years had passed, we were SO impressed with our brief encounter with Grande Vista, that we booked our next stay in Orlando (Dec. 29, 06 to Jan 3, 07) at the Grande Vista. We didn't stay in a villa since it was just the 2 of us, but we voluntarily sought out a time share appointment, just to learn more about the property and villas, in case we wanted to rent one in the future. I'll highlight issues with both our rack rate room and the timeshare/villa fact finding... Our room stay: BEDDING: Is second to none!!! The upgrades Marriott have made to their bedding make leaving home a pleasure. The sheets are definitely a high thread count and the mattress pads make the beds feel like expensive pillow tops. LOTS of fluffy pillows and fluffy comforter. All snow white with no stains. Loved it. We slept like babies every night. Heaven! ROOM: For a non-villa, our room size was generous and we had a microwave, mini fridge, mini sink, dishes/flatware/glasses, paper towels, dish soap, sponge....really nice touches. We bought inexpensive beverages at the Market Place and always had something refreshing right in our room. Very convenient! The bathroom was average and a bit dated, but was freshly painted, very clean and functional. The fabulous bedding made up for it! HOUSEKEEPING: There was a mild dust ring clinging to the textured ceiling above the ceiling fan that should be cleaned. Not a huge issue. My only real complaint about the room was that on a few days we left the room late morning (10/11am) and returned late afternoon/eve (5-7pm) and our room hadn't been touched. Bed was still unmade, no fresh towels...nothing. However, when we phoned about it, we got immediate response. Don't know if housekeeping staff was just having a bad stretch? When they did come in, they did a nice job. TIMESHARE/VILLAS: Now, I've read about being pressured about timeshares here in other reviews and I must say that my husband and I sought THEM out. We phoned on our own to ask for an appt. We completely did not expect to buy, especially that very day. But, the sales staff was not a hard sell by any stretch and after our questions had been answered (and I mean ALL of them...the sales staff is very helpful and knowledgeable), we went to see the villas firsthand. They're absolutely beautiful. They're almost better than home with gorgeous granite counter tops, lovely tile flooring, luxurious jacuzzi tubs in the master bathrooms, the luxury bedding I fell in love with... The timeshare sold itself to us and the sales person didn't hard sell us in any way. I just wanted to mention our timeshare experience as others have mentioned it. I also wanted to point out how stunning and luxurious the timeshare villas truly are. My husband and I travel alone and our 2 bedroom villa will suit us fine, but they're perfect for traveling with friends and family. Overall, the Grande Vista is really an ideal resort for couples, families/groups alike. It has something for everyone. Inexpensive meals/sandwiches at Copa Loca ($8 or less!) that are huge and very tasty, Pizza Hut and Edy's ice cream are exactly what you'd pay at home, the Market Place has a huge variety of food items and more sandwiches to go, soft drinks, sunscreen, etc at very reasonable prices. We didn't have the time to eat at Nick's Grill, but heard over and over that it's outstanding and we found the menu prices to be comparable to decent restaurants at home. The views are lovely from every point at the resort, the pools are gorgeous, the grounds are meticulously kept, the villas are luxurious and the location can't be beat. This isn't a room service/white glove Marriott with columns, marble floors and koi ponds (don't get me wrong, I love those too!). It's a \"kick back, have a great burger and \"sneaky tiki\" by the lovely pool\" kind of place. Nice enough to be an upscale getaway and low keyed enough to leave you and your pocketbook relaxed.

Lots of greenery, trees, bushes. The staff was very helpful and friendly (except one of the concierge attendants). The rooms were well appointed and the furniture was in fairly good condition for a hotel/condo. The Bad: While the furniture was in good shape the walls of our room were well worn. The room was not excpetionally clean (I will get to that below). The resort is so big that if you get put in the wrong area of the resort, you can have upto a 7-10 minute walk to the pool. Due to the large amount of grounds they are always trimming trees or shrubs so there is always noise. Disclaimer: I am generally a very easy to please person so what is below is not an exageration. The Ugly: Room cleanliness: There was mold in the toilet and the shower. There was a cockroach on my daughter's stroller as well as many other assorted bugs in the room. We paid $30 for a full room clean mid week (cleaning is not included with the timeshares). The carpets were not vacuumed, the tables were not cleaned, and they did not leave us any kitchen towels.

We were given a suite in the Alicante building, which housed all the facilities you would require for a home from home vacation. Only two complaints : the occupants of the suite next door were very noisy and because there was an adjoining door there was no sound proofing and the water stank of chlorine. We did complain about the noisy neighbours, yelling, scream and slamming of doors after midnight is a bit excessive. We were informed by the reception staff that security would have a quiet word, whether they did or not we don't know but after that it wasn't too bad. Regardless it didn't spoil our stay. Facilities at the resort were very good. Boating and fishing on the lake. Pizza Hut, Copa Loca Bar and Grill, The Lighthouse Bar and the deli were all good. The deli was a little bit pricey but on check-in you are given a guide with directions to the nearest supermarkets and also the resort's activity guide, considering this is not an all-inclusive facility there are loads to keep you occupied, the majority of which are free of charge and only a nominal cost for make and take craft items and some trips. We thought the drinks at the bars were quite expensive but our son made good use of his souvenir insulated cup which at an initial cost of $12.99 provided him with free refills for the whole of the vacation. Starbucks in the deli operates a similar deal. Whilst the bars operate a buy a smoothy/cocktail in souvenir glass for $8 and then refills at $6 same again for beers. We did not try Nick's Grill so cannot comment. The suite was tastefully furnished, with a full kitchen, washer/dryer and hot-tub/spa in the master bedroom. Although this was one of the newer rooms there were already some signs of wear and tear. We had to call maintenance once to repair the air conditioning and this was done in a matter of minutes. Don't be surprised - there is no housekeeping on a daily basis. We were lucky to have a screened in balcony with ceiling fan and saw no roaches or nasties the whole stay. The resort is located some distance from the hustle and bustle of I-drive but only a very short drive to Sea World and Discovery Cove. 15 mins tops to Disney and Universal. We certainly had a good time and would recommend this hotel to anyone, especially those with small children as the pools were very nice and not that deep. We did not see a playground however there were tennis and basketball courts. When we left it looked like they were preparing to put up some sort of climbing wall. Once a week, in the older of the two larger pool areas, they have a large screen showing fairly recent family movies. If you're lucky you can also see the firework display at Sea World. Overall its a very good place to stay and I do know that a lot of families were happy just to stay at the resort and felt no need to venture to the parks.

My perspective is from someone who has stayed at lower end hotels to the Ritz Carlton in Washington, the Southampton Princess in Bermuda, as well as the Marriott Canyon villas in Phoenix (three weeks ago). Our problem was with the bath water. It wreaked!!!!!! It wasn't subtle, it just smelled really bad and this is what prompted me to write a review. My feeling was that it was not a problem with my specific room's water but was a problem with the whole resort. I had a facility engineer inspect it and he verified my complaint and agreed with my theory saying that some resorts invest in osmosis or reverse osmosis processes to clean up their water but that this facility didn't. He also said that the water in Florida, in general, isn't very good. I later found that not to be true. We were going to move on to another hotel but we checked the Crown Plaza down the street and the water there, while slightly better, was still a problem. So we ended up staying at the Grande Vista except for the end of our stay. I know we're not crazy. We spent a night in a Holiday Inn Express in Tampa and the water was fine and later, moved on to the Crown Plaza in Orlando by the airport and the water there was fine as well. the only other time I smelled water like this was at a hotel in Mexico. As far as the other aspects of the stay, we stayed in a two bedroom villa. The rooms were very nice, the size of the rooms was generous, the furniture was in very good condition, the fact that there were two bedrooms was great and in general the grounds were also very well kept. It was a little older and a little smaller than the Grand Canyon Villas in Phoenix. The staff, for the most part, were very accomodating. I guess there is this corporate procedure where if you request some service, someone from another department calls you and asks if you were satisfied with the help you requested. I was very impressed with that. The only other criticism, though much more minor was that there seemed to be a lot more leaves, etc. in the pool water than there perhaps should have been. Though they bill this property as a 5 star property, no way is it in that class. I would say it's definitely 3.5 stars to maybe 4 stars.

I went on vacation with my wife, and two children aged 7 and 9 years. We own a Marriott Vacation Club in Palm Desert, CA and traded for this resort. We stayed in the Lido Building with 2 bedrooms. Here's the likes and dislikes of the resort: Likes: Great location. Close to all the resorts, outlet malls and major freeways. However, far enough from the highways so it was quiet. Less than 5 minutes to the SeaWorld ticket counter. Very quiet in the room. Many times at timeshares, it can be very noisy. However, we rarely heard our upstair neighbor or noise from people outside. Since we were close to SeaWorld and other resorts, you can easily hear and see the fireworks around 9 pm to 10 pm. Good size - about 1500 square feet. Full kitchen with flattop stove, microwave and dishwasher. Washer and dryer next to the refrigerator. Two pull out sofas - one in the living room and one in the smaller bedroom. Great HEATED pool at the main site. Water was about 85 degrees. It may seem warm, but the kids stayed in for hours and it was refreshing. Game room, including ping pong, pool and an indoor jungle gym. The jungle gym was great during one of the really rainy afternoon thunderstorms. Fishing and boat rides available for rental. Nine-hole Nick Faldo Golf Course on site. Decent workout room with ellipticals, treadmills, free weights and steppers. Dislikes: We obviously did not receive one of the newer rooms. There was a significant amount of mold in the air and visible mold on the baseboards, vent and parts of the shower tiling in the main bathroom. The main shower water control was not intact. The shower was not dirty, but it was not as clean as it could be. When we checked in, we our DVD player was not working correctly. However, they fixed it immediately. Then we found out we were missing the remote control. We did not have pool towels in the suite, but they promptly sent us towels. It may seem like \"petty\" dislikes, but since we have had many positive experiences with the accomodations in Palm Desert, the overall rating is above average and not excellent. However, my kids and wife really enjoyed our stay in Orlando and would return to a \"newer\" building to avoid the \"petty\" things. What we dd: We went to Busch Gardens in Tampa -- about 75 minutes from the resort. My kids and I had a fun time there. SheiKra and Kumba are worth the wait if you like rollercoasters. My daughter and wife saw all the animals while my son and I rode the coasters. Get the 2 day pass and save some money. We went to Cocoa Beach and watched the Space Shuttle take off from Cape Kennedy. The water was warm -- about 85 degrees with fun waves. We experienced a lot of kelp on the beach and in the water. However, a local stated this was unusual. We went to Lori Fischer Park in Cocoa Beach. We went to SeaWorld and enjoyed the Believe Show. We also really enjoyed all the animal displays and really spent our time with the animals and not with any rides. Believe it or not, we did NOT go to Disney. We use to live in LA and spent many days at Disneyland. However, if you do Busch Garden and SeaWorld, you probably don't have to do Disney's Animal Kingdom. You can definintely get all that at Busch and SeaWorld. We didn't do any water parks because my kids wanted to swim at the resort hotel. We went to Downtown Disney to buy my wife a new Mickey tee-shirt. I have never be fan of the So. Cal. Downtown Disney and can't say I'm a fan for the Orlando one either. There are many other places for you to shop in Orlando, such as the Orlando Premium Outlet Mall. However, my wife found a tee-shirt she liked, so I'm happy.

We stayed in an efficiency unit which was purchased on Ebay. My thoughts are mixed. The grounds are beautiful. The two pool areas are fantastic. There is all kinds of stuff to do without ever going to a theme park. They have tennis courts with rackets for rent for $2.50. Paddle boats for rent. Basketball court with complimentary basketball. Fishing poles for rent. Bicycles for rent. A gameroom with pool table and air hockey table. A small, for this size property, but very capable fitness facility. A play area for little ones that is indoor and nice. They have activities scheduled throughout the day including daily lessons at the Faldo Golf Institute. On a macro level, the property was great. However, we had enough complaints that I couldn't give it an excellent rating. When we arrived, the check-in facility was packed and pretty much stayed that way most of the time. For a property the size of this property, and this being such a busy weekend, I couldn't understand why they were so poorly staffed. The same was true with the concierge. After checking in, I went straight to the concierge desk to buy tickets to theme parks. The concierge desk was staffed by two people--one to do the concierge work, the other to offer discounted tickets if you scheduled a timeshare presentation. The problem was, it takes no time to schedule someone for a timeshare presentation, so you had this long line at the concierge desk with one person working and the other just standing there. We were put in one of the older units. I didn't understand this as you would think that if you were trying to show off your property to potential timeshare buyers, you would give them your best rooms. Our room was sorry. It was clean and well furnished, free of bugs and any foul odors. But, it had formica countertops and $20 faucets. I thought the whole property outside of the landscaping and pools looked more like a La Quinta than a Marriott. Staying in an efficiency was a bad idea. The room was too cramped to have never had maid service as our dirty towels kept piling up and piling up as did our trash. Even after asking for maid service, the front desk never bothered to inform us that we could leave our trash and our towels outside the door for pickup (Which we found out later when we complained). Also, you get messages throughout the day as to activities taking place on the property. So, after spending the day at a theme park, you come back and find you have a message waiting. You go out to eat in the evening and find a message waiting. This can be annoying when you are expecting a message from home as we were and kept having to check the message system and wade through the property's messages of the latest goings on at the pool or the golf course. We did the timeshare presentation and it was no pressure. In fact, we will give serious consideration to the purchase of a Marriott timeshare at this resort. There are timeshares everywhere in this area. When we first arrived, I was regretting not staying at the Hilton up the street as it looks much nicer. However, this is the only timeshare resort in the area that is set off well from the main road and had such beautiful grounds. The location is excellent.

The first thing that you'll notice driving in is that the resort is more like a condo village than a hotel. People zip around on golf carts and there are several large clusters of time-share condos. This gated condo resort is well back from the main road which give it an exclusive feeling. We were greeted at the desk by very friendly and well trained hotel staff but had to wait for our room even though it was 5 PM. Even so, we were very impressed with our spacious suite complete with tasteful furnishings, a full kitchen, hot tub and washer/dryer. It is basically a small apartment. The reason this resort ranks as a five-star (in my opinion) is that you really never have to leave the premises to enjoy your vacation! There are several nice pools, a man-made beach, a very nice golf course, bikes and paddle boats for rent, a kiddie climbing maze, a big game room, several bars, and a small store. We found the other guests to be very friendly and always had a smile for our small children as they ran across the bridge over the lake that serves as the scenic backdrop for the resort. Our oldest son (age 6) decided that one day at the overwhelmingly crowded Disney World was enough so we spent the next 3 days at the resort. The timeshare pressure is there but it is not obnoxious. Probably the best feature is that the resort was totally sold out and it seemed busy but not crowded.

The unit assigned to us was a two-bedroom condo located on 4th floor in Building Number 85 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christobal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd facing the lake. MGV is a timeshare property rather than a regular hotel, so our unit is equipped with a full kitchen (with tableware and cookware), living room, dining area, and washer/dryer. Our party consists of four adults and one two-year-old child. During our trip, we encountered Tropical Storm Alberto and it rained heavily at times for a couple of days. We utlized the kitchen to make a few meals together and played some games in the living room. If we have stayed in a regular hotel room, it would not be possible. Our experience with MGV was positive on the whole with a minor annoyance as described as follows. 1. Location: MGV is located next to a golf course on International Drive. It is 12 miles away from Walt Disney World and right next to Sea World. We tried both I-4 and State Route 536 to get to Disney. We would recommend State Route 536 since it is more straight-forward (just two turns) and faster (never congested). 2. Check-In and Check-Out: Both went very smoothly. It took us less than five minutes to check in and one minute to check out. Since the check-in time was 4pm and we arrived at 12pm, the room was not ready. The staff helped us store our bottled water and apple juice that we bought at local supermarket. When we returned to the hotel close to mid-night, the bell service personnel retrieved all the stuffs for us. We were pleasantly surprised that they have put the apple juice in the refrigerator although it was not necessary. 3. Rooms: The rooms were equipped with nice furniture and screened-in balcony. The rooms, especially the guest bedroom, were a little bit smaller compared to other Marriott timeshare properties we have stayed before, but they were still spacious enough for five of us. The rooms look clean as the building is new. However, while I was busy putting the stuffs into the refrigerator right after we first got into the room, I heard my wife calling for help in the master bathroom. There was a two-inch long cockroach in the shower stall. I killed it with my shoe. Three days later, my wife found another one in the closet, but this time it got away. I placed a phone call to the front desk. The staff apologized immediately and asked us whether we want to change to another room. Since I knew that our room probably was located in the best section of the entire hotel, I declined. Then the staff told me that she would tell the maintenance department to spray the room. I did not really know if indeed anything has been done, but we did not encounter another bug problem inside the rooms. Since the main purpose of this trip was to attend a conference, I also went to Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Contemporary Resort. I saw a two-inch cockroach crawling on the floor just outside the convention area. So I guess bug is a common issue in Orlando during the summer season. 4. Maid Services: Since we exchanged our stay from one of the timeshare we own rather than paying for it, we did not receive daily maid services, which was a standard practice in timeshare industry. However, we did place a phone call asking for fresh towels while we were in Magic Kingdom. When we got back to our rooms, a pile of towels was placed on our couch with a note telling us if we need anything else, just give them a call. 5. Facilities: There were a few swimming pools, whirlpool spas, paddle boat/bike rental, lighthouse bar, a couple of restaurants, convenience store \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Market Place\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and Activities Center on site. There were many planned activities such as fishing competition, paddle boat racing, etc. We did not use any of these facilities as we spent most of our time in Disney except one morning my wife brought our daughter to the playroom, and she has lots of fun there. 6. Noise: We did not notice any noise from the construction of the two more buildings at Grande Vista. 7. Wireless Internet Access: MGV offers free wireless Internet access. The connection was excellent throughout our stay. We would go back to Grande Vista and recommend it to others. We also have taken some photos.

The pools were nice and well located throughout the property although I must say that the maintenance on the pools were lacking. There were always an abundance of bugs and critters swilling about to make you swin the other direction. The service on the other hand was greatly lacking. After reporting that a soap dish in the shower was broken and that there were jagged edges apparent, the maintenance staff never made an appearance. The first trip to the bar, they were \"out\" of wanted items. There was plenty of time to ask to see the sales pitch, but no time to do other things. The rooms have a dust pan and no broom. The staff is polite, but could care less about you. We asked to obtain a volleyball to play on the beach and the staff member advised us that the one ball they had was checked out and they had no idea where it was. It surprised me that a resort of this size and caliber, had only one ball. Everything had a charge to go with it, kinds of makes me wonder why someone would pay for ownership, and what comes with it. Come on folks $6.00 to rent a fishing pole is ridiculous. The final straw for me was on Friday night I purchased a beer in a souvenier glass at ne bar, and when we decided to sit by a pool near the other bar I attempted to have it refilled, and the bartender told be they had no beer, and had none all day. It is Friday night and a bar has no beer, and none all day. The lack of attention to this type of detail is inexcusible. I did make a call to managment and spoke with Mr. Mullin who was wonderful to talk to and could not apologize enough. I had the true feeling that he would immediately recitfy the problems mentioned so that other guests would not have to deal with it.

Our stay was very enjoyable. I made a special request for a room, and the staff did everything they could to accommodate this. Everyone was very friendly during check-in. I called to ask for the free starter pack of coffee and some extra towels on our second day, and two people showed up within an hour, one with towels and one with the coffee!!! The concierge was helpful in giving us information about restaurants- he even made a reservation for us, and gave us a coupon for a free drink. To me, the accommodations here were great. There is a new pool and and bar/restaurant called copa loco. THey have decent food and you can get a drink right by the pool, with waitresses walking around right to your chair to bring your drink/food order as you sit in the sun. There is a heated pool and one for kids. Then you walk across a beautiful bridge and go to the old pool. It is nice as well. Over here, you have a lady sitting selling drinks in a large wooden coconut-shaped souvenir, or beer on tap, as well as hairbraiding. The marketplace store is right there, with snacks and suntan lotion, etc. Beside this is a pizza shop. The man made lake, with the bridge, is really nice. You can rent paddle boats shaped like ducks or swans for ten dollars for a half an hour. There is enough in this resort that you could probably stay here the whole week and not even go anywhere! You could swim, get a massage, rent a paddle boat, fish, eat at one of three places, shop in the marketplace, etc. There is a great ambience to the whole place. We were in building 85, near the new pool, but any building you stay in would be okay. The resort is set off from a highway, so there isn't much noise. They are constructing two new buildings, but there was nothing loud going on while we were there, even in the day. The location is beautiful, and all the buildings are in good shape and look like spanish villas. Building 85 did have some elevator problems. I read all the reviews to this place, and what I say to these is that some people will have problems with anything. I think if you are courteous and decent when making your requests and dealing with the staff, they will treat you the same way. I found that anything they could do to help they were willing to do. I didn't see inside all the rooms, so I don't know what the condition would be of those. However, our room was quite nice. We had an efficiency, and it had enough room for two of us. There was a bed, sofa, and ample closet space, as well as refrigerator and microwave. When I saw the pictures online, I thought it would be s maller than it was. I was pleasantly surprised. The greatest thing is that each room has a balcony. This was quite enjoyable. Here are some other tips about orlando- The shark restaurant in seaworld is really nice, with a great view from any table, however I had some problems getting my steak cooked medium well. They did apologize and try to remedy the situation. Also, the restaurant at downtown disney called fulton's crabhouse is supposed to be incredible. The food was very pricey, and they tried twice to cook my steak medium well- once it was burnt and the next time it was medium at best. The waiter was also somewhat rude. The manager did deal with this and deeply apologize. I tend to have bad luck with steaks on vacation- maybe try something else on the menu. At epcot in disney- get a fast pass and go back to the rides that have along line- just go to the entrance of the ride and do the fast pass. If you are going to seaworld or busch gardens- join southwest(--) rapid rewards- you can get a card and it entitles you to 20% discount to each park!!!! Or, buy at least seven days in advance on their websites to save $6 per ticket. There is also a combo ticket for $95 on some websites. If you go to Kennedy Space Center, plan to have all day available. We went at noon and had trouble seeing everything.

I was traveling with a group of 10 - 7 adults, 3 children ages 3,4,5. We came a long way to stay at this resort and I have been reading the past reviews hoping I would have a positive experience. I requested in advance for a refurbished room however, Maggie at room control said the new refurbed rooms are reserved for Marriott timeshare owners. We were assigned to the Lago building, 4th floor. The 2 bedrooms were nice however the 3rd bedroom had an odor of mildew/mold. The appliances/tableware were dated, the kitchen floor & fridge was sticky, the dirt was visible in the grout in all the restrooms, and the tub drain in the 2nd bath was rusted. During our first 2 nights, cockroaches were discovered on the floor of our villa. At this point, I went to the registration and requested that we move to another building. They could not accomodate another 3B/3B in a newer unit, so our party seperated to 2 different buildings, Ibiza and Magellan. The two newer units were definitely nicer, new appliances/tableware, cleaner, without any odor. The overall ground of the property was really nice. There are many activities on the property for the entire family. While the kids were swimming, I went for a massage. The one hour swedish massage I had was not worth $85. The massage room was in the workout facility so while I was getting my treatment, I could hear the treadmills and music in the next room. Another disappointing factor was the lack of parking. If you arrived late night, you were lucky to find parking near your building. The Marketplace had everything you could possibly imagine, Krispy Kreme donuts and Pizza Hut at reasonable prices.

It was also within walking distance of Nick's Grill. The villa was absolutely lovely. It had a full kitchen, with full sized appliances. The furniture was very pretty, and in excellent shape. The master bedroom had a huge king sized bed, with sliding glass doors onto a large balcony. The balcony held a table for 4, and even had a ceiling fan. Some of the balconys are screened in, but ours was not. The master bedroon had a huge jacuzzi tub.

The Copa Loca Grill was good, standard grill type food. Burgers, chicken fingers, sandwiches, etc. They also have a bar here which serves the yummiest frozen drinks! Try the raspberry chocolate frozen mudslide, and their signature frozen drink as well. You won't be disappointed. My kids loved the frozen Chocolate Monkeys! We did eat at Nicks for dinner one night. Maybe because the prices were so high, I was expecting alot, but the food was pretty blah. Not worth the prices for sure, but it's a nice place.

It's really a reasonable rate, considering that even the smallest guest rooms are very spacious, with a large queen size bed, full size sofa, and kitchenette area. The beds have down pillows and some have down featherbeds. In terms of decor, the Grande Vista is perfect for romantics or families... My husband and I are actually on our honeymoon, and the Grande Vista has been perfect for us! There's no ugly 80's decor here. Everything in the rooms is very clean, and it's nice to have the mini-fridge for storing wine coolers or what have you. Hubby and I decided not to go the Disney route in Orlando, so it was really nice to be at the Grande Vista. We had plenty of stuff to do. Our first night here, we grabbed our swimsuits and went to the Copa Loca grill and bar area. The food at the grill was pretty good... I recommend the coconut fried shrimp. The mixed drinks were DELICIOUS. It was so relaxing to swim all evening in either the spa or heated pool and to sip pina coladas. When we decided to return to our room, we walked the grounds and saw tons of lizards, frogs, and even an armadillo! It's in a beautiful area with lush grounds, and it was really neat to see so much life. We did not see an abundance of insects, thankfully.

The connection is very fast, and we've been able to upload our pictures to show our friends and family our vacation. There are only a few tiny negatives about the Grande Vista; like other reviewers have said, you must bring your own conditioner and lotion, because the resort does not provide these. Also, breakfast is not included, and their shop the Marketplace doesn't offer all too many healthy options. During this particular stay we have had some rather noisy neighbors, but they aren't so noisy as to make us alert the resort staff. The check out time is 10am and the resort staff knocked on our door at 8:30am to make sure we were awake; that may have been a problem if we weren't awake already.

Good selection of alchoholic and non-alchoholic beverages in a large cooler. Free bags of ice, as well. The Grande Vista is located off International Drive, so it is centrally located to all parks.

As a Marriott owner at Village I'sle de France near Paris France my wife myself and 2 daughters (8 and 7) exchanged our week and arranged 2 weeks at beginning of April 2006. I can't say enough about the resort. Arrived on the first day and checked in at 11.30 am. I know others have had problems on this but arrive early and take the chance of getting in early - don't get uptight and stressed if you can't - chill around the pool !!!!!!!!. We had unpacked looked around , stocked up at Publix just down the road and were in Seaworld by 4 PM. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! . We did have a coupe of odd first days and ended up swapping rooms as we had a couple of maintenaance problesm with the first one ( no blackouts in Kids room - they woke at 05.30 am !!), flyscreen missing and that it was on ground floor with no sun - made it a bit chilly early evening. Changing rooms was no problem - reception staff were extremely keen to help and there was no problem in chnaging. Help was offered but we were so keen to move we just got on and did it. Had a fab room in the main bulding on the 3 rd floor overlooking the main pool area which was great. I have to say that for guests from the UK or Europe the resort is fantastic. Most people from Europe come for Disney / Seaworld/Universal and Busch Gardens so Grande Vista provides a home away from home, away from the hustle and bustle of I-Drive in what is 5 start surroundings sngd yert close to Disney and Seaworld - a great place to sleep in before hitting theparks, relaxing round the pool before hitting theparks in the afternoon / evening and generally just relaxing in. We spent 3 happy days in the 2 weeks just relaxing round the pool in the sun - the kids loved the pool and spent a lot of the time in it.The film around the pool from 8pm on Thursday was excellent - beer and popcorn for the adults while the kids swam was great!!!!!. Did find it strange people claiming sun loungers and s[pots around the pool very early in the day before turning up at 10 or 11 am Facilities onsight are good as are the two bed apartments - what more do you want on holiday?. Only slight criticism is the lack of daily housekeeping - this is standard in the 4 vacation club resorts in Europe. With young kids it was great having the full kitchen - kids are fussy eaters and just being able to feed them cheaply, easily and quickly helped - on days out breakfast was easy before hitting attractions. Onsite facilities are great - Marketplace, pedal boats, bikes (although more are needed as you need to wait a bit) Pizza Hut, gym, sauna, indoor kids play area. etc. Only really checked them out rather than using them all - spent time out and about really. One thing to note - prices are very reasonable - from Starbucks coffee in the marketplace to frozen cocktails, kids drinks, and food from the Copa Loca bar - all very good. If you want somewhere that is away from the hustkle and bustle, somewhere that you can return to after hectic days out and relax and recover ( with all the facilities ) go here - Grande Vista certainly lives up to its name !!!!

We stayed in the lock-out unit attached to the main 2 bedroom unit that my sister and husband and their children (ages 3,5,& 7) shared. They are owners. We all had a fabulous time. The room was very beautiful with hardwood cabinentry and granite countertops and nicely decorated. Because we had a two bedroom and the attached lock-out, we had two balconies. The corner balcony had a table with four chairs. Ours had two chairs. We looked out over the Copa Loca pool area. This area had two pools, a child's play area with shootable water cannons and fountain sprinklers, a baby pool and two 18 person hot-tubs. There are 3 additional pools in the resort but we really didn't venture too much. We went to the main pool one day for a few hours as some of the kids wanted to get hair-wraps and air-brushed tattoos. We loved being at the Copa Loca pool area. First of all, their are pleny of lounge chairs for everyone. It wasn't a problem finding a few together anytime of the day. There also is a poolside bar and restaurant at this pool (which we fully took advantage of.) I thought the food and drinks would have been expensive and was very happily surprised to find out this wasn't the case. A large hotdog and fries was $4.75 and a chicken finger platter with 3 large breast meat chicken tenders and fries was $5.50. We actually could share the chicken tender meal among a couple of kids. This is like McDonalds prices. Sodas were $2.00 and included one free refill. The \"drinks\" were all made with top-shelf liquor and were 12 oz each. The first frozen drink is $8.00 and includes a souvineer glass, each refill during your stay is $6.00. Double drinks were $2.00 more. Beers were $4.00. They also offer kids virgin drinks, chocolate monkey, strawberry surprise and virgin daquiris for $5.00 but if you ask they will put the kids drink into two smaller cups, which we found to be just fine for the smaller ones. We went to the local walmart (not far) and got two rafts and two blow-up toys for the kids. They were a big hit and I have to admit, I loved floating some of the afternoon away on occassion. (buy ahead and pack or go when you get there) Our weather was in 85-92 degree range all week. Just wonderful! We got some groceries and beer at the Publix which is right down the street. Warning, don't buy too much. We bought extra loaves of bread and kept them in the freezer so that they were fresh and we didn't need to make another trip. They do have a store called the Marketplace onsite and the prices again aren't too high, but not as good as the grocery store. It is like a little Walmart, with groceries, sunglasses, towels, cigarettes, wine and just about anything you might need. I believe they also serve breakfast sandwiches, have crispy Kreme donuts and brew Starbucks coffee. Sunglasses were $12.00 - about the same as you'd pay at Walmart. We spent the mornings at the pool and went to Universal/Islands of Adventure in the afternoons or just went exploring the Orlando area. My kids did this thing called the SlingShot on INternation Blvd. They loved it. It is kind of like a reverse bungee jump. It pulls you below ground and slings you 385 ft at 100 miles per hour. You can get a DVD of you riding it. Two people go together. They had a ball and we got the DVD. I would reccommend it for the adventurous! It normally cost $25 per person, the DVD is $20. They have a special that includes two riders, two (nice) Tshirts and the DVD for $75.00. A great time! Evenings at Grande Vista always have activities. There was a solo guitar guy, a steel drum band and Karoke at our pool during our stay. These events are from 6-9pm or 7-9pm so that if your not into that sort of thing the noise is over by bedtime. There were also events at other pools on different nights. Pool area is open till 11:00 each night. I went for a dip in the hottub at 10:30 one night. So relaxing! The staff was very nice and professional. The grounds were well beautiful and clean. A few other things to mention. Towels: They provide shower and pool towels. If you want a fresh set delivered, just call housekeeping. Dishwasher detergent is provided. The pizza hut delivery was very good. Medium pizza are $12.99 each. What a bargain!

We have not had a chance to golf here yet, but the course is beautiful! Maybe next year! This resort is close to every attraction! Ten to fifteen minutes to Univeral Studios and Disney World. Sea World is almost within walking distance. We really enjoyed the villa because we were able to eat breakfast in and prepare sandwiches to take by the pool. This is a great way to save a little $ and still be able to eat dinner out. The staff here are VERY friendly and helpful! We were locked out of our studio part of our villa and the staff was there within 3 minutes to let us back in! We were contacted shortly after registration to go to the timeshare presentation.

However, due to falsehoods told to us about the resort's accomodations (or lack thereof!!) we immediately knew we'd be back here! We highly recommend setting some time aside for a massage. It was reassuring to have the same masseuse two years in a row, as it shows they value their employees and they want to stay. Can't wait to see if I'll receive the same wonderful massage this year!

The room's decor looks like it had been refurbished but in the core areas, such as the bathroom, it did not look like it was gutted and refurbished. The tub leaked when you take a shower the bath mat on the floor got saturated- not for lack of my closing the curtain - there was a leak in the tile grout which poured water out when you showered- I notified them of this condition after our first use- someone came in (while we were out) and looked like they caulked around the tub but this did not fix the problem. The bathroom floor showed the many months/years of leakage as there were water stains in the corners and up the wall. It was not as clean as I expect a 4-5 star resort to be - As evidenced by the bathroom door which had a dozen or so hairs from previous guests sort of \"glued on\" with various layers of hairspray-funk. The room did not smell fresh and clean. We asked for towels every day(you have to call and ask) and were promptly acommodated. I guess the worst part of staying in the studio unit is the fact that the room ajoins a larger unit and is only blocked by a double door.

We crossed a walking bridge over the lake to go to the main lobby, MarketPlace grocery store (a convenience store that also serves hot coffee and pastries), the on site Pizza Hut/ Edy's ice cream (across the courtyard from the store), indoor childrens Play Maze, video game room and fitness room...all a 3 or 4 mintue walk from our building....a daily newspaper was delivered to our door daily (USA Today), which was nice (except on weekends) The villa was not quite as big in the living/dining area as the Grande Ocean, but I was very impressed with the guest lock-out suite, which was even larger than the master suite...it had a little kitchenette and a private separate entrance, bath and nice sitting area with queen sleeper sofa, table and chairs and private balcony. The living room also had a queen sleeper sofa and housed drawers in the armoire where the tv was in there...the master had a large circular balcony....ours was not screened...some were....a large jacuzzi tub for 2 with a granite counter/vanity area and wall mounted hair dryer across from the tub area...private bath with 2 doors...one to the entry hall...double sinks and shower...very spacious...the beds were very comfy foam...both king sized...kitchen was great too...nice granite counter with 3 bar chairs...washer/dryer in a closet...they provide you with little bottles of dish soap and powder for dishwasher, sponge, paper towels and coffee samples and enough Tide for one wash load. If you exit the resort and turn left...go a mile...there is a nice Publix and Walgreens in a strip mall...Subway and Chinese takeout here as well...Disney parks are just a few miles further past the Marriott World Center...if you turn right exiting the resort, Sea World is only a stop light away, and the Convention Center and Peabody Hotel a bit further. (that's the hotel where the ducks walk through the lobby each day). Best overall ride at Disney right now: \"Soarin\" over Califoria...located in Epcot in The land...kids will love it too....you really feel like you are flying like an eagle..over the state. Most fun restaurant: Rain Forest Cafe in Animal Kingdom best production show: Lion King in Animal Kingdom tip: when going to Magic Kingdom with small kids, go to Fantasy Land FIRST...it fills up by 11:30....and lines can be long....from 9-10 is the best time. Try to leave Magic Kingdom before park closes...it is a hassle to get on Monorail or boats to parking lot late at night...unless you are very patient... We plan to stay at the Grande Vista next year again, when we go to the Builders Show, if possible...my 2nd choice would be Cypress Harbour, as it is in same general area and has similar amenities...got very good reviews...but get a refurbished unit ...those villas are even larger in the main living areas, but does not have the lockout feature. We caught a glimpse of Marriott Horizons when going down I-4...it is very close to the freeway and in a congested area...I would not want to stay there.....International Drive is a much more tranquil area... All in all, we were very happy with this trip.", "Date": "January 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely Stay again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4309815", "Content": "Our family returned from a Saturday-Saturday stay at the Marriott's Grande Vista in Mid-November. I had read the TripAdvisor reviews religiously and wanted to add our experience as well. After spending most of the day at Epcot we arrived at the Grand Vista at around 4:30 on Saturday. No lines, no waiting at check-in. Gentlemen that checked us in was VERY nice. I told him I had called a few days before with requests (although I somehow don't think those request were ever recorded). He gave me 2 options. A 2 bedroom that is close to the Original pool and 'village' area (Magellan building), this would be an 'older' unit that had been refurbished within the last 2 years. OR a new unit in a building (Ibiza) that would be about a 3 minute walk to the 'new' pool that has a better kids play area, Ibiza also supposedly has flat screen TV's and graninte counter tops etc. I let the family decide and they wanted to be closer to the village area so we ended up on the 2nd floor of the Magellan building. This was an 'older' unit but we found it to be nice and perfectly adequate for our family of 6. (After the fact..I do think either would have been perfectly acceptable to us.) It had the 'lockout' suite as one bedroom. So we had a kitchen area, dining area and living area in one room. The Master bedroom with a large jacuzzi tub and separate sink area. Master bath had glass shower and sink. (Hairdryers in both bathrooms worked great.) The 'kids' bedroom (lockout) also had a mini kitchenette area with fridge, cabinets, sink. A regular bathroom. An open balcony area of this room. There was also a little screen porch area off the master bedroom and also access to this through the living room. Washer & Dryer in the kitchen area in a closet. (Used this a lot...so nice to have this!) There was some minor wear and tear...some dings on the fridge and some rusting type spots on the inside of the microwave. Two pillows on the couch had some minor fringing. There was a dent in the drawer at the bottom of the stove. The TV's reception in the living room and the kids bedroom wasn't as good as could be. We never ended up calling them on it though as we just didn't spend that much time there and I forgot all about it. We found the beds to be very comfortable. And throughout our stay we did NOT hear one single noise from above us or next to us. We took them up on their time share offer of $100 (we took them in Disney Dollars) to take the tour one morning. We found it to be pretty low pressure. It does seem like a pretty good deal for our family. For about what we pay to stay in a 'dumpy' little cabin up in Maine we could stay in locations that are much nicer and have all the amenities we want. We did not buy..but we may sometime down the line. We felt the sales rep got a teensy bit abrupt with us at the end because we didn't sign. But he wished us well and we had no problem getting the Disney dollars. We did stay for the 90 minutes..it seemed to go by quickly. (BTW..they were offering us a resale at Cypress Gardens for $13,900 with like 12.9% financing. I picked up a flyer at the Publix Grocery store a few days later with resales in the same are for 8-$11K...don't know what the difference is.) I definitely think we would lean towards Marriott if we did purchase a time share. As we are probably not the Disney-every-year types..if we were than I definitely would look into the DVC program. The pools were very nice. We did find ourselves walking over the bridge to the 'new' pool with the water cannons though. It seemed warmer than the pool we were closest to. It wasn't a bad walk though...2 or 3 minutes. There is a bar area and hot tubs/spas near both pools. At the old pool area there is also a lap pool with handicap access...a few large 'spa/hot tubs' and a sauna. After we arrived the kids wanted to spend the next day just at the resort (and this was our first time down to Disney with them...LOL.). There is also a children's indoor playground area. Climbing structure type thing like what is in a Chuck E Cheese. We were there about 9pm, only a few other kids and my kids had a blast in it. Also is a sandy beach area with volleyball nets. Basketball area/tennis area. Golf of course. They offer some daily activities..some for a fee..some not. We did not partake in these as our week was full with Disney stuff. There is a little Pizza Hut onsite as well as a small store. Oh and arcade area and pool tables. We did not eat at their restaurant onsite..Nick's. We would definitely stay there again. We used a family member's timeshare week through Interval International. We only wish we had had more time to just lounge about the resort. Oh...I found it was about 10-15 minutes to get to most Disney parks. Not bad at all. Another nice plus is that they have free wireless internet access. I took my laptop and was able to download my pics and than share 'trip reports' with my family back home. Hubby was able to check in with work. I know a lot of people were looking for names of buildings to request. I took home a map and there are 22 buildings. I won't list them all..but the buildings that are near the pools: Near the Older or 'Village/Actitivities Center and on either side of the Village Pools: #80: Plaza De La Vida (which also houses the front desk area) #81: Marbella #94: Magellan which only has the parking lot and the road way seperating it from the pool/village area. (We stayed in this and were very happy with location.) The next two are on either side of the 'new' pool that have the water cannons and the gradual entry with water sprinkler type things for the kids. Pool water seemed warmer here. #79: Madrid #84: Alicante #85: Christobal is on the other side of Alicante and is not a bad walk to the new pool area too. There are some other more 'quiet' pool areas. I did not see these pools so I don't know what the pools are like. Our week was pretty quiet...plenty of chairs and not too hectic around the pools at all. Now if I can figure out pictures..I will post them.

We also ate at the hotel restaurant and though it's pricey, the food is great! the grounds were beautiful and hidden from the major roads by the woods.

We stayed in an efficiency which meant one king bed and a pull out sofa, a microwave, small refrigerator and one bath and small patio. Our location was right by the pool on the 1st floor. Good location but the room smelled musty - due primarily to the humidity. I checked another 1st floor room and smelled the same. They brought in a large air cleaning machine that helped but, humidity in carpet etc. is hard to deal with. The pool area was very nice with a sprinkler fountain and pool for smaller children.

After we purchased DVC we tried to tell Marriott we were not interested but they insisted on charging us $200 to cancel. So we went for the package and the presentation. The sales person at the presentation was horrible, rude, and belittled me out of the presence of my husband, but that is a review I will post on the TUG web site. Needless to say we are happy with our DVC purchase and would not consider a purchase here. That said, we would definately stay here again if the price is right. On the presentation package you get maid service daily, plus USA Today McPaper delivered to your door. The 1 bedroom unit was spacious, was recently renovated, had new furniture, a sofa bed that was actually pretty comfortable, a comfy bed, washer/dryer and, because it was on the 1st floor, a screened in porch. The washer/dryer worked well but was the small, apartment sized version. Certainly not big enough to do wash for 8 people (which I would have had if we had the lockout next door). It was also reasonably clean. The grounds are massive with 2 massive but nice pool areas. The pool areas are very Marriott, and remind me of the pool at the Marriott San Juan where we stayed 2 years ago. My kids were not happy that there was no water slide. There was lots of family activities day and night, but my kids were not interested in going to them at all. The kids really did not like the resort because I think they were expecting that \"Disney Magic\" but there isn't any here. The grounds are immense but sterile. The buildings all look the same. Landscaping is ok but nothing out of the ordinary. The bathrooms in the unit, though nice, are very bland like \"Courtyard by Marriott\" decor. Services at the hotel are limited. There are bell services but you have to \"find\" someone to help you. We prefer to stay in a resort with some hotel services (bell services, room service etc) like Disney offers. The apartment type lifestyle here is just not for us. Bugs are a problem here. When we first looked into our unit we were greeted by a dead roach just inside the door. One night, I woke my husband up to kill a bug the size of a field mouse in the bathroom(he called it a palmetto bug, I called it a huge roach). Also, though renovated, the unit was not in terrific condition. Dishes were not very clean. The stove was rusted on the bottom and the microwave was rusted as well. The countertop is formica and was peeling. If you go on the tour they show you a spiffy unit with granite countertops and nice cabinets. People wanting to stay here should know that is not necessarily what you will get in your room. It is only about 10-15 minutes to Epcot or MGM, a little further to Disney Magic Kingdom if you take I-drive. Traffic to Disney and back was never a problem. We spent all our time at the Disney parks because the kids did not want to use the facilities here. Again, I would stress I think Marriott provides a good product and this is a nice resort.

This was our second stay at the Grande Vista. We came to the realization on this trip that this resort just isn't for us. The Disney Resorts are just so superior. We are Disney Vacation Club members and we usually stay at Disney Resorts Sunday to Thursday using the cheap points for midweek stays. We then spend the weekends at a cheap cash resort. That is right, Grande Vista is cheap to stay on cash and you get the daily maid service. WHY WOULD ANYONE BUY INTO THIS RESORT? The first time here we paid $169 for a 2 bedroom and this time we paid $229 for a 2 bedroom. Do you know how long the break even point would be to cover the buy in and the annual dues at this place? Trading power here is minimal as well because there are so many places to stay in Orlando. If considering Marriott Vacation Club ( which is a good program by the way) look at Aruba or Hawaii. This gives you the ultimate trading power as well as a good home resort. Marriott is practically giving the rooms away and I can get a reservation here anytime even last minute. Try getting a Disney 2 bedroom for less than $500 ANY SEASON. Try getting a reservation to begin with. Marriott just misses the little things that add sooooooo much to your vacation experience. First, where is the waterslide? Well there isn't one. The pools are very boring and not that imaginative. They do have a splash area for kids but these don't appear to be big hits with the kids. Adults and kids alike would get so much enjoyment from the slides. We love the slides at the Disney Resorts and my son gets hours of enjoyment out of them. Second, Marriott does not heat the pools. The splash area pool on the side with the restaurant is FREEZING. THe upper section here was better but still cold. The pool on the other side was freezing as well. How can the pools be freezing when it is 90+ degrees every day? Disney heats there pools and they are always a comfortable 84 degrees, even in January. You just can't put a price tag on comfortable swimming water. Marriott seems to have few people swimming because the water is so cold. I'd hate to feel them in January. What good is a pool if the guests aren't enjoying them. Marriott seems to be into appearances. Things look nice but it doesn't add up to an enjoyabel stay. Grande Vista isn't the only Marriott we've found to be this way. Virginia Beach the water was freezing as welll as the Marriott Ocean Club in Aruba. HEAT THE POOL PLEASE. Last but not least the service at the Dsiney Resorts blows away the Marriott. I will say service has improved at the Grande Vista since our last visit in May 2005. The Pizza Hut guys and the store employees are still terrible. They are slow, dumb and not friendly. Many staff members were friendly this stay including the activities people and the bartenders. Another bummer here is the shear size of this resort. Marriott seems to keep building. They seem more interested in the almighty buck than maintaining a manageable resort. We had to drive to the pools each day we were so far out. This was after requesting main building. Who wants to drive on vacation, especially within there own resort? The room was dated and very worn as well. Total opposite of the newly refurbished room we had here last time. This resort is gorgeous and has so much potential. It just doesn't have that magic we seek on vacation. No room service, no waterslide, no heated pools all equal not returning for us. We wil \"spend\" the high points and stick with our wonderful Disney Resorts from now on. If anything this just showed us once again how good we have it with DVC.

Their were three employees at the desk, with 15 people in line! Many people were rude and cut the line, which the employees seemed to \"look the other way\". We were in Building 83, and the room needed some upgrading. Plenty of space with screened in balcony, but decor was dated. The property was very nice, and the pools were great. At the main pool area, there was a lap pool, children's pool, two jacuzzis, and a sauna. The restaurant Nick's located at the golf center was very good, and pricing was reasonable. The concierge was very helpful with dining reservations and park information. They signed us up for a timeshare presentation, however they sent us to Horizons, another Marriott Vacation Club about 5 minutes away because their breakfast was full. We didn't have much of an intetion of buying, but went for the $200 DISNEY DOLLARS, if you're a renter (meaning you don't own a Marriott timeshare, be sure to get your $200 in Disney or Marriott Money), they try to give you $100!! Horizons is brand new, and much nicer than the Grande Vista. It features a high-end miniature golf course, pools with play areas, and all the amenities of home. Horizons is only 15% completed. The total number of rooms is expected to be capped at 700, much smaller than Grande Vista's 1600. We ended up buying a timeshare at Horizons. Given we live in California, we don't get to Orlando more than about once every 5 years. We prefer Hawaii and other destinations. With Marriott Vacation Club, you can trade very easily.

One major downside was that our flight arrive in Orlando at 9am, which left us with several hours to kill before the 4p check-in. A very sweet young lady at the front desk had mercy on us and let us check in around 2-3p. I had called twice to ask for a refurbished/new building (based on the suggestion from other reviews I read on this site). My husband was convinced that we did not receive one, but given our rush to checkin as early as possible it was a sacrifice I was willing to make. The villa was beautiful and very spacious. More than plenty of room for 2 adults and 3 kids (ages 15, 10, 6). The three tvs were a total blessing. The kitchen was amazing with the granite island/breakfast nook, garbage disposal, dishwasher, full stove and refrigerator. What was really awesome is that the cupboards were full of all necessary appliances, cutlery, place settings, etc!! It was like a little home-away-from-home, rather than a feeling like just a hotel. Our villa was always very clean. I know a lot of people complained about bugs, but we found that came from the front door being left open. This is Florida afterall. My only complaint with housekeeping is that over the 4th of July weekend, the cleaning person was very lax about replacing towels. After the second day of this happening, we had to call the front desk to get things moving. (Our guess is that the folks working the weekend were not the regular staff.) The resort had so many different activities for the family every night. We even received messages on our phone informing us of what was on the agenda and notifying us if there were any changes to the schedule due to the inclimate weather. We LOVED the pools.

Kitchen roll, washing up liquid and a scrubber is provided so you don't need to pick that up at Publix (2 miles away near the Premium Outlets) We were really lucky both times we stayed during our two week holiday (we took some time out for a Bahamas cruise and a trip to Miami. Cruise, amazing, Miami, overrated) We were given refurbished rooms on the requested 4th floor. Once we had a lake view (watch out for the fishermen and the turtle) and once we had a golf view. The houskeeping were excellent and were definately not seen or heard by us!! Which is exactly what you want. A daily newspaper is delivered to your room on weekdays. We got a fantastic rate on findorlandorooms and the hotel were happy for us to book with this website then phone the hotel direct with a booking reference number and make requests such as a pool view, whatever floor or a refurbished room. My husband was very impressed with the TV channels offered as was his brother who lives in Orlando! The rooms have individual thermostats for the air conditioning as well as an overhead fan. Each room has a safe. Each room has a balcony which is something hard to find in Orlando. There are smoking and non-smoking buildings. There are ice machines in two buildings. We never ate at Nick's Grill or Pizza Hut. We ate at the poolside cafe which was excellent and had a few drinks which were reasonably priced. A Denny's is within walkind distance as is Sea World but you will probably drive. I think this hotel is excellent value for money. I also recommend booking a treatment at the Ritz-Carlton Spa. Now that is worth the money. Talk about being pampered. The valet parking is complimentary as is the use of the pool, sauna and jacuzzi. The changing rooms and showers are out of this world, with every product you will need provided including razor and deodourant. If you are having a holiday with your children and want some time alone while they spend the day having some quality time with Dad, trust me, book a massage and spend the day relaxing around this pool being provided with iced towels, cold bottled water and lunch and wine served at your sunbed (reasonably priced).

I didn't charge any incidentals so I had no balance to settle. The property was beautiful. We (2 adults, 2 kids) had a studio (king bed and queen pull-out sofa), and were more than comfortable. There was a screened-in patio, and a kitchenette that was more than sufficient (small fridge, microwave, coffee pot, sink). The bathroom was a nice size. I suggest that you rent a car (we had a van).

We had 3 units in Building 98, the Conquistador, 2nd floor. We had a 2 bedroom, a 1 bedroom, and a studio under 3 separate reservations (I got 2 through Interval International and the studio through a timeshare presentation offer) and they were able to get us all on the same floor in the same building. I did request refurbished rooms and was not disappointed. All units were spacious, clean and nicely, tastefully furnished, although you could tell the bath and kitchen fixtures and tile weren't brand new. Still, they were very nicely maintained, so no complaints. The location we had was perfect: away from the noise of some of the pools so it was quiet, overlooking the golf course, but close enough to a smaller pool to allow a quick dip before dinner. We dined only in our units or at the theme parks, so we did not enjoy the reasonably priced Nick's Grill, but would definitely try it on a next visit. The housekeeping works like this: daily if you are a renting guest, once a week for Marriott owners, and only if you request and pay for it for Interval exchangers. They did bring extra towels or paper towels/toiletries if you ask them to, free of charge, although sometimes it took a while. The resort is absolutely kid-friendly, but doesn't compromise for the adults, either. The kid activities are plenty and many are free, although with our busy schedule of trying to get in all 4 Disney theme parks in one week, we were not able to partake in the resort activities. We did hit the pools- the Vista del Sol pool is definitely a can't miss with the kids, as is the Village Center pool. The pool near our building was a hit with my daughters, 6 and 2, because it was quieter. The true highlight for the kids was the amazing playplace climbing structure- WAY better than a McDonald's or Chuck E Cheese and cleaner, too! The things that looked amazing but we didn't have time for: golfing, tennis, duck and swan paddleboats, four person bicycles, free family photography for guests, aerobics, smore's night. When you check in, they give you a weekly schedule of all activities, and it's extensive. The grounds are large and sprawling, and that is one of the things I liked about the resort....it's gorgeous and spread out. None of the buildings are much taller than the palm trees and all direct you to golf course or pool views, with no parking lot views. All the resort amenities are either a short walk from each other or a slightly longer, beautiful walk away. The buildings are a way off of International Drive, through a protected forest area, so no road noise at all. You feel secure having to pass through the gatehouse before entering the resort buildings area. While they have a free shuttle to get you from different areas of the resort, you are out of luck getting beyond the front drive without a car. Renting a car was pretty cheap (one week full-size for $131 through Dollar) and Disney has $8/car parking with in/out privileges so you can come back after a nap and not pay again. The resort will call a taxi (about $30 to Disney) or the Mears Shuttle (about $15 per person roundtrip- a crime!) but both were lots more expensive than piling everyone in the car and driving yourself. The local Publix was a short, easy drive away. Also, no one tells you this but there are two $.75 tolls from the airport to the resort and back, so have some change or small bills! The timeshare presentation was fairly painless, and definitely no pressure. Ours took a little over 2 hours, but mostly because we were talking with our salesperson who was very nice and an ex-semiprofessional English football player (Mark Bulmer). If you have kids, bring 'em, as they can give you your presentation in the kid's play room. They had two rooms with videos, Nintendo, coloring and toys, so it was nice not to have to worry about the kids. They like riding the golf cart to see the model, too. Coming to Orlando in June is a hot and sticky proposition, with thunderstorms daily, so we used the washer/dryer every day. Be sure to buy one bottle of cheap detergent at Publix the first day. (Publix was a lot cheaper than the Marketplace store on site for almost everything).

There are other pools, I think, but we never went there. We also had plans to put the older kids in the kids activities but we never got to. We were so busy that it wasn't necessary! They told us about the Publix supermarket and we stocked up on water and breakfast food and sandwich fixings. I'm glad we did because there were a couple of days when we got back late and we were too tired to go out for food. There are restaurants nearby on International Drive. A car was necessary to get around to Disney World and stores but they weren't too far of a drive. One tip: I was quoted $330 to rent a minivan for 5 days from Budget and when I asked if that was their lowest rate, the reservationist asked me if I had a Costco card. I did and the rate went down to $130. Amazing. Overall, our experience was an excellent one. I'm even tempted to look into buying a timeshare there myself. I would, however, make sure I request a more updated room and maybe on a second floor.", "Date": "June 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland, Europe", "Title": "\u201cDifferent then a realk hotel, but very good\u201d", "Author": "DutchyCan", "ReviewID": "UR3545460", "Content": "Since this is a timeshare resort, you should not expect a hotel. We have stayed at other Marriott timeshares before and have learned that it is handy to have a car. This is more like a mixture between a hotel and renting a house. If you did not book it as a hotel, you will not have a maid cleaning the room daily (unless you pay for it). Checking in went quickly, checking out even quicker (no need to go to the lobby, what you spent will be deducted from the credit card, and the keys from the room you leave at the security gate). Lots of people think the Publix supermarket is great. We did not think so. Okay, there are many options, but prices were very high compared to the 24hr Wal Mart. There are 2 Publix supermarkets in the area, neither one is in walking distance for shopping and carrying groceries. Ask the lobby for driving directions to Wall Mart (it is basically very simple, just about 10 minutes driving). Since it is better to be with a rental car (or van, as that seems the most popular car over there), the parks are not too far away. The rooms look nicely decorated, everything was basically clean when we arrived. The batteries from the remote were taken by the previous occupant, but replaced the next day when we asked (we arrived in the evening and didn't bother then). We stayed two weeks in the same room, and it was not cleaned when the new week started. I mentioned that, and it seems management can improve here. The pools are nice, but can be crowded at sunny days. In May there were enough seats to sit around the pool. There are plenty of activities to do, so you do not get bored at the resort. We were mainly gone (which was basically a shame, since the hotel deserves it to stay more there). If you have a room with kitchen and dining room, it is very sufficient. A room with just a small kitchen will also cater most of your needs. The washingmachine and dryer make more noise then ours in europe.

We had spent the prior week at a different resort on a timeshare exchange, and I wished that we had been able to trade into the Grande Vista for our entire stay. This is a beautiful resort! The location is on International Drive, just south of Seaworld. It is convenient to, not only Seaworld / Discovery Cove, but also situated about halfway between Disney and Universal / IOA. We arrived shortly after 4:00 pm check-in time, and, having had a horrible check-in at our prior resort, decided to time the duration of the check-in process here. From our entry into the lobby until we left with keys in hand was a whopping 4 minutes!!! The young lady at the front desk was polite, cheerful, helpful, extremely competent and professional. She explained about the resort's offerings and gave us concise directions to our accommodations. We traveled to our building which was on the other side of the lagoon from the front desk. One minor complaint here was that the signs indicating the building numbers were sometimes hard to see. Our unit was a one-bedroom located on the sixth (top) floor of Bldg. 82. It was beautiful. The porch and windows overlooked the pool area and lagoon and the view was awesome. The decorating inside was tasteful and pleasing. The kitchen was well-stocked (even had coffee filters in the coffee-maker) with all we needed. There was a door from the living room onto the porch, and the slider from the bedroom opened onto it as well. From our porch at night you could see the fireworks from the Disney area. The living room had a DVD and TV concealed in an armoire. HBO was available on both this and the bedroom TV. The bedroom was large enough to be comfortable, with an in-room jacuzzi for two and a vanity opposite it. The closet was of adequate size with a wall safe with a key lock (not a combination). The bathroom was spacious, with a double sink vanity, corner shower unit and toilet. Plenty of towels were provided, as well as some specifically for the pool. If I had one other complaint here, it would be some noise from either the elevator or air-conditioning equipment in our unit. However, it was not enough to be a bother to me. The pool area below us had two pools (one a zero entry for kids that had squirting cannons and other kid-friendly features in a pirate theme, the other more for adults, without the water toys). There was a pool bar (Copa Loca) with snack dishes available at this location. Drinks were $8 in a souvenier cup that could be refilled for $6. Waitstaff checked the pool areas to serve food and drinks or you could go to the bar if you didn't wish to wait. From this pool area a bridge connected the resort to the front desk / marketplace / second pool area. The harbormaster is there as well, where you can rent paddleboats and such to use on the lagoon. Also, the Faldo Golf Institute is onsite and the Marriott's Grande Pines just across the street. There are basketball and tennis courts available, as well as numerous other activities. We did not have the time to enjoy all of the offerings of this resort. I did enjoy the pool area by the Copa Loca and enjoyed it immensely. I will definitely be looking to stay at this resort again.

We are an extended family of 10, ranging in age from 8-72, and had 3 2-bedroom villas in building 91, which overlooked a quiet pool. Some reviews had me worried, but here's what we found. The grounds are just beautiful - well-kept and extensive. There are many pools (7?), loud ones, quiet ones, shallow for little kids, deeper with shooting cannons for older kids. All were clean, none were huge. We didn't mind walking around, it's only 5-10 minutes to get anywhere and the weather was perfect. We liked being in the quiet area, able to walk to louder places when we chose. We played tennis and ping pong, used the exercise room, ate everywhere but Nick's Grill, and swam in every pool. An order placed from our room to the Copa Loco was ready before we could walk over to get it. The front desk staff were not great - they forgot to give us our keys, to take our credit card #s, to tell us we were already checked in. It took 1 1/2 hours to get more swim towels as the maid hadn't replaced ours. They were not 4- or 5-star responsive. But this was a few minutes out of our week. Once we saw how they were we just tried to have little contact. Our unit was spacious (a priority for us with kids) and nice, not unacceptably worn. It was not top-hotel quality, but then it cost less than a single 5-star hotel room as well! There was a cobweb (big deal) at the ceiling, and my daughter's mattress seam was unsewn, exposing the springs. This was completely unacceptable to her Grandma, but as our daughter decided to sleep on the fold-out anyway, we didn't report it as we couldn't be bothered. The sheets and blanket on the bed were cheap and thin, but again, a small part of the whole experience. None of us had cockroaches.

May 13-20. We had a 1bedroom 1 bath villa and it was spacious and very nicely decorated. After pouring over many reviews here I learned to request the newly refurbished unit. We are a family of four and our 2 sons 5 and 7 slept on the brand new Flexsteel pull out sofa. The kitchen was very nice-a granite countertop new appliances, ample pots, cups, and dishes. We recieved 1 phone call inviting us to attend the presentation and declined. We were never bothered again. The intention of our trip was to enjoy Disney World. It was a close 10 minute drive. On our off days we enjoyed the nice Vista Del Sol pool. This pool had water sprayers, cannonballs, and children's pool games. There is also a nice pool bar that served a great Copa Lopa Pina Colada. My husband thought it was the best concoction he had ever tasted. The lunch menu had children's meals that far surpassed quality and price of any disney resorts that we've dined at. They also make excellent grilled chicken and grilled fish sandwiches. Children's activities are plentiful and well scheduled here. There's also a Harbour Master area where you can rent paddle boat swans or bikes, or surreys. The prices were very reasonable. We purchased this huge inflatable alligator for 10.00 and they blew it up for us right at the Harbour Master area. The kids had a ball playing with that on our rest days. This really is a top notch resort. I would agree with others on the bug issue. We did see 1 large roach--however, every other hotel that we've stayed at in florida has them as well. I wouldn't let that stop me from staying again. The decor was Tahitian/French very well coordinated and beautiful. Everything in our villa was brand new, including the carpet. We really enjoyed all of the activities and services that were offered. In some ways we were disappointed to spend so many days at Disney and not enough rest time at the resort. In conclusion, I am a very picky individual when it comes to selecting hotels. I read review after review, after review before deciding on whether to stay at a specific place. I can assure you--you won't be disappointed. We spent our last night at Disney's Polynesian and were much more disappointed with the accomadations there than at the Marriott Grande Vista.

They also have a window that sells Edy's ice cream and Pizza Hut. The Pizza Hut also delivers at night. At the other pool there is a bar/restaurant called Copa Loca I think.

Plus if you talk to the people that check you in they will allow you to stay for additional nights for only $99.00. Now, lets talk ownership. Do not purchase this vacation ownership scam at this resort. First off this property is not worth $22,000 plus 800.00 a year in condo fees. They admitadly only upgrade there rooms every five years. These places are used and abused 365 days a year. People do not respect things like they do at there own house, so after several years of use things in a timeshare have a tendency to began looking worn. Plus everything they do purchase is cheap. The mattresses are hard and have no pillow top, the ceiling fans rattle at high speeds, and you have to stand on the bed to adjust the speed(no wall control). The porch furniture is made out of plastic, like the ones they sell at walmart. I could go on and on. The point is that they want you to purchase a condo at top price then maintain it like a second class motel. Like I said they want $22,000 plus $800.00 a year condos fees for one week a year. If you were purchasing a cheaper unit these problems would be acceptable but not at these prices. Think about $22,000 x 52= $1,144,000.00 per unit for Marriott plus $800.00x52=$41,600 a year in condo fees per unit. That kind of money deserves first class quality. On a side note. Due to them sending invitations to anybody and everybody and renting out units to none owners most guest are not owners. This means that the caliber of neighbors is not always the greatest. People allowing there kids to use the lap pool as a kiddie pool, and the sauna as a play fort. Every time we have been there the pool is more like your local city swimming pool than a 4 1/2 star resort.

The only true conventional resturant is Nick Faldo's Grill House which is a bit upscale. No standard Marriott \"American Grill\" type eatery available. The on property conceriege was very helpful in describing ticket packages for the theme parks and we were able to buy everything right from her (and charge it to the room - more Marriott points!). This properly is located on International Drive, just five minutes away from the conventional Marriott World Center Hotel, but in my opinion, a much better option.", "Date": "April 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cA great place for families!\u201d", "Author": "spookykennedy", "ReviewID": "UR3365832", "Content": "We just returned from spending 3 nights at Marriott's Grande Vista and have nothing (ok, almost nothing) but positives to say about it! We had just left the Hyatt Regency Grande Cypress, and the Marriott was a breath of gorgeous, tropical, fresh air! We had a refurbished 2 BR/2 BA Villa in the Magellan building, which to us was a perfect location near the main pool and lobby. We had gorgeous views of the golf course as well. The villa was just huge and honestly we used about 25% of the space! It is so great for families and so convenient as you can park right outside your villa. We loved the washing machine in the room and it allowed us to pack less clothes. The way the room is designed it is SO quiet - never hear one peep from anyone else, not from above, below, outside or anywhere! The grounds are beautiful and the staff is great. We did have a grumpy, cold staff member at check in who wasn't the least bit helpful, but then Patty at the front desk helped us and made several calls to arrange for our villa to be ready early! She was awesome!!! We would have been off on a bad foot if it were not for her! We loved the location too as it is set apart from everything else but still relatively convenient. My husband loved that it was far from Disney stuff. I loved having a new Publix up the street yet still quick access to fun restaurants on International Drive. I would highly recommend this hotel. You can book directly through Marriott Vacation Club even if you aren't a member (we got a great rate!) or rent from a member by the week.

The walk to the pool was very easy and we did not encounter any trouble with the elevator, although we chose to take the stairs up five flights just for exercise several times. We enjoyed the pool bar/grill very much, that is a nice touch which the older side does not have. (Keep your souvenir glass handy to receive $2 discount on any refill drink--all were very tasty too!) Enjoyed the walk around the lake and there are shaded swings & benches placed around the property to enjoy. All Marriott employees were friendly and accomodating, even the grounds workers smile and speak as you pass by. We only participated in one activity (the beach campfire & smores) because we just couldn't fit it in our schedule, although we would have liked to. There are many buildings on this property but it never seemed crowded, even at the pool. If I was looking for something to complain about, it might would be that the speakers were not working around the newest pool because I really enjoyed the music around the main pool area. One week here is probably not long enough if you're doing the parks because there is a lot to enjoy at the Grande Vista property itself. Next time we return we will be sure to play beach volleyball, take our tennis raquets, take the paddleboats out, and rent bikes.

Although I did not find it as outstanding as the previous reviewers here, it was very nice, and made for a nice vacation with the two kids. The room itself (a two bedroom villa) was very big, and very clean for the most part. I did find some dust bunnies behind the bed and some mold up top in the bathroom, but nothing too outrageous. I did not see any palmetto bugs at all, which I had been afraid of after reading the reviews on this site. I only saw two small bugs, nothing unlike I would see in my own house, but other than that never had a problem. The room was more than big enough for my husband and my two kids, ages 5 and 3. Could have easily fit one or two more people. Having two bathrooms was great, plus the master bedroom gives you an extra vanity and sink so really three people could get ready at the same time. The water pressure from the showers was great. However, the whirlpool tub was much too big for me to sit in, and I am 5 foot 7. It was a six-foot, 2 person tub, and I had to strain to reach the jets at the opposite end of the tub. None of the jets hit any part of my body, and again I had to strain to even feel the bubbles. The washer and dryer are quite small, could only do 3 or 4 outfits (including kids' clothes!) at a time. So it's like doing half of a normal load, which makes it time consuming to get the laundry done. However it was very convenient having the laundry right there in the room. I noticed that the laundry facilities that they do have at the resort are somewhat spread out, they are not in every building so someone who did not have a washer and dryer in their room would have to walk a little ways. One thing I noticed that the hotel did not have was vending machines. It would have been nice to be able to get a quick soda, snack, or ice, without having to walk to the marketplace store. The mattresses in the rooms were nice, they felt like Tempur Pedic or something. Everyone in my family slept like logs at night, especially after long days walking the parks. However, the bedspreads were a little pilly and didn't seem like the cleanest linens you could have. Maid service was daily, however the maids never put a bottom (fitted) sheet on the bed. So it was just a waterproof liner on top of the mattress with two flat sheets on top of that. The bed kept getting unmade very easily. I had read in other reviews that everyone loved Nick's Restaurant. I thought it would be a pub style, family place, but it is very upscale and expensive. I brought my kids, (5 and 3), and they were the only kids there. It is mostly for the golfers to eat and drink after their game is done. Lots of older folks dressed up and people coming in off the golf course. The cheapest entree on the menu was around $15. The food was fine, but we could not afford to go there every night. Never mind the fact that it was not family friendly at all, which I thought was odd in a family oriented resort. The game room is very small, maybe only 15 machines plus two air hockey tables and a pool table, although not much room to play pool. The fitness center is small as well. The indoor kid's playground is small as well, although the kids enjoyed climbing through the big structure. I was surprised that they did not have an outside playground as it seemed a shame to have the kids playing inside on a beautiful Florida day. The pool areas were fine, although they could have done a better job cleaning out the leaves. Nice music piped in through all the pool areas. No lifeguards or anything so you must be extra vigilant with your kids, of course! I know how I devoured every bit of info on the hotel before I made my reservation, so hopefully this fresh insight helps someone else with their decision, either way. Overall, it is a fine hotel, no major complaints.

We are Marriott Vacation Club owners elsewhere and traded this week for one of ours through Interval International. We were more than pleased with the accomodations. The 2 bedroom villa was very spacious and well appointed. It included 3 TVs with 2 VCRs as well as a full dining area, complete kitchen with utensils and a washer and dryer. We had a very nice view of a lake with two patios one of which was screened in. The on-site Marketplace had most everything one could need but with a limited selection. We were only a few minutes away from a Publix supermarket and a drug store so this was no big deal. On our first day we received a phone call inviting us to take a timeshare presentation tour in return for a $100 credit or 15,000 Marriott Rewards points. We politely declined and were not bothered with this again. The staff was friendly. However, we honestly have to give mixed reviews because of several problems that we encountered. Our daughter and son-in-law arrived aboyt 15 minutes after us in a separate car. Although I had specifically asked the front desk to advise them where our villa was located, they did not do so and refused to direct them to us. They had to call me on my cell phone so that I could meet them at the front desk, arrange for them to get keys, and show them where we were staying. This was avoidable had the front desk clerk taht I spoke to instructed the others as to my simple request. Since we were travelling with two 20 month old toddlers I had called and pre-ordered two cribs and highchairs. Upon check-in I again confirmed this with the front desk and was assured that they would be in our room. This was not the case. It took several phone calls and nearly an hour and a half of waiting before they were delivered. Meanwhile, the children were unable to get to sleep until much later than originally planned. This meant that we got a much later start the next morning than we otherwise would have. We subsequently had some problems with a faulty toaster and coffeemaker as well as with our dishwasher. These were not resolved until we had made several phone calls. It seemed that making just one request was not sufficient. After I complained to the Front Desk Manager, he gave us a $50 credit for our trouble and things went more smoothly. One night my wife and I had dinner at Nick's Grille. The dinner was well prepared but pricey. Our daughter and son-in-law also ate there later that evening but with less satisfactory results. Both ordered filets which came out less well done than requested. Both were sent back. My son-in-law's then came back the way it was originally ordered but my daughter's was still undercooked. It went back another time but came back tasting like fuel oil. I doubt that they use fuel oil to cook it so the chef may have \"doctored\" it to express his dissatisfaction with the second return. My daughter then told the waitress that it was inedible and that she would share my son-in-law's steak. Although they were not charged for her order, no one apologized much less offered them a complmentary dessert. We had much better service and food off premises so I don't know if this was an isolated instance or not. There were lots of activities for children including daily morning activities for real little ones. However, the plastic balls in the play area were grimy and some had food and gunk on them. My wife, who is a children's activities director, had to tell the staff that our local health department would not have tolerated this lack of sanitation and then had to instruct them in the proper way to clean these balls. This was very dissappointing for a Marriott. Since we had traded a timeshare week instead of renting directly we were not entitled to daily housekeeping. We learned that if we wanted complimentary fresh towels every day we had to ask for them. We also paid $35 to have housekeeping clean our unit and change our linens in the middle of our stay. This required 24 hours advance notice. In summary, a nice place to stay but with really mixed reviews for service.", "Date": "December 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Huntingdon, Pa", "Title": "\u201cJust awesome\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2875613", "Content": "My husband, our 2 kids ages 8 and 10 and myself stayed at the Grande Vista in February 2004.

The couch was dirty and worn and when we pulled it out for my son to visit--on his way to Iraq- well he is likely to find it cleaner there. They never replaced the mattress even with numerous complaints. The best I could get was a mattress pad. There were ants in the kitchen, the floor was greasy and there was no mop or broom. Broken hair dryers, enough dust to write a novel in and it was just plain dirty and tatty everywhere. The handrails, the doors--dirty dirty dirty. They did finally send someone to clean and he cleaned some things and the promised spots on the rugs---not...they really do not care. And the worst part we had brought friends who were considering buying. I have never been so embarassed- they were not impressed and management seemed to not care at all. They offered to move us on wednesday--we were settled, thanksgiving the next day and it was simply not worth it-- they had long worn us out.

However we had already used our points in May so needed to find an alternative for this additional break in Orlando. We chose the Grande Vista partly on the back of the Tripadvisor reviews, which in the main are very positive, and partly because in August we had a week at the Marriott Marbella Beach resort in Spain. The Spanish resort was of a high standard and I think comparable with Disney's better resorts. It also helped that we were able to get a very good weekly rate through Interval International. Due to a delayed flight we did not check in until after 11pm. The one bedroom apartment was sited on the ground floor, backing onto the golf course. First impressions on entering the apt were positive. It was large and appeared well furnished and equiped. As it was late we fell into bed, hoping for a good nights sleep. Sadly the mattress was so worn it made sleeping uncomfortable. In the morning we found that the toilet cistern was broken, and had to use a saucepan to fill up the cistern. Looking around the apartment it was clear, in daylight, that we were in an older block and much of the furnishings/decor were a bit scruffy and frayed. Given that we hadn't paid a great deal for the apartment I was prepared to put up with the minor faults in decor but of course wanted the toilet repaired and the mattress replaced. Both of which I reported to reception. If at that point reception had said \"sorry and of course we'll get the problems fixed immediately, and in the meantime have a free drink at the pool bar\" I would have been quite happy. Instead there was no apolgy, and I was casually told that the matter would be reported to maintenance. When asked when I could expect the toilet to be fixed, and what about the mattress, I was told that it would be added to the maintenance schedule and they \"should\" get round to it that day. This wasn't acceptable and I asked to be moved to a different apartment Initially I was told the complex was fully booked etc etc but after some argy bargy with reception and housekeeping we were eventually allocated an apartment in one of the new blocks (Alicante) which was sited across a bridge from the main reception and overlooked the lake. The decor & furnishings were exactly like the previous apartment but much newer and in good condition. No bugs and the one dificulty we had with the safe was resolved within half an hour of reporting the problem. We were close to a nice pool area, which was cleverly designed to provide a play area for children and a quieter area for adults. Plenty of beds and a nice snack bar at pool side. Importantly the pool area and grounds were very well maintained and clean. I cant' say the same for the walkways and stairs leading to the apartments as these, for long times, were quite grimy and littered with trash, cigarette butts etc. We had read mixed reports abot the restaurant, Nick's Grill, but decided to have an evening meal. A wee bit pricey but both the food and service were excellent, and we would certainly eat there again. The complex is large and set in extensive grounds around a lake and golf course, very picturesque. Accommodation is in Spanish style six storey blocks, with new blocks going up.Location is good. Close to Disney, Sea World and International Drive. There is a good supermarket (Publix) 5 minutes away, quite handy as I felt the on site store was lacking in some basics, particularly fresh bread/rolls. Certainly if you are allocated a newer block you should have no complaints. Refurbishment of the older blocks needs to be improved. Another concern is that as more and more blocks go up will the facilities keep pace? Whilst I still prefer Disney, I do think the Grande Vista has a lot going for it and would be happy to return, providing I could chose my apartment.", "Date": "November 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ringwood", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice!\u201d", "Author": "lhs1", "ReviewID": "UR2829707", "Content": "We rented a two bedroom villa.

When I went to make the Disney reservations, the best price I got was $159 (previous years were like $80 or so). That's when I started to look around... I've been a Marriott rewards member for some time (Silver Elite status) and was poking around their web site at about the same time I got a promotional email that indicated a discount code. I tried it and got a fantastic rate: a 2 bedroom unit for $141. I booked it immediately. Kept looking around still, but never found better. Was a little worried about some of the negative reviews (bugs, disrepair, etc), but when we got there, all that was put to rest. First off, the grounds were just beautiful. Tip top. Immaculate. As good or better than any disney property. When I checked in, I asked for a renovated room. We got our room, but it was on the 1st floor (had requested a high room). Went back, and were given a room on the 5th floor, in bld 97, which is right next to one of the 4 pools. The room was great. There were a few nit-pick items such as a worn carpet threshold and a missing piece of base tile in the bathroom. Other than that, it was perfect. Staff was wonderful, made a few phone calls to the front desk (dead batteries in a remote and something else) and they were taken care of immedately. I did not see any bugs, dead or alive.

Also went to the other pool area across the lake: 'play pool', pool near the bar, hot tub #1, hot tub #2, and a kids pool. All the pools were in top condition.

This resort caters to almost any family, big or small, young or old you'll enjoy grande vista. The pools are wonderful and abundant. Rooms spacious and clean. Property well upkept and service immpeccable. My favorite part is the balcony/porch that you can sit out on at the end of a long day and relax or enjoy your morning paper. There is a full kitchen in every room, so you can cook some of your own meals. (I highly reccommend the Publix supermarket right down the road for your groceries) You can even do your own laundry.

Here are some questions: Where are the renovated units, are they adjoining interior doors (if a 2 or 3 bedroom unit), which units have smoking, what amenities are available in the units, which ones have views of the pool and/ or golf course, which units have parking lot views.

Was somewhat crowded, but could always get seats. Overall we loved the resort. Great quiet location midway between Disney and Universal.

The accomodations were excellent and great for kids, especially with a full kitchen and washer/dryer in the unit. We were in building #81 overlooking the main pool area- a great view on the screened-in balcony. We ate most of our meals in, since 3 toddlers are hard to handle at restaurants. This saved us a lot of money, and we were able to have nice quiet dinners after the kids went to sleep. There is a big Publix down the road for grocery shopping. We even bought a small cooler and packed drinks down to the pool with us. The pools were great- there is a children's pool that is about 1 foot deep throughout, so the kids can go in and play pretty much on their own. The main pool is huge, there was never a problem with getting chairs. There is also a beach in front of the lake, where the kids can play and run in the sand- you can check out pails and shovels, etc. at the activities center for free. There is also an indoor gameroom and children's play area with a ball pit and one of those climbing mazes and slide. This was great when it rained and when we needed to get out of the sun.

I must preface this by saying that we did not spend a lot of time there as we were running to the parks quite often. A couple tips to keep in mind. Definitely request to be in the main area/pavilion. We were in one across the way from the main area, and we never used anything. Not even the really nice looking pool. It was just too far and we're lazy. Second, we were put in a handicapped room, which was fine really, but the bathroom was definitely different. I would have liked to have been in a different room, but it was still very nice. Other concerns are that there was no maid service, so your towels are what you get for the week. Of course you can wash them yourself with the Washer/Dryer unit in there. The property was gorgeous adn the room was very nicely appointed.

If you stay at the Marriott Grand Vista, try to get a room near the lobby because if you are far from the front you will have to walk a long way to go to the main pool. The other complexes have pools too but all the activities are at the main pool which is an amazing pool. At lunch time they played games in the pool for the little kids and there were sometimes shows at night. The Pina Coladas and Strawberry Daquiries were great there. We were there for Easter so there was an Egg hunt for the children. They also had little motorized boats for a relaxing ride and view. For activities they had bicycles for two or four people which were a lot of fun. The staff and the animators were really friendly. The grounds & exterior buildings were beautiful.

Want to say firstly, many thanks to all those who take the time to write in and relay their opinions. We relied heavily on the reviews of the Grande Vista before deciding on accomodation. This resrt is absolutely fantastic! From the winding palm tree entrace to the immpecable customer service our stay was everything we had hoped for. We stayed in building #80 which is the main building on the resort. we have three kids (8,7 and 3) and wanted the convenience of the ammenities close buy as well as close access to the main pool. In building 80 is the Marketplace store (offers everything you would want from grocery to drinks (kids and adults) as well as a Pizza Hut and made to order sandwiches. Everything can be paid cash or billed to your room. The other services are located close to the main building as well (Lighthouse Bar, kids activites etc). The main pool is wonderful and the kids enjoyed it as much as the parks. The chairs around the pool fill up quickly however and my advice would be to have someone from your room head down with towels (which you can get from the front desk free of charge) early ( i went at 7:30 to 8 and wasn't the first there) to reserve some chairs around the pool. They also have large , portable umbrellas that can be rolled to your desired location (highly recommended if you have young kids in the pool and want to stay at poolside but also want some shade.) Also, you do not have to buy drinks from the poolside bar (at bit pricey even at happy hour 3- 6...5-7 $ for a frozen drink). I took a cooler down in the morning loaded with juice, water and drinks for the adults :) Bags of ice are free from the Marketplace (beside the pool). Ours room was exceptional with newly appointed paint and furniture. We had a two bedroom unit which offer plenty of room for our party of six (parents, kids and grandma). Check out the planner of activites they give you at check in. Anyway, great time had by all and plan to retunr next year.

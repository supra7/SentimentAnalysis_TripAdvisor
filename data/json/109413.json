By the way we were surprised with an upgrade at no additional charge. The shuttle service was excellent by way of a luxuriously appointed black Suburban. Thank you Jason! We felt like chauffeured executives as we went to the Jimmy Buffet concert. While we did not have time for happy hour and cookie hour, I thought these were very nice touches. We did stay for a very tasty breakfast the following morning after sleeping in a comfortable and quiet corner room on the 21st floor. Check out was easy and when asked by Jackie at the front desk if there was anything else she can do for me, I jokingly replied, \"Can you fold my bill in the shape of an origami pterodactyl?\" We laughed and while waiting for our car outside she found us and handed me an origami pterodactyl. I think this event was emblematic of the incredible level of service and care the staff of the Magnolia takes with their guests. We will return again.

The entire Staff of The Magnolia Hotel in Dallas, Tx has always treated my family & friends with kindness and respect. And I have'nt even gotten out of my vehicle yet and I already feel like a celebraty. We were helped with our bags and proceeded to the front desk to check in. Once I walk up with I.D. and CC in hand I have already been recognized and greeted again with smiles and well wishes.-(Side Note - I just recently underwent a Total Hip Replacement and The Magnolia Hotel were kind enough to allow my family members stay with My Wife As I Underwent the procedure, for a reasonable rate.) I get a few winks and 'Congratulations' from the staff because they all know we are here to celebrate our 13th Wedding Anniversary. I sent an Email to Mr. Juan T. Morales with a couple special requests that could help me make this Anniversary the best! So the entire staff knew already of what was waiting inside our room, but my Lovely Wife did not! I have been to The Magnolia Hotel several times since our 1st visit there in Dec 2009. And EVERY visit I find something greater about the Magnolia I didnt before. This time its the Food Prep Staff. The Pictured you see at the bottom of this review comes from a simple request: 'Mr. Morales, could you help me suprise my wife with a make shift Wedding Cake? Like the cake we had on our wedding day? It had 3 tiers of twinkies, zingers and cup cakes.' Well, to my amazement, his Food Prep Staff went above and beyond this simple request. The service we recieved throughout our 2 day stay at The Magnolia Hotel Dallas,Tx was courteous and kind. Always a helping hand around every corner. And I do believe the atitiude and atmosphere of the staff has rubbed off onto the patrians of the Hotel. Helping hold elevators so no one will be left behind, helping with directions and sitting around the bar or table sharing stories. This hotel makes a person feel comfortable the second he is greeted at Valet or as he walks through the doors.

The bathroom was nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable and the staff was very helpful. I have only two suggestions to improve my next stay: while the room was restful, it was a bit dark, due to the dark brown walls, and the minimal amount of lighting fixtures. I would prefer a little lighter wall color and more lamps. Additionally, I had room service two evenings, and while my choices were delicious, I didn't have a large selection from which to chose.

The hair dryer in my room had a short in it and was difficult to use and the cabinet door on the bathroom vanity was loose on its hinges - very minor things that could be easily fixed and were not too much of a distraction.

I travel frequently for business and as such, I often prefer to stay at one of the big chain hotels for the rewards points.

The hotel is in a great neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shops, including things like a 7-11 and a CVS if you need any last minute essentials. The hotel has a nice free breakfast buffet and it offers milk and cookies at bedtime. I think it also had a complimentary evening happy hour, but I did not participate in that. There are a few other things I really liked about the hotel. The service was absolutely fantastic and every employee I encountered was super friendly. Everyone was warm and smiling and that can really go a long way when you are far from home. Another thing I Ioved was the free shuttle. The hotel has a complimentary shuttle service that will take you anywhere within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. They will even pick you up when you are finished. I took full advantage of that shuttle and made trips to a local movie theater and Target. Another thing that is worth mentioning about the hotel is the sheets. So many hotels have sheets that make a lot of noise when you are moving around at night and the sheets on the bed were so soft and quiet. That may seem like a silly thing to mention, but it really makes for a better night of sleep. I was upgraded to a suite and my room was nicely appointed.

We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in February and everything was ok for the first day; however, when we got home Saturday nights, the hotel had thrown an urban rap party for Mardi Gras which encompassed the entire lobby, lounge, bar and restaurant area on all three floors. The rap music was literally so loud that it hurt your ears to even walk through the lobby and I had to scream at the front desk host to get my room key fixed. I asked him when the party was over and he had to hold up his fingers to tell me 2am because it was too loud at the front desk to even speak. Fellow travelers told me that they could hear every word of the music on the 10th floor until 2am. The irony of the whole thing is that the hotel guest were not going to the party, it was local ghetto warriors that came to invade the hotel by the HUNDREDS. The hotel reportedly made $8,000 by hosting the party, which shows a COMPLETE LACK OF RESPECT FOR ITS GUESTS that it would allow something so disturbing to occur until all hours of the night. Honestly, words cannot describe the scene that was taking place and I have no desire to ever travel to this property again. Why the management would think that it is acceptable to allow this to happen until 2am and keep all of its paying guest awake all night in their rooms is utterly beyond me. I hope that they go out of business, which won't be hard if they keep this stuff going. There were also 6 armed guards in the lobby for the party - generally when this is necessary, you shouldn't be staying at hotel. I am surprised there wasn't a stabbing or shooting given the crowd.

It worked well because my wife and I were both participating at the conference, but had very different schedules on some days and were able to get ready to go in the morning without distubring the other one. The suite had a kitchen, including a full-sized fridge, but we didn't use it. Wireless was free in our room which we liked. There were some issues with the signal coming and going, but rarely did the signal completely disappear, it was typically a matter of re-connecting.

I finally just dropped off the paper and plastic bottles at the registration desk; seems kind of silly in this day and age to not provide recycling options, in the lobby, at the very least. Second floor has a bar and offered free breakfast, but I never used it, so I can't comment on its quality. Did enjoy the free cookies and milk that was offered in the late afternoon/early evenings. The only thing that I specifically remember is how the TVs were such a pain to use. The remotes didn't really work well in either the bedroom or the sitting room. Not surprisngly, the TVs started on the pay-per-view screen, but we often had a bear of a time actually getting past that screen, to watch normal cable television.

The first thing I noticed was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff -- valets, bell staff, front desk staff, everybody. This was one of the most positive experiences I've had with hotel staff in a long time. It was good to know that they had a free shuttle van for rides within 3 miles of the hotel. I used this a few times and had good experiences each time. The room was good -- it was one of their smaller rooms, but was much larger for one person than most rooms have been at conferences I've attended. There were two large beds, and the bathroom was down a short hallway that was within the room... so it felt more spacious because of that. There was not much seating in the room. There was one desk with a chair, and otherwise the only seating was on the beds. The room had a flat screen TV, hooked to cable. But it was not digital cable, so the pictures were not in HD and were very slightly blurry. Still, this didn't bother me very much. Everything worked well in the room, with a couple of exceptions. I see another review saying the blinds didn't work on one window. Mine worked, but they had seen better days and didn't really close completely. But I was on a high enough floor that I was above the roof of the Adolphus Hotel, the very ornate building next door. So nobody could really see into the room, and there was a shade to close over the blind, and that really kept out the light. Speaking of the Adolphus, looking at the upper level of that building out the window was a highlight every morning. It's very ornate, and i was getting a view that not many could see. The one downfall of my room in the Magnolia was the carpeting. It had been cleaned, but it had seen better days. It was stained, but clean. The room as a whole had a dark decor, so that made the lighting seem inadequate. Except for the carpeting, though, I thought the room was overall in good condition. The hotel also has computers where you can print a boarding pass for free (although they charge a steep fee for other uses of the computer). The free breakfast was appreciated. I found the food to be middling to good -- not excellent, but certainly not terrible. And there are a great variety of choices for breakfast. I did like the breakfast sausage links. I would recommend the Magnolia Hotel.

I liked the different style but when you take away the experience of not staying at a cookie cutter hotel, this place is just ok. The staff is very nice and accommodating, however a few other things overshadow this place. For the evening reception the bartender was very rude. He would not acknowledge that we were standing there and wouldn't look at us when we did ask questions. There were only 3 drink choices for the reception (2 of them wine) and the beer (which is what we all got) was warm. We then went to ask the bartender if there was a full restaurant and he asked, \"Where?\" - as if he didn't know - and when I said \"in this building I guess\" he said \"yeah we have menus right over here\" (I don't understand why he asked me where when he already knew). The waitress was very nice, however, and even wished us a good night when we abandoned our drinks and decided not to order from the restaurant there. We didn't go to the cookies and milk (but I heard they ran out of cups) and breakfast was just OK and items ran out very fast with the number of guests there and we'd have to wait to get more. Finally, the elevators need updating (some of them work funny) and most importantly they are loud if you get a room where you can hear them going up and down all night. Also, our room was right above the common area outside the hotel, and although we were on the 9th floor there was one very loud group out there in the middle of the night, and later there was another \"incident\" where 3 guys were screaming at each other for at least 30 minutes. I was very curious as to why the hotel did not call an officer or otherwise stop that madness from disturbing guests as I'm sure if I heard them from inside my room on the 9th floor, someone else had to too. I also turned on our heat but didn't notice it working at all, and another guest in our party didn't have any of the $3.00 bottled water in his room to consume and when he called the desk they were apparently out and couldn't restock (and the vending machines only had soda). At any rate, there were obviously good things and bad things about this hotel. However, (aside from the bartender) staff was again nice and willing to help if you came to them. The shuttle service and valet are also good.

Many lamps are in the room but even after turning on all the lamps, the room could be brighter. My one complaint are about the pillows. They're lumpy and aren't soft enough.

We had accomodated family and company for an entire week. We have both stayed all over the world and this was the worst experience either of us ever had with a hotel. Hardly the relaxing and rejuvinating stay we had hoped for. We started our check in at 3:30pm, Saturday, 12/03/2011. I had reserved a suite so we would have a kitchen and we brought our own food so we could stay in for the evening and just relax and enjoy the boutique hotel atmosphere. The toilet in the first room we were sent to overflowed, ended up soaking my socks and shoes. We were told to stay there and maintenance would come up. I told the front desk it was worse than a maintenance call because the entire bathroom floor was flooded and seeping into the carpet outside the bathroom door. I turned the water valve off myself so it wouldn't continue to get worse. When we got back to the lobby we were told there were no other suites ready at the time and if we could please wait a few minutes another room would be ready. After 30 minutes and no notice, I walked back to the desk and were told there were no suites available but I could go look at 2 different rooms and could chose between the two. We chose one room and went back down to be told that room had been pre booked and was not available. We said fine, let us have the 2nd room we were sent to. We had not spent much time other than looking at the room, but it seemed OK. When we got to this queen parlor room, we realized it was very hot and when we turned the AC on to cool it off, it didn't seem to be working. We also discovered there were only 3 small lamps in the bedroom and there was no light whatsoever in the area contianing a desk and the small refrigerator. We called the front desk and were told to come back down. We asked for someone to just meet us at the new room so we wouldn't be burdened with moving our luggage yet again up and down the stairs and elevators. No one ever showed up after 25 minutes so I called the front desk yet again. I was put on hold for another five minutes. I hung up and called back. The front desk girl ran the key up to the 13th floor herself because the person she asked to do it disappeared and never returned. It was 5:35pm when we finally got into this final room # 1326. The room was in fairly good condition if you overlooked the fact the wooden blinds didn't function properly. By the way, being in the hallway on floor 13 so long waiting for admittance into our room, we noticed broken glass in front of the housekeeping door and it remained there our entire stay...... The front desk person told us she would speak to the manager to see if he would approve reducing charges. We waited 3 hours and didn't hear anything. We went to the front desk around 8:30pm where we discovered her telling the manager about it and he said he would not charge us for the room. We thought we were not going to have any other issues, but the morning of 12/04/11 we found the room charge still on the bill left under the door. This presented a problem because the shift change occurred and we had to re explain our whole ordeal to the new manager on duty, who did remove the room charge, but added the valet parking charge. When we tried to get our car from valet it was cold and raining and it took more than 25 minutes for that to occur. There was only one man who was truly trying to make the valet parking go smoothly and was directing his crew which seemed to be very uncooperative with him. Sadly, I didn't get his name - he should be rewarded for his patience and efforts. I am a reasonable person and realize things go wrong, but it didn't seem that anyone truly cared that we were so inconvenienced. Just wanted you to be aware. Training might be in order to improve and learn about how to better accomodate during unnusual circumstances. The Dallas Magnolia is a very unique and interesting boutique hotel.

Out of 7 elevators only 3 0r 4 of them work? Consider having half of them go only to top floors (14-26) and half going to lower level floors (2-13). If you can't afford having all elevators running, cut back on the cookies, drinks and other gimmicks and get your house in order. Just a suggestion. 3) I don't valet. This hotel is not very accommodating for that. I know valet is very \"Dallas\", but there are a lot of us who like to self-park and not having that option is annoying. Even if that was an option, there's not place to reasonably drop off bags, etc. before self parking. 4) A positive, we were there to attend a wedding reception in the Pegasus Room.

The lobby is unique and kind of swanky without feeling pretentious. The Magnolia seems to be a deal, in a good area downtown until you hit the traffic it takes 30 minutes to make the turn to get around the block to the hotel, to get in line to the valet. However, check-in was fast, but things deteriorated quickly when we're told there are only Queen suites left (apparently the weddings have overtaken the entire hotel. More below). But we figure, okay, a Queen suite will be okay instead of a King, right.... WRONG. We go up to find our Queen suite is actually a rather dark, odd two-room affair with a bed that is in reality closer to a full-size. For adults this is ridiculous. I spent most of both nights falling out of the bed along with the pillows. The rooms were so dark I thought I was in an \"off the strip\" Vegas special. With the blinds open and all the lights on it was still so dark I wondered what they were hiding. The bathroom was a big, but nothing special. We had a kitchen. We didn't need or want one. We had a living room, didn't need or want one. Okay, onto the other amenities. This isn't a posh modern hotel. It is an old office building that has been converted. And it's not charming. It's just OLD and dark. We quickly discovered the Magnolia turns into WEDDING CENTRAL on the weekend. Several wedding parties had taken over the entire lobby, bar and parking area. Lovely. They swarmed the lobby and sprawled everywhere to take photos. The bar is packed. This beautiful hotel has turned into Disneyland complete with crying babies, whining kids and young women in what I can only call club wear (which apparently now passes for wedding attire). Sweet. Cheap entertainment! You'll be happy you have it -- because you're gonna need it while you wait for the VALET aka the waiting area from hell where they say they are getting your car (or hopefully find it eventually) or maybe get you a taxi (see more below). The Magnolia Promised several \"free\" goodies like cocktail hour, breakfast buffet. and milk & cookies at bedtime. However.... we had problems with all of them ... or and a bit more. What did NOT WORK: 1) Free cocktail hour: We went down, but the bar was so jam packed we could not get through in any direction. We gave up and left. Not a table open, not even a chair (again due to the wedding(s)? Really shouldn't the wedding parties cocktail/bar be separate from regular hotel customers? So much for that freebie. Next! 2) The breakfast area was so full we stood up to eat for the first few minutes. Classy. I felt like I was at any resort area hotel with a kiddie attraction (aka Disney World) -- you come down for breakfast and it's packed with the families and kids are everywhere, like locusts. They will eat ANYTHING that doesn't eat them first. The eggs were cold and had an odd texture (almost like powdered or something... very odd). There was no meat on the buffet. The potatos were cold and greasy. It was toast-your-own bread. No where to sit. So stand, hold your juice & balance your plate and eat. Charming. Am I at the Motel 6? Within a few minutes, before we could even get a cup of coffee the entire \"buffet\" was broken down and wheeled away. Who closes breakfast at 10 a.m. on a weekend? I wondered again if this disasterous mob scene was due to the multiple weddings. Should everyone in the hotel be punished because of the wedding parties? Thanks Magnolia Hotel for this fine freebie. 3) The noise was horrendous. I was kept awake until after 2 a.m. on both nights. Motorcycles, horns, cabs, yelling -- it was insanity. We were on the 22nd floor and it was AWFUL. I might as well have slept out on the street. 4) Super slow elevators. Oh and be prepared. The wedding parties don't mind cramming in on top of you to the point of knocking you down. Oh and you're welcome. Just move the ___ out of their way already. 5) Valet system was a nightmare in general. We paid $24.00/ & used our car ONCE. When we came down to get a taxi on our second night, the valet area was a disaster zone. We waited and waited and waited ---- and we were PAYING them $24 a day for this service? They even stick a note in with your bill on check out day instructing you NOT to call for your car. That's right -- you are paying for the service and they are now asking you not to use it. So at check out time you get to go down and wait in line (yes, like security at the airport but even MORE disorganized). A less than stellar ending to our stay. What?! And I'm paying for this \"service\"? This pushed what a been an annoyance on previous occasions to a point of no return. 6) Top covering on bed was like burlap. Really cheap, really tacky. As we say in Texas, \"Tacky McTack Tack.\" 7) No luggage rack. 8) One bathroom for two people 9) Small vanity in bathroom (so small that I laid a towel on the floor and used that to lay things on). Crazy, huh? 10) Full size mirror in the bedroom but so dark I still couldn't see to check my clothes before leaving. Put the full size mirror in the bathroom if that's the only place where there is ANY lighting. The good: 1) Night #1 the valet staff was wonderful. I think we caught them just before the mass of wedding guests arrived and left. We came down to get a cab & the valet staff offered to take us in the hotel's SUV. 2) Front desk staff was courteous, friendly, helpful. Professional. Sharp. 3) The hotel lobby was beautiful, clean, well-kept; unique architecture. 4) The bed was comfortable (though small). Silky sheets, super-light comforter. Plenty of pillows. This is probably a different hotel during the week. I can't recommend it on the weekend though. The $24/day for valet is a joke. The cocktail hour and breakfast is also a joke. I even tried writing the management of the Magnolia. They care so little they have not responded at all. Apparently, they only care about booking weddings. We won't go back. Yes, The Magnolia was a good deal, but price isn't everything. We paid the price for going cheap. Can't recommend it. We'll pay the extra $ next time and avoid the noise, Wedding Central and the rest of the mess.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas", "Title": "\u201cLove my new weekend spot\u201d", "Author": "iknowwhatisnice", "ReviewID": "UR120964085", "Content": "I have lived in Dallas all my life.

The hotel staff was friendly, the breakfast was good and the cookies were a nice touch. The gym is nicely equipped and the Sauna in the dressing room was a pleasant surprise.

Constant sound of water running in the toilet - didn't really bother us as the suite was well isolated for noise but the water waste is a shame. 3. There was only one bathrobe in the room. (Really minor issue, noted here to just to demonstrate good response by the staff). I notified the front desk and a 2nd robe was delivered quickly. A notice to maintenance was opened for items 1 and 2. Warnings to fellow travelers: 1. $30 for parking per night ($24 + tax + gratuity...) - way too high in my opinion 2. Starbucks next door closes at 6PM on Friday and 2PM on Sat-Sun. Ridiculous hours. 3. Checkout at 11AM, 12PM at the latest (stay past noon you will be charged $50 for late checkout) Recommendations: 1. Free Beer/Wine/Soft drinks in evening reception 5:30-6:30PM 2. Warm cookies 8-10PM 3. Look on their web site for specials.

The beds were extremely firm and very, very comfy..and there was a nice big bath to soothe tired travelling muscles in. Staff were a little uninformed, but then again, they did find our accents difficult to understand and we had a few extra adventures finding shops etc due to their lack of directions or knowledge, so that wasn't really a drama. The Magnolia isn't close to many shops so we did a little walking, and the area is very safe to walk around and easy to negotiate the streets - no mad running across the street like in Asia!! Breakfast was varied and part of the room price - very nice - there was lots of talk about the free happy hour and milk and cookies by other reviewers, but we weren't interested in either of those, so have no opinion on them - we did get many a thermos of boiling water sent up by room service though for our herbal teabags - our drink of choice...the room service was very prompt every time, day or night.

The building itself is old with the red Pegasus neon sign on top, linking it to the Magnolia Petroleum Company in its hey days. Although renovated it exudes a dark aura. The colour scheme of the room also did not help with its grey walls, dark carpet & wooden louvres on the windows. However, the front desk was helpful and efficient. The same can be said of the staff at the buffet breakfast. This complimentary meal is available to all guests in The Lounge on the mezzanine floor. You get sausages, bacon, porridge, toast etc., fresh fruits, juices, tea and coffee. Completely self service so just grab your stuff and grab a table or share one with others. Eggs are served by a chef at an adjacent station, but a charge of around $6 is levied. Anyway the free stuff is more than enough for a good breakfast. From 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm, you can get a free drink at the bar in The Lounge. Then from 8 to 10 pm there's hot milk & cookies. These complimentary services are quite unique. The lifts were not modern and fast. We were there at the Labor Day weekend, with lots of guests wanting to go down in the morning, making getting into a lift an interminable wait. Lifts after lifts were full. In our room the airconditioner outlet was facing directly our beds. As a result the blast of air was hitting my face/head full on, which became unpleasant after awhile. However, there was a major heatwave in Dallas then and it would be just as uncomfortable to turn the airconditioning off. We just had to tolerate the oft interrupted sleep. The hotel is quite close to the Neiman Marcus store and about 3 blocks away from the Akard Station if you need to use the DART rail system. We found that was quite a convenient way to get around Dallas or further afield. There was also the complimentary hotel shuttle which you can use to get to other downtown areas.

Front desk staff was extremely helpful., both prior to the stay when I called with questions and once I arrived. I had requested a room that was on the 7th floor or lower via the internet reservation. The request was honored and I was assigned a 5th floor room. The front desk provided a coupon for a complimentary appetizer at a restaurant near by when I asked for directions. Possibly because it was Sunday night and it helped send business to the near by restaurant, but no matter the motivation, it was a welcome extra.The room was decorated in the sophisticated style of New York or LA. Dark rich colors, indirect lighting. Luxurious feeling. Do not expect the suburbia style room with fluorescent over head lights and large windows. You are in a high rise in a downtown area. Comfortable beds. The elevator issue mentioned in other reviews did not pose a problem. My stay was on a Sunday night when the facility did not have a large number of guests. I would image if the hotel was full, like during a football weekend at the Cotton Bowl, the elevators would probably be slow. The valet parking was convenient and by calling from my room prior to going downstairs and checking out, the car was ready when I got there. Again, if the hotel was busy, it may be another issue. Taxes are high on both the room and the valet parking service. Not a fault of the hotel, but it does increase your per night rate significantly. The location has a disadvantage of being in downtown Dallas for a leisure stay. Very few restaurants are open in downtown Dallas on Sunday night.

The Magnolia has a historic feel but has been renovated with all kinds of modern comfort and decor. The price, location and accommodations were all excellent. If you are going to be in Dallas, I strongly recommend renting a car as that is the best way to navigate the city. The cost for parking is $24 for come and go valet or $12 for a one-time park. You have other options of where to stay that are new and right in the middle of action but I prefer staying somewhere just a few miles away for a better night's rest. The complimentary brunch on Sunday is exceptional, especially considering it is complimentary. There are some nicer restaurants nearby but if you want something more casual or more options, there are plenty of options within a few miles. You can use the 3 mile radius hotel shuttle or take a short drive to the Deep Ellum area for the Twisted Root or Cafe Brazil (kind of grungy in a good way part of Dallas). You can also go to McKinney Ave. where there are a variety of restaurants and pubs (The Gingerman has an unbelievable amount of beers on tap in a great old wooden house). If you want some higher end shopping and more food options, go north on 75 to the North Park Mall area. For more nightlife- bars, clubs and indie music concerts, look up Lower Greenville. For events, you are seconds away from the American Airlines Center and surrounding area. For biking/walking, head to the Katy Trail or White Rock Lake. All of these things are within 10 miles of the Magnolia. Having been downtown countless times, it was nice staying in a room on a higher floor and seeing the ornate work on the tops of the buildings I've only seen from street level.

We took advantage of the complimentary breakfast as well as the paid omelet station and both were good. Not the best we had ever had, but no complaints. The kids really enjoyed the complimentary cookies and milk in the evening, of course. Valet parking was $22/night which, compared to other major cities, is a pretty good price. Of course self parking would be nice and I'm sure you could probably self park in a nearby garage but we didn't look in to that since we were unfamiliar with the area. Would possibly look at that if staying there in the future. I believe the valet uses a nearby garage anyway. Our room was well appointed and clean. The beds were pretty comfortable, a little on the firm side. A/C worked well but was loud, you could definitely tell when it was running but it wasn't a bothersome noise. This is an older building so you can hear the inner workings such as plumbing, etc. Again, nothing bothersome to us. I had read that the higher floors are quieter and had requested a higher floor at check in which I could have got but opted for the larger room on the 6th floor that was also offered. In hindsight, I would have stuck with the higher floor. Road noise on the 6th floor was bothersome, especially when someone playing loud bass was stopped at the intersection at 2am and it rattled the windows enough to jar me out of a dead sleep. Go with a higher floor! The large garden tub in the bathroom was nice and I liked having drawers in the vanity especially since there really wasn't a convenient place to hang my toiletry bag.

Spacious room, comfy bed, room temperature (we were able to control) nice and cool. I loved the soft robe and bought one to take home. It's just not a vacation without room service, and room service at the Magnolia is top-notch. The cheese plate and jalapeno-bacon grilled cheese we ordered were delicious, arrived quickly, and just the right temperature.

Happily, everything about the hotel surpassed my expectations, so the cocktails and cookies were just added perks. The location of the hotel itself is fantastic. It's situated within walking distance of a peaceful courtyard, Margarita Ranch, Walt Garrison Rodeo Bar, and the Dallas Fish Market, making a night out on the town possible with very little planning or effort. Of course, it's right in the heart of downtown so anything else you could want to do during your stay (art, performances, Dallas World Aquarium, etc.) is also easily accessible.

Our only sore spot was the street noise, which kept us from getting a great night's sleep. We arrived just after 3:00 PM on a holiday-weekend Saturday for an overnight stay. Valet experience was great and they accommodated our request to keep the car close at hand as we were departing again within the hour. The front desk staff was helpful, and got us into our room (a \"Queen Suite\") quickly. At that time of day, it's a quiet and serene property. Our suite was delightful, and on a high floor (21st floor). It comes with a small kitchen, a nice bathroom, and a main sitting area in addition to the bedroom. It smelled pleasant and clean, and it's a corner room so we had a number of pleasant views of downtown Dallas. Some Things We Really Liked About Our Stay: - The valet experience was truly wonderful that first night and they handled our special request for quick access without complaint; to make matters more challenging for them, I forgot to leave my keys, but they were very nice about it. Later in the weekend, though, they aren't kidding about giving them 10-15 minutes lead time, so plan for that. - Free WiFi! I can't believe every place doesn't offer this, but it's worth mentioning those that do. - The size and shape of the tub make showering a truly pleasant and spacious experience; it's enough beyond the typical experience to make mention of. Things We Weren't So Happy About: - The Street Noise! Even 21 floors up, the other reviewers aren't kidding about the street noise. People, cars, sirens, mystery noises - it keeps going well into the wee hours. I would wish for some double-paned glass, or some other sound insulation trick. Light sleepers, beware. - Lighting in the bathroom was not really sufficient for my lady to be happy applying her makeup. Not enough light, the placement of the lights is poor, and the color tones were weird. - There's no business-type desk area, so nowhere is there a place to put your computer that's at a comfortable operating height. Things Just Worth Mentioning: - When we arrived back from a show around 11:30 PM, the door is locked and you need a key to get in. - Also at 11:30 PM, the crowd around the hotel is definitely a young, hip scene. We didn't feel unwelcome, there were just a surprising number of folks crowding in and around the lobby and sidewalk areas. Summing up, this is a nice property, it definitely has personality, and the staff deserves a thumbs up all around. That said, the \"personality\" is distinct, and might not be to everyone's liking. This is not your generic business hotel - it's a property with a style all its own, and I think it's worth experiencing (especially with its attractive price point), but if I was traveling on business, I will probably look to a different property for my next stay. That being said, I still give this hotel a strong rating - so long as you know what you're getting!", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakebay, Washington", "Title": "\u201cLove the hospitality and the service.

This hotel appeared to be at its busiest around breakfast and was sometimes difficult to find a table, however no one appeared concerned with sharing. Fruit, juice, scones (biscuits in the US), gravy, bacon, and sausages. The room we stayed in was pleasant and spacious. This is a hotel to enjoy and not be in too much of a rush, the elevators will make sure you take your time. The decor and the elevators are all very old that provides a lovely charm to the property and you can put yourself make in the day when it would have been a different hustle and bustle with elevator operators etc. There are limited restaurants in this area, however there is a nice Texmex sports bar 1 street away that you can access through the valet parking area. In addition there are several other small quant bars and the locals are very happy to have a chat which is nice. Dallas was nice for a stopover, but for more than a few days I think you would want to see more of Texas as tourism seems to be a less important industry to Dallas city at the current time. JFK musesum/ 6th Floor museum is an excellent and close building to the Magnolia incl the train station. If your game, take a little stroll with some of the conspiracy theorists that will certainly help understand more of the evidence from a non-governmental perspective. HOT TIP!

We were very impressed with the extras the hotel provided. Between a complimentary drink when we arrived between 5:30&6:30, and an amazing continental breakfast, they have me hooked. Usually when I go to a hotel breakfast, I expect some donuts, cereals, not-so-great eggs, etc. Well, this breakfast was closer to a full-on brunch than the typical hotel breakfast. They had fresh bacon, fresh eggs, good (not cheap) french toast, fresh oatmeal.... it was more of a buffet than a breakfast imo, and I was glad I made it up in time! Anyway I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're visiting downtown Dallas. Great for couples, or a quick weekend away. I would recommend parking across the street though... there is a Neimann Marcus parking garage... instead of using the valet. The garage is cheaper (I think) and you don't need to wait 20 minutees for the valet to get your car when you're ready to go.

The hotel is average in nearly every way. One young woman, Tory, was very friendly and helpful. A man on Sunday afternoon was quite helpful about the route to Dealy Plaza. Other front desk staff were fine, but nothing above what one should expect. Most were pleasant, but not of the outstanding level that some reviews implied. True and typical Texan friendliness--which I find nearly everywhere in the state--was not that evident here. Some staff were worse than average. The man at the breakfast buffet Monday morning was just plain rude, when i asked where i could put the used plates (it was a self-service place, after all). I called a \"guest service\" person to ask where there was an ice machine. She curtly told me to go up to the 25th floor. I get in the elevator--NO 25th floor on the panel. Thinking i might have heard wrong,I got out on 26th floor(where the hall carpet was filthy, as if a vacuum cleaner had unloaded excess dirt and dust in a pile) No ice. I returned, empty ice buck in hand, to my room on 21st fl. Call guest service lady again. She replied, impatiently,that i have to go to the one elevator (of 4 or so) that goes to 25th floor, and look on the side of the elevator door to call the one for the 25th floor. That would have been nice to know in the first place. We checked in on a Saturday. Sunday morning, friend had run 13 miles in the weekend's half-marathon (the source of many hotel guests) . He returned, achey and exhausted, at 1:30 pm, just wanting to nap. Room not refreshed or made up, so i called guest service and ask if room can be made up, so friend can nap without being awoken by housekeeper. Two more calls later, after two more hours...finally housekeeper shows up, at 4:30 pm! When i asked guest services guy why it was so late , he said, \"We had a lot of people checking out.\" OK--but what about people who were paying for an additional night--don't we get to have clean rooms by afternoon ? Scary elevators mentioned elsewhere on TA--yes, quite unpredictable Each elevator has a metal plaque warning of this--forewarned is forearmed-- in a cute humourous way. However, the signs were scratched up, lending an air not of historic charm, but just plain old. That was my sense of the entire hotel. Historic charm was less in evidence than drab and dull. Hallway and room were dark--could barely read or see even with all desktop lamps turned on. (There are no ceiling lights.) Only the shower had a bright light (in a glass wall recess) . Colors of room--yellow and brown. A room can be basic, but at least \"inviting\" enough to enjoy just kicking back and wtaching TV,etc. This room was so drab and dreary, i didnt want to spend any extra time in it. There was one bathrobe in a two- bed room. (They must figure the second person can do without one) No folding luggage rack--so had to open suitcase on one of few surfaces--the desk--making it unusable for other purposes. On the plus side, beds were comfortable, and breakfast itself was very good, with scrambled egg and cheese dish, plus oatmeal, and bagels, etc. And people at the evening liquor reception were having a blast!! The lounge on the second floor was lovely. Perhaps \"free\" liquor explains the positive memories and high ratings. Also, do not use the valet parking. There are public lots within a block or two--much cheaper. Across the street, the one for \"Nieman-Marcus \" was officially about $10/24 hours--and both Sunday and early Monday morning, had free exiting. Upon return home, i rec'd a survey email from Magnolia askeing that i give them top scores so they can be #1 on Tripadvisor!!! Maybe that explains a number of once-only, one sentence, reviews here. At least in my experience, the glowing reviews are not deserved, unless the free alcohol is a big draw for a prospective guest.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheltenham", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and helpful staff, very clean and excellent food\u201d", "Author": "petmadness", "ReviewID": "UR104076787", "Content": "We had two rooms on the 20th floor which had excellent views out.

The location is amazing, everything we wanted to do was within 3 miles of the hotel. The room was clean, the bed was soft, and the pillow didn't make me wake up with a crick in my neck...which I totally appreciate. I've read other reviews about the elevators being scary... I didn't find the elevators scary at all, but that could be because I was expecting the worst, but really they were okay...so don't be afraid to ride the elevator. The wine reception hour was not what I was expecting, it was a small table set up in the lobby with 2 large ice buckets and 2 guys pouring basic drinks - I ended up pouring mine out. Some reviews imply that you get mulitple drinks, that is not the case - you get one drink coupon...but still, that is one more drink coupon than you get at most other hotels so I'm not complaining, I'm jus' sayin'. =) We were out getting our party on so I can not speak for the milk and cookie hour, but how can anybody go wrong with milk and cookies? Ha. The free \"expanded\" continental breakfast left me wanting for more, but that could've been from the hangover?!? They did have an omelet station that you could pay $6.00 more per person to have, but we decided to skip that station and just eat what was included. What was included? Breakfast potatoes, Chicken spicy nachos (weird!), Bran cereal, Oatmeal, Bagels, and Toast. They ran out of Orange juice so I was bummed about that, but no huge biggy. I was pleasantly surprised with the Valet service. They were rockin, seriously!! We checked in, called down for our bags, and within 5 minutes our bags were in our room. We left for a night out on the town and we had the hotel car take us to our first order of business, dinner. We didn't have to wait for the car, it was available so we took advantage of it and didn't have to take a taxi, it was nice surprise. We finished dinner late so the car wasn't available to pick us up but we happened across a limo service that we had drive us around for the rest of our night. We checked out this morning at 10:30a and when we went to the valet desk to hand in our ticket (we weren't allowed to call down for the car since it was Sunday?) we only waited about 7 minutes for our car.

When you first arrive and pull up to the valet stand you are immediately greeted by the friendly staff. Valet was $22 for overnight but well worth it when you aren't familiar with Downtown Dallas, you are also allowed unlimited in and out privileges. The lobby was beautiful and everyone at the front desk was very nice and got us up to our room in no time. Also, when I booked my room I requested a high level and they had us on the 26th floor. The view was awesome!! We had to upgrade our room to the King Accessible because that was all that was available. I was awesome! Another one of the couples that where there with us had a deluxe room with a queen and their room seemed very small but they were pleased with it. The other couple also had the same queen room and theirs was much bigger so I don't know why that is. We were told that they had a free shuttle service within 3 miles of the hotel and we were going to Fair Park and they said that was within area. Awesome, right? Well the only problem was that we would need to be picked back up at about 1am. Their free shuttle service closed at 10pm. My husband and brother-in-law talked to the guys at the shuttle desk and somehow we ended up with a private shuttle, or should i say our own private GMC Yukon, that was on call for us the entire night. We were given his cell phone number to call him when we were ready to be picked. So we call him to come get us from Fair Park and he said to give him 20 minutes but he was there in more like 10 minutes. So after that we asked him to take us a another bar somewhere close. He said he would be back to get us at 2 when the bar closed and sure enough he was waiting on us when we came out!! So then after a long night of having fun with friends we were hungry so we asked James, our driver, if he knew somewhere closer to the hotel to eat at. And of course he did! He took us to Cafe Brazil and it was AMAZING! When we were ready to go he was waiting! So our experience with transportation service at the hotel was beyond 5 stars. Our driver was James and we would highly recommend him to everyone. Only a few things that were a disappointment but everything else was so great that's why I still gave 5 stars! Complaint #1: for me the beds were very uncomfortable but I'm also use to my TempurCloud so any bed would be hard to even compare. Complaint #2: someone from the staff was beating on our door at 8:30am!! We even had the Do Not Disturb on the door!!! If I had not of had such a wonderful night the night before, I would have been throwing a fit! I know it wasn't that early but when you NEVER get to sleep in due to work schedules and kids, not to mention getting to bed at 4:30am, it can really ruin your day. Especially when check out isn't until 11, which we planned on sleeping until then!! Overall, great experience, will definitely be returning, and recommend this hotel to everyone we know!!!

The valet to me was worth it, you can come and go as you please and not have to fight traffic looking for parking all for $22.00 per night. I didnt mind that. I loved all the different lounging/sitting options in the hotel. It was a very cozy feel. I wish the hotel room's atmosphere was as comfy as the lounge areas. The receptions was cool, the free cookies and milk, as well as the free spirits at 530 was a nice touch. The breakfast wasnt bad, but the omlette station had a fee, I didnt mind that either. I like the restaraunt nect door, The Iron Cactus, good food, There is a breakfast place within walking distance that has good food at a cheap price. We rented a car and drove around dallas so we were not just limited to the downtown area. For the most part I would recommend this hotel.

We slept well and enjoyed just relaxing in our room. Room service was prompt and tasty when we needed an evening snack (be aware of the gratuity that's mandatory!). The breakfasts were slightly varied each day. Starbucks is right off of the lobby if you need high test coffee. Cocktail hour was nice (limited to beer and wine), and the cookie bar was yummy.

And the main question people need to ask when writing an HONEST review is simply, \"Did I get what I paid for?\" If I'm paying top-dollar in a hotel, was the service I received worth the money I paid...? Many times, people will write a bad review based on a SINGLE incident that may not have gone the way they wanted. And most of the time, it's something that policy doesn't allow or something simple that could have been avoided with better preparation by the guest. I'm telling you, the staff at Hotel Magnolia \"gets\" it. They understand the process and they anticipate guest's needs better than any hotel I've ever stayed at! My girlfriend and I were staying for the Cowboys v. Saints game on Thanksgiving and booked blindly, based mostly on reviews and word-of-mouth. When we checked in, the valet was on our car before we could blink. Then, when we checked in we were offered an upgrade without even asking for one. And trust me, most front desk staff are either too lazy to re-block a room or don't care enough to offer. And I don't normally give employee names when I write a review, but Sophia is one of the sharpest front desk employees they have working for them. Example: Their hot tub was under construction during our stay (which makes sense, if you're going to do maintenance, do it on a holiday when occupancy is low). Of course, this was one of the features that helped us make our decision about which hotel to stay at. Without a second thought she asked us whether we preferred champagne or wine. She not only sent it up immediately, she also added chocolate covered strawberries and bubble bath for us as an added surprise. Very impressive reaction and service considering she had just found out about the hot tub minutes before we did. Exactly the way I would have handled the situation myself! \"What can we offer to you in lieu of an amenity we have deprived you of...?\" It makes me smile that they think that way. After the strawberries, I hopped in the shower and LORD! They have the most PERFECT shower heads in existence! I wanted to stay in for the rest of the trip! They offered a complimentary beer and wine reception and a complimentary set up of cookies and milk at night. Then, complimentary breakfast in the morning!

The second one isn't related to the hotel, it's a regional thing: there is no coffee on weekends in Dallas.

I would NEVER stay again!\u201d", "Author": "Veryunhappyguest27", "ReviewID": "UR74491224", "Content": "The hotel is lovely however, the employees are extremely rude and very unprofessional. I have stayed at many 5 star resorts and hotels and this by far was the WORST experience than I have ever had! When I walked to the front desk, the girl behind the counter RUDELY informed me that I handed her my debit card instead of a credit card. I told her that was how I was paying. Is being wealthy in your bank account an issue these days??? So, she smirked and ran my card. When she gave me the amount I was unclear on the charges so I asked her where the additional $100 came into play? She RUDELY asked \"Did you park valet?\" I said \"Yes\" She said \"Well it is $22 a day. If you don't want to park Valet you can always go get your car and park it yourself! This is DALLAS!\" As if I was from some small town out in the middle of no where and as if I were some PEASANT. I think my jaw dropped! I said NO that is ok, I was just asking for you to clarify. She smirked again and handed me my key and she then asked me... \"IS THAT EVERYTHING?\" As if I WAS BOTHERING HER!!! I said no and took the keys and she just stood there! She didn't say \"Enjoy your stay at the Magnolia....or... If there is anything else please let me know!\" NOTHING. NOT EVEN A SMILE! The room was fine. Clean. HOWEVER, I was woken up at 6 in the morning by my smoke alarm BEEPING non stop. So I called down and they sent someone to look at it. The guy said... Well it is broken. I have to go get another one. And he removed it from the ceiling and DID NOT RETURN! I went to my event.... I was sitting at the table and 3 of my friends who were also staying at the hotel said the SAME THING happened to them with the front desk girl! So I wasn't imagining things! I stayed another night since I didn't feel like driving back tired.... ordered room service which was very good! Then did the express check out so I DID NOT have to meet up with Ms. Nasty Pants again! As I was leaving .... low and behold there she stood at the front desk in all her glory.... SMIRKING AT ME! I just walked to valet... I was entirely too tired to go to the front and speak with a manager. I just didn't have it in me. As I was standing at valet. I was approached by the Valet gentleman and I handed him another place's valet ticket... they were both blue so I could clearly see that happening. WELL he didn't think it was an obvious reason for a mistake. He handed it back and said \"THIS is NOT the Magnolia's!\" I said \" Oh I'm sorry about that\" and began looking through my purse for their ticket. He TURNED HIS BACK to me and said to another employee standing there. \" I have NO IDEA what that WAS ABOUT!\" I just HAD to respond! I was NOT HAPPY at this point! I said \" Well clearly I must have Valet'd somewhere else!\" He looked at me and just WALKED AWAY! I stood there .... jaw dropped on the ground! Another employee saw my reaction and walked over to me and said Ma'am do you have your ticket. I said I am looking for it. He said well what kind of car do you have? I said \"I drive an Infiniti\" He said \"Oh I know which car that is\" I looked at the board of keys and said \"My key is on # blah blah blah\" .... as he handed my key to another valet man... the other employee who so RUDELY turned his BACK earlier walked over and started to YELL at the gentleman helping me! He told him to go stand somewhere else.... and they began bickering right in front of ME!!! As if I were NOT A GUEST at their hotel! I again felt like saying IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING???? I will NEVER EVER EVER stay at this hotel again. I will not recommend it to any of my friends or family memebers. The room was decent.

Most of our free time was spent shopping. I got an e-mail from the Magnolia announcing a weekend package in June that included free valet parking, wine and strawberries, and an upgrade to a suite, all for only $150. I thought it was a great deal. I had never stayed at the Magnolia, but I had heard many good things. The valets were fast and friendly. Check in was quick and easy, since I booked online. We were on the 20th floor, but the elevators were quick, and we were never waiting for one. The room was clean and well appointed. It was also huge. It was about 600 square feet. It was modern, but warm. The paintings on the wall had their own lights. It was a nice touch. The hotel itself retains a lot of the original architecture from 1910, but the lobby, lounge, and rooms are all up to date. The bed was very comfortable, with plenty of pillows and blankets. The wine and strawberries were waiting for us when we got back from dinner. They were quite good. The atmosphere of the lounge was nice. Very subdued. We didn't attend the reception, but we did enjoy the late night cookie buffet. The only complaint I can come up with is the breakfast buffet. While there was a good selection, the pancakes were kind of rubbery, the bacon was thin and not very flavorful, the cereal choices were limited to regular corn flakes or Cheerios; nothing sweet. My wife said the seasoned potatoes were good, as well as the scrambled eggs. The best breakfast I've had at a hotel was at the Kimpton. It was on our honeymoon, and they brought it to our room. We ordered off a menu, though, so I don't think there's a comparison. Anyway, I would definitely stay here again, but I would probably go out for breakfast.

Instead of a gigantic property with a Victorian vibe you'll find a boutique hotel that's oh-so-hip. I arrived after a $55 cab ride from DFW to be greeted by a genuinely friendly staff. The bellman explained have several SUVs available to take guests to nearby attractions for free. But I didn't need the service because so many restaurants were within easy walking distance. Checking in I admired the contemporary decor, which was heavy on reddish wood with clubby furniture upholstered in pastels and the occasional jewel tone. Very sleek and sophisticated. Drew room 1905, which overlooked Commerce Street. As you can see from the photos it featured the same modern look as the rest of the hotel. Road warriors will appreciate the spacious desk and work area, with good lighting and handy electrical outlets. The wi-fi connected quickly and was acceptably fast. The LCD TV had a good picture, and the channel lineup featured both Bloomberg and CNBC. (Margaret Brennan *and* Erin Burnett. Sigh.) The bathroom was fine, although I prefer a little more counter space. Towels, soaps, etc. were top rate. As you can see, the closet contained a comfy, thirsty, terrycloth robe. And in addition to the iron and ironing board there was a little bottle of spray starch. If you're a business traveler who hates to wear a wrinkled shirt (or blouse) this is a nice touch. The bed and linens were as you'd expect from a quality hotel. Clock radio was easy to set. The windows had shades vice draperies, and they were just perfect for keeping the room dark. Didn't spend a whole lot of time sampling the hotel's amenities. But I did find my way to the gym, where there was quite a bit of cardio equipment and lots of flat screen TVs to ease the workout boredom. Skipped the happy hour and cookie break on the second floor, but did make it down for breakfast. The self-serve buffet was top notch, with an excellent selection of hot and cold chow. FAR better than the lame breakfast offerings seen in many hotels. I'd say it was about 80 percent as good as the Embassy Suites spread. (Which as all business travelers know is the gold standard in breakfast buffets.) Business completed I had the bellman arrange for a car back to DFW. For the same price as a dilapidated taxi, he whistled up a shiny Lincoln Town Car driven by a polite young man who had thoughtfully stocked the back seat with the day's paper and some bottled water. Nice touch. All in all I was very pleased with the Hotel Magnolia. It's not quite a modern as the nearby Hotel Joule.

It was my wife, and my 2 children ages 3 1/2 and 21 months. At 9:30 pm after a very long day I requested that a roll-away bed be brought to my room. This bed was supposed to have been available when I checked in. At 10 PM the bed had not arrived and I called again to request it. The lady I spoke to on the phone was very polite and friendly. However, the bed did not arrive by 10:30. At that time I decided to sleep on the floor because my children were asleep and in my spot on the bed and there was no way I wanted to wake them. I put the do not disturb sign on the door. After 11 pm there was a knock on my door and it was the roll away bed. My children had been asleep for over an hour. On Saturday, I picked up my car from the valet and handed in my ticket. When I returned later that afternoon around 2 pm the guy parking my car took my keys and said that I didn't need a new ticked since there was still a ticket on my keys and on my review mirror. I was not given my ticket stub back. That evening at 8:30 I requested at they get my car. I explained why I did not have my ticket and the attendant asked what kind of car I drove and my name. In all fairness the valet guys were slammed, but they had not brought my car by 9 pm. I had to repeatedly remind them that I was waiting for my car. They were always friendly and explained that they were working on it and should have it shortly. At 10 pm I decided that my car and my keys must have been stolen since no one had been able to produce either one. I grabbed one of the valet guys and asked him to jog to the garage with me, in the rain, and then start at the top and run down until we found my car. It took less than 10 minuted to find my car. The valet attendant was able to read the number off of my review mirror ticket and then once back at the hotel, he found my keys immediately. That was super, except my evening plans with my family had been ruined. It was after 10 pm on Saturday and I had 2 toddlers who had been cooped up in the hotel all evening. While I sitting at the valet stand all evening, my wife and some family, who canceled their plans to wait at the hotel with us ate McDonalds in a small conference room generously offered by one of their wait staff who took pity on them. This was nice until another hotel employee ran them out of this room because he needed it the next morning, thus cutting short their controlled environment in which to allow the small children to play and not disturb the other guests in the bar. Overall the employees were very friendly, always smiling and apologetic when things went wrong, however they were completely unhelpful. Furthermore, they showed zero initiative save for the kind lady who opened a small room for our kids on Saturday night. Now that I think of it, I don't even think anyone offered to comp the valet parking after losing my car for an hour and a half. The Magnolia is an attractive hotel and is a very convenient location for us to stay as it is located within walking distance from my brother's loft and we travel to see him frequently.

I had never stayed there before, but remember the red Pegasus on top of the building from my childhood days. When you get to the hotel, you find the first thing that might bother some - parking is pretty much all valet. I'm sure there's some public parking nearby, but the best best is to use the valet. The special rate I got included free valet, though, so this was not a problem. The lobby is very nice - modern and stylish - sorta art deco-ish. Check-in was quick, courteous, and efficient. If you want the free wi-fi, they'll give you the code here, too. The elevators are a little creaky and obviously at least the interiors are original, but there's a sign in the elevator reassuring the passengers that even though the elevators have \"character,\" they are inspected on a regular basis, and are actually quite safe. The room on the 23rd floor was roomy, and had very high ceilings so it seemed even more so. We requested and got two queen beds so there was room for the three of us. Beds were comfortable - that's the most important thing in a hotel room! The cookies and milk in the club were a nice touch before going to bed. Four different flavors of cookies, along with Starbucks coffee and both regular and chocolate milk. For the adults, the bar is open as well. The bathroom was nice and roomy, with a large tub/shower. The tub was not very high walled, but would probably have held two people. The breakfast in the morning was fine - not outstanding, but not bad for a free breakfast. It was set up in the same club as the cookies the night before. There were two choices of eggs - both scrambled, but one with onions and peppers - and two meats - sausage or ham. Potatoes and some breads rounded out the breakfast, along with coffee or juice to drink. Valet took a few minutes in the morning - don't know how far away the parking is.

There's even a pool table around the corner from the bar. I found my room to be quite large and well laid out. Like the rest of the hotel, it was nicely decorated and comfortably appointed.

It is a great location, right in the center of downtown Dallas. It's easy to get to most of the museums, close to the concert arena, and near a lot of great restaurants. It's always SUPER clean. There is no doubt that the sheets on the bed are fresh. I've left hotels before after check-in because I didn't think it was clean enough. I'm a little OCD about that. The Magnolia is spotless. It is beautiful also. It is a historic building and has a lot of character. The breakfast buffet is fresh and full of great choices--pancakes, bacon, eggs, cereal, fresh fruit, granola, cereal, juices, Starbucks coffee, and more. The evening cookies and milk are great for kids, but you see plenty of adults there too. They are fresh and soft, and there are usually 4 or 5 varieties to choose from. There is also a free evening bar with wine and beer. I haven't tried it, but everything they do they seem to really do well so I'm sure it is equally fantastic. I've never really had any complaints at this hotel. The price could be hefty, but they have discounts and deals on such a regular basis that really all you have to do is ask and you will get it for such a low price that you will probably even beat some of the lower level chain hotels in the area. We've never paid more than $110 for a night and for downtown Dallas that is a real steal. If I were to have any complaints to share, it would be that there is no parking so you have to drive down about 1/2 a block and park in a garage, or you could use the valet (we always self park). The other small annoyance is that we always have to go to the side door to get in until we've gotten our room key. The front door is always locked and you must scan your door key to unlock it. Hardly a complaint, but it's all I've got. It's a great place and we have stopped even looking at other hotels.

We reserved a regular room with a Queen sized bed. Upon checkin we were asked if we wanted a higher or lower floor. I asked for a higher floor & we were placed on the 24th of 26 floors. I did it partly for the quiet (which worked) and partly hoping for a view (which didn't, all we could see was another part of the hotel). The blackout curtains in our room were wonderful, we even had a mid afternoon nap & the room was darker than our room at home some nights! The bed was firm & comfortable. The bathroom was nice & the shower had plenty of room & light. The hot water was great & the water pressure was good as well. A lot of hotel showers end up being dark, small or slippery, but this one was just right! I am a fan of included breakfast buffets & they did a great job. Each morning there were scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, bacon, fruit, biscuits, bagels, etc. They also had orange juice, coffee, water & milk. There were also some items that changed, some kind of mexican dish (DH liked, I did not) & I also saw what looked like pancakes or waffles on other tables, but I never saw them at the buffet so I must have missed them. The evening cocktail hour was nice. We were too late for it the first night, but we each got 3 tickets for the 2nd night which could be used for beer, wine or soda. There was also a full bar, so if you don't want one of these you can order something else for a charge. We never made it for the milk & cookies, but they were advertised as being available from 8-10pm. The area around this hotel seemed safe, we walked it both evenings & nights & never felt a threat. We had a late dinner one night at the Iron Cactus, which was really good. There are certainly plenty of options for both regular dinners & late night eating & drinking! We also walked to the American Airlines Center, just a bit less than 1 mile away.

The suites have a full kitchen with stove, oven, microwave, full refrigerator (great!), and glasses, dishes & utensils. The kitchen was very clean. Our bedroom was very small - with just room for the queen bed (no kings) and end tables -- no closet or drawer space. The closet was like a hall closet in the entry area, so it made getting dressed a bit awkward when there were people in the room. Had to keep our clothes in the suitcases on the floor. The bedroom in our other suite was noticeably larger; however, our suite had much better light (5 window facing east with a nice city view) than the other suite, which essentially faced the other side of the building (kind of U shaped building). The queen & double queen rooms were equally nice -- and again just varied from room to room on shape & size & views. The bathroom was nice -- a large oval (no whirlpool) tub and shower -- a bit awkward to get into the tub/shower if you were older or less agile.

The entire staff was very friendly and accomodating. Great hotel in an historic building. Because the hotel is a renovated office building, a few things were different from your average hotel. For example, the ice machine and soda machines were located on one floor so if you wanted anything you either went to the bar or the floor where the machines were. Not a big deal, but they could post a sign or add it to your room key sleeve to help you find them. The weekend we stayed, the Cotton bowl was playing at the new Cowboys stadium. The crowds from these two teams were very rowdy and loud. We only stayed Saturday night, but there was yelling and very loud singing in the streets from about midnight until 2:30 a.m. when the cops showed up. We could hear all of this from the 14th floor.

We didn't have a view out of our window, but that wasn't a big deal for us. The staff was nice and the valet parking was great! It was worth the money not to have to worry about parking. Since we didn't know our way around we ate at the mexican restaurant next door, The Iron Cactus, and it was good and reasonable. The only thing that was disappointing was the complimentary breakfast. It is served until 10:00 am, but when we came downstairs at 9:30 everything was gone and they were putting it away, which means we had to go down the street and pay to eat breakfast. The complimentary breakfast was one of the things that helped make our decision of where to stay.

There were no cars available and no wreckers to come assist. On Saturday, wrecker said the underside of the car was damanged--no cooling fluid and a rip in the radiator. The car rental manager gave us a grim predication: we'd be liable since the hotel had a 3rd party vendor, the valet service. They said the hotel would probably not help and blame the valet service and visa versa. My daughter has stayed at Magnolia twice before and loved it. She has recommened it to her friends in DC (where she lives). I realized on Saturday that my future son in law got the parking fee on his room bill (although I requested it on mine at check-in).

Jon the bartender (who was fantastic) served guests with free draft beer, and free wine during that hour. We did not stay after that hour so I am not sure of the prices after that. Jon was very helpful in sharing about local places to visit. From 8-10 each evening they have complimentary milk and cookies. They have about 3-4 different types of cookies for your pleasure. Finally each morning they have a breakfast which has eggs, potatoes, and a meat. The breakfast was excellent and a great way to start the day. We did walk into the weight room which looked nice, but the hot tub was TOO hot. They do have a business center with printers on the second and third floors. The people here are outstanding! Everyone from the manager to the valets were very friendly, helpful, and all around welcoming! The walk to some of the attractions range from 5-15 minutes. We did all the tourist stuff (JFK 6th Floor Museum, Southfork, Dealey Plaza, Fort Worth). Hofbrau Steaks is excellent (short walk), Sonny Bryans was very good too. I cannot say enough about this hotel. The only drawback could be the parking which is 22.00 per day plus tax. It does have in/out privledges and I was able to get my car very fast.

The shower had stains in it and the tile was not as nice as what you would find in a manufactured home. In addition, the water would not stay hot for the duration of a shower/bath. We experienced some not-so-pleasant lukewarm bathing. Breakfast buffet was simple eggs and fatty sausage served on plates the size of tea saucers and there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough tables for everyone to sit at so you had to wait until someone got up secure a place to eat your food. We stayed two nights and decided to sleep in past breakfast the next day because it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth getting out of bed for. They give you drink coupons as you arrive but they are only good for their one hour daily happy hour so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really not that big of a perk unless you are accustomed to using your three drink coupons per person within the 5:30 PM \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 6:30 PM time frame\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6how convenient, happy hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over now so drinks are on you! To top things off, at the end of the trip we had to wait 35 minutes for the valet to return our car! We tried calling the valet from our room in advance but their line was busy for 30 minutes so we decided to just go down and get it. When we got to the lobby it was PACKED full of people waiting for their vehicles. Finally we walked further outside of the circle drive to see what the hold up was and saw our car locked up on the side of the building. We finally flagged down one of the many valets walking around like chickens with their heads cut off and asked if we could please get our keys and he shrugged and came back 10 minutes later with them in hand. All in all, our experience could have been worse but it was NOT what we expected to say the least.

I was a little hesitant after reading some of the previous reviews, but I have to say the Magnolia exceeded all my expectations. Check-in and Check-out were a breeze (only a few short minutes each time). The room, two double beds on the 22nd floor, was well kept with lots of character. The bed and duvet covers were quite comfortable and caused me to sleep in past breakfast several times. The layout was a little different than a typical room however it was still very practical. The only thing I would have liked to see different in my room was a newer TV. The TV's are a little older with only average picture quality and channel options. The free hot breakfast was better than most 'free' breakfasts. It was a little different every day but consisted mainly of eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, hashbrowns, toast, bagels, yogurts, milk, juice and starbucks coffee. There was more than enough to choose from and more than enough to go around. The second level lounge has great atmosphere and a great 'free' cocktail hour. It is well decorated and offers numerous couches/lounges, free pool table, free nintendo wii, and great company. The bar staff were quite friendly and one in particular 'Bishop' pours a great drink. The milk and cookie time is another great perk of the Magnolia. The assortment of fresh baked cookies were complimented with white milk, chocolate milk, or coffee. The valet service, which has been heavily criticized definitely seemed like a bit of a cluster. We rented a vehicle for our stay in Dallas but chose to self park instead of using the valet service. Valet is about $22 a day however for less than half the price (about $8/day) you can park your own car in the same parkade the valet uses. The parkade is about 1 block away but an easy safe walk from the hotel. It was quite comical to see the valet drivers sprinting back and forth from the parkade numerous times a day. Another critique of the hotel, the elevators, never seemed to be a problem for us. Although we stayed on the 22nd floor we never had to wait more than 2 minutes for a ride. A small price to pay for staying at such a beautiful hotel. The only pitfall of this hotel that I found was the food. There is no 'official' restaurant on site however a limited amount of food items can be purchased through room service or on the level 2 lounge. We did however become quite fond of the Iron Cactus Restaurant which is located right next to the hotel. Great food for great value. Although Downtown Nightlife seemed a little quiet, everything is a short cab ride away and there were always plenty of cab drivers willing to give you a ride.", "Date": "December 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cOops!

The bedroom furniture and linens were great. The living couch and chair need to be replaced. The bathroom was large and well appointed. The kitchen had all the essentials and everything worked well. There were a ton of windows for great light and I found it very quiet. I do not think I saw anyone esle on my floor.

The location of the hotel is great -- close to mass transit and alot of the tourist stuff as well. My family was able to walk most anywhere during the day. At night, this area is deserted (as it is the business district) not at all like downtown Chicago or DC. This area is also going through a lot of redevelopment of the high rises so there is a lot of construction which makes the area alittle disconcerting at night. My only disappoint was consistently with the service. We arrived late --after 11pm --due to flight delays and check in took over 45 minutes! The reason for the delay is that even though they took my ID to locate our reservation -- they proceeded to check me in as someone else! When I went to sign the paperwork I noticed that we did not have the right daily cost per night nor did I have a reservation for the right number of nights. Therefore, we had to start all over with the check-in process. Other issues were with customer service when we asked for extra towels it took 2 hours and 2 phone calls to receive them. This also happened with a request for an ironing board and even room service took much longer than we were told. The hotel does not have a conceirge regardless of what they say. We could not get reccomendations to restaurants nor could we even get directions to well known locations -- one theater was literally 2 blocks away and noboby could say how to get there!

It's situated in downtown Dallas - lots of nifty Art Nouveau buildings nearby. This was the old Magnolia Oil building. The elevator lobby is gorgeous - old lamps and the flying Pegasus logos on the elevators. There is a little sign in each elevator (holds 8, but is roomy) to please be patient with their quirks. They were quite the modern conveyance when installed over 100 years ago! The Adolphus Hotel is just across the street - peek in and see the lobby! The original Neiman-Marcus store is just up the block (great lunch cafeteria), and the Urban Market is wonderful for snacks and water. Don't miss the Art Nouveau stained glass on the Joseph Banks store across the street - wonderful scene of Thor handing down electricity to the world. Thomas Edison is a gargoyle on that building! The Starbucks in the lobby is very handy. PROS: Hotel was basically full. I had a single queen room on the 19th floor. Elevator service was average to speedy. The halls were extremely quiet. Nice leather easy chair, wonderful big bathroom with drawers and a nice cabinet, large work desk, free fridge, lots of big windows and a nice view of the old Art Nouveau buildings. Staff was friendly and courteous - both front desk and bell staff. Room service was amazing. I ordered a wedge salad and a cheese BLT. It was $17 - with an additional tip!! The meal was huge. Homemade - warm! - cookies before bed in the lounge were a treat each night. Big closet - with a light inside - and the full length (large) mirror were a help. A light in the shower was also nice. CONS: The bedding wasn't at all what I expected. My sheets didn't quite fit the bed, and they had been washed so many times they felt threadbare. The top sheet had two small holes in it, in fact. The pillows were small and flat - I used three of them to sleep on. They were clean, but they were never changed in the three nights I was there. The bathtub is designed so that the water flows out freely onto the floor during a shower. Be prepared to mop up! The drawers are small and slim - no room for large items. The internet wireless was cranky, but it did work each day. Overall, I would definitely stay here again for a good price - but I would ask for different sheets.

The only thing I was bummed about is no pool, but they told us we can use the one at a place across the street. We went across the street and you have to walk through a restaurant to get to the pool so it wasn't ideal.

I had a contract with the hotel through the sales office for a large quantity of rooms. The hotel was ALWAYS helpful with the changes that I made and the staff was more than willing to aid me at every turn. When I finally arrived at the hotel after a year of contact with the staff I was pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel pictures I'd seen online in multiple places were WELL REPRESENTED in reality. The hotel is very stylish and the decor is sweet! Upon check-in the staff were friendly, helpful, and prompt in getting me in my room and off my feet. The room was VERY nicely appointed with a full kitchen, separate living room area, large bathroom with over-sized garden tub, and private bedroom. The decor, paint, furniture, ammenities and service were all TOP NOTCH! I stayed in the hotel for a week and it was the most comfortable stay I've had in a while. The bed and its multiple layers of bedding were always sure to put me straight to sleep! I never saw anyone else on my floor until I had been there about 3 days. The floor was VERY quiet and I never had any problems with the downtown ambient noises. I stayed on the 17th floor and I rarely heard any noises below. The only bad thing (as minute as it is) was that the Continental Breakfast was VERY BASIC. They had 2 or 3 kinds of muffins, 2 kinds of fruit pastries, milk, 3 kinds of juice, cereal, and coffee. I somehow expected more for the price of a nightly stay. BIG TIP: There is an URBAN MARKET grocery store across the street. If you have a suite like I did...you'll save money by shopping and cooking your meals. The nightly Cookies and Milk service was a nice touch to the long evenings I had through the week. I was a little bothered by the $10/night INTERNET charge, especially when I kept loosing my wireless signal. They eventually worked out the kinks and I stopped getting booted offline. $20.00/night parking was a little outrageous. If you stay here HERE IS A BIG TIP on SAVING MONEY TO PARK: 1) DURING THE DAY Park your car in the SAME GARAGE that the VALET uses 1blk away. $1.00/hr. 2) After 6pm PARK ON THE STREET at the meters (FREE) Once the Parking Garage closes at 10pm you cant get your car out by self-service, which is what makes VALET look like a better choice. DONT FALL FOR IT! PARK ON THE STREET! I was in a very nice car and it was never bothered over the 7 nights I was there. With this method, the most I paid daily for parking was $6.00.

We received our champagne and strawberries around 6 pm and went down to the front desk on our way out to dinner at 7 pm and inquired about the remaining items of our package (robes, cd, turndown service with cookies/milk). We were told that they would arrive between 8-9 pm and that it would be left in the room if we were not there. We returned a little after 9 pm to find no such items in our room. We called the front desk and requested the remaining items along with 2 additional washcloths. 30 minutes past and we called again. After this call we received a call from a porter who verified our request and said he would be up shortly. It was around 10:15 pm when he arrived and he had forgotten the washcloths, the CD that was a part of our package was unavailable because they were \"out\", and we never received the turn down service. The next morning I called again and we finally got the washcloths and our breakfast came on time, but was missing an entree and we had to call back to get condiments such as syrup for the pancakes we ordered. Lastly, we had a 2 pm check-out inluded with our package and yet the maid service knocked and entered the room at 9:30 am and again at 11:30 am while we were still trying to enjoy what little peace we could before leaving. Upon check-out we received 1/2 off the room after we explained our discontent and were informed that we received the wrong room which also should have had a view.

The Magnolia is a cute, boutique-ish hotel located in the heart of downtown Dallas. I lived in Dallas for 7 years and know the area well. I'd never stayed at the Magnolia, so on a recent visit, I booked a room there out of curiosity more than anything else. First off, the Magnolia is cheap! My room (with a King bed, love seat, tv, desk, fridge, coffee maker, wireless internet, etc.) was $85/night. The room was tastefully decorated and had a warm, inviting feel to it. The hotel was originally an office building from the early 1900s, and I was impressed that they were able to lose the loft/warehouse feel that so many old converted buildings have. The room was reasonably sized, on the 11th floor, and relatively quiet. The bathroom was larger than average, and the closet was large enough for me to hang all my clothes. The room had signs of wear \u00e2\u20ac\u201c small hole at the base of one wall, broken door on the armoire, dresser drawers difficult to pull out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it was clean, the bed was comfortable, and there were extra blankets in the closet (though I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need them). Overall, the room was cute. You can tell that Magnolia tried to make it stylish and accommodating, but the fit and finish were a little on the cheap side (pseudo tile in the bathroom, laminate surfaces for the counter, furniture that could have come from Ikea). Still, the general effect was thoughtful and stylish enough for me to overlook the minor drawbacks. And at $85/night, I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like complaining about anything. The room served my needs just fine. House keeping was unobtrusive and good. The hotel boasts free happy hour daily (from 5:00 to 6:00, I believe) and complimentary breakfast for all guests. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother with happy hour, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d skip the breakfast if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re someone who likes a good meal in the morning. The spread consisted of semi-stale blueberry scones, blueberry muffins, mini cups of yogurt, some fruit, and standard juices and coffee. One visit to the breakfast buffet was enough. The other days I went down to the adjoining Starbucks. While downtown Dallas doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much life on the weekend, the Magnolia is right in the middle of what is there. The original Neiman Marcus is 2 blocks away, and several restaurants/nightclubs are located on the same block as the hotel. So you can easily walk to dinner and drinks. If you wanted to get the West End, I suppose you could walk there as well, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d opt for a cab to go that distance. If you drive to the hotel, the parking situation is valet only. I think the fee is $20/day with unlimited in/out privileges \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reasonable for a downtown hotel. The valet operates 24 hours a day, and the gentlemen who work there are friendly and helpful. The rest of the staff was friendly and efficient as well. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d caution against having drinks in the lounge. I stopped in for a nightcap one evening, and the bartenders were generally incompetent (10- to 15-minute wait for a drink) and had more than one customer sending them dirty looks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a few choice words. When I ordered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153top-shelf\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd martini, the bartender who made it, intentionally poured my drink \u00c2\u00be full, then (while I sat right there) turned to his co-worker and notified him that he needed to try what was left in the shaker because it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the good stuff.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I just laughed, but some of the people sitting at that bar would have taken those as fightin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 words. So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the mood for a drink, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend one of the nearby bars/restaurants. On the whole, I have no complaints for the Magnolia. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a full-service hotel with friendly staff who seem genuinely interested in making your stay pleasant. The location is great, and as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said, the price is right on the money. I will caution that the price tends to draw a clientele that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more on the rowdy side. While my room was quiet and peaceful, the lobby area (with a bar/lounge on the second floor) was pretty noisy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially late in the evening. But there are plenty of secluded places to sit, so you take in some good people watching if the mood strikes or just go up to your room for a cozy night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. For now, the Magnolia is probably the hippest hotel in the area. But in the coming months, the W and Ritz Carlton will be opening just a mile or so away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though they will certainly be at a different price point. Until then, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend the Magnolia, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay there again the next time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in D town.", "Date": "December 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel-beware of housekeeping\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4153039", "Content": "I had the opportunity to stay at the Magnolia Hotel in Dallas, TX November 11, 2005.

Nifty restaurant/bar/lounge in contemporary open area with an atrium looking over the lobby on the next floor. Would be a very comfy spot to bring your laptop and work if you were there for several days. Overall effect reminded us of Jetsons-style decor if it were simultaneously peaceful and elegant! Rooms had fresh, contemporary decor. We had a queen suite with a full kitchen, bath with oversized oval tub. Beautiful and restful. Decorated in attractive shades of butterscotch and gray. Very comfy bed w/ feather pillows w/ embroidered cases, foam pillow in closet. Furniture looked good but could be a little more comfy in some cases (minor quibble). Friendly & competent bell and reception service. Didn't try room service, but menu looked very promising (not alarmingly ambitious, and a couple of notches above typical room service in similar-class hotels). Only downside - we were on 16th floor but still got quite a bit of truck noise early TG morning around 5-6 a.m. Would definitely recommend if you're staying in downtown Dallas.

I have mixed feelings about our stay: The Good: \u00e2\u2013\u00aa Beautiful boutique Hotel with good central downtown location. \u00e2\u2013\u00aa Outstanding staff (sans GM) that seems to really care and are very helpful. \u00e2\u2013\u00aa One hour free cocktails each evening from 5-6pm. \u00e2\u2013\u00aaLocal, free shuttle service. The Bad: \u00e2\u2013\u00aa Internet access is $9.95 daily \u00e2\u2013\u00aa Mixers not on the \"gun\" are $3-4 dollars \u00e2\u2013\u00aa Continental breakfast is very lame \u00e2\u2013\u00aa General Manager is non-existent Details: We were in town for a convention and had originally planned to stay at the Hyatt. We read the Magnolia website and decided for the latter. We were led to believe (website) that internet access was provided, wrong! When I called the GM (voicemail) upon check-in to express my disappointment, I never heard back. In my opinion, internet access is as basic as shampoo and a hair dryer, particularly at this price point. HI Express and Fairfield offer this service gratis for Pete\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake, not to mention a much better continental breakfast (read below). Secondly, we went to the cocktail hour one evening. I ordered vodka and cranberry and my wife order a vodka and tomato juice. We were charged $3.50 for the tomato juice, since it was not available on the \"gun\". Also, if you are not available between the narrow time period of 5-6pm; forget it, a mixed bar well drink is $6 and up. The continental breakfast was the biggest disappointment; very poor food quality and selection. Choices (and I am being kind) consist of small, recently thawed scones or muffins. However, if you arrive very early, you may be rewarded with a small container of yogurt. Oh, coffee and hot water are also provided. No fruit, juice, cereal, etc. Again, totally unacceptable for a hotel at this price point. Bottom Line: I would not stay at the Magnolia Hotel again. There are simply too many choices, to tolerate these basic lack of amenities.", "Date": "October 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cSuites are HUGE!\u201d", "Author": "tarheelgirl03", "ReviewID": "UR3807495", "Content": "My family and I recently stayed at the Magnolia hotel for one night and we were incredibly impressed. If we weren't flying out the next day, we probably would have tried to extend our stay! ROOM: We booked a Signature Suite since we were traveling with our 7 and 10 year olds and wanted extra room to spread out. Boy, did we ever have that! The room was absolutely huge! In some previous reviews, the suites have been compared to a small apartment and that couldn't be any more true. As a matter of fact, I think I've lived in smaller apartments! The suite had three closets (not sure what we'd use all of them for but they were there if needed) and a nice view of downtown. The only thing in the room that I was a bit perplexed by was the fact there wasn't a door on the bedroom. Granted, the bedroom was located on the other side of the kitchen and, therefore, you couldn't see the bedroom from the living room, but, it still seemed weird. Plus, if the kids had to get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night they could clearly see us in bed. BATHROOM: The bathroom was large and the products (shampoo, conditioner, bath gel & lotion) smelled yummy. There were two sinks and a very long counter area. The shower was also really neat since it was in a large oval tub. There was definitely space to move around and the terry cloth shower curtain was a nice touch. KITCHEN: The kitchen in the room is just as it looks on the website and it was totally stocked with pretty much anything you'd need if you were staying for a few days. The cupboards were even stocked with dishes, glassware, wine glasses, pots & pans and even measuring cups! There was a large refrigerator, stove, oven, microwave, and dishwasher! Since we only stayed one night, we didn't use the kitchen but it seems as if they thought of everything you'd need, and then some! FOOD: We ordered room service for dinner and it was very good. The service and presentation of the food was great. Since they offer complimentary cookies & milk from 9-11, we just had to partake (the kids couldn't wait!) While this was a nice touch, the cookies weren't quite as fresh as I thought they would be. The sugar cookies were ok but the peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies were pretty hard. Regardless, it was a nice touch and the kids loved it. We had the complimentary breakfast the next morning as we left for the airport and it was pretty good. They had a selection of scones and yogurt and provided just the right amount of food to get us out the door. Not sure if I'd like the selection if we had stayed more than one day but it worked out well for what we needed. It was also really nice to have a Starbucks right there for a big shot of caffeine to get our day started. SERVICE: All of the employees we encountered were very nice. The gentlemen at the front desk were pleasant and were proactive in offering information before we had to ask. All in all, we had a great night and the room was a bargain for how large it was. I can see my husband and I going back sometime without the kids to enjoy the downtown ambience and great restaurants.", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "United States", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!!\u201d", "Author": "vegastraveler", "ReviewID": "UR3761693", "Content": "I have stayed in several hotels in Dallas, but looked into the Magnolia after reading about it on Tripadvisor. It was perfect! I really loved everything about this hotel. I rarely stay in 3 star hotels, usually 4 or 5 star, so I was hesitant especially with the outrageously low rates, but I feel the Magnolia should be rated a true 4 star hotel. I had a queen room that was very nice... very large, the furnishings looked brand new, leather chair, lots of lamps, full length mirror, three windows, large bathroom with nice tub. The entire hotel, including the rooms is decorated a very chic, modern decor, and I actually got some ideas for my own home. A friend traveling with me had the deluxe room which is actually the size of an apartment with separate bedroom and living room and a full kitchen, and it was decorated just as nicely. We enjoyed our room service breakfast, but there is a complimentary continental breakfast set up everyday on the second floor which looked nice with a selection of pastries and muffins with juice and coffee. The hotel also offers room service for dinner. Everyone on staff was extremely gracious and helpful. We encountered no service problems whatsoever. They were very nice when we we forgot our shopping bags and cell phone on two separate occasions after our car had been valeted. The valet charge is high, but I expect that for any hotel and valet parking. The location is great too.

We asked for a room w/a view & were placed in a corner room on the 24th floor, from which we could see Neiman Marcus below, the Cotton Bowl & the State Fairgrounds in the distance, and everything in between.

The 2nd floor is dedicated to numerous small intimate seating areas for guests to sit & talk, read a book in front of the fireplace, have a drink w/friends, watch a ballgame, or even play billiards. No matter how many people were there, we always felt we had a \"private\" spot. The evening reception has \"standard fare,\" - true -- but the cheese, veggies, crackers, chips, & salsa, along w/the free drinks -- were served w/a smile, and there was always someone quietly cleaning up any mess from the people before you. We were walking distance to the Convention Center, the West End, and the Kennedy Memorial. The public library is just a couple of blocks, & the newly opened & fantastic \"Iron Cactus\" is LITERALLY out the back door. We thoroughly enjoyed the hot tub on the 3rd floor. It is in a corner room off the gym w/ barred but open (meaning no glass) windows, so the crisp outside air is a factor, but... the tub was warm so the January chill air felt nice.

We stayed two nights and that was about enough since there was indeed a smell in the room, the windows hardly keep any noise from Van Ness out, TV has only 5 channels and it 's not really your dream hotel. But, of course what can you expect for this price and if you consider the area and proximity of many 'attractions' I think it's a good hotel for low budget travellers. Moreover, concerning safety of the building there have been a lot of recent improvements and the manager keeps a strict regime on who is entering: the outer door is open but there is a gate at the reception, where the manager even sleeps to hold guard. It might not look very professional, but we never felt in a dangerous environment. Anayway, if you 're looking for a cheap place to sleep in the city, take your ear plugs and sleeping bag (we preferred this since we had them anyway), and give it a try at the Sonoma Inn is (for a short stay).", "Date": "May 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR462709046", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "A very cool place  Located in the heart of the city, budget hotel with great managers, very nice.

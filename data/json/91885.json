The hotel is in Downtown (think classic Las Vegas) rather than the 'Strip' where many of the modern hotel/casinos and their shows are. You can get to the Strip by bus or taxi in less than half an hour. The hotel rooms are a little old in decor (so no flat screen TV, Internet, bit short on mains sockets) but were clean and well maintained. The bed was comfortable (I prefer a firmer bed rather than a marshmallow) and despite some traffic noise I slept well. Hotel has a really good buffet restaurant with a range of international food that was rally good value.It also has a 'Brew Pub' or microbrewery with some good, award winning beers although these were a little rich for my taste. Buffet and Pub can be busy at peak times and you may need to queue. You can expect to pay a lot less here for good food and drink than hotels on the Strip. It proved to be a good base for visits to the Strip, the Rugby Sevens (staff helpful in booking group transport) and out to locations such as the Grand Canyon. Not really a gambler, so can't comment on the Casino aspect - but get the free 'Connect' card from the Casino that gives you a small discount at the buffet.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu", "Title": "\u201cenjoyed our trip.\u201d", "Author": "Riki M", "ReviewID": "UR126614448", "Content": "Thank you to the friendly and helpful staff at the Mainstreet Station Hotel and Casino.

After getting soaked up on the other end of the strip it was nice to feel like you were getting something for your money (with a nod to the great margarita they made me at 4 Queens). I had a prime rib dinner, and three finely crafted pints of beer for $20 bucks. I noticed the prices for the buffett which is apparently one of the highest rated in Vegas was around $7-8 for breakfast lunch and $10.99 for dinner. We proceeded to the roulette table and played several hours enjoying our luck and the friendly staff. Five dollar minimum bet limit was nice. We asked to see a room and were immediately given a key.

The walk from the elevator to the room was short. We never had to wait for an elevator like at some of the larger hotels. The bad: the outside noise from the roof fans/air conditioning was awful when they fired up! The weatherstripping around one of the windows was missing and the wind whistled in like crazy. The view was of the lower roof and the railroad tracks. We ate at the Triple 7 a few times. The quesadilla appetizer was the best one we tried. The burgers were good, the steak, not so much. Loved the beers. Linda, the bartender was awesome and helpful! The Garden Court Buffet breakfast was pretty good. The seafood buffet was also good. The servers were super prompt taking care of us. The only cranky employee we ever encountered was when we asked to be seated at a different table at the buffet and the hostess gave us attitude. But we just let it roll off us. Hot tip: If you have no coffemaker in your room, just call the front desk. They delivered coffee maker and supplies quickly and did not charge extra (unlike some larger downtown hotels.) We loved the decor and all the woodwork. My husband is a carpenter and he was opening doors and drawers and loving the craftsmanship. It was almost embarrasing when he stroked the wood (heehee.)

Glad I did not pay too much. The hotel is down town, a few blocks from experience, but seems like a long walk when your feet hurt from walking strip and when it's cold. There are low cost hotels closer and from what I was heard better. The room was clean and run down. There was something wrong with the bathtub and they just glued a sheet of plastic? to the bottom. This had a rather strange look and feel. makes you wonder what is under the plastic and if it was comming out from under the plastic in the water as you were showering. Glad I do not take a baths so it only got my feet. The shower itself was very difficult to regulate the temp. Sometimes this was worse than others. You'd have it nice then go hot or cold. I had to plan extra time for showers, almost impossible to regulate temp at certain times. The hotel is a no frills type that wants you think it is high class, it is not. The worst part is the lack of knowledge of the staff. I asked several questions about the area to staff. No one knows anything. I had to call other hotels for info. that Main Street staff should have been able to provide easily. The other hotels could answer my questions without hesitation. At one point I was looking for a service most hotels offer free for their guests everyone surprised not offered at Main street. I could not access the service from other hotels not being a guest. I was very lucky that the Golden Nugget( who provides the service free for their guests) was also able to direct me to where I could get it in the community. Thank you Golden Nugget staff!! Main street did not offer the service and could not even direct me to where to find it. There seems to be no services offered at Main Street. My cell phone died while I was there and had to make an important call. They charge for phone calls from your room, they will not let you use a phone at the desk or in the lobby (a one minute phone call). They do have free parking? I had to call 3 times to find out where it was and was given wrong directions. This is seems very typical for them. I still don't know were the free parking is. I gave up ended up using valet (of course). There is no WIFI in rooms. There is suppose to be Wifi some somewhere in lobby (a small part of lobby across from desk). I did not look. I wanted to download movie to watch on flight while packing and was not able to without taking additional time and dressing and sitting down stairs for down load. Needless to say I did not watch movie on return flight. They offer no room service. I wanted to place an order for food to go. This can not be called in, the resturant will not take calls and doesn't seem to like to making things to go. I ended up buying food from elsewhere when I felt like eatting in not to hassel with them. If you are taking any early tours the Main Street resturant is not open until late and you cannot even get a cup of coffee in the morning before you leave. A bottle of water is $2 in their machine which is all you can get. They do NOT have coffee pots or refridge in rooms. I asked for a refridge in my room for my medication and this was not working right either, hot or frozen like a brick. I asked the cleaning person for an extra shampoo, lets just say not joyfully given. They have no concierge their bell man acts as concierge, useless but will want tip. I found out the day I left that a female can ask the attendant to get the men out of the bathroom so you can see the Berlin wall. They are suppose to have a piece there used as a urinal in the men's bathroom. I thought being a female I was just SOL to see it. Did not get to see because found out leaving Vegas I how to go about it. I'm sure there would be a hassel doing this that they will expect a large tip for this as always in Main Street Station (I am a big tipper anyway, but I hate to be pushed for it). I think I will try elsewhere even if it cost a little more, possibly the Nugget.

The casino is very laid back, as about 80% of the clientele are retired Hawaiians. The best thing about the casino is the full-pay 25 cent 10/7 video poker. It's actually better than 100.17%, as all 4-of-a-kinds get a scratch card for more winnings (as long as you have your B Connected Card in the machine and you wait for the slot attendant before playing another hand. Buffet is excellent and well priced. Also, a very cool coffee shop (Market Street Cafe) is right across the indoor walkway at their sister property, the California. Bottom line, next time I'll stay back at Four Queens (the second best rooms downtown, after Golden Nugget).

Frommer's guidebook lists it as one of the best places to stay in the Fremont Street area. There is a lot to like about Main Street Station. First, the casino and check-in area are really cool: bright and clean, and decorated with a 1900s San Francisco vibe. There is lots of brass and wood; just very nicely executed. This casino caters primarily to people from Hawaii, and you are going to see many, many older, retired Hawaiians milling around. Maybe it's the whole Aloha mentality, but these people are really friendly, but this is about as far from hip and happening Vegas as you can get. Many of the people who work there also seem to have come from Hawaii as well. In addition, the buffet is a very good deal, but not quite as good as it has been in the past: WHAT is the DEAL with casinos no longer serving real cream with coffee? The microbrewery dishes out good pub grub, good beer, and also has a sushi bar just, you know, because. So why only three stars? Well, because of the rooms - and more specifically - the shower. The television was a big 'ol Zenith, probably circa 1995. You can count on about 15 channels, but hey, I didn't come to Vegas to watch TV. The bed and bedding were definitely on the economy side, though it was reasonably comfortable. There is a very small lock box to stash your loot. It was clean and well-kept. This is one of those old-school hotels where there are doors that connect rooms. The heating and A/C are operated by knobs on the unit, not a thermostat on the wall. Again though, it worked. But not the shower. Now, I will say that when you do turn on the water, water comes out the shower, and you get clean. But this is a very, very moody shower, whose water temperature seems dictated by how people are using water in other rooms. You know: it's the old joke of flushing the toilet while someone is taking a shower to hear them shout in disgust. So, often times I would have the shower going at a good temp, only to be blasted by either scalding or icy water. It got to be where I had to ready to jump at any given time in order to avoid this. Taking a shower in my own hotel room made me paranoid about the water that was about to hit me! Ugh. To make things even more bizarre, you turn the water on going \"righty-tighty,\" not \"lefty-loosey,\" so it's backwards. In addition, shower overall was pretty rundown. This really is not acceptable for any hotel. Is Main Street Station a good deal? Probably. But many of the user reviews I see on this website and others rank it between 4 and 4.5 stars. Huh? Maybe they had a working shower or had just hit the jackpot before they wrote their review. (Brief side note: MSS, The California, and The Fremont are all next to each other and all are owned by Boyd Gaming. For Blackjack players such as myself, they offer some of the stingiest rules; you might wish to play elsewhere: for the best rules, walk to El Cortez; conversely, they have great rules on Craps.) If you get a really good deal, you probably won't be disappointed. But Beware of The Shower!

The list of reasons for some could vary, from taking in a few good shows, doing some off the Strip sight seeing, a little shopping here and there, or looking to be pampered by some of the best hotel, spa and resort casinos found in Vegas. Then, we have those who strictly visit for some good ole' fashion hard core gambling--the one's who dream of raking in as much as possible when a \"hot\" roller steps onto the \"crap tables.\" You're not going to find this up on the Vegas strip, nor will it be at some of those beautifully placed hotel casinos situated on the out skirts of Vegas. If you're looking for some real serious good crap table gambling, you better jump on your car and head straight to downtown \"Fremont\" street where all the action is. And for this type of gambling, hands down, we always head straight to the Main Street Station Hotel & Casino and its sister \"Boyd\" hotels, the California Hotel & Casino and Fremont Hotel and Casino. But, let's just concentrate on the Main Street at this time. Of all the Boyd hotels downtown, the Main Street is the newest of all 3 properties, and conveniently adjoined by a walkway to the California hotel. The casino's high ceilings, wooden panels with a touch of stain glass windows here and there and spaciousness, is not a bit overwhelming, but offers a comfortable atmosphere to maneuver about without getting lost. The rooms too, are nice sized, adequate as far as comfort goes, but may be lacking when it comes to the savvy technology offered by many of the 4 & 5 star strip hotels. But, at this point, who cares, we're here for some good crap table gambling and here to make some serious money. The Boyd hotels are mainly frequented by Hawaii visitors who call Vegas their \"9th\" island away from home, and who also come to do some serious gambling being that Hawaii does not offer gambling. The buffet offers some great eats and variety at a very reasonable cost too. It really doesn't matter what restaurants in the Boyd's hotel one chooses to eat at because the food is still great and still quite inexpensive. There is one thing you should all know about those who travel from Hawaii to play the crap tables, they'll surely cheer you on to the very moment you release that pair of dice, they'll wait patiently as you set up to make that winning throw, and they'll give out some high five's and maybe even a little dance or song after your number hits. Hands down, they have some the best & longest rollers I've seen so far. You only see this type of action at the Main Street, California or Fremont hotel. You'll even see \"golden arm\" plaques upon the walls at the California hotel for those who hold the dice for more than an hour plus, and believe me, these hawaiians hold them dice for a long time. If you're an avid craps table gambler, don't lose out on being there during those frequent and special moments when the dice is rolling hot, hot, hot! For those who work the machines only, you'll find a lot of variety and some very good poker machines too. Don't forget to sign up for the Bconnected players card which can be used at all Boyd and Coast properties. The comps are very generous when it comes to rooms and food for players. So, the next time you go to Vegas & want to do some serious gambling, head on downtown, it may not give you the glitz and glamour that the Strip does, but, you're more likely to leave Vegas with some money in that wallet of yours.

They don't have horse racing so all the TV's are tuned into some kind of sport.. If you play craps then you'll want to play at MSS with their 20X odds. The only downside to either property is the BJ rules. Dealer hits soft 17 (pretty much everywhere these days)and there is no double after split. Food is fantastic at both places. We enjoy prime rib and sushi at the 777 Pub at MSS and Steak & Lobster ($17.95) at The Pasta Pirate at The Cal.

Because I have breathing problems, this has now become an unacceptable practice; whereas in the past I was immediately moved at check-in to a nonsmoking room when I confronted the desk clerk, this trip I was required to first spend a night in a room where smoking is allowed. The result was a bloody nose for the week and a brown cast to the water in the water reservoir of the humidifier component of my CPAP machine. This is the only hotel where I consistently face this problem. For 38 years, making travel reservations/arrangements for executives was part of my job; and those executives invariably were given the type of rooms that I reserved.

I'm staying there in May (they sent me a 4 night comp + 50 slot dollars, hence the 5 stars for \"value\"), so I came to look at the reviews. From what I've read, the consensus is that it's a great place to stay. But I did read one review that said something about the slots being \"tight\", and I couldn't disagree more; I had my best gaming experience EVER at Main Street Station last May. Since the overall gaming experience is a major factor for most people when deciding where to park their luggage in Vegas, maybe they'll let my review of the casino slide through even though I've never stayed at the hotel. Main Street Station awards a scratch ticket worth at least $2 anytime you hit 4 of a kind on a video poker machine, so I spent most of my time playing there last year, even though I was staying elsewhere. Over the course of my stay, I probably hit a couple dozen 4 of a kinds (all my tickets wound up being worth $2) and the hostesses were always prompt in bringing the scratch tickets, even during peak hours. I play quarter machines almost exclusively, but I put a hundred dollar bill in a dollar machine with the intent of playing until it was either gone or I had doubled it. Long story short, it was a \"Treasure Chest\" machine, I hit 4 of a kind and won the $5000 jackpot. The next night, I hit a royal flush on a progressive quarter machine and won $1100 +. They also had deuces wild machines that pay $625 for four deuces (compared to $250 in most deuces wild machines), I hit that 3 times. All told, I came in with $500 in my pocket, never went to the ATM, and went home with over $7000. I hope that serves as a counterpoint to the review that stated the slots were \"tight\"; if you spend enough time in casinos, you're occasionally going to have a run of bad luck, no matter how loose the slots are. And it's common knowledge that the slots downtown pay better than the ones on The Strip.

I might have liked the food there a little better. But then, I didn't come to eat. I came to win money...which I didn't. Definately sign up for their player's card as it gets you comps at several other casinos that are in walking distance. They will send you gracious offers even if you don't gamble a whole lot. And if you do gamble a lot, the offers won't change that much unless you gamble a whole lot. I probably would stay here again if we don't stay on the strip.

My friend & I arrived early (10:30) & even though there was not a room ready for us, we were able to request 2 queen beds and south-facing(towards downtown, not the freeway) & to be on the 17th floor. That's the top and was hoping less noise would be heard from the street plus bonus - nobody on a floor above us jumping around! We did hear occasional sirens and some trains went by but nothing that kept us awake at night. So, the desk clerk took our info and said to come back in a couple hours. We did, but the room wasn't ready. Came back at 2 and it was. I think they noted that we had checked and knew we'd be back again so they had it ready. The hotel was booked for the rodeo so I knew they were busy. The room was nice and looks exactly like the pics on the website. Only complaints: shower head is positioned on the wall too low (I'm 5'5 and I had to squat down) & although the wooden shutters are a nice touch, they don't keep the light out when the sun rises. Our room had a small fridge and we hadn't requested one, so that was nice. The beds are super comfy. The room was clean. There's no room service, coffee makers, or coffee in the lobby. They said to go to the casino bar. Of course you'd have to pay for that. Just seems odd they don't offer coffee. The food at the buffet was delicious!! We ate way too much. Recommend the seafood buffet. Crablegs were great, (but bring your own shell-cracker, they don't have any). The staff were all very nice! The hotel is just at the end of Fremont Street & over a couple blocks. Easy to get to. Felt pretty safe walking around outside at night, just kept good eye around us.

I will outline our stay and then you can decide for yourself if this hotel meets your travel needs. Price per night was $80, not worth it in my opinion. This was through getaroom, which advertises rooms for $38 but the days at this price are so limited as to be non existent, other searches quoted similiar prices. First room assigned was on 7th floor, we did not sleep a wink as very busy freeway right beside property, with continous traffic all night long. It felt like you were 'sleeping \"on the middle of the freeway. Combine that with AC noise and you get the picture. Went to ask for room change at 7 am next morning, asked if all room were priced the same as we felt this room was overpriced (thinking was that maybe noiser rooms were cheaper than other rooms). We were informed that no difference in prices. We did get a new room on the 17th floor on the opposite side of hallway. We had expectations that this room would be better but ,sadly, not the case. The train tracks run right beside this side of building, and until about 2am there were trains passing, in addition, sounds of a digger/excavator but really dont know what this was as no visible building site seen. Also, there are no curtains on windows, only shutter slats that open and close (but don't really close tightly) and our room was located just under a hugh blinking red neon sign that flashed on and off, so another distraction from restful sleep. At this point , I am resigned to situation. Would probably have moved hotels if we were going to stay longer but decided we would tolerate one more night. Other dissatifiers: Dim lighting in room, one of main lamps did not work, clock radio was broken, bathroom tiny, no coffee machine in room, Yes I realise this is a tactic to get you out of your room and downstairs so that you are more likely to gamble! Positives: staff are very pleasant, we ate at Buffet and 777 restaurant, both were good. Proximity to bus station where you can get bus to get to Strip ($7 dollars for 24 hour pass).

The brewery servers up great microbrews and sports-pub fare for when you need a break from the tables.

Only disappointment was the deep fried cheesecake. We remembered it as being phenomenal 3 years ago, but this time the piece seemed smaller and did not come with ice cream.

The hotel/casino grounds are gorgeous. The room size was to be expected. Two beds, a desk, a tv, and a tiny bathroom with a separate vanity station. No Wi-Fi in the rooms, but they did offer it in the lobby. We had a lovely view of the mountains and the expressway exit sign for Las Vegas Blvd. Beds were comfortable. Room was \"clean\" but I did find a lot of dust on the window covers, tables, and some food/drink splatter on the walls. The maid service was good, up until we checked out. Upon check out, I realized I had left my pillow behind and called the hotel (within 10 minutes of leaving) to notify them I would be stopping back to get my pillow in a few hours. They put me through to the housekeeping manager, who stated I could get it from the room myself when I come back if the room hasn't been cleaned yet. Otherwise, they will keep it in the housekeeping station. Satisfied with their answer, I went about my day. At approximately 5:15, I returned to the hotel to claim my pillow. The girl working at the front desk called to housekeeping and made them aware I was there to get my pillow. A man came to the front desk after 10 minutes and told the other worker that they have no knowledge of my pillow being found, and the room has been cleaned and re-rented already. When they told me this, I was a little confused, considering I had been told my pillow would be there for me to pick up - but apparently that's as far as the communication went. I decided that since they had re rented the room, there was the possibility that someone else was using my pillow and I no longer wished to have it back.

Really good beers and food. Good selection and decent prices. Neat to watch the brewmaster working on the 2nd floor brewery! Casino was fun. Friendly staff at tables and the hostesses are attentive. Good selection of table games and slots with a direct connection to the California across the street via a covered bridge/walkway. Only 2 blocks from the north end of Freemont St. 3 blocks from the bus station to get to the strip.

I've found that Main Street Station is my favorite choice. It's reminiscent of a bygone Victorian era theme and features a self-guided tour of some remarkable antiques in the lobby & casino area. They even have a piece of the Berlin wall in one of the men's rooms. It's very close to the freeways; the I-15, the I-515, 93, and 95 (these 3 are one in the same by this area). It's 2 blocks from Las Vegas Boulevard also, which if you choose to take it, will take you directly onto the Strip in about 10-5 minutes (but be prepared to add extra time for traffic lights and pedestrian traffic as you approach the Strip though). It's a 5 minute drive to the Las Vegas Premium Outlets (which is right down Main Street and one block over), a 15-20 minute drive to the Strip (with moderate traffic on the I-15), and a little less than a half hour to Henderson or Summerlin. Parking at the hotel is free and ample. They have 2 lots, a garaged one close to the hotel, and an open lot across the street. If you're looking for the glitz and glamour of Vegas, like you see on TV, this probably isn't going to be for you, but if you're looking for a great deal, supernice staff, and a feeling of old-time Las Vegas, this is definitely would be to your liking. Main Street Station has the buffet, which is a great deal and offers a vast array of choices for everyone's palate. It also features the 777 Brew Pub, which has great happy hour specials M-F in the afternoons and $2 beers/wines during that time. A couple of notes: Walking to the Fremont Street Experience is easy via the California Hotel, less than 10 minutes. Also, note that due to the economic downturn, there are a lot of homeless/transient people in downtown Las Vegas. They're harmless for the most part, but if you decide to walk around alot, you may be approached by those less fortunate asking for money. The hotel itself is very safe and there's security all over. There's no room service, but there is a refrigerator in the room, which comes in handy when you have leftovers or want to keep cold drinks nearby. When I've had problems with my room (such as the A/C going out when it was 105 degrees outside), the maintenance staff was there in no time. Same thing for housekeeping when I needed additional amenities. Beds are clean and comfortable. The plantation shutters block out the sun quite well if you want to sleep in. They can be opened to view the railway, the beautiful mountains, & points south (you can see Palace Station and the Palms from this side), or on the other side, which provides views of the freeway (which actually helps if you're planning to go on it, a heads up on traffic is always a good thing), more mountains, & points north. The restaurant staff is very accomodating and the bar staff are exceptionally friendly and kind. The front desk people go out of their way to help.

It is about time we report the positives staying at Main Street Station as experienced by us. My husband and I stayed at the Main Street Station for first three nights of our July trip, arriving July 19th, a Sunday, at about 10:30 a.m. We usually have to wait for our room to be ready at MSS and they did not have a king room available at this time as well. However, there was a high floor,two queen, non-smoking room facing away from the highway available at that time so we gladly accepted this option. The spotless room had two beds with a bedside table between them with a clock, two comfy chairs at a table by the window, a decent sized desk and huge mirror, television and roomy dresser drawers. Enough room and hangers in the closet area also and the room itself was not small or crowded. For description purposes, the inroom safe in the closet has a key instead of the electronic keyless entry. The room is bright as the windows are from one end of the room to the other. There are shutters which do a good job of blocking out the daylight if you prefer it dark, but we keep them open all the time. The beds were soooooo comfortable and far better than the bed at the Golden Nugget that we stayed at for the next three nights. The bedspreads are the ones that can be washed regularly instead of the ones you see at other hotels questioning if you are the first to see it after cleaning. This room had a small dorm size refrigerator, but this was the first time we have had a frig in our room. Came in handy for the water, soft drinks, and the leftover cheesy garlic bread with marinara sauce from Triple 7 for a midnight snack for my husband. The room is also equipped with a hair dryer in the sink area which is outside the bathroom. This separate room of bath/shower/toilet from the vanity/sink area enables both of us to get ready at the same time. The vanity has enough space to put all our \"stuff' on it. The bathroom is big enough for the tub and toilet and not much more. The shower head is installed lower than the norm, however, so my husband had to adjust it, but it was fine for my five foot two self. Air conditioning worked perfectly and we had no issues with maid or checkout service either. A railroad track next to MSS did have a train traveling on it once during the night, but it did not bother us. We saw the time and temperature from our room atop the Fitz or Binions which was quite handy. Not fancy, but super clean, roomy, and bright. There is no pool on the premises, but they offer the California pool across the skyway. We do not use this pool here so could not comment on it. We are frequent visitors to the Triple 7, which has a good weekday happy hour, TVs all over to watch a game and a very pleasant atmosphere overall. There is a sushi bar onto one side, but we have not used it. Good food in Triple 7 at decent prices with or without specials and the microbrews are very good, the best we have tasted in Las Vegas. We like the Triple 7 and the atmosphere throughout this casino. Not recently, but we have eaten at their beautiful buffet and we will return. The chef making the omelets is quite entertaining. We frequent this casino and recognize the same staff there year after year so it must be a pleasant working environment there. In my opinion, this is the most interesting casino downtown as there are many wonderful and beautiful antiques, stained and uniquely etched glass purchased from throughout the world, even a portion of the Berlin Wall in the casino's mens room. The lobby is a beautiful reminder from yesteryear. Except for the mens room, I do a little tour every time I am in this casino admiring these \"finds\". Not often can you be playing blackjack under huge and beautiful stained glass ceiling and antique chandeliers. Even if you need to have to stay in a fancy room on the Strip, you should come here just once to see how interesting this casino is.

We've gone once a year for the past several years and always have a great time.

This time we got a great deal on the Main Street Station and decided to give staying downtown a try. We had been to MSS once before to eat at their good buffet and remembered it as vaguely nice, but I was still a little hesitant to be downtown and away from the Fremont Street Experience at that,. They rate we got for 4 nights was great so we gave it a try. Location: MSS is just a very short and safe walk from Fremont St and is only a few blocks off the interstate highway that more of less parallels the strip. Getting to strip hotels was quick enough (although traffic in Las Vegas just keeps getting worse every year). Food: We only ate at the buffet for a couple of meals and it was good, but not as great as I remembered. The buffet room may be the most beautiful in town. Staff: Everyone we encountered at the hotel was great and very friendly. Rooms: The rooms are fairly comparable to the other places we've stayed. Very nice, but not overly plush. My one disappointment was not having a coffee pot in the room.

Dad and I just returned from this short trip to Las Vegas. This review is for first time M.S.S. visitor's or someone who has not been there in six year's or more, like me. I remember Main Street Station well, after all this time. It was October 12, 2001 a month after 911. Security was very tight then. It is not as tight now, but there seems to be allot of Police, plain clothed undercover and Security at M.S.S. I have a disability to my hand and ware a sleeve and a glove. I know everywhere I go I am watched, I feel safe and secure. It does not bother me at all, being watched. Actually I feel privileged that I am constantly being watched over. So this is a plus at M.S.S. In fact at all the Casinos we went to Security followed us all around , I know it\u2019s the same for Hawaii too. That\u2019s my life. The room we were in only down side was the third floor roof top view of A/C, equipment. But I managed to take a few nice pictures I think, to make the best of my stay. I felt kind of dumb founded, Why you ask? Well I brought along my iron and hairdryer, like I did in 2001. This is all provided now. Wow! So check first before you pack. This trip was really for Dad to play all the Casino games to his heart content. This was not a Megabucks win but a Father & Son\u2019s fellowship jackpot. We had a wonderful time, enjoyed each other 247, you know what I mean. As they say you loose track of time, so true we forgot to eat and sleep the first 25 hours. I am a Lacto-Vegan so the food at the Garden Court Buffet was perfect for me. This is why the Boyd Hotel package was my choice. I Did not rent a car this time, so food needed to be at a walking distant for Dad, who is 84. God bless him, walking can be a slight problem in the heat of the day for him. The weather was perfect for him 70's 90's. spent most of the time in the Casinos. The room was the same as I remembered it in 2001,very comfortable. Had to turn the A/C down because of less humidity and dry air. The Good: I have very long hair,and washing my long hair and drying it makes it soft and limp. I loved it. Not like here in Hawaii which becomes very dry and brittle. Not so Good: Is the usual , the dry skin problems,I washed my face with my hair conditioner which did a great job. You gain one and you have to compensate with the other conditions. You learn fast to lip balm first before you smile. Ha ha ha. Ouch! that hurts. All in all we had a very good stay at the Main Street Station nice and homely feel. The food was good, the people were kind and courteous, as I remembered our last stay in 2001. it is still great. If 18 months or more have passed or you have never stayed at a Boyd\u2019s Hotel Casino Do sign up online for your Player's Gold card,before you get there. If you do, it will be real fast so you can start loosing your money even faster, or maybe \u201cHit the big one\u201c, and with 4 of a kind, max bet you will receive a scratch card worth $$$$. I signed us up online for the Player\u2019s Gold card because of our out dated Player\u2019s card had expired. So after we received our luggage, we headed down stairs. It was fast and easy, I just handed the nice lady our copy of our registration, and we received our cards with spring card keeper within minutes, and was playing lose your money fast. Ha,ha,ha that\u2019s Vegas yeah! (pupule) Crazy, insane. I do recommend, a higher floor if you want a better view of the far off strip. But if not, you will be down to the Casino in no time. We had an Ice and beverage Machine on our floor, Not sure if every floor has one. So there you have it ,our trip and stay at the Main Street Station and my few recommendations. Dad had a blast playing The Twilight Zone 1 cent slots, near the entrance, He made $106 dollars in less than 20 minutes the morning of our departure. So you can say you win some and lose more most of the time. Good luck with your stay at the Main Street Station. We did.

Unfortunately the north side rooms are facing and just too close to a busy freeway. On the first night of my stay I got stuck in a north facing room 1416, and even on the 14th floor the sound and vibration of 18 wheeler after 18 wheeler mixed with the occasional (but very noisy) train was just too much for me to deal with. From around 1am-5am I got about 20 minutes of sleep (estimate), at which point I called the front desk and asked if any south side rooms had become available, there were none, although I was able to move to one the next day 1405. At various points during my tossing and turning I thought about going down to the casino to get drunk so I could pass out (I was only a little buzzed when I first tried to sleep), but the idea seemed a bit absurd and I figured I'd just fall asleep any second now...any second now...you get the point. Eventually I got about 4 hours sleep and moved to the south side room for the second night and that was just fine, but this was my third stay at Main Street and my first time getting stuck in a north room, and I strongly encourage anyone who is a light sleeper or who does not plan to pass out drunk to not accept a north facing room here. Either insist on a south facing room or ask them to transfer you to one of Boyd Gaming's many sister properties, there is the adjoining California, the nearby Fremont, as well as Gold Coast, The Orleans, Suncoast, and Sam's Town. Check-in time is 3pm, if you can't be there at or around that time you might get stuck with a north room. I showed up at 6pm on a non-holiday Monday and they didn't have a single south room. So if you are going to be late arriving, I suggest booking your room elsewhere unless you have experience sleeping in noisy environments or war zones or plan to bring earplugs. As far as the rooms, property and service goes I have absolutely no complaints. Check-in/check-out was a breeze, no wait at all. Cocktail service and restaurant wait staff were all quick and friendly. The property is well maintained and clean. The rooms themselves are very nice and underwent a recent renovation a few years ago. The beds are comfy, the rooms look great, bathrooms are decent if not overly large. One other problem is the property is just a bit isolated in the downtown area. While it isn't a long walk from Main Street Station to Fremont Street, it is a bit of a jaunt from Main Street Station to the middle or east end of Fremont Street. Walking from Main Street to El Cortez (for cheap roulette and BJ) and back was a real hike. As much as I have enjoyed my stays at Main Street Station for the most part, I doubt I'll be staying there again. They have tightened up their room offers since the renovation in 2005 (I don't get any offers anymore, used to get 3-4 nights free every 3 months with quarter level VP play). If staying downtown in the future I'll probably try Fremont or Four Queens, as much as I like Main Street I could just do without the noise and the additional hike.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurndale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cClassy for a low priced hotel\u201d", "Author": "Danarenaeb", "ReviewID": "UR14539142", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel in 2000 on my first trip to Vegas.

The casino has a San Francisco 1890s atmosphere about it. It also seemed very quiet for a casino, none the loud sounds one often gets from a casino. The buffet was very inexpensive by Las Vegas standards and very good. The rooms are of average size. The beds were a little soft for me, although others may find them fine. Noise however, was a problem. We asked for a room opposite the freeway and they gave us one on the 14th floor; but, we could still hear the trains and I don't think there is anyway to escape them. They did wake me up a couple of times in the middle of the night. Our only problem was with the maid service. The maid removed our used towels but failed to leave us new ones. Unfortunately I didn't discover it until 1 in the morning when I came out of the shower. Ever try to dry yourself off with a hand towel?

The few things I have to complain about are that our non-smoking room was on the side of the freeway and when I called the desk to ask if we could be moved the desk clerk stated that they only had a smoking room available away from the freeway. They also do not offer wireless internet in the room. I just assumed since most hotels offer this that they would too but I was wrong. You had to take your computer, if you had on down to the players club area and sit at tables that were by the slot machines. To print out boarding passes you had to pay $3.00 to get on their computer with a printer for 3 minutes. It would be nice if they would offer to do it for you for a nominal fee. I talked to one guest and it might be the norm in Las Vegas not to offer wireless internet in the room, as they don't want you in your room they want you out gambling. If you don't mind these inconveniences it was a nice place to stay and really close to the Fremont Experience which we enjoyed participating in.

Certainly, places that may offer a two for one stay in a coupon book will get our attention. We did have a coupon and stayed 2 nights. The room was immaculate. As many older Vegas hotels go, they can be dirty or smoky. Neither was the case with the MSS. There is an easy walkway to other casinos and staff was very nice to us always. The casino itself is one of the cleanest. On separate occassions (multiple years) witnessed people cleaning handrails with disinfectant, cleaning slots with disinfectant and most recently, late one night, saw them applying a hot cleaner via steam to all machines and a crew of 15 wiping them down. I am not a germophobe but I would assume slots are generally pretty dirty! They said they clean every machine with that large system every week to two weeks. I cannot say how impressed I was. The food was good in the main eatery. Their Garden Court Buffet quite often has 2-4-1 coupons and is a good deal with good food. The game selection is also good and free drinks available frequently. Now the one con I mentioned: We had a room on the backside. The back of the hotel is very near I-15 and the road noise was quite loud. If you are a light sleeper, this will bother you. Now, I sleep hard and generally stay up way too late in Vegas so sleeping was not an issue for me but I could see it being a drawback for some.

Called front desk 5 mins before I went down to ask them to book a cab (as they'd advised me to) and just as I finished checking out it arrived - some brownie points there!

This casino, in comparison to the other downtown casinos, will never appear to be old and outdated. The casino staff was very friendly and accomodating. The machines did seem a little tight, but I figure it's my luck. My husband did ok....The dealers were fun... The hotel was very nice. We stayed in a King room on the 15th floor...the veiw was wonderful...we could see the strip in the distance. Nice shutters on the windows. The bed was great. Room safe was handy. Only drawback...no coffee maker in the room. The bathroom was the only thing that showed age. I guess they didn't put new fixtures in when they remodeled a few years back. It was clean, though...and lots of hot water and great water pressure. We ate at all three restaurants....all were good. The buffet was great...and the 777 Brewery stayed open all night and served Breakfast, for those of us that stay up all night and gamble! We felt very safe here...no hoodlums hanging in the casino, like in so many others. We did venture down to Fremont street to watch the show and visit the other casinos.

Previously I've enjoyed the buffet, and wanted to see if the rest of the hotel was as good. It is. The parking ramp is very close to the hotel. Checkin was fairly efficient. Although they advertise a 4PM checkin, the sign at the desk said checkin began at 2PM. When I told the clerk I wanted a quiet room facing south, away from the interstate and the railway, she gave me a room on the 14th floor. It was a bit crowded with two beds, but I had told the clerk I would happily take two beds if I could get everything else I wanted; i.e., quiet and no smoking. Housekeeping in the room was quite satisfactory, toiletries and towels were good quality. No coffee machine or refrigerator--Las Vegas hotels don't want people hanging around their rooms when they are supposed to be gambling. I liked the indvidual room safe, particularly because it had a key rather than an electronic keypad. I'd asked for a room on the south side because I'd been concerned about noise from the railway and the interstate to the north, but what little noise I heard was the periodic sirens of emergency vehicles throughout the night on Main street below my window. But I'm not complaining, because I enjoyed my view of the town. I've since learned even numbered rooms face north (Interstate and RR) odd numbered rooms face south (sirens and view toward strip) and the lower the room number, the farther it is from the railroad tracks. I was in 1403, which may explain why I heard only one train. I had no problems with noise--and I'm picky about noise. The casino and lobby feature lots of elegant wood paneling and brass hardware, as well as an assortment of bits and pieces scavenged from old buildings around the world. With its high open ceiling and Victorian flavor it's arguably the nicest casino downtown, and possibly in all of Las Vegas. This decor doesn't extend to the rooms--at least not to my room--and I was glad. Dark paneling in a big area is one thing, but the same treatment would have made my room seem like the inside of a cigar box. I was pleased my room was done in light colors, and loved the louvered shutters which kept out the afternoon sun. Main Street Station's Garden Buffet is possibly the nicest buffet in town--the price is competitive, and the room is a beautiful high ceilinged cathedral of white filigree ironwork with tall windows, making for a pleasant well lit open space. The variety of food is mind boggling--in addition to a huge assortment of American cuisine, there are an extensive number of Pacific Rim dishes. I'm not discussing how much I ate, but now I can go to my grave knowing that at least once in my life I finished breakfast with a slice of chocolate pie. Main Street Station markets aggressively in Hawaii, and a significant number of the guests are Hawaiians, something i liked. These folks seemed to be better dressed and better behaved than most mainlainders. Main Street Station is a quick two block walk from Fremont Street, which is a good thing--I had no desire to be any closer to the nightly light show. If one doesn't want to gamble in the hotel casino, there are all the grind joints along Fremont Street, along with girlie shows, souvenier shops, miscelleneous stores, and an unlimited opportunity for people watching. For someone who wants to see Las Vegas close up and on foot, downtown is superior to the strip because things are much close together. If one wants to visit the strip and avoid the nightmare traffic and expensive cab rides, a city bus terminal is a few blocks walk north. The strip bus is crowded, but I found it fun--and less than 10% of a cab trip. The only place downtown which compares with Main Street Station is the Golden Nugget, which has bigger rooms and an impressive fish tank in the pool area. It also costs more, and the more remote rooms are a fifteen minute hike from Fremont Street.

After staying at Main Street Station twice, it has definitely become my favourite hotel in Vegas to stay in, and I highly recommend it to anyone! Although some people prefer being in the mega-resorts on the strip, we have definitely come to prefer staying downtown. With so many casinos within a few blocks from each other, it is great to spend the evening walking between places, finding different games and limits, along with various food and drink specials. We have enjoyed staying out late, following the \"action\" when things get slow at a particular casino, and then just walking back to our room. No waits for taxis, no worries about driving after drinking, etc. The casinos downtown have lower limits also, which is great for the recreational gambler who doesn't want to shell out $25 minimum bets on table games. As far as Main Street Station goes..the prices are at least half of the hotels on the strip. The rooms are nice, probably comparable to TI, and there is plenty of convenient parking both in a garage and an outside parking lot. The casino isn't overly smoky due to the high ceilings (with beautiful stained glass) and you don't have to walk through it to get to your room. Betting limits start as low as $5 and they have all the standard table games and slot machines. The hotel has a unique atmosphere including numerous pieces of art/ antiques throughout the lobby, casino, and guest rooms. You can get a brochure and map of these items at the front desk. Service was always great for us and the staff are very friendly. On our first night, we noticed that our sink was draining very slowly, so we called the front desk. They sent a repair person 5 minutes later, who took care of the problem very quickly. Maid service was great and they always respected the \"do not disturb\" sign on our door. They always managed to clean our room during the day, even though we often didn't leave until noon! The 777 Brew Pub had really great beer; try the sampler if you can't decide. They are open 24 hours and have pretty standard \"American\" fare. The most recent time we visited, we didn't find the buffet very exciting, although we had liked it a lot in the past. The prices are very good ($5 for breakfast buffet, I think), and you can get a \"buy 1 get 1 free\" coupon at the O2 bar in the middle of Fremont Street. We didn't eat at the nicer restaurant there, the Pullman Grille, but it looked very inviting with an interesting menu. I know some people have strange reservations about staying downtown, but I highly recommend this hotel. I wouldn't consider staying anywhere other than Main Street Station or Golden Nugget downtown, and we didn't really like the \"old person\" feel of the GN when we stayed there. We have also stayed at Aladdin (now Planet Hollywood), Mirage, and Treasure Island, and we both agree that the $50/night rates at Main Street Station are a great value without compromising cleanliness, location, and service, unlike the cheaper places on the strip (Stratosphere, Sahara, Excalibur, etc). Why pay triple the price to stay on the strip and be stuck where the casinos are a long walk from each other and the food and gambling is expensive? Well, I guess gambling can always be expensive, but I hope you get my point. ;)", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "daffydana", "Title": "\u201cabsolutely fantastic\u201d", "Author": "daffydana", "ReviewID": "UR8103875", "Content": "I did not stay here, but booked the hotel room for my parents.

I complained at the MSS about the fact we had to stop taking food when breakfast was over and made a comment about Golden Nugget allowing people to take lunch after paying for breakfast and the woman was rude saying \"you're not at the Golden Nugget.\" No big deal really.

I think perhaps my parents may have gotten a better room with a view than many other people, but I'm not sure. It certainly wasn't because I paid a lot more.

This is not a \"glitzy\" huge hotel like many of those found up on the Strip, but it is a nice, older hotel in the downtown area, & it is a good option for travelers on a budget. The main areas of the hotel & casino have a lot of antique charm, & we were pleasantly surprised to find that the rooms had obviously undergone a recent renovation because they were very modern & comfortable. Check-in was quick & the staff was friendly. Our room was larger than we expected, with the exception of the bathroom, which was small (adequate, but very small). The bed & chairs were very comfortable. Our room looked out toward Fremont Street & the railroad tracks. The only complaint we had about our room was the noise of both passing trains & the fans on the roof of the Main Street casino, which was just below our room (we were on the 6th floor). The train noise wasn't terrible & I don't recall hearing trains go by late at night, but during the day it was noticable. The fan noise was annoying at night, though - we turned on our air conditioner to drown out the fan noise, but that just made it even louder in our room. These noise issues were not a huge problem, but if we were to stay there again we'd probably request a room on the other side of the building or up on a higher floor (a friend travelling with us stayed across the hall & said her room was pretty quiet). There was no Internet access from our hotel room, however there is a wi-fi area near the player's club off of the casino, plus there is a computer terminal in the lobby available for guest use for a fee. We ate dinner at the steak restaurant at the Main Street one night. The food was decent, but not excellent. Two of us ordered medium-well steaks & found them to be overcooked & dry, which surprised us since it was a steakhouse restaurant. We also had the breakfast buffet one morning, which we thought was great. If you are a gambler then downtown is a great place to stay; that is the primary \"attraction\" in this part of Vegas. We found the Main Street casino to be relatively uncrowded most of the time, which was nice. The casino staff was friendly as well. There isn't much shopping to do in downtown (although there is an outlet mall not far away) & the Main Street does not have a swimming pool, however it's neighbor, the California Hotel, has a rooftop pool that Main Street Station guests may use. We stayed at the Cal last year & I used the pool - it's fine if you just want to swim some laps or lay in the sun, but it certainly does not rival the elaborate pool deck areas of some of the larger/newer hotels in Vegas (up on the Strip, that is). Fremont Street is a short walk from Main Street Station (walk through the Main Street, through the Cal, then walk one block down the street & you're there). Fremont Street is the place to be at night if you are downtown - check out the free laser light show that plays periodically throughout the evening, gamble your way from one casino to the next, buy a cheap margarita-by-the-yard, etc. There are also numerous other restaurant choices in the hotels on Fremont Street; we had dinner at Grotto at the Golden Nugget one evening where we had a tasty Italian/seafood meal.

We have visited the casino in the past, but this was the first time staying there. We have been comming to Vegas for 20 years and have stayed both on and off the strip. After reading other reviews, my wife and I decided to give MSS a try, and I'm very glad we did. Check in was a breeze with pleasant people at the desk. The room we had was on the 17th floor. It was clean and somewhat larger than I thought it would be. The beds were the most comfortable we've ever slept in (including ours at home). The bathroom was small but manageable. We were a little concerned about the railroad behind the hotel, but never heard it at night. We ate most of our meals at the 777 and were very pleased with every meal. The entire casino staff was very friendly and helpfull. At the end of our stay we spoke to a casino host who was most gracious in reducing our hotel costs. If you're looking for \"glitz\", and high prices stay on the strip. If you're looking for a relaxing, normal priced vacation, check out Main Street Station. For a first time visitor to Vegas, this is a downtown location, so if you plan on spending time on the strip, you better budget for taxi fare or a rental car.", "Date": "September 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cMy new favorite downtown hotel!\u201d", "Author": "goldennuggetlover", "ReviewID": "UR5787573", "Content": "I loved Main Street Station! I only stayed here for one night and then went on to stay at the Mirage. In hindsight I wished I had stayed here the entire trip. I was extremely sceptical of this hotel but for $50 for a Saturday night I figured it was worth a try. I'm glad I did. I had reserved a non smoking king room, I ended up checking in early and got a non smoking room with 2 queens but since we were only staying for one night and it was our first night in Vegas I knew we wouldn't be in the room much and that it wouldn't matter so I didn't bother to complain or say anything. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. It was so comfy it made getting up the next morning quite difficult. Our room was on the side with the train tracks but I only heard the train once and that was in the afternoon when we happened to be in the room napping. We ate dinner at the Triple 7 Brewery. The food was delicious. (everything that came out of the kitchen looked good too), I don't drink beer but my husband tried the sampler and liked a couple of the beers while I enjoyed their margaritas. Our server was extremely pleasent too. We're not big gamblers so I can't comment on that except to say we did enjoy some margaritas at the main bar while we played video poker. All in all, I would definately stay here again. Unfortunately they don't have a pool and I'd be hard pressed to convince my husband to stay somewhere that didn't have a pool.

This is NOT staying at the Bellagio or Venitian if you want to spend that much money on a room then by all means go to those hotels but this is a good room at a great price. The gambling in the downtown area in my opinion is better then on the strip, the hotels are mostly paid for so your payout is higher.

Room: The room is mid size and is on par with a decent budget hotel like a comfort inn/best western. The decor is nicer than a typical budget hotel room. The bathroom is small and the beds and shower are average. Our room was on the 16th floor and had a good view looking towards the strip. We had no trouble with outside noise from the highway, hallway, or even the elevator bank next to our room. At $70 for a Friday night the value was excellent. Casino: The casino is a fun little place with a friendly staff. The vibe is very low key compared to a strip casino. The decor is very nice with brilliant chandeliers, wood work, and ceiling work. I didn't see another downtown casino that looked as nice. Food: We ate at the weekend brunch buffet. Though the selection was excellent the food was mediocre. I think it is an overrated buffet even at its low price. That said, after looking in at some of the other downtown buffets, the Main Street is probably the best value in its area. Overall Impression: We really liked the Main Street Casino/Hotel. It reminded us of a friendly, small Midwestern city hotel. Service at check-in, at the buffet, and in the casino was great.

We decided to stay at Main Street Station for something different, inexpensive, and off the strip. The hotel was interesting and funky - classic Vintage Vegas close to the Fremont Street Experience. Parking and checkin were pretty easy, however, upon entering our room we discovered that it had not been touched by housekeeping. Beds slept in, garbage everywhere - obviously a mistake had been made. We had a little trouble getting the front desk to believe us (the computer said the room was clean), but they did eventually put us in another room. Unfortunately, they had no other nonsmoking rooms available. We were able to leave the windows open while we were out, which helped some. The bed linens were typical of what you find in smoking rooms - full of burn holes. The bathroom was just short of disgusting - the tub would not drain and black mold was growing on the ceiling and walls. Our room had obvious water damage - perhaps this is limited to only a few rooms in the hotel. The price was great - $80 for our room was the cheapest we paid anywhere on our 10 night trip across the Southwest. With the taxi fare to the Bellagio, however, we didn't wind up saving any money. If this were any other city than Las Vegas, with its dirth of hotel choices, I would give Main Street Station another chance.

On our arrival our reservation information had been lost, this did not give me a good feeling about the stay. There was a difference in the rate quoted on my reservation and the rate charged on check in because of the loss of my reservation. The rate was honored once I provided a copy of my reservation. The front desk staff overcame this issue and checked us into a room. The room was acceptably clean and the bed was reasonably comfortable for us. The ice machine was broken on our hall and I reported it to the front desk but it was never fixed during our stay. (3 Nights) I concur with other reviewers that the halls are oppressively hot, AC in the halls is not working at all. When it comes to food at the hotel, there are huge issues. Food service is horribly slow and the menu is primarily fried foods with the exception of some salads and one or two baked or grilled items. This is our second stay at this hotel because our event is hosted there. On our first stay we waited more than one hour for food ordered in the sports bar. The staff reluctantly comped our food because of the horrible wait time. On our visit this year the service was some improved but we still waited 50 mins for fried food and appetizers that should have been out in less than 15 mins. ( It just doesn't take that long to fry chicken strips or chicken fried steak ). On top of that most of the items were not hot on arrival to our table. The room service experience on our first night was far better than eating in the sports bar or dining room. It took 30 mins. and everything was hot on arrival to our room. The smoke alarm started chirping in the middle of the night and a call to the front desk was no help. I ended up removing the smoke alarm myself and removing the battery to stop the chirping. Our door lock broke twice during our stay locking us out of our room. I can say maintenance staff was prompt and friendly and fixed the problem both times. I got the feeling from my stay that preventative maintenance was not a priority. The wood trim showed wear and the elevators were terrible. The elevators were noisy and the doors rattled. The doors got stuck open for long periods on 3 occasions with me. I noticed several gaps between the elevator doors and the elevator car walls large enough to get a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand in. I can only imagine how a parent of small children might feel about this. We did not visit the pool and found the outside security officer reassuring at night. While I couldn't recommend this hotel to a friend, its not bad enough yet to make me stay at another location and drive to the event that is hosted there.

So, we get our 3rd attemp to our room. Finally a door to the bathroom and the A/C worked, but the mattress to this hotel seems like something you would pick up at the flea market. SO UNCOMFORTABLE!! My family was tired of moving so I decide not to say anything. I also mention to the clerk that our hall way is extremely hot, doesn't seem like the A/C is working. She said she would have someone check on it. The hall way never got cooler. On our way to the pool I ask the front clerk for towels for my kids and the kids in our group. About 10 kids, he says he can only give me 3 towels total. He says, that once those get soaked to go and take them back to him so he can give us 3 more towels. WHAT???!! Never heard of such a thing!!! 2 other couples from our group had to change rooms becuase their beds were BROKEN! One of those couples with the broken bed were switched into a room where the toilet would not flush.

The good points were the staff. Across the board they tried to be as helpful and kind as possible. Unfortunately they were the primary good point. The second good point was the Lobby, it was beautiful. Another good point was the food at the hotel was hot and tasty. My bed was comfortable. Now, the bad points, which unfortunately could not be ignored. 1. There is a Krispy Kreme donut stand that was supposed to offer donuts and Starbucks coffee featured prominently in their ads. I never saw it open even though I came down for breakfast quite early and walked by it numerous times. 2. There was a nice restaurant, but it was only open in the morning. The buffet was not as elaborate as some previous guest seemed to indicate. Since I have special dietary needs, I requested a menu. This was greeted with suprise. I got the impression more than once that the guests were encouraged to eat off the buffet for breakfast and lunch. However, I did eat off the menu which was short, but the food was fine. 3. If I wanted to eat dinner since I was stuck at the hotel, I had to go to the sports bar since the restaurant was not open. I did, but I did not feel comfortable in such a place even though it was quiet. Many of the venues touted in their information were either not open or very minimal at best - such as the gift shop. 4. Past the Lobby the hotel is plain and slightly shabby, two star in room decor. 5. The elevator had a musty smell. 6. The room was very plain, clean, but the bathroom needed to be remodelled badly. The fittings and fixtures were obviously old. The TV was only a 24 inch screen with bad color. 7. The hotel had a weird vibe past the lobby as I never heard or ran into a single guest on my whole floor. There's quiet, then there's creepy quiet. I felt like I was in the movie \"The Shining\" and I was in the hotel alone. This was very, very unnerving as I was a woman alone. The first night the only people I saw in the evening seemed to be staff, and even in the day there weren't many people that seemed to be staying at the hotel. The only time I saw anyone was for the seminar I attended. I was not the only one who felt this way. The only other person from the seminar I found to be staying at the hotel was another woman, and she expressed the exact same feeling of creepiness that I did. 8. The biggest disappointment was the so-called \"business center\" that was nothing of the kind. There was one computer, and ATM, and a conference table. No fax, no phones, no coffee bar, and worst of all, no printer. The internet was slow and had annoying pop-ups whether you wanted them or not. This resembled nothing like any other hotel business center that I have ever been in. The staff are trying their best, but this hotel is like being on a sinking ship, they don't have a chance. My recommendation would be to go elsewhere.

We stayed for New Year's Eve & the New Year's Day game at Texas Stadium. We'd had confirmed reservations for 3 weeks, which had been double-confirmed just before we headed to Dallas, as was our shuttle from Love Field. When we arrived, no shuttle. We called. No shuttle. We called again. No shuttle. We called a third time, and after almost 2 hours of waiting, a van picked us up (but WE had to find the tiny computer-generated paper in the window saying \"Sterling\" because there were no logos on the van & they wouldn't take OUR descriptions to look for us - even though we were the only ones being picked up). Ok, next... We check in. Fairly smooth process. We go to our room on the 8th floor. It's somewhat smelly, but we can handle it. It was really pretty dirty, though. Again, we're just going to handle it. There are hairs in the bathroom on the floor, as well as in the tub - and a towel. (And by later that night, hundreds of tiny ants in the bathroom - remember, it's the 8th floor!!!). The 3 \"parties\" the hotel offered that night were run by private groups & we wouldn't have \"fit\" for any of them, so we used the computer (the ONE computer they have) to look for alternatives. No printing services & the computer is slow as dirt. We find a newly opened restaurant throwing a party \"in town\" - roundtrip, it was over $50 in cab fare, because the sterling wouldn't transport us... They would have to the West End, but would've charged extra. No thanks! Did I mention that the front desk staff could have cared less about how dirty our room was? Refused to move us or let us out of our reservation w/o charging us! Oh, and backing up... the ONLY thing around this place is... NOTHING!!! There's a really really nasty dive to eat at across the street, but even it has extremely limited hours. There's a Jack in the Box, if you want to walk down the road a little bit, but it's slower than anything I've ever imagined (we stood in line for over an hour for food!!!!!). There's also a restaurant in the hotel, but it's SOOOOO disgusting that BOTH of us got sick after eating it. Nasty. Nasty. Nasty. There's also a \"sports bar\" if you want to call it that - more like a little hotel bar with a couple of tv's and booths - but you let me know if you like it, or dare eat at it after seeing how dirty and unkept the rest of the hotel is. One plus - the beers were cheap! But, the place closes really early. Arcade? Yeah, that's a joke. I think it had maybe 1 machine in it from the early 1980's, and I'm not even certain it was working. But read on if that's not enough.... We booked reservations on the \"shuttle\" to and from the game at the Texas Stadium. It cost extra ($30 to be exact). Getting on the \"going to\" shuttle was no problem. A little crowded, but nothing too bad. Coming back, after the game?? Haha We actually left the game EARLY to find the shuttle. It wasn't there. We saw all the shuttles from all the other hotels, but nothing from the Sterling. We kept being told it would be coming or that the Sterling was borrowing the Marriott's shuttle and once the Marriott was done with the shuttle, it would let the Sterling use it. We waited and waited, along with 100+ other angry people who were quickly gathering as it went on 11, 12... Finally, almost all the shuttles for everywhere else were gone, and we saw a bus approaching.... We RAN as fast as we could & jumped onto it. Fortunately, they were there for the Sterling guests... However, they only had room for about 25 people, if that, and we had to almost barricade the doors to keep the mob of people trying to get back to the Sterling from coming on board, and the driver made \"promises\" to them of another shuttle coming right behind him. I'm not sure what time everyone got back, or if they did, but for us it was almost 1am - the hotel is 1.5 miles from the stadium, and we were waiting at the gate for the shuttle at 9:45pm. Hmmmm. I also heard people the next morning saying that they didn't get back until 2:30am. I'm not sure what time the last \"shuttle\" rolled in. Oh, and the best is now saved for last: Under our bed, there was a certain kind of toy - use your imagination. I am still cringing at the thought of seeing that there. And, upstairs, there is a nightclub, but BE WARNED - it is a swingers only club. If you don't plan on leaving with another couple, I wouldn't bother. And, you can hear the pounding bass from this club story upon story down very very late into the night (or early morning)! Good luck if you plan on staying here. I wouldn't stay there again if it was the Sterling versus a cardboard box in the worst part of town! When we wrote to them to express our disgust over the way we were treated, the condition of the place, and the game day experience, we never heard back. I've worked at hotels in the past and good ones will respond and USUALLY refund some, if not all of your money for an experience such as this. At a minimum, you would get a huge apology from the corporate headquarters.

A night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay, free shuttle transportation to and from the Cowboy game, and free breakfast the next morning. The idea is good, but the reality is HORRIBLE!!!! First off, when we arrived it looked nice for the mere $100.00 that we were paying. Check in was very slow, and our rooms were not nice at all. It was a very basic Motel 6 room, and I would not even dare my worst enemy to get into the shower. GROSS! But, we start with a few drinks down at the Sports Bar (which was the best part of the whole trip)! So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re watching another game on the big screen, having a few drinks, and my husband orders some food. We are planning to take the 6:00 shuttle over to the game. Well, at 5:00 (just after my husband ordered his food) the shuttle organizer comes to the bar and tells us that we need to get on the shuttle now. I told them that we were waiting on food and that we were planning to take the 6:00 shuttle. She said that we were the only ones scheduled for the 6:00 shuttle so the bus was not going to come pick up just the two of us. Soooo\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6The bartender goes and rushing my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food into a to-go box, then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re boarded on a tiny overcrowded shuttle with standing room only! Needless to say, my husband couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat standing up! So, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking it all in stride. We arrive at the game and we wait outside the game so that my husband can eat his $8.00 hamburger. The game was fun, had a few drinks, and when it was over we headed out to gate 8 for the shuttle to pick us up. This was around 10:30! Marriott shuttles kept coming and going for an hour with no Sterling Shuttle in sight. By this time an angry and tired MOB of people have formed waiting for the Sterling Shuttle. My husband calls the hotel to ask what the issue is, and they tell him there is a shuttle there and to go find it. Obviously there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a shuttle there so about 45 minutes later he calls the hotel back and the guy screams at him and hangs up! Finally I push our way through the crowd, board a bus that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ours and begged for that driver to take us to our hotel! HE DID! Wonderful man! And guess what time we arrived\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.12:30AM!!!! 2 hours after the game was over! We could see the stadium from our hotel so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lonnnnnggg drive! When we arrive at the hotel there is a HUGE mob of angry people trying to go up the elevator to their rooms. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one working and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barely working. So, after another 20 minutes we get up to the room! The next morning we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still optimistic and are geared up for the free breakfast. When we arrive downstairs, we find out that breakfast was only served from 7-9! Ok guys, lets get realistic. A late night at the Cowboy game where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been drinking, how many can get up, get showered, and be ready for breakfast by 9:00??? WHAT A JOKE! So, for our $100.00 that included the room, shuttle and breakfast, we only received the room! I would definitely recommend the Marriott (because they seem to have it together) or stay at a different hotel and call a cab! It will be less hassle!!!

The next day, again when housekeeping cleaned the room, and now knowing better, they left only 1 wash cloth. Three request and 3 hours later, we recieved 1 additional wash cloth. That evening as we were preparing to go out to dinner, we noticed loud music and hollering coming from outside of the hotel at the pool. It was obvious that a party was preparing to start. That was at 6:00 pm. Later when we returned, it was obvious the party was in full tilt. The music was so loud the room was vibrating. To try to drown out the niose we put the room A/C on high and turned up the TV. At 10:00 PM we placed a call to the front desk. They told us that we were not the only ones complaing. but the party would go on for a while. The person said that the manager would go out and tell them to start to wrap it up. It did not happen. At 10:30 and 11:00 two more calls were placed. They finally got tired of accepting calls and would only put us through to voice mail. We ended up calling the Dallas Police Department, to see if we could get them to stop the loud noise. I finally was able to confront management, where he took the attitude, and stated that the partiers would be allowed to continue and that the room guest would have to toloerate the loud noise. We immediately packed our bags and left. We are now trying to get our money back for the last nights stay.

The hotel was not even close to full yet the room we were assigned was on the one floor that rennovations were being done. Because of this loud hammering woke us up by dawn in the morning. We were also awoken several times in the early morning by phone calls asking for someone who we did not know. As well as a key being issued to a person not listed on the registration who tried to enter the room while we were sleeping. The lights in between the beds did not work, and the air conditioning went out...then suddenly the lights mysteriously come on. Which calling a maintenance man to repair the air conditioning ruined the $10.00 movie we paid for. And as if this couldn't get any more unusual we went to the top floor which has a night club and bar to have a few birthday drinks...little did we know what world we were entering. After a little while we were informed that what we thought was an average hotel lounge was frequented by couples seeking other couples. This could make for an extremely uncomfortable situation for the common traveler. All in all it was a totally mind warping experience out of The Twilight Zone.", "Date": "March 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cYour Car is Better Than This Dump\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2831306", "Content": "My brother, a friend, and I stayed here for 3 nights when we went to a football game in Dallas this weekend. I'm an easy going guy and not much bothers me. This place bothered me. 1. My room did not have internet access nor a refrigerator as I specifically requested and paid for. 2. The \"renovated\" room had a view of a garage. 3. There were only 2 beds for 3 guys and the hotel did not provide a cot. 4. The water was lukewarm at best. 5. The \"fitness center\" was locked until Monday as the GM had taken the key home with him. 6. On Monday, when we got access to the \"fitness center\" not a single piece of equipment worked. 7. One elevator did not stop at the 5th floor which is where we stayed. 8. The other elevators worked when they felt like it. 9. The walls are paper thin. 10. The \"Sports Bar\" closes at 10:00. 11. The picture on the tv was actually fuzzy. This actually fascinated me as I'd never seen a fuzzy cable picture. 12. When I checked out the clerk didn't even ask how we enjoyed our stay.

The refurb job brings this hotel up to two star standards - do not mistake this for a luxury hotel, but it's not a dump either. If you can get in here around $59-69/night you'll get your money's worth. Check-in is fairly easy and the lobby is well kept. The rooms could use some brighter lights, especially the bathroom.

Some problems that I encountered were: no hot water in the shower area the last 2 days of my stay (i was there for only 3 days). There was hot water in the sink but not in the shower. When I reported the problem, a man came up and played around with things in the bathroom but the problem was never resolved. His solution was to run the hot water in the sink and maybe the hot water would eventually work in the shower. Result: no hot water in the sink OR shower. There wasn't one garbage can in the entire room including the bathroom. When someone finally brought the garbage can, it had no bag in it and the can was stained with all types of disgusting colors. It took 3 hours for someone to bring extra towels and washclothes. I had to call twice. Lastly, in the elevator, in order to get to your floor you have to continuously hold your floor number until you get to your floor or the elevator won't operate. It was a pretty scary experience.

This is the second year in a row that I have stayed at this Hotel, and they have clearly made improvements from the previous year. Rooms were clean, staff was friendly, food in the restaurant was good. Even though this is an older hotel, the renovations made, put this hotel a cut above some of the others in the city.

What we did get at first was a Standard (non-upgraded) 1 Double (small/handicap) room. By this time, it was a Friday night, we had traveled half the day, hungry, tired, and late for a party. We felt rushed, and it made both of us in a frustrated mood until the party (and even after, when thinking about it). When we called for more towels and shampoo, I had to call back 2-3 times and nearly an hour to finally bring us more towels, because we had to take a shower/bath before our party that we were then late for!

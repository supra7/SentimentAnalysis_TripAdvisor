Search for better.\u201d", "Author": "SarahCalifornia", "ReviewID": "UR116585799", "Content": "I went to san Diego for Comicon and this was one of the last rooms available in town. The pros: It was a room, it had two queen beds, no bedbugs or vermin, it was mostly clean except for some water damage to the carpet by the bathroom ( a leak under the wall apparently) and fairly quiet. The cons: The reason it is fairly quiet is that it is the middle of Nowhere. No restaurants, clubs, bars, stores, movie theaters....nothing near this place to do at night. It is about a 15 min walk to the convention center. The hotel is not near any shuttles- it would take you as long to walk to a shuttle stop as to just walk to the Con. The neighborhood that the hotel is situated in is NOT one in which you want to be walking after dark. It is industrial, near the shipyard, empty buildings after 5pm, and streets filled with homeless encampments. The week of Comicon, the owner tried to boost my payment for my reserved room from $150.00 per night to $300 per night by telling me that my reservation fell through and the only rooms left were now $300. I booked through Venere.com and either they didnt send my cc# to him, or he claims they didnt. Either way, there was much arguing and contacting of Corporate HQs, and threatening emails. Finally he agreed to give me my booking back at $200 a night, still $50 more per night than what I had agreed to pay, but he had me over a barrel, no more rooms in town at any price, and he knew it. (If there was no convention in town, and you had choices, you would not pay more than $75 tops for this very basic room.) So, when you book, make sure you get written confirmation from the HOTEL, not just the booking consolidator. This hotel offers free danishes and coffee in the lobby in the am. But, at Beardsley & Newton, a couple of blocks from the hotel, there is a great little Mexican restaurant, New Mexico Cafe La Dona with really good breakfasts for about $7 per. If you do stay at this hotel and do walk, go there for brekky or take-along instead of paying through the nose for food around the CC. In the final analysis I would say: if you are planning for next year's Con, get a shuttle map (San Diego tourist info should have one) and find a hotel that is within the Convention's shuttle radius. It will make a huge difference in your ability to get to and from the CC easily and cheaply. (Parking at Petco Park is about $25.00 a day, and at the Marriot next door to the CC is $35).", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Varanasi, India", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Rakesh74", "ReviewID": "UR115142350", "Content": "The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect and major bussiness centres (downtown) are at walkable distance (1-2miles).

We spent two nights here courtesy of a time share presentation my partner endured several months ago, and I found this motel to be one of the quietest I can remember staying in. Our room had minimal amenities, but was clean. This is obviously a motel whose time has come and gone, but they do seem to be making a reasonable effort to keep it habitable. The parking lot is way to busy for the amount of business the motel seems to be doing, and I expect there's still a fair amount of illicit business being done there, but it had no effect on our stay. I would definitely NOT recommend any after dark strolls in this neighborhood, as it borders or the edge of downtown and a large homeless facility is a few blocks away. We walked around the area during the day and encountered no problems. You can walk into downtown San Diego in about 15 minutes if you're so inclined. There are also two bus lines running on Logan Avenue with stops either in front of the motel or on the next corner. If you're coming by car, there is freeway access literally at your front door. I wouldn't reccommend bringing the kids here for a fun filled family vacation, but if you're looking for a place to stay on the cheap, this place should do. A conversation with the manager here, who is apparently fairly new, indicated that the previous management \"may have been catering to a little different clientele.\" He appears to be doing a good job of turning things around, although this place isn't all the way back to respectability yet. We stayed on the back side of the motel, which helped cut down on freeway and parking lot noise. If you can get a room here for about sixty bucks or less, it's an okay place to stay.", "Date": "July 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, Ca", "Title": "\u201ckeep looking!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5040479", "Content": "If you are doing case studies on the habits of nocturnal street people, by all means stay here.

Went to San Diego to attend a ballgame at Petco park and all I knew was that this place was within walking distance. When the game let out about 10:30 p.m. (10 innings) we started walking and got lost. I asked a Police officer for directions to the hotel and his response was \"why are you staying there?\" I felt embarrased for not doing the research before booking. In the middle of the night when the blood curdling screams around the corner woke me, I almost got dressed and left. I am a former deputy sheriff and this place scared me. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!

We declined to pay the $100.00 to upgrade to a better motel because neither of us had ever been to San Diego and didn't plan on spending a lot of time in the room. WHAT A MISTAKE THAT WAS!!! The room itself wasn't bad but the area was terrible. I read the two reviews that were posted previously and thought, \"How bad can it really be?\" It's by far the worst place I've ever stayed at and I've stayed in some real dumps!! Upon arrival, we almost mowed down two people presumably making a drug deal right in the parking lot. They didn't seem to care that we had to wait for them to make the exchange. The dealer even accidently dropped the baggie on the ground, picked it up and finished his business! We went out for the evening and got back to the room quite late. This is when everyone that lives there (pay by the week?) just starts getting active!! And I'm not just talking about the partying back and forth between rooms and on the balcony's. Cars would pull up at all hours, tap on their horn, and then someone would run out to the car and give them \"whatever\" and 20 seconds later they'd drive off. And the hookers!!! You could hear them yelling and the \"clip-clop\" of their high heeled shoes all night. I finally got up and put a towel under the door because it had about a one inch gap underneath and that kept some of the noise out. We laugh about this now....but it made for two really miserable sleepless nights!! Moral of the story....UPGRADE!!!

It's right off the freeway ramp with a chain-link covered walkover that's all graffiti & broken glass. I had to walk 3 blocks to a trolly station & stand amongst the bums to catch a trolly. I preferred to walk, though it took 35 minutes to get to the convention center. I actually passed a bag lady having sex under a blanket with some drunk right by her shopping cart between the curb and a chainlink fence on Industry Blvd. at 7:15am, with cars whizzing by. I have never seen such a epidemic of homeless people like in the San Diego industrial district right next to the bario the hotel's in. I was told that the mild climate draws them from all over. I dreaded returning to the hotel & kept myself locked up in my room till the next morning. DON'T STAY THERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES - YOU WILL BE MORTIFIED IF YOU DO.

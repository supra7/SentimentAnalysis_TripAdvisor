{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lots of Litter... Where's the Wifi? Check-in was very prompt and effecient, and the room was functional (as you would expect from Motel 6). There were a couple of unexpected problems I encountered, however. This hotel advertises Wifi Internet Access, both on their web site and with a banner in front of the hotel, yet no hotspots were even visible from my room, let alone accessible. I was also surprised with the amount of litter around the property. The litter was scattered all over the place, with some even floating in the pool.Would I stay here again? Perhaps, but only if it were a bit less expensive, and I was only looking for a bed to sleep on and nothing else.", "Date": "Mar 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR137814354", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "rickscholz"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d73884-r13996099-Motel_6_Phoenix_Northern_Avenue-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "HotelID": "73884", "Price": "$50"}}

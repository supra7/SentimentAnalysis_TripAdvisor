While not a hotel I would likely have chosen myself, we were pleasantly surprised and I have to say I would seriously consider staying here again if in the area. First the rooms--think a sort of dated \"Jetsons\" look and you won't be far off. Fun, funky furniture, bright colors. We had a 1 BR suite and it was spacious, clean and just as described. The bed was VERY comfortable, the linens soft and cushy, kitchenette area very nice and a well-stocked mini bar. The sofa bed mattress was a little tired but \"sleepable\" according to our daughter, who stayed with us. Next...location. This is the good news/bad news. The Erwin is 1/2 block from the ocean, but also in proximity to the Boardwalk and therefore LOTS of street noise/parties at night. We didn't sleep much the first night. Staff/Service: Absolutely outstanding staff--friendly, courteous, professional. Restaurant: We had breakfast both mornings in the restaurant, BarLo, and the food was excellent. We didn't have a chance to eat dinner there, but checked out the menu--very innovative, lots of locally sourced produce, very nice wine selection. It rained the night we had time to enjoy the rooftop lounge, but the view looks to be killer, so maybe next time. Overall: Really surprisingly great property in proximity to the hot, happenin' Abbott Kinney St. in Venice. Close to the water, spacious rooms (and they are updating the entire property), comfortable bed. Our biggest issue was noise--so ask to be in a room NOT facing the back of the property, or bring ear plugs.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lebanon, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cFantastic time in Venice\u201d", "Author": "FannieM_50", "ReviewID": "UR126568612", "Content": "Roof top bar was amazing with a beatiful view of the sunset.

Also, $60 to leave my car parked and untouched for 2 days is a little sucky as a hotel guest. If I used the valet I could see that, but to arrive and not see my car again till checkout, ouch.

I'd stayed at Hotel Erwin 2-3 times so when I was booking a hotel for my mother and aunt I thought of it since it's 4 blocks from my new place. Our first night we went to dinner and while we were at dinner someone came into their room and stole a camera and a brand new iphone that had been charging. These things happen and it was unfortunate, but it was more upsetting how the hotel handled the situation. After thoroughly searching the room to confirm it was taken we called the front desk. The didn't have a manager on duty so we filled out the report with their restaurant manager who told us to come back in the morning to continue the process. He assured us that they would check the security cameras. My Aunt and my mom returned the next morning and finished the report. They had no information about the cameras and never followed up on that. They said their insurance would cover the phone, but couldn't confirm for how much and when the insurance company would get in contact. Refused to give us the name or number of the insurance company so there is no way for them to follow up. Couldn't assure us any time line or details. At the end of that conversation they said they would comp the 2 nights. When they checked out on the clerk didn't know about the comped rooms and raised his voice when my aunt brought of the theft. He literally yelled at her \"There is no theft in our hotel!\" My aunt calmly clarified and insisted. Eventually he comped the rooms like they had promised. Then he started to charge her for the entire contents of the mini-bar. Apparently, when the theft occurred they also cleaned out the mini-bar. But because we never opened the the fridge we had no idea. Very strange. Again, we had to fight with the front desk- convincing them that 2 women in their late 60s didn't consume the entire contents of the mini-bar. Needless to say this event dominated their entire weekend. I appreciate that theft can be a sensitive and difficult situation to deal with in a hotel, but we were patient and understanding at every turn. I was personally surprised to see how calmly my aunt and mom were since their room had been broken into. It was frustrating to see how the hotel dealt with calm, collected and understanding customers. I would hate to see how they handle customers who are less forgiving. I have to say now I'd never recommend the Hotel Erwin and I certainly wouldn't stay there with valuables.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Claremont, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cPerfect LA beach weekend getaway\u201d", "Author": "Josh W", "ReviewID": "UR126112068", "Content": "For my wife's birthday I surprised her with a little weekend beach getaway.

It's worth exploring the area away from the beach such as the shops on Abbot Kinney or the Venice canals which shows there is a lot more to the area then you would first imagine. The hotel itself is modern and our room was much larger than I expected with views over the ocean as well as inland. There's free wifi and HD content on the TV's which is nice. Parking's not cheap at the hotel but it is pretty easy to park in the area if you're willing to walk for a few minutes. Just be mindful of the parking restrictions which fall on different days based on when they're cleaning the street. There's a trendy rooftop hotel bar which was really nice with some great views, as you'd imagine.

The hotel is expensive - I wouldnt usually pay out so much for a hotel, but we did enjoy our stay. The check in was fine, we upgraded to a 6th floor room for an extra $25 per night, which didnt seem like much, but once you factor in city tax, tourist tax etc etc etc etc our bill was nearly $700 for 2 nights - this was a lot more than we had planned on spending so be careful as the prices quoted on the websites (we booked with booking.com) doesnt include all the extra costs!! The room was beautiful - newly decorated, lovely large glass balcony which had a view of venice beach and the promenade.. we would have preferred day time sun but we got the sunset instead which was beautiful. Now onto the roof top bar - well, the first night we went up there and it was pretty busy, but we couldnt get a table to sit down as they were all reserved but half empty. we only stayed for 1 drink and left. As we were leaving I asked the maitre if i could book a table for the following day/evening. she said that we could and that she would make a reservation in the afteroon and then again in the evening.. so the following afternoon we arrived, to be told that the reservation hadnt been made.. and that she had only suggested it to me.. not actually booked it. so we went back up at 7pm when the evening reservation started.. we were given the table we requested which was private in the far corner of the bar.. however she had to move people off it first. she then approached us 40 minutes later and told us that our reservation was only for 2 hours and that we had to move at 9pm. we finished our drinks and left straight away - we had a room on the floor below with the same view where drinks didnt cost $20 a go.. so.. in summary - the hotel is nice but expensive, and the bar isnt worth visiting as it is expensive and the staff are totally rubbish. good place for a splurge but certainly not worth the huge bill when you check out!!!", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, better service\u201d", "Author": "mjm19", "ReviewID": "UR119308500", "Content": "We chose this hotel due to its location (1/2 way between Santa Monica and Marina Del Rey) and for the highly recommended rooftop bar, but it was the excellent service that will have us coming back.

Though I'd been to Southern California numerous times, I had never really had a desire to stay in Venice as it's not really my style, but I booked via Hotwire in the Santa Monica area and got a good deal at the Erwin, about $125/night. When I arrived at the hotel, I was a little anxious as it really does have that eclectic, hipster feel to it and thusly fits in nice in the uber-cool Venice scene, and I'd go as far as to say this is the hotspot of the area. The parking in the area is tough, you gotta pay, but just sucking it up and using the valet is better than searching or paying for spots elsewhere. When I got to my room, I was disappointed, but not surprised to find that it was very run down and I had a great view of an AC vent with an alley backdrop. I sat there for a few minutes, cracked a beer, contemplated, and then went down to the front desk and asked for an upgrade. I was not upset, as I know as a frequent traveller and Hotwire junkie, when you get a great deal via these sites, the hotel is giving you the bottom of the barrel room, which is understandable. The young kid at the front desk gave me my upgrade options, I haggled for a few minutes per custom, and moved up to the 6th floor from the 2nd for a mere $20 more per night and got two free meals at \"Hash\" out of it as well. Now for the good part: I walk into my next room, on the totally refinished 6th floor and was in heaven. All new furnishings, beautiful partial ocean view, great bed, unbelievable shower/bath, and just the feeling that you went through a time machine from the late 90's to 2011 on the 4 floor ride up to the newer top portion of the hotel. This room was great, and a great deal to boot. Overall, this is a nice hotel either way. I'm not a big fan of Venice Beach, though I'm a party-type traveller in my 20's, as I like things a bit more high end and that isn't Venice Beach. The hotel is high-end, definitely, but not pretentious and suitable for most travelers, but mostly I'd say desirable for singles, couples, and folks looking to get a true L.A. beach party, surfer dude experience with the wacky Venice culture right out the back door. Hash was fine for what it is, very small restaurant with small plates and small menu, but big on quality and service. I had dinner there as well as breakfast and have no complaints. I walked through the rooftop bar \"High\" and it was very trendy, but it was May so a bit chilly for night, but the place was hopping and seemed like the cool place to be for locals. I bet it rocks during the summer.

The hotel restaurant, Barlo, is a new concept, a farm-to-table resto with a limited selection of locally sourced, artisan dishes and premium cocktails. Breakfast fare is a bit less exotic but very good and fairly priced for the area. Comfort and cleanliness of the room were both top notch. Keurig coffee machines, minibars stocked with top-shelf liquor and tempting snacks, big screen tv and good cable and movie selections, though the local scene provides all the entertainment anyone could want. Service was excellent and consistently professional. Hotel Erwin showed us a whole new side of LA, one that made me fall in love with the city and want to go back.

The staff were helpful and moved us to a much larger room with a safe and more modern bathroom.

The location of the hotel is very good for Venice Beach but you can't actually get into the hotel from the beach, you go round the front which is not the most picturesque to say the least. There is a little patio to eat/drink but you are basically sitting on a main road so we ate in the restaurant one evening - we were the only guests and one of the five main courses was unavailable. They were upgrading the restaurant so this may have improved now. The roof top bar has impressive views. However, you need to book a table since when we went up (on a Tuesday night) it was completely full and we couldn't sit down - although locals seemed to be squeezed in!

A few tips for travelers to Venice Beach and beyond: the hotel does offer in-room service and has a restaurant right on the premises but we chose to wander about and explore the neighborhood. If you head right and make a left on Washington Street, there is a neat breakfast place to hang out in where it seems all the locals go to (I think it's called the Cow Barn or something like that)- reasonably priced and healthy. We strolled down Venice Beach (which is easy in the early morning and much more congested and lively mid-day). Santa Monica beach and pier has a totally different feel and ambiance-- both are definitely worth doing-- after the Santa Monica Pier (which has a carousel ) stride east to the Promenade which is a car-less place to roam and shop-- you can then head south to a unique outdoor mall which has a place my daughter insisted that we visit- a self-serve frozen yogurt place (glad we followed her advice; this place is amazing!).

Unfortunately it was one of the worst hotel stays I've ever experienced. I don't even know where to begin, as the hotel seemed to be plagued with issues. From the minute I arrived, it was complete chaos. I waited 20-25 minutes just to arrive at the entrance. The driveway was so small, and the lack of attendants and organization was the precursor for what I experienced throughout my stay. As I was arriving from a different part of LA, I ended up arriving at 1:30 pm. When i approached the front desk, I was told that my reservation could not be found even though I had a confirmation number (which they said was not relevant at all). A supervisor was summoned, who seemed to find the reservation in short order. After finding the reservation, I was told that there was no room ready for me, and that check in was not available until 3 pm. (It is in their policies). The same supervisor asked housekeeping to prepare a room immediately, which I still did not get into until after 3pm. I was only travelling with a carry-on, so with some hesitation I left my bag with the valet. Later on during my stay, I actually overheard that the hotel valet's had actually given guests the wrong luggage upon departure who returned it to the hotel. All of this, wasn't even the beginning of the problems. The biggest issue occurred while enjoying the beach in the morning. Upon returning to the room at around 2 pm after some great surf to get cleaned up, there was a note placed on the bed stating that from 12-6 pm there would be no water in any of the hotel rooms, not to mention that housekeeping had not yet been to the room. There was no prior notification whatsoever, for an inconvenience such as this, making this completely unacceptable. How do you not inform guests that they simply cannot shower, drink, go to the bathroom etc for the duration of most the day??? I contacted the front desk immediately and was very displeased to say the least. Solutions were very slow to come, which therefore inconvenienced me further. Their solution was to make shower facilities in another part of the hotel available, as well as compensate me with 1 complimentary drink upstairs on the roof patio. You have to question priorities, when guests are inconvenienced due to a very poorly planned water outage, which turned out to be part of a restaurant renovation. Later I chose to pursue the matter with the operations manager, who did apologize, and comped that day's stay. The hotel itself is dated and is aged considerably. There is only 1 elevator throughout the entire hotel, some of the carpets are quite dirty, there was scuff and dirt marks throughout the hallways, musty odours were prevalent, the tile on the bottom of the shower was not cleaned well, and wearing away etc. The furniture in the room looked worn, and our room didn't even have an alarm clock in it. It feels very 60's, and needs a new style of funk. Some modern upgrades and decor do exist, but is not carried throughout the entire hotel. It's in desperate need of a complete remodelling job. Also as a side note, they do advertise every room with a balcony, just be prepared that your balcony may be 18 inches wide. I ordered room service for breakfast on my final morning, and it was just average, and albeit somewhat cold. I had been told it would take 30 minutes, and did not receive food for well over an hour. This just once again isn't acceptable. (They did give me a free glass of OJ for the wait\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) Yes the location is great, and there are some nice ocean views, but this was just a terrible overall experience. The staff were indeed very nice, and accommodating but did not seem to have the resources to deal with the issues. They couldn't even provide me with the correct directions to LAX upon departure. Even as a non-resident I realized that the directions were incorrect, and had to refer to a map. As a very frequent traveller to California, and a patron of boutique hotels, my preference still remains elsewhere.

It is right near the main crossroads of the boardwalk & beach. And the crowd is funky! A real crosssection of humanity come to the boardwalk in Venice. But we knew that before we got there so we were fine with it. The hotel was formerly the Best Western and has been updated into a hip hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly upon arrival, and we were upgraded to a ocean view room. The valet parking is extra and steep at $28 a nite. The room was on the sixth floor and was large and very nice. The downside though, to being on the 6th floor is that you are right below the nightlclub 'High\" and you can hear the thumping in the room and the hallway. We moved from right below the DJ to a room at the opposite end of the hall, and that was much better. We went up to \"High' for a sunset drink and it is a great spot with a fabulous view of the water and the town. It is a very strange set up though. There are a limited number of seats and you have to reserve ahead of time. There are no bar seats just a small area for those who did not reserve a seat - standing room only. The drinks are very expensive also. There is no place in the immediate area for a nice dinner, it's a little sketchy in the evening with the homeless crowd, but Abbot Kenney Blvd is not too far away to walk. Really great shops and restaurants in that area. Our big problem came when we returned to the hotel after dinner. Apparently there is no security doors from the stairway doors to the room floors and customers coming up to the rooftop bar can wander around the hallways. We encountered a crowd of shirtless hip hop guys and their girls roaming our hallways laughing and yelling. There was a party going on in the room next to us and there was door slamming and yelling in the halls til 3am.

This hotel was a big let down for JdV and I certainly wouldn't stay here again for anything over $99/night. Stayed here for the Easter Holiday weekend and checked in around 7pm. The outside of the hotel is pretty stereotypical Venice Beach. Some trendy signage, but a run down and dirty exterior. Right on if you ask me, I love Venice! Things sadly went down from here, Valet was running terribly behind and since the load in area is a quarter-circle drive, this makes it cramped and somewhat dangerous for loading/unloading. The check-in was also very slow and behind. Certainly happens, but for the weekend I was there, not a time went by whenI walked by the front desk that it wasn't under-staffed or without someone waiting. No exaggeration here, but I will say, in true JdV style, once they become available, the staff is very friendly! Once checked-in and in the room, the big shock was just how dirty the place was. Being a regular traveler, and certainly far from stuck-up, I can deal with the average hotel let-downs that inevitably happen with frequent travel, but this place was a disaster. Literally hairs were all over the place. The carpet smelled really bad as did the furniture, and the lighting was so poor in every nook but the bathroom area that it almost seemed planned as to hide the \"nasty's\" that are certainly apparent with full daylight.

So I went back down, talked to the manager who was offering to file an incident report when out of the office stepped the woman who had answered the phone. AND SHE HAD MY GLASSES! YAYYYYY!

First, even if you ask the hotel reception to call you a taxi, they will instead call a car service-- and then they will try to tell you that the car service would be the same price as a taxi. THIS IS A LIE. Once they quoted me a price that was a full $30 more than the taxi I ultimately took, claiming that a taxi would cost the same amount. Another time they quoted me a price that ended up being almost twice as much as the taxi I ultimately took-- again, lying to me and telling me that the taxi would be the same price. When I pointed out that I didn't think a taxi would cost as much as they quoted to me, they lied to me AGAIN, and told me that the base price for a taxi in LA was $6 (it's actually only $2.85). Two of my friends separately had the same experience with the same people. They clearly have some sort of deal with the car service next door. Second, the website and signs all over the hotel claim that they offer free wireless internet. THIS IS ALSO A LIE. When trying to use the internet, they will request that you either pay $5 to use the internet, or sign up for a login and password-- which also requires you to first pay $5, and takes several days to arrive. Also, the internet is so slow, that you really have to pay for the \"second tier\" wireless for it to be useful, which is $10. It would be one thing if they were upfront about this, but they have advertisements all over the place claiming that they have complimentary internet. When I complained to the hotel reception that we'd been forced to pay for the internet, they told me it was because the \"complimentary\" internet was $5, and the second tier was $10. I pointed out that \"complimentary\" does not mean $5, and they said I had signed up for the second tier of internet (which I had not). When I told them there was no option available to sign up for free internet, they told me they had no idea and took it off my bill-- only then I spoke with two of my other friends who had each separately gone through the same experience, and had the same conversation, with hotel reception.

I'm a fair bit older than that and it didn't feel like a good fit. In the (rather overworked) elevator, I encountered a group singing in unison, and, later, a guy trying to pick up all the cans of soda that fell out of a big box. I saw a group yelling off a balcony. High--the attractive bar on the roof--was getting heavy action on a Saturday late afternoon--but one look told me it wasn't for me. Having the rooftop bar meant a lot of people flowing into the hotel and up that elevator. The room itself was attractive, as Joie de Vivre properties usually are. The bed was big and comfortable. The first \"partial view\" room they gave me had virtually no view, but when I went back, they moved me up a floor and closer to the ocean, with a decent view. The bed was big and comfortable. There was an awful lot of selling going on in the room. There were the usual minibar snacks and a generous selection of liquor. There were non-food items for sale, including bandages, under a label something like \"Oh I'm cut\" (this is tasteless in about 10 different ways). There was a rack of sunglasses hung up in the room for sale, so you could achieve the proper Venice beach cool. Worst of all, wireless internet cost $4.95, I refused to use it. Unlike many cheaper hotels, they didn't have a public use computer in the lobby, though they didn't have much room there (not that this really bothers me, since most hotel lobbies seem to be just wasted space). Kudos for being retro enough to have a phone book--it's very handy and all hotels should do it. Venice is a curious mix of commercialized 60's counterculture and trendy contemporary yuppiedom. That said, it's still nice to be near the beach and the ocean, and though the winter weekend rate was almost $200, it's still less than it would have gone for in Santa Monica. I was also able to see a play 5 minutes' bus ride away. Transit is pretty good, there are frequent buses to Santa Monica, to Downtown LA (an hour plus ride), and other places like Westwood.

The check in area was a little cramped, but the check-in process was very quick and soon we were up in our room. The room was fairly basic but it was roomy and had plenty of modern charm. The restaurant is cozy but they have good healthy food. One unexpected bonus was the sunglasses they had for sale in the room, we needed a pair so grabbed one and paid when we checked out. The rooftop bar is remarkable and the true highlight of the hotel. We went up on a weekday afternoon and there were only a couple other tables occupied so we more or less had it to ourselves. Unbeatable views of the coast.

Read reviews on several sites and selected the Erwin, based on location, rooms and appeal of rooftop bar. Called ahead 3 days prior to ensure we got adjoining rooms - which didn't happen. Rooms are ok. A few nice touches, but feels like a rather cheap fix up of an older hotel. Shower tub looks original (pull back the shower curtain to reveal a mustard green tub that looks like it's from the 80s. Cafe Hash had decent enough food and service but tucked into the side of the entrance of the hotel - so not a great space for anything other than a functional breakfast or meal by yourself if you're traveling for business. The rooftop bar was closed the nights we were there and so there was nowhere to drink in the hotel after the cafe closed. The biggest issue I have is the look of the hotel, relative to the photos on their site. The lounging areas shown are from a very small reception, and an outdoor lounge area right on the curb of a busy street - not a place you'd want to sit and have a drink unless you didn't mind the noise and fumes from the traffic. And the rooftop bar is just a collection of furniture with a temporary bar setup on the roof without protection from the wind - not at all appealing on anything but a sunny day. Also not a lot within walking distance - other than the beach (just one half decent coffee shop and James Beach restaurant) - but it's close to Abbot-Kinney which has a load of great shopping/food. Also had to pay for print outs at the \"business center\" - two laptops tucked next to the service entrance - first time I've ever had to do that at a hotel.

Hash, the restaurant on site, was super yummy and not expensive with lots of great choices. High, the lounge they have upstairs is AMAZING! great views, great food, great mood, great service.

They really make you feel that you are an invited guest and will go out of their way to make your stay as pleasant as possible Another plus for the hotel that they hired such service oriented people. ok, so that's alot of good. Here's the bad. And for me, it's the only bad that counts really. The hotel was dirty. Really dirty. Our first room, partial ocean view, was filthy. Someone else's dirty used contacts on table, broken glass on floor that my husband stepped on, absolutely disgusting closet with food particles and dust inches thick, stains on walls, the cushions on the deck were filthy, cigarette burned bird poop on chairs.. dirty.

When it came time to check out the person that was checking us out said that we should have let the restaurant know when eating about this, although we had been told differently at check in. I explained to him the situation, and then checked out. The bill that he gave me was $100 over what we had agreed to pay on tablethotels.com. When I asked the gentleman why this was, he said I would need to provide proof of our rate. I used their computer to print off the receipt from tablethotels.com which clearly had the rate at $100 less what they were charging. After about 10 minutes of debate, and me having to get a little upset, they realized that they were in the wrong, and fixed the problem. As I have worked with tablethotels.com personally before, I don't understand why they didn't have the correct rate or any information about the voucher in their records.

The valet staff was professional and timely and although we cringed at the price for the nightly valet fee, it was quickly eased by the friendliness and courteous attitude of the employees. Awesome and efficient. The front desk was accommodating and polite and went out of their way to give recommendations, assist with questions about the area, and even comp a bottle of wine or two for joining the Joie de Vie club (free) which provided us free internet during our stay (essential for technojunkies such as ourselves).

The guest rooms were beautifully designed with great manga-esque drawings on the closet door- complimenting the original photography and urban graffiti viewed throughout the hotel.

The city tour booked by the front desk was very good. The beds in the rooms are really comfortable, big and soft. We also had a room at the alley, but did not have any noise from the bar next door. Very complete and original Mini bar items. It would be nice to have some smaller bottles of liquor in the mini bar. The only thing we missed in the room is a shaving mirror. We loved the complimentary Wolfgang Puck coffee in the room!!!! It is very recommendable to have breakfast and at least one dinner at Hash. The menu is not very big, but you will always find something of your choice. All dishes have a very original touch from the Chef. Prices are very friendly! Last night we were surprised by a fire alarm at 00:30 hours. We all had to leave the room because some joker activated the alarm. This all was handled very professionally by the staff members. If we return to LA, there is no doubt about where to stay.....", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malmo, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cCould be great, but isn't\u201d", "Author": "KavehK", "ReviewID": "UR68888440", "Content": "If you value location and interior design then this is the perfect place to be if you plan to visit Venice Beach. The location is truly awesome and the rooms are nicely designed. The design and the feeling has the right Venice vibe mixed with some modern touches The staff is really friendly and will help you as much as they can.. But that's it. The hotel claims it has free Wi-FI (according to hotels.com), but it hasn't. We were a group of people who needed internet to do some work so we had to pay additional 6$ per night per person for it for standard speed and 10$ for high-speed. That's just bad. Half of the channels on the TV didn't work, including HBO. The bathrooms didn't have real doors, just sliding ones that left a couple of inches of free sight at the sides. Needless to say it makes you uncomfortable going to the bathroom knowing everyone in the room can look at you doing your thing. 28$ for valet parking is too much. The whole building and the rooms had a bit of a weird smell. The housekeeping was awful. We were four people in one of the rooms and we NEVER got four towels or four sets of anything. One time we didn't even get any towels at all. We had to ask for towels every day until we got tired of it the last day and just made it with two towels. Other than that the beds weren't made so well and housekeeping they came at weird hours, sometimes at 10 am, sometimes at 4 pm.. The water pressure was lousy, it made it pretty unpleasant having a shower. Generally it's an average hotel that could've been really great if the management really did pay attention to small details. Being nice, friendly and having a great level of service doesn't do much when there isn't a door to the toilet or you never have enough towels.

The rooftop at night is pretty cool, worth checking out. Valet parking is $38/night, right across the street (not Pacific, the side street) you can park for $20/night, no brainer. Pull in drop your bags, drive another 10 yards, or just park and carry, it's very close. Venice Beach is the usual Bohemia, it's has it's \"cool\", but the number of Mad Max looking street urchins has increased. It's a big issue, and a problem. They leave you alone for the most part, but they stink, and filth the place up. One morning I bought a breakfast sandwich, then realized I'd have to stand to eat because most of the benches are scummed up by street scum. They have a problem and the locals know it. There is an increased police presence. I called 911 one morning because a guy (mid-twenties) was laying on the oceanwalk moaning, in severe pain and distress, everyone was just passing him by....just another drug overdose. Paramedics came to his rescue. The place is the perfect example of what too much freedom of everything can can create. Back to the hotel, check your bill. I was charged $25 for a bottle of Vodka that I didn't take. I suspect it was housekeeping, or they missed it from the last guest. They removed it from my bill. Also I overheard another guest being told that if they showed the room key in Hash they received a discount, no mention of it when I checked in. Of course I mentioned it and received the 25%. It didn't seem like they wanted everyone to know. A great place if you want to be close to the beach, the staff is friendly and very helpful.

The morning we were hungry and ready to hit the beach for the few hours we were there, too bad the room service waitress forgot our order. We got a call to see how breakfast was before we even had received it. She forgot to ask how we wanted the eggs on the hash and so she called and got that info. We wanted longer with still a no show, finally the manger got involved and within about 10 minutes we got our food. He comped it of course since it took over an hour and half for eggs!!! The girls (all of us really) were hungry and wanted to get to the beach! The manger told us to help ourselves to the mini bar food and we did to stop our stomachs from growling as we waited and he comped all that too. We needed something from our Van but they had forgot to tag it when we came in and could not find it so 30 minutes later I went down and got the stuff out myself. We only had one day at Venice Beach and we spent two hours waiting around for them to get things right. The other thing I heard after on was that the room next to ours was very loud so the tweens did not sleep much. Once the manger heard of our day, he comped our whole stay and gave us an extra hour after late check-out so we could get to the beach. Everyone, but the room service person was polite and kind during all of this. So once again when the Manager heard what was happening he stepped up and fixed it.

While I in no way expected the Erwin to match the previous fortnight spent in Tahiti, I was pretty disappointed on a number of levels and would not recommend this establishment. The rate went from 150 to 200 to 270 USD per night over the 6 days because I was told the occupancy rate went up. Every time I had to rebook to stay a few more nights I was made to feel like they were doing me a favour by letting me stay there. I know hotels are a business, but they clearly exploited the accommodation shortage. Corridors were noisy at night as the revellers from the rooftop bars returned to their rooms. There were two power cuts during our stay so pity the people on the sixth floor having to use the stairs and walk through pitch black hallways. There did not appear to be any back up safety lights at all. The weekend cleaners pinched a packet of cigarettes from an unopened carton I had bought for a relative. Neither of us smoke so we know this was deliberate. I did not report it to the desk as it is hardly grand larceny, but does not make for a comfortable stay. If I had wanted to store any real valuables, forget it, because the safe door was broken and this, they could not fix. I hid our passports under the carpet behind the bed and noticed an uncovered electrical socket on the wall. This is a safety hazard. The night we did eat at the tiny restaurant, we found it quite mediocre and overpriced, unatmospheric and cold. The rooftop bar is OK, but they add 20% tips to the drinks before you have even taken a sip. The patrons are not the glitterati of LA, but then Venice Beach is a dump so fair enough. The one good thing that happened was that we were initially given a room that we found to be occupied when we carried our cases up to the second floor. The occupant was in the shower! The young receptionist did apologise and gave us a 15 dollar voucher for breakfast. Apology accepted and gesture appreciated. What was completely unacceptable however was when I went to pay for the first night and a different receptionist was very forthright in asking me to donate money to charities that help the many needy people in the locality. My firm 'no' met with a decidedly dirty look. This is appalling as I was a stranded traveller having to pay out for an unexpected hotel stay and I pay UK taxes and I am not responsible for the economic policies of the US which mean there are loads of vagrants on the streets. This just left a sour taste. The location of Venice beach means that you will be harangued by people asking you for money as soon as you step out of the door. Wearing a new pair of sneakers and having clean clothes is enough to make you a magnet for these people. Some of them are quite nice, but if you are not in the mood or not the type of person to humour them, do not stay in this area.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeachside at the Erwin\u201d", "Author": "world_in_my_eyes", "ReviewID": "UR62042896", "Content": "I booked this hotel via Hotwire & was quite pleased overall. Upon check-in, we upgraded our room to a queen size with partial ocean view. We were on the south side of the 6th floor and our room had a balcony with nice ocean views. We were on the highest occupied floor, and one floor below the roof top bar. The proximity to Venice Beach & the beach walk was excellent, although beware, Venice Beach gets a bit sketchy once the sun goes down. I don't think I would go walking around in the dark near there. We did not eat at the restaurant or try the roof bar as we were in town for a wedding & had many pre-planned events to attend. The building was very sturdy & quiet thanks to the solid concrete construction. They just don't make buildings like this anymore. The room decor was good, bed was comfortable, with good quality linens & towels/toiletries. It had a 42\" plasma TV but we had not much time to watch it. Fully stocked mini-bar. Great 'pod' coffee maker. My biggest complaint about the room was the terribly low water pressure. No idea if it was isolated to our room or hotel wide, but way too weak for my taste. The valets were fast & friendly, which I would expect for the $28/night parking charge. Only one elevator serving the guest rooms meant wait times could be long, and could get really ugly if the hotel was full, which it was not. Now for what bothered me. The morning we were leaving, Sunday, 4-18-2010, there were several power outages. The first few lasted less than one minute, and I didn't think much about it. We go to the elevator on our way to check out & see that it is out of service. A staff member advised us to take the service elevator. Just as we were about to get in, the power went out again but this time it did not come back on. So we headed to the stairwell & began to walk down. Much to my surprise there was no emergency lighting in the stairwell & it was pitch black. I don't know what the building codes are in California, but where I live in Chicago they have such strict codes for hotels & office buildings concerning emergency lighting in stairwells, I was really shocked by the lack. When we got to the lobby, we learned the situation was due to the city doing work nearby. I totally know the outage was not the hotel's fault, but my advice would be to figure out an emergency lighting option asap for the stairwells. It was extremely unnerving to have to walk down 6 floors in total darkness & not to mention a huge liability. The staff didn't seem to have any flash lights either. And it was a good thing we didn't take the service elevator as someone was stuck in it when the power failed. Yikes! Talk about timing is everything...One minute earlier & I would have been in there. I was on my way to the wedding that morning. I think the bride would not have been too happy if her maid of honor was trapped in an elevator!!

I'm so mixed about my stay there, as they had some great advantages, but too many annoyances to go along with it. I'll try listing the good stuff, then go into the bad. For the entire week, the staff was fantastic. Front desk clerks were always super nice and helpful, maids in the hallways would always give a friendly \"good morning\" as you headed out for the day, and the front door was almost always opened for you if an attendant was standing there. I have absolutely no complaints about the staff as a whole. The hotel was very clean as well. The carpet in the hallway on the 6th floor was a bit spotty, but nothing major in my eyes. The room was very clean when we first arrived, and it was touched up every couple days by the staff, which we were pleased with. Linens were spotless, sheets/blanket was spotless, everything was great. The location of the hotel was nice, but ONLY if you want direct access to the beach and the Venice Boardwalk, otherwise, there is nothing else around that you can easily walk to (Santa Monica Pier is a 45 minute walk from the hotel). Directly behind the hotel are basketball courts, the bike path, the boardwalk, and the beach. Here's where some of the annoyances come into play. We reserved a 6th floor \"Ocean View King Bed\", or as it states on the website, the \"Premier Ocean View King\". We got a room on the south-facing side of the building. The ocean view was fantastic from the 6th floor, as there were no other buildings as tall as Hotel Erwin (on that side of the building, anyway). You could see a decent stretch of ocean down the coast towards Marina Del Ray. We were happy with the view. However, the bed we had in our room was NOT a king size bed, but queen size. I have a queen size bed at home, and have slept on king size beds in other hotels, and I'm confident that what we had was not king size. The bed itself was very comfortable though, I never had any trouble sleeping. Also, it was of my opinion that the room was rather small overall for what we paid. However, that is said by someone who stayed a week. If I were to only stay a couple of days, it would've been fine. Also, on their website, our room was described as having a \"private balcony\", which is an absolute lie. Putting up 3 foot high glass panes to section off a building-long balcony does not make it private. If I wanted, I could've easily climbed over these short walls and entered someone's room if they didn't have their balcony door locked. If one were so inclined, they could make their way all the way down the building and back just on the balconies. We were saddened that we couldn't leave the door open at night for fear of someone coming into our room. A nice touch, however, were the lockable screen doors, but those wouldn't have held anyone back who wanted in. This was only on the sixth floor, however, I cannot speak for other floors. Next, the \"complimentary high-speed wireless internet\" was basically non-existant. On my laptop, I could see the network, but the signal was so weak that it wouldn't connect (< 20% signal). If I stood in the door to the room, it would get a little better (< 40% signal) and let me connect (although still excruciatingly slow), but the fact that I was standing in the doorway (and for such a meager signal) made it pointless. Keep in mind that I stayed in the very middle of the sixth floor, next to the ice/soda machine, so it's not like I was staying on one extremity or the other. As soon as you walk into the room, the signal drops and your connection goes bye-bye. I contacted the front desk about it, and from what I gathered (without him saying it directly), the person I talked to knew this was already an issue, and handed me an ethernet cable and a phone number to call tech support so they could help me while I was in my room. I initially tried the ethernet cable and plugged it into the jack next to the bed, and the ethernet port was dead. I called the number, a gentleman came about 5 minutes later, had a conversation with me in very broken english that I did not understand (he never came into the room, just stood in the door), and left (never saw or heard from him from again, but then again, I couldn't understand what he was saying to me, so I just nodded to everything until he left). The wireless was still non-usable later that night, and I stumbled upon another ethernet port behind the coffee-maker on the other side of the room, plugged in the cable, and I finally was able to get internet. Unfortunately, I then had an ethernet cable strung across the room for the entire rest of my stay there, but at least the internet was fast. My suggestion is to bring a cable with you if you stay at this hotel and want internet. On to other things, we were pleased with the large 42\" TV in the room. It was a plasma, if that matters to anyone. There were composite, s-video, and component hookups on the wall, but we didn't use them. It appears that certain channels were for those hookups. The selection of channels available was fine, around 30-35 in all, everything you'd want/need for a business/vacation trip. Another annoyance was the overpriced parking (valet only, no self-parking). $25/night is a bit steep in my opinion. Also, the long waits for valet service were bad. One night was a particular mess, as I waited for 25 minutes in my car so I could even get into the very small driveway to the hotel. I literally was halfway into the street and barely giving enough room for people to walk on the sidewalk. Luckily there was enough room on the street for cars to easily get by, but waiting a full 25 minutes is insane (it was right at 25 minutes, I kept watching the clock as I was pulling my hair out). When I finally got my car in far enough to where I could leave it, there were a couple of people that were still waiting to get their cars, that had been standing there before I even arrived. The in-house restaurant, \"hash\", was way too expensive in my opinion, so we never ate there nor did we order room service. It's almost like they know they are the only nice restaurant in that area, so they be sure to charge as such. We also didn't go to \"high\", the rooftop lounge, because beer was $7 and mixed drinks were $13+. Way too expensive for my tastes, especially when I think about how I can get a 12-pack of the same beer back home for $9. Prices are highly subjective, though, so maybe others won't find them as absurd as I did ($13 for a biscuit with jelly and some eggs or whatever it was is expensive to me). Probably the most frustrating thing overall is the single elevator. It has a mind of its own, and during the evening when the rooftop lounge is open, you'll easily wait over 3 minutes for the elevator to finally make its way to your floor (3+ minutes is a LONG time when you're standing and staring at the floor indicator). And when you finally get on the elevator, it will most likely stop at every other floor where people simply got tired of waiting and took the stairs (something which we did often, even though we were on the top floor). During my stay, in the middle of the week, we noticed they taped a printed paper that strongly recommended people pay attention to the passenger/weight limits, probably due to the fact that the small lobby becomes crammed with people in the evenings during the multi-minute wait for the elevator. I'll close my book now by listing the pros and cons: Pros: - Great location for beach goers if that's all you want to do. - Very friendly staff. - Very clean hotel throughout. - Comfortable bed. - Great ocean view on the south side with the premium package. - Great entertainment options with video connections and the iPod dock/alarm clock. Cons: - Bad location if you want to do anything other than the beach (Santa Monica looked to be a MUCH better option for vacationers like myself). - Wireless internet did not work, and they will do nothing to fix it. - Bed didn't appear to be king size. - Valet parking was expensive. - Valet parking waits were often long. - Single elevator will make you curse during the evenings. - Expensive in-house eating options. - Small room. - No private balcony after being advertised as such.

The hotel certainly met the needs of our business group, but I would also go back there to stay if I visit Venice as a tourist.

It is a fun must-see beach. Very different from Santa Monica Beach, Huntington, Laguna, Newport.... you name it, Venice Beach is special. The hotel staff told us the boardwalk was unsafe to walk on after dark. And judging by the daytime crowd, we can easily imagine why. However they neglected to tell us that the area to the south of the hotel is quite different. We almost missed a big part of Venice, complete with lagoons and beautiful (also reasonably priced) beachfront houses. One place rents for $2000US a month for tourists. That's amazing for L.A. The rooms are clean enough, and the staff attentive and courteous. Our partial oceanview room is precisely that - looking straight out, the view is the top of a warehouse type building; crank your neck to the left and you can barely make out the ocean and beach about half a block away. There was no balcony. If you have a car, remember to add the valet parking fee ($16 a day) into your hotel budget. Street parking is not recommended in that area. Also watch out for a \"donation\" for the homeless that they sneak in without asking first. We ended up making the donation, but still felt scammed because they didn't ask and put us on the spot when we reviewed the bill.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland", "Title": "\u201cHallways are beautiful; Room decor okay but half-baked\u201d", "Author": "KrisPDX", "ReviewID": "UR26469824", "Content": "Pros: - Beach access - Free internet - Has a safe - Flat screen TV - Showerhead Cons: - Expensive for what it is - Tiny bedroom - Not enough towels - Low quality, old interiors - No towels, sponges, soap in kitchen - Valet parking only", "Date": "March 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cModern and stylish boutique in the heart of thriving Venice Beach- a great value\u201d", "Author": "manuel569", "ReviewID": "UR25708086", "Content": "For those of us with an eye for design, good lighting and a keen sensitivity for zen ambiance, The Marina Pacific provides an excellent experience. Located at the heart of Venice Beach, along the world-famous Venice Boardwalk, The Marina Pacific allows for a great point of departure onto Los Angeles' Westside. Surrounding the hotel are various eateries, clothing boutiques and bars of an alternative/beach lifestyle persuasion. Upon my arrival to the hotel, I was sincerely impressed with the kindness and helpfulness of the valet as well as attendant at the front desk. You are treated as a guest and not just as a number. Once in the elevators, and out in the hallway walking down to my room, I really appreciated the soft lounge grooves under the mellow mood lighting as well as the tasteful portraits that line the walls of various rock & roll artists and musicians among other things. The rooms were nicer than average, and mine had a great balcony which looked north along the coast onto the beautiful Santa Monica Mountains.

So we were woken up each morning at about *:30 am or so, by loud voices, hammering, and music. The last night there, I was bitten several times by something in the bed. When I told the front desk at breakfast, they told me it was something probably from the beach. They then said they were going then to check our room. When we got up there nothing looked like it had been moved or disturbed. We decided to check out not long after that. When I asked to speak to the manager, I was told he was not available, but that he would be calling me in the next 24 hours. Needless to say I never heard anything. I tried calling the hotel, sending an email, still never heard anything. Only after I complained to Best Western directly, did I get told that the hotel claimed they had fixed everything with me already. Shortly after I recieved a generic hotel apology.

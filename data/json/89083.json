I stayed here in double room in November 2011. In town for a conference ~ held just a block away at a big box hotel. The room was clean, and comfortable. The bath had a spacious glass shower (with excellent water pressure). Of course getting the right hotel is really individual~ I didn't really need a view, so I didn't mind the small window that pretty much looked into another building. The beds were just fine (not-please don't ever let me leave the Marriott-comfortable). But really the best part of the stay~ personalized service. Stephanie (sp?) at the front desk played \"concierge\" and did a better of listening, and offering suggestions for food & music, than any other hotel employee I have interacted with in almost 20 years of travel. Honestly- it made my trip. And every time I needed something, and called the front desk- they were on it within moments. The building itself has similar charm ~ great art, a cool lobby. A solid restaurant for drinks and shared plates attached... The few downsides: NO COFFEE IN THE ROOMS. I don't think anyone should have to see me before I've had coffee, but they did have it for sale in the restaurant in the AM. They did not have change at the restaurant when I tried to pay for that coffee. On the upside, when I left with the coffee (after waiting 10 minutes for the hostess to return)-- nobody accused me of inappropriate stealing... Second downside: limited power outlets in the guestroom. It's a problem if you're traveling with lots of tech. Finally: totally awesome swanky bar with good drink list in the lobby, totally slow bartenders... That I'm saying all those things and would still go back?

As we were a large group there on a festival weekend, we had a hard time finding bars where we could all sit together and talk, so we often ended up starting and ending our nights out at the hotel bar. I do have to say they have the best Mojito I have ever tasted! Beware though, they charge extra for all the fresh herbs that are in it! The rooms were well appointed but small, dark.

I say our first room, because we were looking for more of a spa like experience on our weekend excursion. After being quickly and happily moved to another room in the penthouse, we proceeded to the Loa Bar. They make amazing hand made cocktails I hear, (our friend had a killer mint julep) I had Brooklyn Lager Black Chocolate Stout and we had appetizers, (3 cheese plate and grilled marinated artichokes) yum.

I really enjoy boutique hotels and have stayed at many. I know going in that if it is a renovation of a much older space that I am taking a gamble. International House is a beautiful space in a great location just outside the quarter. Upon entering the hotel I was delighted by the electic glamorous feel of the small space. My delight quickly turned to frustration when I got to te reception desk. Upon check in I was told we had been upgraded to a room with a view. Normally this would have been a pleasant surprise but since I had specifically booked the Rock Star (windowless) room for our stay this was not a welcome upgrade. I politely declined the room with the view and let the clerk know that I had been looking forward to my windowless room which I had booked almost 2 months prior. At this point she informed me that in actuality the no longer had any windowless rooms available. I offered to wait until one was made available and was again told that they were all occupied. Interestingly enough our friends that arrived a few hours later were given a windowless room and when I called the front desk to inquire about how they were able to get the windowless room I was told, very courtly, they had specifically reserved that room almost a month ago and that in the future I might consider doing te same if I wanted a specific type of room. Our friends booked their room AFTER we booked! The room itself was so tiny there was not even room for a small chair. The size really wasnt an issue though as that is pretty common with boutique hotels. What wa surprising was the condition of the room. The wallpaper was peeling from the floor and ceilingin th bedroom and bathroom. The headboard was vinyl and had pen marks all over and the wall had multiple scuff marks. Oh and the upgraded window room with a view. Our view was of a wall of windows and the tops of other buildings. When the sun came up the next morning there was no option of sleeping on because even with the drapes pulled shut the room was bathed in light so I was wide awake both Saturday and Sunday morning by 6:30 am. Not exactly a relaxing weekend. Other lowlights: Very limited hours for the restaurant, bar and room service. Bar and parking super expensive. Parking with tax was 42.78 per night!! Highlights: Beautiful design Bottled Water in your room for $2.00. Party for 22 people in the altar loft was nice with tasty appetizers and good service.

The counter space in the bathroom was also small but we all managed fine. The only real complaint we had was a lack of outlets for hair equipment. The staff was friendly and accommodating. When we needed extra robes and towels they brought us some within 15 minutes. They provided great options for local restaurants and remembered us when we dropped off our bags and returned later.

What we got was a small area that was about 4ft by 8ft with a small table and two chairs. Room was nothing special. I booked the room 6 months ahead and signed up for a breakfast each day for $10. I had forgotten about this and when we checked in, there was no mention of the breakfast option,nor were we even told of the hours when breakfast was available. The first morning, we went to the desk and asked for a recommendation for breakfast. The host told us of a place called Ruby Slipper about two blocks away. Again not even a mention of breakfast in the hotel. BTW, Ruby Slipper is excellent!!! Issue number two--when booking online, I didn't see any type of military discount offered so I assumed that they didn't offer one. I happened to ask the desk one day and they said that they didn't. However, when checking out, I asked again and the clerk said that they generally give a 10% discount. They were nice enough to credit my AmEx for that. They also credited the breakfast costs that we never used. Issue number three - a biggie....I happened to leave a power cord for my laptop in the room. I called the next day and they had found it and said they'd send it to me via FedEx and just bill my credit card. I realize that they can't possibly afford to pay shipping for every item that might be left behind so I told them it would be fine and that there was no hurry. The person I talked to said that they'd ship it FedEx ground which I figured to be 3-5 days at approx $20...To my surprise, it was shipped FedEx Priority overnight express....and my card was billed $61.00 Considering all the options, we will look elsewhere for our next visit to Naw-lens", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, AK", "Title": "\u201cNot great room\u201d", "Author": "jennyak", "ReviewID": "UR120117618", "Content": "The international house has a great lobby and bar.

We stayed in one of their \"Rock Star Rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which was not a bad room as far as size and comfort. Some people on other reviews complained about no windows which this did not bother us at all. The hotel claimed they were Rock Star rooms due to stars loving them because you can sleep with no noise from outside, which is NOT true we could hear everything in the halls it was very loud! Room had a nice T.V and bed was comfortable, but towels had stains on them which we were not fans of. Staff was okay, but not good kind of in their own world. When I stay at a hotel I like to see smiles from staff which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see. Bar was average at best, drink were not great under poured for price and if it was my hotel I would switch the lighting in bar which was hands down too bright and they had a cool feel in the lobby but was dark. I feel like it should be opposite lobby shall have the light and bar area should be dim like 98% of most hotels. THE WORST PART of our stay was we had Valet parked my new company car for $38 per night on Friday and when it was returned on Sunday at our check out it had been BASHED. While it was in their hands my rear end was demolished of course I was not very happy about this. The valet manager Jared Farrell told me not to worry about anything and he would take care of it all and have my car fixed right away and then apologized. I then went up to the hotel front desk and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would not be paying for valet since my car was returned in such way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she somewhat rolled her eyes and gave me my money back. No apology not a \" hey please come back we are so sorry about what happened to your property we would love to comp a room for one night in the future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Nothing! Jared Farrell seemed like he was new at the valet gig which was uncomforting since he was the manager what manager doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a business card? Of course Jared did nothing after the fact my company tried to contact him multiple times no calls back, nothing back from their insurance.

Next morning we're going for breakfast at the downstairs restaurant \"Rumbala\". One piece of advice: don't put it on your room. You'll be charged tip in advance and get the food when the waiter (part time bar tender) will consider it is the right time... for him. Do yourself a favor: go across the road where there is a nice little place, clean and friendly.

I have to say, after our last stay, I'm not sure I'll be returning. This hotel has a number of pluses: chic rooms, polite staff, nice restaurant and bar with creative drinks. However, I was very unimpressed with our stay in May. When we got into our room, the linens had not very obviously not been changed. Gross! We called housekeeping and they came up quickly to change them, but it was irritating since I was exhausted and wanted to take a nap. Later that evening, we went down to the bar for a drink where the \"hip\" waiters ignored us for about 15 minutes when we tried to order a drink. Then, I had to wait another 10 minutes or more for a glass of water and another 20 minutes for our check. The waiter was staring at me the whole time and knew I wanted to get his attention, but ignored me nonetheless. At checkout when we mentioned the above problems with our stay, all the staff did was offer an apology. He said that the maid, who apparently did not change any of the linens on our floor, was fired. He said he would mention the problems at the bar to the bar manager. This is an inexcusable way to apologize. At the very least, he should have comped the drinks from our bill and offered us a discount on our next stay. It makes me very angry as we are return guests.

It's close to everything, without being too close to the chaos and noise of Bourbon Street. The staff at the International House was friendly and helpful.

The bathroom was a little small, but clean and up-to-date. Our only complaint about the hotel was the noise. The walls were paper thin and you could hear everything that was going on outside, as if the windows were open. We were on the fourth floor, and there were times we could even hear people's conversations from the street. It made it hard to sleep, especially in the morning when the street cleaner truck came by.

It was raining and cold after returning from a jazz club around 11 pm on a Thursday night - we asked for Irish coffee at both bars - neither could accommodate. The bartender at the lobby bar smugly said that \"bars\" don't offer coffee drinks. Really? The restaurant bar said they were closing and didn't want to brew fresh coffee. Really - this is a luxury boutique hotel and they can't brew coffee for guests? They acted as if 11 pm was soooo late at night. During our stay we didn't ask for anything out of the ordinary, but it felt like all the responses were about why or how they couldn't or wouldn't accommodate requests.

The room decor, however, is minimalist to the point of starkness (at least imo).

Firstly, let me say that we aren't really drinkers. We drink, but its not a focus for us. Travel is however & we ended up really loving N.O. not only because of the awesome food, but the people really were super friendly & welcoming! For us; Bourban Street was way overrated & it 's pretty disgusting in that it's as close as you can get to being a red light district. Add blind drunks, people throwing up/the smell of vomit, wedding parties dancing down the street with strippers wearing next to nothing at all in doorways & you get the picture. Most New Orleans residents aren't spending time there. My advice is that you do something way more useful like: going to a plantation or a museum, or on a tour & learning about the history of the region you are visiting. International House: its very modern & reminded me of an upscale boutique in LA or NY & maybe that is why we picked it. Rooms were clean and neat. No coffee makers (very sadly) but a small fridge you can stock any way you like. One thing they don't have is food 24/7. So, you'd better order your breakfast (& caffeine fix of choice) by 10AM or look elsewhere. Rambla, the tapa's place in the lobby is excellent however & we were sad we didn't get their menu in our room as we loved it & only discovered it the last day. The staff: very friendly & helpful & in many cases went out of their way to help us set up tours, make reservations or directions anywhere. With all that in mind I think doing a little homework before you go is always prudent, wherever you travel to so you know what you want to see before you hit the ground running. We were curious about Burboun Street so we did it the first night & about 10 minutes in we were done. Royal Street: with its antique shops is a nicer, quieter walk & much more enjoyable. Tours: Grayline, VIP & others. Of all of them I liked Grayline the best. They have big, clean buses that will take you out to the plantations (about 1 hours 15 minutes away) & the drivers are professional & knowledgeable. VIP Tours: was touted in our hotel as being \"great\" but we didn't think so. They pick you up. Gotta love that, but that's about where it ended. We drove all over the city, at the end of our trip which was a mistake as we had mostly gotten the lay of the land & its better to do it before you get going. We did drive into the 6, 7th & 9th wards though & saw the homes that were destroyed there still, but mostly new homes (contracted by Brad Pitt reportedly who is only charging cost to get into one. What a guy!) have been built & things are looking up as some have solar panels & most are on stilts, which makes much more sense! We drove around the Garden District with it's lovely homes where Sandra Bullock & John Goodman, among others live. Also, Commander's Palace is there & we thought it had the best food of any where. Ghost tours: this is very popular & we did one on a Sunday afternoon that covers the Garden district. We thought it nothing to rave about & was, of course, allot of stories told by locals that the guides learn & pass on although our guide had 1 story of her own. The Food: is awesome but stay out of \"the quarter\" as it's all tourist food there, except of course K. Pauls/Paul Prudhomme's place. He's a legend. Commander's palace ditto. Chop House we heard was wonderful, can't remember the chef's name but he's very famous. The Palace, just up the street from IH has good food but nothing awesome, however the jazz (on Sunday's not sure on other days) really made it much better!", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cMODERN BEAUTY WITH A THE GLITZ AND SHINE\u201d", "Author": "melaniefh0205", "ReviewID": "UR104653991", "Content": "My boyfriend and stayed for our anniversary weekend which is also Halloween weekend as well...

The desk was dinky and literally no other surface area in the room beyond the tiny desk. Most of our clothes lived folded in piles on the floor for our stay. Nothing on the walls. It was just so bland. It was very clean - I will give them that! We looked at another room, that had a better closet situation on a lower floor, but that room was so clausterphobic as to be completely depressing - we ran back to our original room. The other depressing point as that one night we asked the concierge for a good recommendation for dinner in the Faubourg since we didn't know that area of town well and the place he directed us to was the most soulless, Friday's looking kind of place.

This was not the case at the hotel. Walking into the lobby of overstuff seating areas, crystal chandeliers and candles everywhere was wonderful.

The corner room was spacious and decorated in what I would call high end shabby chique. The shower was huge, the view out the 6 windows great, the bed was very comfortable. Our 3 night stay was enjoyable. Here are few other things we noted during our stay. There is no good place to park near by. The entrance is right on the street with about 2 car spaces used to handle guests coming and going. So if you have a car, be prepared to pay for expensive valet parking. The men who work the front entrance were friendly and efficient. This was true for all of the staff. Also, guests do not have access to an ice machine. I thought this would be a problem, but all I had to do was contact the front desk and a huge bucket of ice was delivered immediately. Another item...noise from the street can be heard even on the 9th floor, but things quieted down late at night and I had no problem sleeping. We opted for the Wellness Breakfast when I made the reservation. At $10 per day for 2 it seemed like a good deal. However, on the first morning, the buffet was out of eggs, sausage, bacon and fruit. About 15 minutes later, the eggs and fruit were refilled but we were told that there was no more bacon or sausage. This was at 9 AM. We went out for breakfast the next morning. On our third and last morning, it was scrambled eggs again, no sausage and an emptly fruit bowl. The coffee station was well maintained and the coffee very good.

The design of the hotel and the rooms is nice, but the execution in our room was a bit lacking if you looked really closely--the floor under the carpet was uneven, feeling as if there was just plywood stuck on top of the floor in spots, the carpet was pulling up at the transition to the bathroom and near a wall, and there were some flaws with tile installation in the bathroom as well--basically, it seemed as if they paid the designers well but the installers poorly. I have to say that I did not really mind any of this because I got an excellent rate for the room; had I paid the published rate for the room I might have been upset. It did not impact our comfort (bed linens were of good quality and there was a down comforter) in any way, and the room was clean, but if you expect everything to be perfect you will be disappointed.

The bill had been paid in full, yet the hotel still had a $1000 \"hold\" on his card that was tying up his funds. Again, bill paid in full, we had checked out a week prior, no damage, no extra charges. Just this hold. Upon contacting the hotel-repeatedly-they said the hold \"can\" be there for up to 90 days.

Greg in reservations went above and beyond before we even arrived.

Nicholas at the front desk should win a gold star award for excellence in personalized customer service. Within one day he learned our travel and dining tastes and every single suggestion he's offered (and he has given us many with the utmost patience and insider insight) hit the mark spot on. He is truly the best asset this hotel offers, and they are very fortunate to have him. The decor is elegantly charming in a streamlined kind of way. We do wish there were a minimum of coffee and tea service at the hotel since the restaurant is closed and with the holidays, many businesses including dining options are closed. We expected that a boutique hotel would at least offer a hot beverage in the morning so we wouldn't have to step out in the bitter cold to start our day, and I hate to admit for my mom, this is a deal breaker. We hope the contract with the Rambla isn't for too long and that the coffee/tea/pastry/fruit offerings will be restored, especially during holidays when so many dining establishments are closed you want the convenience of your hotel to offer the basics.

On the hotel website, the room is shown with tall windows with curtains, a queen double bed and desk etc and is described as: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Remarkably pleasant, soothing spaces in which to relax, sleep and work, each guestroom at International House celebrates contemporary New Orleans style. Average size is 300 square feet, and each of the 117 rooms offers a spa-like bathroom, glass shower or oversized bathtub, Aveda bath amenities, abundant natural light, I-home, ceiling fan, two-line speakerphone, complimentary wireless service, original black and white photographs of today's local jazz greats and fresh Louisiana wildflowers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When we arrived at the hotel, they initially put us in a room on the top floor with two small double beds and where there were two windows of approximately 2ft x 2ft that finished at chest height above the floor, with no curtains or net curtains, ceiling fan etc. We phoned reception and asked if they could put us in a queen double as requested which they said they would do. We were moved next door into a room with a queen double, but unfortunately: 1) It was so small that there was no room for a desk or chair as advertised. 2) The windows in this room were again, 2ft x 2ft square and chest height above the floor, with no curtains or net curtains, just painted brown venetian blinds. 3) The room was directly opposite another so without the net curtains, the other room could look straight in on us. To protect our privacy, we had to shut the blinds which meant the room was either dingy and overlooked with blinds open, or very dark and private with them down. 4) As a result of the two tiny windows, the room was extremely dark so no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153abundant natural light\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 5) The bathroom had not been refurbished (the manager told us they hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got to that room yet) so there were no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aveda products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, just generic supermarket branded soap, and the sink was an old stainless steel affair. 6) There was no ceiling fan and the ceiling itself was rough, uncovered concrete. We telephoned reception who apologised but said that there were no other available rooms for that night. They said that instead, they would try to move us the next day so we had to unpack, then repack and then leave our bags the next day which meant taking our valuables with us. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting at this point that when we asked the receptionist why our room was so poor, she said it was because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was a third party booking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I.e. Expedia customers get the last choice and thus worst rooms. So be very careful as if you book through a third party website, it seems that you may be \"bottom of the pile\" on selection of rooms. We have mentioned this to Expedia. The next day we were moved into a room that was exactly as described which I must say was very pleasant and was as described on their website. If you get one of these rooms you'll be very pleased with the accommodation. Unfortunately, the manager on duty simply said that the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153class the room as Deluxe, so it is\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We pointed out that they could call it a penthouse, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it one and that it was fundamentally not as described. After some discussion, we were offered a free night's accommodation which we couldn't take up due to our flights home. Since then, the hotel has offered and refunded a fairly derisory amount of approximately \u00c2\u00a339 to my credit card but we feel that because of the offer of a free night and the terrible room, we should have had the first night refunded. To conclude then, the hotel and location are great, but unfortunately, they ruined the first night of our New Orleans holiday by putting us in a terrible room, so if you book, make sure they don't put you on the top floor where the rooms have these tiny windows and bare concrete ceilings...", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, room, bar, staff.\u201d", "Author": "Elisedab", "ReviewID": "UR89213195", "Content": "Great hotel!

No-smoking policy is enforced. The wireless Internet worked great, except for the first day (I was told the whole system was down that day). The bad things: windows do not open and thus I had to deal with stuffy/mildewy smell for the duration of my stay. No coffee/tea making equipment. My room was small (imagine a typical hotel in central Paris). The interior of the rooms was worn: huge burn-marks on the upholstery of the chair, the bathroom wallpapers were stained, it looked like the bathtub was about to fall off (there was a huge crack between the wall and the bathtub, all around). I asked for a quiet room but since it was facing the street, I heard lots of noise in the morning (early-morning garbage pick-up?). The house-keeping standard was mediocre--I found someone else's pubic hair in the bathtub my first day; and I found my own hair in the bathtub the second day! What's more, my second day there, I saw someone's room service tray outside their room--and it remained there until 6 in the evening! So I was not too sure about this hotel's hygiene standards after that--I am glad I did not see any cockroaches or rats in the corridor, though I am sure there would be some, if they make this a habit! Now, the terrible thing: the staff. First, I was asked a 200 dollar deposit, because I wanted to pay in cash. This, I was told, was to enforce the non-smoking policy. Fine enough. Later, I found out that since they had my credit card details on record, I need not have paid such a huge sum for the deposit. Second, I had requested before my departure that I wanted the 200 dollar cash deposit back in crisp dollar bills--just like the brand-new bills I gave them when I checked in. I was told by the guy at the reception, no problem. And of course, when I checked out, they did not have crisp dollar bills and could only give me wrinkled ones--which are totally useless in SE Asia (where I live)!

The guy at the reception promised that he will \"send a team to look for the package next morning in the basement and on the first floor\", but of course, the person at the front desk the next day had not heard anything about this. So I never ended up receiving the package before my departure. Fourth, the person at the reception asked for my contact info so the manager could get back to me on the above issues. Of course, it was just lip service, didn't hear back from the hotel. I really don't like to have one bad staff ruin my experience at a hotel, but honestly, the whole team needs improvement!

We were excited to come back to the place that left such a positive impression on our first trip to this amazing city. We were a bit disappointed that the service was seriously diminished. In this review - unless stated otherwise - the room/cleanliness/atmosphere/sleep quality was outstanding. Exactly what we expected and paid for. This is just speaking to the service quality: Concierge prior to our arrival (Amy) was excellent - made great recommendations, asked the right questions, completed our arrangements and followed them up with an email. Yay Amy! Bartender Lucy was - in a word - phenomenal. Whoever's in charge of these things, please give this wonderful woman a raise! Above and beyond doesn't begin to cover it. Check in was smooth, slight confusion about whether or not our room was ready, but not a big deal, and we chilled out in the wonderful bar while we waited for only about 15 minutes. The telephone in the room did not work. The only time this was an issue was for room service or valet service (we just used our cell phones). The front desk did offer to send someone to fix it, but we declined (it was a romantic weekend for us, so we didn't care). The big problems were with room service. As in many hotels, there is an option of leaving a breakfast order on the outside of your door. One of the options is fruit, coffee, and the 'pastry of the day'. The hitch is that you have to hang it by 11 pm. Even though I've stayed at Super 8 Hotels with later deadlines, this was their policy, so fine. Having been out the night before dancing, we missed that deadline for automatic delivery. My husband simply called down the next morning and asked for fruit, coffee, and pastry. For $32, we rec'd 2 miniature slices of watermelon, 2 strawberries, 2 orange wedges, coffee, and 2 pieces of cold baguette toast. That was the 'pastry of the day'. Seriously? In a Culinary jackpot of French/Creole cuisine? Baguette toast? In addition to that order, he asked for a bottle of Champagne on the breakfast plate. This was a Sunday morning, we were going to brunch early afternoon at Brennan's, and wanted to sip some champagne, as is the way in NOLA. This seemed to really freak room service out. \"I'm not sure if I can bring champagne to your room\". REALLY? This is a $250/night room in a four star, and you can't bring a bottle of champagne that your bar sells to a room? The next morning was even worse with room service. We'd learned our lesson the day before, and so my husband got dressed at 9 am to walk to Cafe Du Monde to grab beignet. On his way out the door, he stopped at the front desk to ask that a pot of coffee be sent up to the room (remember, no phone in the room). The woman at the front desk looked at him and said \"We stop doing that at 8:30.\" He talked her into bringing me up a pot, and when I answered the door (I had no idea it had been an issue in the first place - not a weird request for coffee at 9 am in a city known for its coffee) she marched in, and proceeded to tell me just how lucky we were that they had coffee left, and that she delivered it past 8:30 am. Huh. Here I was thinking that the hotel was lucky we chose to spend several hundred dollars with them over the weekend. Silly me. My husband is in the service industry - he operates an upscale resort in the Rocky Mountain West. We cater to the same level of client the International House does. If a guest asks for something, even if 'that's not the way things are normally done', all employees know that \"no\" is never an option. \"we'll try our best\" \"I'm going to see what I can do to make that happen for you\", anything except an eyeroll and an explanation of how difficult your job is. Never ever tell a guest how hard you're working to please them.

Overall we loved NOLA, it was a bit hot (August) but we had a great time. The people, music, restaurants and bars were great as well as the architecture throughout the city. Regarding the hotel let me tell you that I am in the hospitality business and alway do a lot or research when I travel to some place new and after looking at all the best places to stay I picked the International House. I tend to stay away from chain hotels which usually feel generic and cater mainly to business travelers, I look for hip boutique hotels preferably with a cool bar and a good location and I found all of this in the International House hotel. It is located 2 blocks away from The French Quarter and about a 5 - 10 minute walk from the warehouse district so I don't think you could find a better location. The hotel has a great lobby with a very cool bar and very friendly staff. The rooms (we booked a superior corner room 808) are comfortable and very nicely decorated although the bathrooms are very very small. I do have a few issues with this hotel , first of all they need to change the curtains, you have the sun in your face by 7 am and if you are in NOLA having a good time and staying out late you most likely want to wake up late. Second, they don't have safes in the rooms, now this I can't understand for a hotel of this caliber, hotel room safes only cost about $200 dollars. And my last issue is that there are no minibars in the rooms, there was a non working mini fridge beneath the tv but no minibar, what a loss of revenue, I can't believe it. I would definitely stay here on my next trip to NOLA but I would happily pay more if my issues were addressed.

I ordered a double and they gave us a single. I was a little upset because I called the hotel to make sure they had a double and to be honest we booked so late that there were only a few hotels that had doubles available so that was one reason we went with them, the other was because my roommate found out Hill Harper was a part owner. At first the front desk clerk didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to ready to help make an adjustment because everything was booked so that sent me to the internet looking for another hotel which was hard because Essence was in town. Long story short they moved us to a room with a king size bed. The other bed had to have been an xl- twin it certainly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even a queen or even a full size bed. Anyway they made the change with no charge for the upgrade this room was a lot bigger and so we made the best of it.

We saw Tre Songs (?) & TI there although I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognize them till the other women started yelling and fanning themselves.

We also visited the hotel bar, Loa, that night and it was also very nice (service was a little slow, but there were about 30 of us who showed up all at one time). The front desk staff, doorman, and bellman were all very attentive and made several great recommendations. The hotel is within easy walking distance of the quarter and some of the major tourist stops (aquarium, Harrah's, Riverwalk, etc.), but there are lots of options closer as well. We walked about two blocks to Daisy Dukes for breakfast Saturday morning (at the recommendation of the door man) and made it for the early bird special; 2 eggs, choice of meat, choice of bread, and grits for $3.99. If you don't mind waiting in a line, you're also a very close walk to the famous Mother's (totally worth the wait).

If the owners/management believe that poor, too cool for school service, tarnished furniture, old TV sets and dirty in-room carpets and windows epitomise 'boutique', then I think they should take a long hard look at their European boutique peers and really improve IH's standards significantly. Was given a room whose name had little to do with reality - superior double. I am sorry, but there is nothing superior about a room which has tiny and stained windows, dirty carpets, tarnished furniture and a 1990s TV set. There is also nothing boutique about it either. No tea or coffee making facilities. No duvets, just blankets, uncomfortable mattress... I could go on. The plus side was the bathroom which was nice, but somehow did not fit with the rest of the room. It was like as if the bathroom was 4 star standard, but the actual bedroom around 2 Star. When I went down to reception to complain about the dirt on the carpet (which was everywhere around the bed and the chair), I did not receive an apology. Oh no. Instead, I was told: \"OK. We send housekeeping\" I am very sorry, but IH's hotel management really need to up their ante and show some proper customer service standards. If they aspire to be hip and 4 Star, then they should never forget, that too cool for school customer service is not hip at all. In fact, the behaviour of the receptionist just made me think how unprofessional the situation was being dealt with. Whether or not a hotel is a two or five star, rooms have to be clean. And mine wasn't. The same scene continued when housekeeping arrived. Instead of apologising for the dirt, I was challenged that the room had allegedly not been ready, but had only been given to me because I wanted it. That was not only untrue - the same housekeeping person was down at reception when I checked in and told me the room was ready - it also did not make sense. How could you EVER give a room to a new guest if the room was not ready???? Once again, rather than apologising, staff just blamed the customer! Enough said.

It is within easy walking distance to Harrah's Casino, the Convention Center, Jackson Brewery (now a mall), Decatur Street (House of Blues, Nip's, French Market, traditional tourist restaurants), Royal and Bourbon Streets, and several drug stores. A short cab ride or vigorous walk across the French Quarter will get you across Esplanade Avenue to Frenchmen's Street, which is where you will find d.b.a. club and a string of NOLA residents' favorite hangouts for music and evening fun. Also, IH is about 2 blocks from the end of the St. Charles Ave streetcar line, which will take you to the Garden District (the first exclusively American residences in the city and the place where Anne Rice was inspired to write her Vampire tales) and Tulane University/Audubon Zoo and Park (about 30 minutes away by Streetcar). There are 2 Taxi stands within a block, just in case the doorman (usually, Jerry) can't immediately hail you a cab. The rooms are best described as \"very comfortable, but unusual.\" IH is a \"Boutique\" hotel, so there are a lot of designer touches like featherbeds and low lights (which take a little getting used to), a Clock/Radio with a dock for your iPod, extremely foreshortened mosaic art in the elevators (which is fun to figure out), and a big-screen Mac computer in the lobby for guest use. The lobby bar is called Loa, and it is one of the best in the city -- You have to experience it to understand why. The tapas-style restaurant, Rambla, was just reopened, and now offers room service to the entire hotel.

The South is known for its hospitality yet I was impressed by the friendleness and the service provided by the staff considering that the hotel was sold out. The Loft 123 is almost across the street and the sister property of the International House. If you have a chance, try to get a room there. The rooms are very cool and huge.

It was a little weird to come back to this quiet hotel lobby and see this crowd there. No quiet late night drink for me. There's an iMac in the lobby for guests to use. There's just one, though, so quite often there was some young kid aimlessly surfing or chatting while their parents were talking in the lobby so it was rarely available.

The hotel's website says that all the rooms have an ipod dock, but our room only had a CD player (and some great jazz CDs). I mentioned this to the front desk, and they said that only the superior rooms had ipod docks. (This REALLY bugged me - I hadn't brought my charger specifically because I didn't think I'd need it.) Other things that fell short: there was no coffee in the lobby in the mornings, but there was some set up in the adjoining restaurant - but they charged for it. (If I'd been paying $300 per night, I'd have been outraged. As far as I could tell the restaurant wasn't serving breakfast. The coffee was, I believe, just for guests to purchase.) The sheets were too small for the bed and came off the second you turned in your sleep.

It was an awful experience for the following reasons: 1. The room was filthy, dark and depressing. In particular, the decor wasn't at all what you would expect for a boutique hotel. Even though it had been recently remodeled, everything looked really dated and worn. The carpet had tears in it. The furniture was dinged up. The linens looked like they came from a thrift shop. And, to boot, the room was dirty and smelled of smoke (even though it was a non-smoking room). Worst of all, there was almost no natural light in the room, which, when combined with the dreary decor, made it feel like a prison cell. 2. The walls were paper thin. We could hear all the noise from the hallway, as if those making it were standing in our room. During Jazz Fest, people are coming and going at all times of the night. If you're trying to sleep, watch out, as you will hear all the drunken wails from those returning from the bars. 3. The lobby, while very chic, is usually crowded with those patronizing the bar they have there. It is loud and smells of alcohol. I know it is New Orleans, and one should expect some of this...but, I would have liked a little peace in the hotel after a day of craziness outside. Hard to get given that lobby. 4. Front desk staff wasn't particularly helpful. In fact, one of them was downright rude if you ever asked for advice. We tried to get them to tell us the best way to get to the Fairgrounds, and for recommendations on places to eat. You would have thought we were asking for their left arm. I think the issue is that they are under-staffed, and were stressed because they couldn't get people checked in in a timely fashion...much less answer their questions. 5. Not the best location. You aren't in the French Quarter. You aren't far from it, but you do have to walk several blocks. In the hot sun, it wasn't always a pleasant experience to do the walking. There are many hotel options in the French Quarter; in the future, I would choose one of these. And, the neighborhood in which the International House is in still hasn't undergone post-Katrina refurbishment, so is pretty run down (unlike the French Quarter). 6.

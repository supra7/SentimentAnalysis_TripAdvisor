This one is very nice and new, and has their wonderful pillow top beds with great pillows, nice 32 inch flat screen TV. It is very well furnished and spotlessly clean. My room was on the side facing the freeway, but with the thick walls I really couldn't hear a thing from the road. Check in was quick and efficient. The rooms are nice and spacious, great soft chair to sit in and watch some games on TV, nice desk and chair. Breakfast is typical continental breakfast - same as most La Quintas. The only real drawback for visitors to San Diego is that the location is about 20 minutes (north) from most of San Diego. If you are doing things in the northern SD area, it should be great for you. Overall, nice, quiet, clean, and comfortable. The staff is very nice and very helpful. Overall, a great value for the money - better than you'll get most other places in the area.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nor Cal", "Title": "\u201cBetter than I expected\u201d", "Author": "LinasReview", "ReviewID": "UR119879241", "Content": "When I arrived at this LQ hotel, I was a bit apprehensive. The location is right off the freeway, I-15. There were some questionable folks parked in the back parking lot. BUT, I have to say, after my first night there, I felt comfortable. The room was very clean and newly renovated. It was not perfect, I had not frig or microwave. The continental breakfast was not the best. There is an I-Hop, Starbucks, and Mexican Restaurant right there. But I would hope that the LQ would improve their coffee so folks won't have to walk to Star-bucks. The staff was nice and friendly. It was also dog friendly. YES, I would stay there again. It was centrally located to all the places I needed to be in San Diego, Poway and Rancho Bernard. The town is very easy to get around. Thank you LQ-Scripps Poway.

When I checked in the lady working the front desk said we don't have a suite for you. I explained that I had a confirmation number and prepaid for the room. No apologies, instead she blamed the third party service. She asked if I was travelling alone, suggesting that I didn't have a good reason for a suite. She checked for an available king bed. Nothing. She said she had a room with two doubles. I'm a big guy, that's not working. I said I wanted a refund and would find another hotel. Y'know, if people would just own up and apologize then things would be cool. But when there isn't any consideration for my inconvenience caused by them, then I'd rather not deal with them. I didn't stay there. I can't comment on the rooms. The place appeared to have a clean lobby and the outside was decent. However, I will avoid staying at La Quinta since the service was so disappointing.

I was not impressed with this hotel at all, the lady on the front desk was very slow in checking people in, must have waited 15 minutes. When we eventually got to the \"no smoking\" room it distinctly smelled of cigarette smoke - had to trek all the way back to the lobby and wait another 15 minutes to explain the situation - and be given another room. This room didn't smell of smoke, but that was about the only thing going for it - even though it had recently been remodelled. If I'd paid around 50 dollars it would have been OK, but at 100 dollars this place is a rip off. Free breakfast was awful - milk was sour and coffee wasn't nice.

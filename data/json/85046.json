The staff at this hotel --from the front desk to the parking guys to the housekeepers -- are tremendous. My room was also good -- a junior suite with a little balcony. Over the loading dock and with no sun at any time of day, but since I booked a smoking room I can't complain. Acually greatful I was able to book a room that permitted smoking close to my meetings in Miami Beach. But the property is very very tired. The rooms are dark and dated, with beat up furniture and old carpeting. The exception is the beds -- they are fresh and comfortable, and even this smoking room does not smell. Even so, from the decor you'd think you were in an airport hotel. Not good. Needs updating badly. The worst thing is the locaton. There is nothing within walking distance of this hotel. The shopping area connected to the hotel is gruesome, dark, and a little creepy. There is a deli, but it's also not very appealing. You really need to get in a car to get anywhere you'd probably like to go, thereby incuring addtional parking fees (and parking here is pricey -- $29/night) and the inevitable Miami tolls. BTW, keep in mind that when they tell you the \"hotel across the street\" charges the same for parking, they're refering to the Hilton, part of the same chain. In short, I'm disapointed in the property but very satisfied with the service provided.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon,", "Title": "\u201cGRAND HILTON VERY GOOD, ALMOST EXCELLENT\u201d", "Author": "denirokeane", "ReviewID": "UR125726638", "Content": "Hilton Doubletree was very good.

The maids were coming around at 7:45am to clean the rooms, a little annoying.

Sweet! So I wrote back to say thank you very much - see you tomorrow. We arrived the next day, and as I checked-in, the clerk informed me that they had a note in their system to offer us an upgrade. Of course we accepted and thanked them kindly and proceeded to find our room. It wasn't until we walked in and found an absolutely gorgeous 2 bedroom penthouse suite overlooking the bay that we realized this was no ordinary upgrade. So I went back downstairs and asked the clerk if they were sure we were given the right room - and the response was that the manager simply appreciated hearing that some guests were excited to be staying with them... Then they gave me some ideas for places to eat and extra cookies. That was the best customer relations I'd ever experienced at a hotel.

This is becoming more of a problem for anyone using a non-3G iPad (or other tablet, for that matter) that can't be plugged in. It is also terribly inconvenient while using the laptop as well. Along similar lines, my room didn't even have a cord to plug in, so I had to call to get one (though the IT person that came up was very prompt). Mini-Bar. Only stocked with one diet coke. They could have sold me 2 more if it had been stocked properly! Gym. The gym is the only part of the hotel (from my perspective) that has not been redone. The entrance is incredibly deceiving, as it has been redecorated. However, all of the equipment in the gym is old, old, old. The ellipticals struggled, stair-steppers were the same ones I used in the 90's and weight equipment is of a similar era.

The rooms could use a soft renovation (wallpaper, curtains, paint) but the rooms and linens were clean.

Bring your own snacks and beverages and hang out! Quad hot tub is huge. Outside the hotel, you will not find much for restaurants in the immediate area. We went in August, so a 2 mile walk was way too hot. However, we found out (after we were exhausted, hot, and tired...) that there is a free elevated tram. The station is a few blocks away and you can take it down to the Brickell area where there are highly rated restaurants. Front desk staff totally dropped the ball on this suggestion when we asked about how to get around. The best idea they had was taxi and bus. DON'T TAKE THE BUS!!! Front desk also dropped the ball on booking our cruise shuttle. Then they didn't communicate that we needed a voucher or something to give the driver once we got the shuttle re-confirmed and paid for. They would be better off telling you to ask the concierge instead of only half-way handling guest inquiries. So it was not a horrible stay, but it was not a joy either.

We found ALL of the staff (front desk, security, maids, doormen, etc.) to be of very cordial, almost like welcoming us into their own home. The hotel has numerous amenities, including four restaurants (Tony Chan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Primo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were both fabulous), a deli/grocery/liquor store, dry cleaners, and my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favorite, a beauty salon. Taxi service was readily available and, so, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a car. However, on three days I needed to rent one and there was an Enterprise Leasing Company on site and again the service was excellent. Constantine, the manager, made sure that everything was set for my reservations, and the return service was quite easy. I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Michal Hunter, one of the DoubleTree Managers, and told him of our very pleasant experience. All in all, our stay at the DoubleTree Grand Hotel, which went from May 28th through Sunday, June 19th, was excellent.

I was looking for a room with two doubles and a fold-out couch (we had three adults and a 4-year old that sleeps with one of us depending on his mood). Upon making my reservation both the national reservation line AND the hotel reservations desk stated they do not offer a room with a fold-out couch. As a result we ended up paying for an adjacent room. Arrival and check-in was a positive experience as was the room appearance and the hotel did upgrade our rooms to bay view rooms as opposed to the city view rooms normally given for reward stays. Upon getting to the room and checking the couch, it was indeed a fold out, so we ended up paying for an extra room we really didn't need:( Being in Miami, we were all looking forward to some pool time and maybe a few cocktails while there. We headed straight to the pool assuming we could get drinks and towels there (as with almost any Miami hotel). Neither were available which was disappointing. We later learned that the hotel is part hotel part condominiums therefore we needed to provide our own of each (we didn't think to bring the towels from the room). We ended up calling room service for drinks and after much haggling, they contacted housekeeping for us to bring us all towels- we had already gotten in the pool. The AC in the rooms is louder than the majority of hotels I've stayed at. The internet was free given I was an Honors member, $9.95 daily otherwise. Parking was $29 daily (pretty standard for Miami hotels). A big positive was that I forgot my watch in the room. I called two days later and housekeeping had found it! They over-nighted my watch to me at no charge which was above and beyond. Overall, I would recommend staying at the regular Hilton (1 block away) as they have larger rooms and a full service pool area for the same rates (and for fewer points if you're on a rewards stay).", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, SC", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel very close to everything!\u201d", "Author": "KeithnAlly", "ReviewID": "UR113833644", "Content": "Stayed here for three nights.

Room was a good size, clean and with all required facilities. We paid a little extra for the bay view, which was well worth it. Really nice views of the marina and Miami beach further on. Good size balcony. Good size bathroom with a nice shower. Comfy beds and nice pillows. We slept very well. On the ground floor are some shops and a few restaurants and bars. You need them, as there is very little within walking distance. We did find a supermarket, but a bit of a walk. You can get everything you need in the ground floor area. We ate at the Italian both nights. Pleasant food for a hotel and a nice atmosphere. Unlike the reviewer below, we only saw a few people smoking around the pool and it did not cause a problem. We found the pool area to be clean, with plenty of chairs and great views of the marina and bay. Again the hot tub area was very pleasant. Free wifi in all areas. There is no real balcony area outside of the bars, but the adjacent hotel (Marriot I think) has a really nice, cool balcony area with good seating. Well worth a visit . So much better value than staying on Miami beach if you are pre or post cruise, but don't walk around the area, as there is nothing to see. A convenient place to stay for a few nights.

I read a number of reviews and there seemed to be mixed emotions about this place, but given the proximity to Jackson Memorial / UM Medical Campus I decided to give it a shot. Upon arrival they informed me that I had been upgraded from a standard king room to a condo. This was before they knew I was a Diamond Hilton Honors member, so they must have just been way under booked for the night. The condo was HUGE, I would guess it was close to 1,000 sq. ft. It certainly showed its age but it was clean and very comfortable. It had 2 bathrooms, a fully equiped kitchen, a full living room with nice size TV, a huge walk-in closet off the bedroom, and also a washer/dryer combo. The staff were friendly and my request for foam pillows was addressed very quickly by housekeeping. So all-in-all my stay up until the moment I left was pleasant and I was going to leave a nice review. HOWEVER, that all went to the garbage basket real quick. This hotel is located in the heart of downtown Miami, so the only parking they have is valet. No biggie, I left my car with the valet folks and assumed that it would be parked in a secure area in the hotel/condo buildings parking garage. Upon retrieving my car the next morning, I opened my glove box to retrieve my GPS and it was gone. Upon further inspection I also discovered that my iPod had also been removed, as well as all the loose change that was under the arm-rest in the console (every last single penny). I sell microscopes and had a $30,000 system in a box in the back that the thief ripped open. Thankfully they were stupid and didn't touch anything inside the box. I'm about 99% certain that this was an inside job by someone working for the valet company. My car doors automatically lock 5 minutes after the keys are removed if they aren't locked by the driver. Therefore, unless they left it unlocked and someone got into it within the first 5 minutes of it being parked, then someone from the company used my keys to get in and pilfer it. Bottom line - my hotel stay was very pleasant, however the deadbeats that work for the valet company totally spoiled my stay. If you choose to use the valet, make sure you remove ALL valuables, even if they are not in plain sight (I obviously just learned that the hard way).", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWorth what you pay\u201d", "Author": "chileandreamin", "ReviewID": "UR104311476", "Content": "The hotel is located in a convenient spot almost within 15 minutes by car of any area worth a mention like South Beach.

I had to change rooms 3 times. The first had hairs all in the bed and a major bug infestation crawling all over the bathroom and room. They moved me to the condo side, which was worse. The stains on the bed made me want to vomit and the room was just a mess. Pieces of the floor board were missing, there were stains everywhere, wires hanging out, and the shower was the most disgusting, moldy, greenish blue goopy nastiness I had ever seen. My 3rd room had hair in the sink, crumbs all over the floor, trash had not been emptied, and there was an old newspaper thrown about the bathroom. The front desk staff was rude and asked if I wanted to check out (it was midnight at this point and I had no where to go). They finally agreed to send a cleaning team upstairs to clean the room (she was so sweet, btw... the only positive thing about this hotel was the lady who cleaned the room). She was horrified when she saw the condition of the room and very apologetic. In the midst of all this, the elevator broke, trapping me inside. When I finally go the doors to open, they slammed shut immediately as I was walking out and the elevator dropped a few inches, catching my toe in the riff. I was told the manager was on vacation but I arranged to speak with the front desk manager. I had told the staff that I would be back to talk to her on my lunch break (giving the exact time) but when I arrived, she had \"stepped out for lunch.\" I asked when she wouold be leaving for the day and I was told 7:00pm. I told the desk staff that I would be back by 6:30 to meet with her. When I rushed back from my meeting and asked for her, I was told she had left 3 hours ago! I finally talked to her the next day and showed her the photodocumentation of the gross conditions. She did not seem phased but said she was going to give me 70,000 HH points (but would not reiumburse the room charges). She also left a bottle of wine in my room which was inappropriate considering the nature of the conference I was attending. I would normally appreciate wine, but it was just awkward that it was left there on my last day and I could not carry it back on the airplane unless I wanted to pay to check my bag. Anyway, 2 weeks later I still had not received my points in my account (I was told it would take 7-10 days) so I called the HH hotline. They told me (even though I had it in writing) that the hotel had never submitted anything about the points.

I picked this hotel based on decent reviews and because I'm an HHonors member and could get some amenities like free Internet and HHonors points. Room price was in the 260 dollar/night range for a balcony room which worked out to 130 for each of us, not bad for this expensive area. Our room was very large (I was expecting something about half the size) with a sitting area, double bed for each of us with nice linens and pillows, two sinks (which helped a lot when we were rushing in the morning to get ready to go) and big balcony with view of a marina and chairs for sitting out there. The bathroom contained a toilet, bidet (which I could have done without - I'm not a bidet person) and a pretty ordinary tub and shower. I would have liked a deeper or nicer tub but overall the bathroom was OK. There was also a minibar which was missing half the things on its menu but there was also a nice big bottle of red wine for purchase in the room at not too much money (16 dollars which in my experience with hotel minibars usually gets you about a half-size bottle rather than the large bottle this one was). Bottled water was complimentary which was also nice. I used the business center to print out some cruise documents and found the computers and printer in good working order, easy to use and there were four terminals so I didn't have to wait to print out. The wi-fi in the room worked pretty well and like I said I get it for free as an HHonors member rather than pay the 9.95/ day charge. The hotel is also attached to a mini-mall with a couple of restaurants and some fashion and sundries stores. The concierge was helpful, greeting me on arrival and helping us get transportation to the Port of Miami. The desk staff were also friendly and helpful with answering questions and getting our bill split between two credit cards. As others have noted, the lobby is very small which is a problem when a bunch of people with large luggage all arrive at once. There was also a free breakfast included with our room, which turned into a hassle as we first could not find the restaurant serving the breakfast. Turned out there are two places serving it but they are both at the very end of the attached mini-mall rather than in the hotel itself; one place is a grab-and-go and the other is a sit-down restaurant with very few tables. After we finally found the breakfast place, we discovered our free breakfast only included a bagel, coffee and juice - no eggs or anything - and we had to have a special voucher to get it, though we eventually did get it. I would rather skip the \"free breakfast\" and have them knock a few bucks off the room price as it seemed to be more of a gimmick to get you into the restaurants and get you to order other things not included in the freebie, than a convenience for the hotel guests. Also, this hotel is not really walking distance to the Port or to nearby markets, nor is it convenient to downtown Miami, and when my friend tried to take a taxi to a party downtown the cabbie got lost and couldn't find the club. Overall we had a good experience, though, and I would stay here again especially if I was planning to hang around the hotel (like business trip or pre-cruise) and not be going out and about in the city too much.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nassau, New Providence Island", "Title": "\u201cGreat, Grand, wonderful\u201d", "Author": "havlyn", "ReviewID": "UR93663668", "Content": "Lovely hotel the rooms were immaculate.

We picked the Doubletree for its location close to Miami/SoBE/Key Biscayne plus I could get a decent room using Hilton Honors points. My Honors level got me an automatic upgrade to a room overlooking Key Biscayne. We were on the 7th floor right above the marina and had good views of Miami Beach and the bay. The hotel is easy to find. Only valet parking ($29/day) but it was very efficient. The hotel shares space with some sort of condo complex so there are shops, bars & restaurants in the complex. The hotel breakfast was offered at one of the restaurants. The hotel isn't as impressive as the web site photos show. The hallways are a bit narrow and somewhat dark. The king bed room we had was OK. Having two sinks was a big plus and one was outside the shower which was nice. No fridge in the room but they did have a mini bar fridge. The prices were not that outrageous. It had a balcony where we could sit and watch the sunrise over the bay & marina and that was very nice. Overall, the room was OK but not spectacular. The location was close to one of the main causeways over to Miami Beach so that was very convenient. The area around the hotel consisted of other hotels, condos and some sort of arena/venue for shows & operas. We did not walk around the area at all because we did not readily see shops or restaurants within walking distance. May have been there...we just didn't see them. Overall, our stay was fine. The front desk was helpful and check in/out was fine. The valet parking was very efficient. I'm not sure I would stay here again if I went back.

The hotel sits right on Biscayne Bay with great views of the Bay, the Miami Beach strip, and the Atlantic beyond. We opted for the \"condo\" room which had 3 bedrooms though I had reserved a 2-bedroom condo. The rate was cheaper then what 2 hotel rooms would have cost, plus we had 2 bathrooms, a full kitchen with ice maker/water dispenser on the fridge door, a large living room, and an expansive deck with comfortable deck chairs and lounger.

While in Miami we were centrally located to: dinner in Little Havana (go to Versailles restaurant and be sure to drop in on the bakery next door to bring a few delicious items back to your hotel - on SW 8th Street); a short drive over to South Beach; a free people-mover electric tram over to AA Arena for a Miami Heat game; a drive to the everglades for a short airboat tour of the alligators and birds native to the glades; and a not too long of a drive to Sawgrass Mills Mall for great retail and outlet shopping, just northwest of Miami. The hotel has a full boutique shopping mall on the bottom floor with pharmacy, groceries and liquor store. There are also several restaurants on site of which we only had time to try the one at the front of the hotel which had a great bar menu and friendly bartenders.

We booked it at the last minute, and got a good rate, and were thrilled with the view of Biscayne Bay from our room on the 9th floor. We loved the hot tub area - 4 separate tubs but all connected, so there was plenty of room and privacy. What marred the experience was the concierge. We called to inquire about boat tours of Miami on Biscayne Bay, which we had seen advertised in the tourism brochures, and the concierge told us that she would be happy to make the arrangements. She told us that it would cost $39 per person, and that we would be picked up at the hotel and dropped off after, and that we would have to pay her a $30 deposit. What she failed to mention was that the $39 was the rate if you booked the boat trip through Safari Tours. If you just went over to Bayside, where the boats left from and booked the tour through the boat company, it was $26 a person. Bayside was only a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We didn't know any of this at the time, and agreed to the $39. When the driver picked us up (a half hour late), he informed us that the $39 per person rate did not include tax. When he walked us over to the boat company, we realized that the boat ride was only $26 per person, including tax. At that point we told him we were cancelling, and he told us we owed a $30 transportation fee for the ride from the hotel, which we refused to pay. I understand that there are kickbacks in this industry, and if the concierge has a deal with a tour company, that is their business, as long as it does not cost the guest extra money. Here we were not advised that this was through a tour company, and that we could simply walk over and book the boat trip ourselves for $48 less. When we got back to the hotel we talked to the manager on duty, who advised that the concierge service was outsourced. So I can't blame the hotel entirely, but they do have some responsibility. They took our information, and promised to pass it along to the general manager, who was out of town.

We had to walk almost a full circle from the elevators, pull our suitcases up a few steps of stairs before we were able to find our room. After such exercise, you'd think we'd be in for a nice view or something, but nope! The window revealed a scene to nowhere. Well, more like a partial wall, some plants, and what seemed to be some sort of roof top patio/outdoor lounge. The service was great - desk clerks always greeted us and of course the welcome cookie was a nice surprise. But gestures like this are overshadowed by dissatisfying things such as having to pay ridiculous amounts for internet, which most respectable hotels extend as a complimentary feature. Also, the cleanliness of the hotel is questionable for I had found a pubic hair lying in front of the bathtub in plain sight. I understand housekeepers are only human and they can miss spots. But having something like that lying around is just gross, and the reason why I walk around wearing thick socks (or slippers provided by the hotel, which in this case was not). With all this said, this is not a bad hotel. It is a nice hotel. However, nice is not good enough to keep guests from coming back.

The only downside was the bath water which was more lukewarm than hot. There was a double balcony that one enters from the bedroom or the living room and there was a TV in both. Spacious with 1 1/2 baths. The room service like all hotels is pricey but $60.00 (with tip) for breakfast may seem alot but the waffles were HUGE and surrounded by some of the best strawberries we have had. There were two places we had meals at that we will review with one of them for lunch at Primos (supposedly Primo's downtown Miami's #1 choice for Italian Food) and the other Le Faubourg Deli. It must have been a bad day at Primos as if this #1 we are in trouble as the Deli had better food. The service at Primos was one of the worst we have seen in a long time, There is also a pharmacy and a liquor store also nearby.

The Hotels seems to be just one of the businesses in the building, the building itself consists of mostly Condominiums (with plenty of dog owners i may add.) We arrived via Taxi and were friendly greeted by a Doorman opening the cab door. I think he spoke english. (?) We tried to get the attention of a Bellhop, but, oh never mind, we idd not have that much luggage anyway and made our way to the Front Desk. It was 4pm but a 2 Doublebed Hotelroom as we booked (Bayview) was not ready. We were offered to have our luggage stored, with after some waiting time was done. I may add that so far the conversation with the Front Desk people were not very pleasant, as they seem to be very annoyed and bothered by us showing up and the room not beeing ready, as if it was our fault. Anyhow, an hour later we were in our room. The room itself was clean with the exception of some hair in the bathtub... brrr! The Balcony and the Windows were very, very dirty. But we did not mean to bother anyone about that, we are usually easy going. The pool is and exterior \"olympic sized\" on the 10th floor and very nice. the Hotel shares it with the Condo Owners, which seem to be slightly bothered by the hotel guests, but that is understandable. It made us feel uncomfortable though. Upon reentering our room we discovered the ceiling in the bathroom leaking water and the air vent towards the bed turned into a water sprayer. To get help in this matter, an engineer to our room and responses from the Front Desk was like pulling teeth. It turned out the A/C was responsible for the water intrusion and the engineer sort of vacuumed the ceiling tiles dry. No apologies or at least sympathy was provided or shown from the Front Desk. The engineer gaves a coupon for extra cookies to be picked up at the Front Desk. Hmm, fine, we like the cookies, but it did not dry our luggage or shoes. The next morning at checkout the Front Desk did ask us how our stay was and i mentioned the A/C incident. I was asked if i reported it the evening before and why i would bring it up now at checkout. I suppose they thought i was going for a rate reduction for my stay - which i surely would have appreciated, but i was not seeking it - and were very unfriendly. The manager told us that these things happen and there is nothing they could do about it. Still no \"sorry\" or apology. Oh, before i actually got to talk to the manager, i had to deal with Desk Agent who were either not trained at all or did not care much for hotel operations. The only person who was engaging and friendly was \"Roberto\" (?) who brought us new towels after we used ours for the pool. The Front Desk however, seemed utterly confused, untrained and even the manager would propably not last long in a real business envirement, because this property seems to have very, very low standards for \"managers\".", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "boise", "Title": "\u201cmanagement, charges, room, service all substandard\u201d", "Author": "owleyes99", "ReviewID": "UR60260056", "Content": "We booked a few months in advance and called a day before to confirm but when we got there they overbooked.

The room was neat and extremely clean, all amenities were top-notch. High end soaps and supplies. Towels thick and fluffy. Bathroom spotless. Bed and linens inviting and fantastically comfortable. View of Biscayne Bay and the park to the north of the hotel was just lovely. Concierge desk was busy but friendly and accommodating - they act as security for the condos and that is obviously their first priority - so there were understandable interruptions. There is a mall of sorts on the first two levels of the hotel (it is also connected to the Marriott via doors and to the Omni and parking garage via a skywalk across the street) . This area has several shops, restaurants, and convenient services, although we thought prices were a bit high - our Asian dinner cost $80 for two and was good, but not extraordinary. Every interaction we had with any of the hotel staff was great. Housekeepers were friendly and helpful and we noticed security officers making rounds throughout the hotel at various times - and they were also friendly and helpful. Bellmen and valets were always present, busy and efficient, and never failed to open the doors and offer assistance and friendly greetings. We walked to the tram half a block south and easily made our way around the city, although the bellmen can definitely get a cab for you in seconds.

There are numerous tropical plants which separate the two areas, and the views from the terrace are very nice. Everything we had anything to do with was in top notch condition.

Cons: Housekeeping was awful (one day i got no towels, one day i got one towel and the other day i got two towels) One of the days i left the room at 8am to go to my conference upon returing around 3:30 p.m. the room had still not been touched as was never done during the whole day. Front staff was medicore at best, though the hotel was fully booked for Nascar and various other events. The hotel was not apologetic with the room mixup and was blaming the Diamond Desk for a rate code problem. If i did return i would stay in one of the condos not in the hotel part.

I used Hilton HHonors for the first night and then booked a room for the second night. Both the Doubletree Reservation Confirmations listed a double, city view, non-smoking room with additional charges listed as: Parking Charges: Self parking 0.00 Valet parking 29.00 I have no problem with walking from a parking lot so we decided to self park. We drove to the front entrance, unloaded our two bags and I asked the attendant where the self parking lot was located. He stated that all parking MUST be valet at $29.00 per day. Showing him the confirmation listing self parking at 0.00 did nothing. So I surrendered the car keys and went to registration. As we registed I asked about the parking and why my confirmation listed free self-parking. Neither of the room clerks could explain - only saying that there is no free parking. When we arrived to our room, I called the Doubletree main reservation number to ask about the parking. They informed me that I had to speak to the local manager. So I called the hotel with my mobile phone and asked for the manager's office. I was transferred to voice mail where I left a detailed message about my question of the parking and a request he return my call. To date I have heard nothing. We were assigned room 967 - a pleasant, well furnished room with a stunning view of the J.W. Marriott Hotel next door. According to the evacuation map on the room door, our room was designated a \"garden view\" room while the city view rooms are located on the opposite side of the building. So, there were two initial problems; a misunderstanding about parking fees and a room which had a view different from what I booked. During the first half hour in the room we discovered an extraordinary number of other problems: 1. The light over the desk was burned out. 2. The light over the bathroom sink was burned out. 3. The light in the closet was burned out. 4. The ironing board rack in the closet was empty. 5. The hair drier in the bathroom had been removed leaving the plastic sinker-filled holes. 6. The clock-radio wasn't functioning. 7. The light switch for the bathroom lights had an internal problem causing the lights to stay on, occasionally, when the switch was turned off. Doubletree has a help desk reached by dialing \"55\" which I called each time we found a problem. It got to be funny as the help desk person and I started to call each other by our first names. To their credit, each problem was addressed and corrected as well as possible late on a Friday afternoon, but in a hotel of this caliber, the problems shouldn't have existed when I checked in. Then our friends checked in. They had booked two nights using only points and were assigned room 934. We visited them in their junior suite for which they paid the same number of points as I did. They had a large sitting area and an expansive terrace over looking the bay. On our way to dinner I stopped by the front desk to inquire about our room not being the city-view we had been confirmed for. They stated that despite what their own floorplan says, we had a city view. When asked about why we had a small, viewless room while our friends, for the same \"price\" had a spacious room with a view - they had no explanation. We had a pleasant sleep in the well air-conditioned room with really superb beds and down pillows. The next day we were out touring until 4:00. We arrived back to shower and nap until 6:30 when we had a cocktail date. The room hadn't been cleaned. I called the \"55\" help desk and was told that it would serviced as soon as possible. I explained that we needed the room until 6:30 and could we just have clean towels and the room cleaned after 6:30. This, I was assured, would be no problem. We met our friends for drinks and they too had not been cleaned. They asked the cleaning person in the hall who said she had too many rooms to clean and couldn't get to them all!!! At 11:00, we arrived back from dinner and the room hadn't been touched. I called \"55\" and got an apology - that was the best they could do. Finally, on Sunday, before checking out, I called the front desk, got the front desk manager and explained my dissatisfactions.

From the start everything seemed to go wrong. Initiatly we were shown to a lovely condo - sadly it had the wrong number of beds so we had to move. It took well over an hour for this move to be organised - we now suspect that this was because they were trying to knock an unused room into shape. The room we finally received was poorly maintained - cupboards had broken lamps hidden in them, fittings were missing from walls, the laminate floor had chips missing from them, the windows showed signs of damp penetration and there were broken chairs on the terrace. Bedroom doors didn't shut (nor did the blinds) and the single beds (which we didn't want) were actually broken. The cleaning wasn't much better - the last occupant clearly had long black hair - it was all over the shower and the wash basins. The surfaces were covered in dust and many of the sufaces in the kitchenette were soiled. The floor clearly hadn't been swept for some time. Complaining took considerable effort - the Condo manager went out of her way to avoid us and only spoke when we insisted on seeing her. She promised to attend to all the cleaning issues and mentioned that they were planning not to let the apartment again (you can imagine how good that made us feel). She made a vague offer to move our apartments which we didn't take up as were were going out for the day and were only staying a second night. When we returned the condo showed little sign of cleaning (apart from left over containers). When we complained again and asked to see the manager we had a delegation of four staff (including the condo manager) who tried to tell us that we'd been offered a specific ocean-view apartment when we'd coplained earlier. The outcome was that that they waived the costs of one of our two nights stay and gave us free breakfast. If you are considering this hotel be aware that the condos are in a separate area and you should be ready to insist on getting a good room - the condos are not owned by the hotel but sub-let from individual owners.

Its location is good if you have a car. Our stay was near New Years; however it was not too busy. We booked a Baywiew standard room (room 754) at a unbelievably pricey rate for 303 per night (and it was non refundable...). This is probably because it was New Years. We had to valet park at the DoubleTree at a rate of 29 dollars per day, which is actually a good deal (you're probably thinking that is overpriced), because places at South Beach, even public parking, cost 20 bucks with no in or out privileges. The only problem with valet was that they were a little slow, and that they mixed up our key (more info on that later on the review). The hotel lobby is to the left when you enter the entrance. The desk that you see in front is the condo front desk, and not DoubleTree's. Check in was swift, and three cookies were given to us. Only complaint was that the cookies weren't really warm (unlike DoubleTree Monvrovia) like advertised. Another slight complaint was the hallways leading to the hotel rooms. The chandeliers were of in the style of the 80's (not what DoubleTree usually is), and the carpets were a little faded. Also, the lighting was flouresent, which gave a spooky feel to the hallways, and not the warm feel like DoubleTree offers. However, this all changed when we entered our room, which did not look at all like most of the travelers photos. Our room was very modern (unlike the awful hallway), and gigantic! Bayview rooms are much bigger than a regular room...in which we found out later. The rooms looked pretty much like the hotel photos, just a little smaller and a different layout. Our room could probably sleep 6 if configured well. There were two comfy Sweet Dreams Bed, a work desk, a giant down sofa (which could sleep a kid if you wanted to....), and a sofa with legrest (and if you pulled up the work chair to the sofa, it could sleep a teen). There was also Neutrogena toiletries (lotion, shampoo, etc), as well as a face cleanser and a mini tube of sunscreen. In addition, our room had a Wolfgang Puck coffee maker (two single cup style) with complimentary tea and coffee. Our really big complaint with this hotel was some of the people who were at this hotel (probably the condo people). While we were at the pool, a condo owner person spit gum at us, which was simply disrespectful! No ethics at all. Also, the condo area which is with the hotel seems to be a low end condo. The elevators were so so, and inside the condo area was also like DoubleTree's hallways, but worse. Only plus about the condo area was an atrium, which was cool. The pool was pretty large, and was as deep as 6 feet near the bay side and 3 feet toward the jacuzzi. The pool area also had a view of the Marriott Biscayne Bay and cruise ships. This was a plus because you could see the cruise ships that were arriving and departing. One tip that I could see one guest using is that you can get complimentary Zephyrhills Spring Water and as many cookies as you would like just by asking the front desk. This could save you some money by not needing to waste extra money on water. Another tip is to tip the housekeeping people, unless you want a room that is 90% cleaned up (which means your pillows and linens are not placed back correctly if you moved them to a sofa, and that your face cleaner and sunscreen tube is missing). Also, sometimes towels come later on the day...like 3 PM, so if you come back at noon and don Check out was slightly slower, but still okay. Then, there came the valet problem. The valet accidentally mixed up our rental keys with the giant amount of other keys that they have. However, after 20 minutes of us searching with them, a person found our keys (which is actually a \"big task\" due to the fact there were more than 60 keys that the valet had). After that, we were okay. So, in conclusion, above average stay. I would have rated it excellent only if some of the condo people were not so disrespectful and had no ethics (but what can guests do about this?), if we had no problems with valet, and that the hallways were updated. Also, if they had put a dispenser of ice water, like the Marriott next door did, in their lobby, it would be a plus because Miami is very warm.", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGood Experience\u201d", "Author": "gpptraveler", "ReviewID": "UR12227455", "Content": "We had a good experience at the Doubletree.

Hotel superb, we had a bay view room on th 9th floor with stunning views (despite the appalling weather!!) over the bay. Room huge with 2 very comfy beds. Beware of mini bar, as usual very pricey!! Staff were superb, very accommodating and helpful. The guy on the concierge even got us a complimenary limo to an italian at south beach!! All in all a fabulous hotel in a great location for a good price (\u00c2\u00a3194 for 2 nights).", "Date": "November 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medellin, Colombia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and views\u201d", "Author": "CDY", "ReviewID": "UR10329756", "Content": "First I need to state being a Marriott Gold member I have been upgraded to waterfront rooms in each of my stays, great views of the intracoastal. Not sure what my thoughts would be if I was given a room overlooking the construction of the condo being built next door. That being said, the rooms are large, rooms are not new however so there is some wear and tear. Front desk staff not the friendliest, they are oK but nothing special, typical of Miami. Had one issue with a phone charge, Manager never called me back. Parking is $24 per day, it is a pretty effiecent operation however. Great resturaunt on first floor not associated with hotel, it is a small Italian place and is on your right as you come in the front door excellent drink prices and decent cheap food. Hotel is a part of the Grand Condo complex, lots of traffic coming in and out. I guess the value of this hotel depends on the price you pay and the room you get. I have paid $149/night the three times I was there. At that price I consider it a good deal, but if there rates go up to $200/night during the busy season you will probably be disappointed in the stay.", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calangute, Goa, India", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "villafatima", "ReviewID": "UR10076981", "Content": "I stayed 4 nights and found the Hotel excellent in all respect.

We had reserved a doubles room on a non-smoking floor but when we arrived all they had was a King. They had a double bed room available, but only on a smoking floor. Normally, I wouldn't complain, however, the moment we got off the elevator, the air reeked horribly of stale smoke, enough so that our hair and clothes were instantly permeated with it. I called the front desk and stated the room was unbearable; we needed another room as soon as one became open. I think I called enough that they eventually tired of me and mysteriously 'found' another room. Once we were in that room, all was fine. The hotel overlooks the bay, very nice, and the concierge was quite helpful. It's very close to the Biscayne Bay open shopping area with great open air restuarants and stores. It's also close to the cruiselines, but if you're looking for a beach hotel, this is a 4 mile trek by vehicle only, over the bridge. Overall summary, be sure to get a nonsmoking floor, the smoking floors are the worst in any hotel I've been in, other than that, the hotel is nice.", "Date": "October 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roseville, California", "Title": "\u201cNo problems, just a great room\u201d", "Author": "drichrx", "ReviewID": "UR8610131", "Content": "I travel over 50% of the time on business, so I have seen a lot of hotel.

We were originally booked at the Marriott (next door/connected) but they messed up our reservation and suggested we stayed next door at The Grand. To start off the Doubletree Grand is a 'condo - hotel;' meaning that the lower floors of the building is the Doubletree and the upper floors are condos. There is one lobby which splits into 2 elevator banks (one for hotel and one for condo). The general loby is dated with 1980 style brass and pastic-glass lighting. The Front desk for the doubletree is more modern, the staff was most helpful for our last minuet stay. We had a few room options, finding it repulsive to see a kitchen durning our stay we booked the junior suite with 1 king and 1 sofa bed. Not frequenters of Mid-Grade hotels, we were pleasntly suprised. The room was a nice size and the decor was fresh and stylish. Linens were a bit rough by our standards but for the price what do you expect. Balcony was a nice size and a partial view of the bay. Called for additional pillows and a turndown of the room and they responded promptly, including placing cookies on the pillow...intersting touch. Primary reason for staying here was proximatey to the highway, becuase we already enjoyed the relaxation of St. Thomas my wife and daughter wanted to shop. Very close to high-end shopping centers. Pool area was very dated and they didnt provide any pool service or towels, so remember to bring down your bath towels but then make sure you call for more. This is too confusing. The day we left (saturday) the pool was overun by the residents so be prepared to fight for the chairs. Health Club was extensive. The Mall/Arcade area that connects to the Marriott, has some shops and a mini-mart. In general it was a nice place to sleep and a nice home bace equadistant to the beach and shopping. Restaurants are either on the beach or in Coconut Grove area. This seems to be very much a buisness man/convention hotel also close to docks for cruise ship departure. Would proboly never stay here again but was a nice experience. Try the Marriott nextdoor it seemed more updated. If you want to stay on the Beach...Marriott South Beach and The Bentley Beach are great upscale places to stay.

Our room was towards the back of the hotel and took FOREVER to walk to (around several long corners and up a short flight of stairs). This was especially annoying when trying to cart around our luggage. Anyhow, I personally, would never have a desire to stay at this property again. It was in downtown Miami (near just about nothing) which, in my opinion, was incredibly boring and out of the way. Also, the service at the front desk was TERRIBLE! #1 I had booked 2 rooms, one of which a friend was to check into prior to my arrival. She gave my name at the front desk and was rudely told by the agent that they didn't have a record of the reservation and to wait in the lobby for me to arrive. When I did arrive, I gave my name to the agent (a different agent than the one she had dealt with) and had no issues. In other words, my friend had to wait for an hour sitting in the lobby for no good reason. #2 My best girlfriend called the front desk for an ammenity and was rudely told that they would not bring it to the room, but that she'd have to come down and get it herself. Which, being that our room was a quarter of a mile away from the elevator, she said forget it. #3 When we came back to our room in the evening, we found that our room key card was no longer working. I called from my friends room only to be rudely told once again that I'd have to come back to the front desk to receive a new one. I explained to the agent that our room was incredibly far from the elevator and would like for somebody to bring me a new key, as my feet were now blistered at this point from the quarter mile long walk from the elevator to our room. She maintained her position that in order to receive a new card we'd have to come to the front desk to pick one up. Um, HELLO! It's not my fault that the key stopped working! Work with me here! Grrrr... The pool has an amazing view and was huge, but very boring. They have a bar that isn't even open, so in order to get any sort of drink you have to bring it up from the lobby. Our room was, however, very nice and clean. An entire wall full of huge windows with a partial view of the water. Our bed was just fine and the room in general was very modern.

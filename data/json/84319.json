Let me start by saying how helpful all the staff was and accommodating to such a large party. There were about 30 of us there for a family reunion/65th wedding anniversary/holiday weekend. That alone can seem like a daunting task but the staff made it look easy. The pool was very large and clean and towels were easily accessible. The beach was right there, just steps away and even a grassy lawn with lounge chairs and umbrella tables & chairs. An outside bar, ping pong table and a couple of covered tables for shade when needed. One of the biggest reasons for staying there (sight unseen) was because they have a restaurant on site and we wanted to have a big family dinner so no one had to driver anywhere. The staff did a great job and they have a \"free\" cocktail hour..no really it's totally \"free\"! My only suggestion is that if you have a large party for dinner make sure they know how many in advance. I did that for the Anniversary dinner but not the next night and they already had a large party in there and it was difficult for them and a little stressful for all. That was completely my fault....not theirs. I can't say enough positive things about our stay. They just know how to do it \"right\"!

We were only spending one night in Daytona Beach, and this hotel did not accept reservations for only one night on the weekend. I was happy we could get in since we were calling at the last minute for a Saturday night. I was impressed by the hotel's website and reviews, and wanted to see what it was like. We got an excellent room oceanfront on the 4th floor. The view was fantastic! The balcony is mostly adobe, so it was very sturdy and had no rails that could pose a safety risk. There were 2 chairs and a small table on the balcony as well. The room had a small kitchen, a table, 2 queen beds, a tv and a desk. We had plenty of space for our family of 4 and plenty of places to sit. We did not have a sofabed, but our sons shared a bed with no trouble since it was a queen size bed. The bathroom had a vanity and a shower in the tub. It was all very clean with nice towels and large wash cloths. We had plenty of toiletries and plastic cups as well. We were at the end of the hall, so the kitchen had a window and we also had the large sliding glass doors to the balcony, so there was plenty of natural light. The beds were comfy and the linens smelled fresh and clean. We all slept well. The whole hotel was very clean and tastefully decorated. Traders was a nice comfy restaurant with a decor that matched the rest of the hotel. We enjoyed the free breakfast buffet at Traders in the morning. There were hot and cold choices and plenty of seating. THe attendant kept the food coming as it got a busy for breakfast. We had arrived at the hotel in time for the manager's reception that offered free drinks, but we wanted to get down to the beach right away, so we missed the reception. This is a smoke-free hotel and family friendly. I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a family place to stay in Daytona. The parking is a little tight. There is vehicle traffic on the beach right behind the hotel, but it is a nice area of Daytona. We enjoyed the beach and had no problems.

The bathroom was huge, but did not have a fan so it got very humid after we showered. The room was a tiny bit musty and my allergies acted up by the end of the weekend. Loved the 'clean remote'.

Scrambled eggs were ok, but the pancakes were fat, doughy, and crispy burnt black on the bottom. There was no butter, only syrup. The orange juice was standard frozen reconstituted - I never understand why Florida hotels don't offer FRESH oj. They did have yogurt available and some sweet rolls and sausage, which I didn't try.

My first impression from the outside of the hotel was 'anything goes'. No, it's not very impressive from the outside when you first arrive, but the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms more than makes up for the lack of luster. Afterall, it's not a 5 star, but it was a clean and friendly place. We were there during a \"BRING IT ON\" convention (cheerleaders), so there were tons of teeny boppers and their parents in the hotel, making it crowded and loud at times. I was thrilled that I picked to have my room on the 5th floor, b/c otherwise, those that were on the 2st floor really suffered for 2 days full of noise. The rooms were BIG! Very spacious with lots of space, micro-fridge and in room safe. The bathroom is small, but who cares? I wasn't there for the bathroom. Every room has either a side view of the ocean or ocean front which was a big plus. Rooms were extremely clean, beds were a little on the firm side, but nevertheless comfy. The remotes are sanitized between guests which was a nice touch. My boys enjoyed the pool, basketball area, bean bag toss, and beach area immensely. The sand was like powder! Wonderful weather and the water was warm. They have a FREE hot breakfast in the morning with eggs, sausage, french toast, pancakes, danishes, cereals, and fruits.

The staff we encountered were some of the nicest we've met at any hotel ever, friendly and helpful. It was too cold to use the pool but it was clearly kept sparkling clean. We couldn't spot a hot tub. Maybe it was located somewhere else if they had one. Easy beach access. The manager's cocktail hour was great with full sized drinks. Atmosphere in the dining room was cheerful and we were enjoying ourselves so much and liked our server so much at the cocktail hour we ended up eating dinner there. We were very pleased with our decision as the menu, although not huge, was adequate and the food turned out to be very good and prepared perfectly. The breakfast buffet, included in the price, was good with a nice selection. Although a basketball team came to breakfast just as we did the kitchen/servers did a good job keeping plenty of food out. When we checked out I noticed a platter of oatmeal cookies set out under glass for the guests. That was a nice upper-end touch!

They also have appetizer specials like $5 (8buffalo wings) Mozz sticks, Nachos and cheese and other selections for just $5 from 4-7pm. They serve a budget friendly menu which included the 8sliced pizza that I was suprised at how good it was. Fries cost $2.50 our eyes almost flew away in shock at the mountain of fries they plated us up. The other non specials on menu looked $$ price. We was told they have the best burgers and crablegs too by fellow guests. We had so much we already ordered that we offered the food around! New friends was made and we did talk people in to helping themselves. People laughing and having a great time. Bartenders layed back, wholesome and lively natured. Same with waitresses and back house staff that came out to see and hear as well as chime in on the fun. Outside pool was olympic sized outdoor had restroom areas and laundry room borderlined the outside perimeters of the pool side area. Other areas adjacent to the left of the pool was an upper level deck full of nice tables and comfy chairs with umbrellas surrounded by gorgiouse tropical exotic plants. My son kept trying to catch the little lizzards that would dissapear before you could even get close to them. The other end of the pool was greeted by a pavillion that held a ping pong table and a tiki bar which was large enough to seat dozen people are so arround. Also tables and chairs. Plenty of everything. The beach was few feet away and one of the cleanest, white sands I have ever gazed upon or stepped upon. feet was cool in the sun and had'nt we a rental car we would of been one of the many to drive right on the beach. The sand is as compact as concrete streets. We topped off are great night by walking down to Congo Minature golf where they had arcades and a alligator pit! Yes many little to mini sized gators were my son fed them little sliced hot dogs for under $4. They gave him a fishing type rod to feed them with. He had a blast. 7-11 right across the street from here, icecream stand, dollar general, I HOP and laundry mat and WinnDixie. Very convenient opposite of what we just experienced in downtown Orlando. BY which that hotel did make up for our rather misfortunes due to me complaining in a proper proffessional manner recieved comps for troubles. Just a tip people if you are unhappy speak up. Do not wait till you go home to complain. To me that is too late and your wrong to settle and grow angry later. You will find people want to aim to please.

We absolutely LOVED this place !!! Upon arrival we were very impressed with the well kept grounds, the beautiful lobby & friendly staff. Check in was quick and easy, We were provided with 3 keys & a listing of recommended resturaunts. This hotel has interior corridors which we like, they were always clean & well lit. The outside of the hotel is very vintage, but the inside is very modern. As we entered our room, we immediately could tell it had been cleaned thoroughly & most of all sanitized. It smelled very fresh, clean & not like alot of rooms typically smell . The decor of the room was very tasteful & beautiful. We were also impressed at how spacious the room was. The bathroom was a bit small, but never an issue with us. Housekeeping makes sure you have everything you need each day. This hotel has mandatory daily housekeeping. If you don't want housekeeping, it has to be cleared thru the front desk. This hotel has high cleaning standards. We were able to see the cleaning supplies used on the cleaning carts. We saw only name brand DISINFECTING supplies on the cart and also Febreeze which I Love. Most hotels use stuff never heard of. It also appeared on the cleaning carts that the shower curtains are probably changed after each guest. That impressed me!!!! Their shower curtains are all fabric not plastic. I just can't say enough good stuff about housekeeping & how well this hotel is kept. The view from our 4th floor balcony was amazing. We could see both the ocean & the main strip. The only thing I would've liked better was a room with an ocean & pool view, but what we had was just fine. The pool is huge & very clean w/lots of chairs available. More chairs are available in the large grassy area behind the hotel as well as picnic tables & umbrellas. We really liked the gounds at this hotel. We've never stayed anywhere with a backyard. This hotel has a 10pm pool curfew to control noise. Our entire stay was very quiet & no guests were loud or out of control. We saw mainly families & middle aged couples staying here. The hotel also offers complimentary Happy Hour from 5:30 til 6:30 each day, soft drinks are provided for the kids & adults too if preferred. The lounge area is beautiful & comfortable w/lots of greenery & a large coy fish. A big flat screen TV is in this area too. The previous negative reviews just can't be true!!! I am a VERY picky person who never stays in older hotels. I usually stay in the new ones. After reading the good reviews & seeing the awesome pics, I decided to give this place a try. I'm so happy that I did. I learned that Old is sometimes better than New. We will definently return & recommend to others. I promise you will really like it here!!!!", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it and we'll be back!\u201d", "Author": "rgc1", "ReviewID": "UR114908785", "Content": "The Tiki is the best place to stay when you're in Daytona.

We checked in to this hotel at approximately midnight and were served by a man who didn`t look like he knew much of what he was doing. When we booked with hotels.com we had asked for an oceanview room on any floor other than the first. When we were given our keys it was for a hotel room that was facing the parking lot on the first floor. Now I don`t know if it`s their procedure to try and give away the rooms that no body wants that they think some sucker will take or if it was just an innocent mistake. When we returned to the front desk to inform the clerk that the rooms assigned were not as requested he changed them and gave us 2 rooms side by side on a higher floor but pool view. The hallways are very creepy-looking with a hidious and harsh red colouring to them. When we actually got into our rooms there were stains on the carpet and the phone wasn`t working. We decided to check the matresses for bed bugs and thankfully there weren`t any; however on the matress there was a stitching that said MITEX on it and a date right underneath. My friends and I decided to look up what kind of trademark MITEX stood for and found out that they were a cleaning company that sprays matresses in order to get rid of bed bugs termites etc... so obviously some of these mattresses had been sprayed due to a problem with bed bugs in the past. My friends and I didn`t feel comfortable sleeping on a matress that used to have bed bugs crawling all over them and decided to leave at approximately 1 am to check out of this run-down shabby hotel into the Holiday Day In Daytona Resort right down the street. My advice to you is to not stay at this hotel because it wayyyy over priced and you can get a much cheaper deal at a 10 x better quality hotel down the road.

The location is in Daytona Beach Shores which is a little bit south of the hustle and bustle of the main Daytona Beach town area. There are lots of restaurants nearby and a nice mini golf place just a block away. The only reason I rate this hotel as very good instead of excellent is that their housekeeping staff shuts down pretty early in the day. We arrived late at night and slept in a bit our first day and housekeeping called about noon to say they were getting done and did we need anything. They did provide some towels which was really all we needed anyway. Not really a big deal though. The room and the entire hotel area was very clean and well kept. They did have a problem with the elevators one day for a short time. The maintenance staff jumped right on that and got it fixed after a short time. They have a free happy hour every day with free cocktails at the restaurant bar. You have to wear shirt/shoes to go into the bar, but there is an entrance right off the pool area so you can go inside and bring your drinks out to the pool.

We stayed in various types of lodging from a normal chain hotel to a 4 star luxury resort to the Walt Disney World Resort. The Best Western Aku Tiki was hands-down everyone's favorite hotel. It is difficult to please over 150 people from different backgrounds, but the Aku Tiki managed to make it look easy. Karen (our group sales coordinator) went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. Be it a place to park the semi-trailer that travels with us or a hose to spray off the classic cars, no request was too big. The staff was friendly and efficient and check-in went smoothly. Everyone loved the cocktail hour and the morning breakfast buffet. The pool area with the oceanfront tables and seating was a group favorite. I know that the next time I travel to Daytona Beach with a group or for family fun; I will definitely stay at the Aku Tiki. The hotel is clean and well maintained and the staff is very friendly.

The hallways smell really musty (the rooms weren't as bad). I enjoyed our room, until I started noticing all of the bugs in there. I had the balcony open for a little bit (to try to get some fresh air in and the musty smell gone) - so I'm not sure if they just flew in and parked on the wall, or what. There were a lot of them, however, and it seems like they had been there for a while (not just flew in). This was gross. The restaurant on site - I would not recommend it. The pool is totally outdated, and I wouldn't go in it. I don't think that this hotel should be charging the rates that it has. I have stayed at many Best Western's on the beach, (Cocoa Beach, South Beach, etc.) and have always had a clean, bug-free room. My boyfriend came home with many bites all over his body. I really liked the location and service at this hotel, I don't know if they need to have pest control come through or what. If the elevator was fixed and the musty smells gone, I may stay here again.

We ate the breakfast buffet one morning and it had many options for a reasonable price. The food was as well as can be expected. If you drive a car there the clerk gives you a parking pass to display in your window since parking is limited. We had fresh towels everyday and the maids were very friendly. My friend forgot her razor at home and they gave her a very expensive one for free. I was amazed that it wasn't a cheap Bic disposable. There are even free cookies in the lobby.

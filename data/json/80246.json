I searched the internet for several weeks trying to find a \"safe\" economical motel close to SeaWorld in San Diego. Everything was a little high for me, around a $100 a night. ( I'm retired, but still working), So I pulled out my Motel 6 book, and found a deal to beat all the others, $210, total, for three nights, and that included a Micro/Fridge for just an additional $3 a day. The staff were very accommodating; answered all my questions, and were very professional. Having stayed @ a refurbished Motel 6, three times in the last year, in San Antonio, Texas, I expected similar accommodatons in San Diego. The San Diego Motel 6, is on the \"to be refurbished list\" and it is due. The place is just well worn, dirty carpets, etc. I also got the impression that \"people live there too\" ( due to the hard economic times in California). I think this brings down the standard of any Motel. We were in room #171; don't stay there. It is above the parking garage, down the very end of the hall, above the laundry room, and adjacent to the elevator, that goes up and down 24 hours a day. Also, the hall is an enterior hallway in the four story \"tower\" building, and there were lots of dogs and \"poop\" and \"pee\" circles around. I saw a small dog \"poop\" by the vending machine outside, and 24 hours later, it was still there. But like I stated, you get what you pay for, & I got a comfortable bed, and a good bathroom to use and morning coffee each morning in the office. Take your blowdryer, and shampoo, you just get linens @ Motel 6 now. We were out all day seeing the sights, and I slept through the night despite the noise, door slamming, constant pizza delivery, elevator, and laundry room noise. I felt fortunate to have enough money to take a long weekend trip to a fun place like San Diego. I felt even more fortunate, when I went to Ralph's grocery early Sunday morning, and viewed a \"senior\" like myself digging plactic bottles from the trash.

The value is good, the rooms are clean and I go on vacations for the things whatever place I am going to provide, not to stay in a room. I just want a good night's sleep in the room. So, my son and I went on our first ever ocean fishing trip. Sport water fishing they call it. We bought the tickets in advance for the boat, tackle and all of that and then booked a room at this hotel. When we arrived, I was surprised to find 2 buildings on this property. The first is the normal 2 story structure, the second is a HUGE 4-story structure behind it. We got into the room. It was very clean, I'll give them that, but that's where it ends. It was a very odd place. There were 3, small wall fixtures for lighting in the room, which was room 258. The lighting was very low and I didn't like that aspect of it at all. There was no alarm clock, something that really took me by surprise, every other Motel 6 I have been in at least had an alarm clock! No mini fridge and no microwave. Very few channels on the TV as well, though that wasn't really a bother, just throwing it in there. No lamps. Again, very odd. I can't remember any motel or hotel I have ever been in that didn't have a table lamp somewhere in it. But that is far from the worst of it. The noise. ALL night long. Doors slamming. People making loud noises walking up and down the hall - ALL night long. I have never experienced this much noise in any motel or hotel, much less a Motel 6 of which I have been on countless of their properties all over America. However many people were in the room above us? Walking back and forth, all night long. I did not get a single hour's worth of sleep in this room. We got up at 4:15 am, my head was aching. It ruined the trip. We are from Phoenix and had driven into town for the sole purpose of sea fishing. I had to take naps all day long, I was exhausted and basically I felt like I had thrown my money away on this trip because of the lack of sleep the night before. Well, I had paid for 2 nights. I figured after being on the ocean all day long, I would want to sleep a night and then drive home. When we got back from the ocean, I went into the office and demanded my money back, that or a different room with a GUARANTEE that it would be a quiet room. Let me add here that I take a box fan and ear plugs with me on any trip to make sure I will get a good night's sleep. Even with all of that, the noise emanating from above, the hallway and the doors slamming FAR overwhelmed the \"white\" noise of my box fan. We were moved to room 410 - the 4th floor and top floor of this building. I was so exhausted that I wanted to give it a try rather than having to go to another hotel and get another room - though there are PLENTY of hotels in that immediate area. We went to bed at around 10pm. At the same time I had turned the light out to go to bed, someone came into the room next to us and they were making a LOT of noise in there. Fortunately, it only lasted 15 minutes and then we slept - 10 hours straight in fact. But, the second night's sleep was irrelevant. It was the FIRST night's sleep that was crucially important and that was stripped of us from a hotel that doesn't seem to care about it's customer satisfaction level. This is not a typical Motel 6 in any way shape or form. PERHAPS it is a normal type of Motel 6 in the front, 2 story structure that people are used to seeing, but that 4 story thing is an animal. I am guessing from the reviews I have now read around the net about this particular facility that management undoubtedly knows about the noise levels in that bigger building and does nothing about it and certainly, you aren't warned about the noise in advance. If you can sleep with the equivalent sound of a jetliner taking off, then this place is all for you! If not, STEER CLEAR!!! One last thing, room 258 and room 410 were identical inside the room.

I stayed at this hotel from June 17-20, 2011. On the last day of my stay I found a small bedbug on the sheets. I am a biologist by training and profession, so I knew what it was, and flipped the beds to look for more. I found 3 small bedbugs total. I collected 2 of them in a cup and killed one. I took them to the hotel desk and presented them to the manager. He was not interested in seeing them, and surprisingly none of the staff members blinked an eye when they heard the word bedbug (I think they are all well aware they have an ongoing problem). Since he wasn't interested in seeing them in the cup, I dumped them out of the cup onto the counter. He still wasn't interested in seeing them. I asked for a refund, and proof that they were working on fixing the problem. The manager said their procedure was to have an exterminator look at the room and if they found bedbugs they would see about giving me a refund. I put the bedbugs back into the cup and told him to show them to the exterminator. He called later in the afternoon and said the exterminator came and couldn't find anything. I am not surprised by this because I took the room apart and only found 3 (which I collected or killed). However, he said the insects I found were roaches, and not bedbugs! I was a graduate student studying ecology/zoology, and have taken a graduate level entomology course. I have seen bedbugs in entomology class, and have seen plenty of roaches. There is a clear shape difference between roaches and bedbugs, and although the bedbugs I found were small, I confirmed what they were with a hand lens I had in my car. So, the hotel management denies it has a bedbug problem, and the infestation continues.

When we checked in, there were some very sketchy looking characters doing laundry in the \"tower\" where our room was. Then we got to the elevator (a death trap) and headed up to our floor. The smell in the hallway was disgusting, somewhere between mold and feet. The room wasn't overtly filthy, although some of the smell of the hallway had definitely seeped in. The pillows were seriously the FLATTEST things I have ever seen and the bed was akin to something they give mis-behaving prisoners to sleep on. It may as well have been a board or a concrete bench. So uncomfortable. The boxspring had some lovely stains on it... didn't even want to know what that was. The carpet was filthy... neither myself or my friend walked around barefoot the whole time. The thing that killed me was that they were charging almost ONE HUNDRED dollars a night to those that didn't have reservations... we paid around $73, which was still unbelievably high for the quality of hotel we got.

We booked a 1Q room online for $85.99/nt (I'm assuming the rates were slightly higher than usual due to the Tiki Oasis event next door). Note that when you book a \"1 bed\" room, you still just get a Queen bed (instead of a King) AND it's the exact same price as a room with TWO QUEENS! I really wish I would have known this, since I'm sure the 2Q room is larger. ALSO, all of the single bed rooms are in the OLD 2-story motel building near the freeway. The \"Tower\" (a 4-story newer building) houses all of the double rooms. I'm not sure what the rooms in the Tower are like, but our room was pretty icky for $86/nt. The moment we opened the front door, we were BOWLED over by the smell of mildew. It seriously smelled like damp socks in our room. The cleaning staff had not opened any windows prior to our arrival and had left the A/C unit on \"warmer\" temp (it was about 85 degrees, that day, outside). We immediately had to open the window and turn the A/C on full-blast to help air out the room. Unfortunately, the curtains open from the OPPOSITE side from the open window, so you can't even really get good ventilation without somehow propping open the curtains with something. There are no windows in the bathroom, so any time someone took a shower, we had to leave the door open or it became a stinky, mildewy sauna in there. There is a small ventilation \"fan\" in the wall which is on the same switch as the light, so we ended up having to leave the bathroom light on all day after taking a shower in order to keep the room from being sweaty and smelly. There was mold around the base of the tub and along the interior. There was also no lid on the toilet (\"open seat\") and the only towel bar was directly over it. You ran the risk of your towel falling into the open toilet, if you hung it there. There are NO amenities AT ALL in the room. I stayed in another chain's \"budget\" motel, recently, and they still provided shampoo and a coffeemaker. You get none of that, here. You are provided two very tiny bars of soap (total old school soap wafers with the M6 logo embossed on them) which barely last 2 days. The towels are clean and not thread-bare (at least), but are still very thin and small. No hair dryer or Kleenex. A friend of ours didn't even get an ice bucket (we did). There aren't even \"Do Not Disturb\" signs for the door! I had to make my own with a business card and a sharpie. I also can't believe they want to CHARGE you to use the Wi-Fi. The least they could do is give you that for free (it's $2.99 for 24hrs). The bed is hard, the sheets are rough and the pillows are flat. The thin, scratchy polyester blanket on our bed had several large burn holes in it. At least there were no bed bugs. I can't be grateful for that. As someone else mentioned, the parking spaces seem to all be for compacts and people end up boxing you in. There is also no monitoring of the parking lot and on Friday nite, when we came back from eating, we had a hard time finding a space (I know all of those cars were NOT guest vehicles). Here are the ONLY PROS: The A/C actually worked pretty well. It was right next door to Crowne Plaza and there was even a little \"secret pathway\" through the trees, so you didn't have to walk out on the street. We faced the parking lot (instead of the freeway) and our room was pretty quiet. The pool was very clean and some umbrellas were provided -- we even watched the woman clean it (note that it is NOT heated, however). If you are going to an event at the Crowne Plaza and don't want to pay CP prices, this location can't be beat.

The next day we visited the Cabrillo National Monument, which is a lighthouse on top of a peninsula, the peninsula was elevated above San Diego which provided a great view of the ocean and the air force base to the side. The lighthouse itself was fairly small, but there was still a lot of things to see and learn from it. We then visited the Air & Space Museum and the USS Midway Museum after eating lunch at a small restaurant. Both Museums were both worth it, they were huge and there was a lot to see. The Air & Space Museum had a large selection of aircraft and it had a very fun simulator which takes you on a roller coaster ride. The USS Midway Museum, is basically a large aircraft carrier, which you get to board and you get an audio tour of the whole ship at your own pace.

She won't make the same mistake (i.e., booking at this, or any, Motel 6) twice. We check in around 6pm or so, I think, before we head out for dinner in nearby Old Town. She walks to the room (112), and I pull the car around back to the parking lot--only to be solicited by a hooker walking the property. (Uh, no thanks.) Besides the hooker, there were several other \"interesting\" characters loitering in the parking lot. I was sure to take my laptop, iPod, and anything else of value into the room, rather than leaving it in my car. In the room, the carpet underneath, and in front of, the sink area is SOAKED. Not damp, but absolutely saturated, as if someone left a hose running on it. Of course, I just HAD to find that out by stepping in it while wearing socks, and wondering why my socks were increasingly taking on water. Disgusting and unsanitary. (And when I had checked in, the front desk person told the guy behind me that they were totally booked/sold out, and turned him away. So no chance of getting a different room.) When my wife and I are leaving for dinner, the minute we walk out of our room, what do we see? The same hooker soliciting some construction workers (who were staying upstairs) right outside our door. I neither know nor care whether she had more success with them. When we get back, my wife showers. And, after she dries off, what does she come to find out --- THE FREAKIN TOWEL WAS FILTHY DIRTY, and must have been hung back up before we came in (or just wasn't checked by the staff).

Not this one. We arrived at around 10:30pm to find the lobby already locked up. Luckily there was a air condiftioned foyer to stand in. Unluckily, the automatic door wouldn't close and they just wasted electricity... One guest was in font of me and they had started to overcharge her for her room. She had papers saying that she had booked at a lower price and the staff person went to get the supervisor. There were three people in the office, and yet none of them would help me or the other guest who arrived a short time after me. Instead we had to stand, waiting for an hour while two staff people wandered around and the supervisor tried to puzzle out the correct rate. I don't blame the person who was going to be overcharged $50 a night for arguing. The prices of this Motel 6 were already higher than one in downtown, and this made no sense considering there was a big convention in town. Also, one could note from the posted rates, that they had raised the rates at this Motel for the convention weekend. After an hour, we finally were able to check into our room. We were not delighted to note that the TV, the vanity, and the desk were covered in a sticky substance, which I assume from the splatter marks were exploded soda. As we had been traveling for awhile, we just went to bed and thought to say something about it in the morning. Everyday we were there we said something about it, and it was never cleaned. The places was totally booked, so there was no switching rooms, and being this particular weekend there were no other rooms in town. So for three days we lived with someone's sticky exploded (I pray) soda. I had left my pocket change in an ash tray (in our non smoking room) and when I came back to the room it was gone. I figured that the maid had thought it was tip, and it was my mistake for leaving it out like that. Not going to quibble over two bucks in change, we said nothing, I wish we had said something, because the next day $30 worth of items that we had bought were stolen from our room. I have stayed in many a Motel 6 and in hotels which are actually far more rundown and seedier than this one, and yet I have NEVER been stolen from. Most of the time when I read revews where someone says they were stolen from, I think \"why would the staff risk their job?\" I am the kind of person who checks under the bed, and shakes out the sheets.. We were stolen from and I suppose I will start taking those reviews from people who said the same with a bit more faith now.

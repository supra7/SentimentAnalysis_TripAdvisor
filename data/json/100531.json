They claim to have a shuttle that takes you downtown, but was conveniently not running on the weekends. I specifically wanted a place to stay that had a shuttle available to take us downtown. I was going to the Mariner game that night, and did not want to drive. What's the use of staying in a hotel that supposedly has a shuttle for your convenience and don't inform you of that it only runs during the week until you have already checked in!!! This place is a pit. There was dirt all along the baseboards and gross gunk under the table. The tiolet barely flushed and the shower was clogged. Not to mention that the room smelled horrible. I didn't even want to sleep on the so-called queen bed that was all dusty. Don't ever stay here, even if $ is the issue. You will definately get what you pay for.", "Date": "May 24, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR469934272", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "A Neighborhood Experience A great place for the family, close to all the action of downtown without the price.

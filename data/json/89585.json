We had a very friendly and welcoming reception by Katherine at the front desk; she was helpful throughout our stay, suggesting restaurants and activities and always remembering us by name. The concierge, Walter, did a marvelous job helping us select restaurants. He was like a walking restaurant guide and knew the ins and outs of the menus, views, and ambience. And he graciously made all our reservations and sent a note to our room with with confirmations and directions on how to find them. The room itself was lovely and beautifully appointed. As we had made reservations using AmEx's fine hotels and resort's service, we were upgraded from a basic room to a top floor room with breathtaking views of the Boston Commons below. Wow. Also on the top floor is a terrific, light filled pool and gym with state of the art machines, including an amazing stationary bike with a monitor that allows you to \"virtually\" race through various mountains, very fun and great workout.

Expensive? yes but worth every penny. The hotel is in a great situation within easy walking distance of all the parts of Boston you would want to see. It is easy to find and sits comfortably on the side of Boston Common, (Boston's \"Central Park'')on the opposite side to Old Boston and the Cheers bar. The hop-on hop-off tour bus stops just outside, so there is no need for a car or taxis. Having said that Boston is a very easy city to drive around.

My experience this past week allows me to vouch for the wonderful service and food at this 4 Seasons property. However, I was surprised to find that the physical structure of the hotel rooms don't seem to have been upgraded since I first stayed there 20 years ago. I heard that they had invested $40million in room renovations. However, the new soft goods (carpet, drapes,etc.) must have been really expensive since the same shower/tub (small) combination and single sink in the bathroom had not been updated. When I showed up for the massage I booked there were two fans in the room to cool down the heat generated by the adjacent mens locker room facilities. While the massage itself was very good, I felt like I had stumbled into someone's spare room off the kitchen for my treatment. Clearly the massage experience is an afterthought at this hotel. However, the indoor pool is still in wonderful shape and a pleasure to use. The physical structure aside, the service at this property is absolutely first rate. By the time I called for a room service breakfast the second day, the woman on the phone remembered what I had ordered the day before! Everyone on staff is incredibly nice and helpful However, when the starting rate of a hotel is $900 a night, the friendliness of the staff should not be expected to gloss over an outdated physical structure.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, would definitely go back!\u201d", "Author": "Kelly G", "ReviewID": "UR117990657", "Content": "I stayed here in March on business as well, and was really impressed with the hotel - the slightly more modern decor really worked with the high level of service most of us expect from Four Seasons.

Much of the staff has been here for many years. They seem proud to work at the hotel and that gets transmitted to guests. Business Center - Excellent. Conveniently located between the concierge desk and front desk. Open 24-7 with your key. Three computer stations with dividers for privacy. Large printer/copier/fax machine as well. Fitness Center - Awesome! Lots of equipment. An incredibly attentive staff offering towels, water, etc. Great indoor swimming pool. If you grab a chair and sit near the pool the view of the city is unbeatable. Cleanliness/Aesthetics - Hotel is immaculately clean. Several areas (like the lobby and the pool area) are, visually, incredibly nice. Restaurant - Bristol Lounge off the lobby is a really comfortable, serene spot for breakfast (lots of \"power breakfasts\" here, it seems) or lunch. It's really nice without being really formal. Great views across Boylston Street of the public garden if you've got a window table. Unfortunately, \"Aujourd Hui\", the four-star restaurant on the second floor that closed several years ago. Sunday brunch there was amazing. It's always nice when a world-class hotel has, as many (including Four Seasons in D.C., Philadelphia, and New York) do, both a formal, \"occasion\", restaurant and a more casual one too. I miss that. Location - Fantastic! Directly across the street from the city's central \"green spaces\", the Public Garden and the Boston Common. Very easy access to \"T\" stops at Boylston or Arlington. Only a few minutes walk or ride to many of the most popular parts of town (Newbury Street, Copley, the Financial District, Quincy Market). Rooms - Large, spotlessly clean, lots of bathroom amenities. Suites are especially impressive. \"Garden-view\" rooms or suites provide a wonderful view, in any season, of the Public Garden, the Common, and the golden dome of the State House behind them. Cost - As a Four Seasons, it's the most expensive hotel in the city and doesn't present itself as anything else.

We live 20 miles outside of Boston and on special occasions (the most recent being my birthday) we will book a night or two at the Four Seasons. That should tell you something there. First- there are probably properties that are nice and perhaps a little nicer (The Taj, or the Millenium?) but none have the staff that the Four Seasons has. I actually purchased the new book that has been written by the founder of the Four Seasons to figure out just how they do it. Everyone is a pro- and everyone knows who you are , where you are from, that we had our twins with us. Knowing that our twins (who are eleven and well behaved) the staff allowed them to use the workout room (they had made the same exception last year when they were ten). The spa is super, the health club, just what one would expect (see how hard it is to write a review?) from a Four Seasons. The pool is on the 8th floor (perhaps the 7th?) with floor length windows opening up views of the Public Gardens. Day or night the views are incredible! The location at the Public Garden means you are just a half a mile from Newbury Street and Charles Street shopping. Unfortunately the last \"Formal\" Hotel Dining Room in Boston the Aujord Hui closed about 18 months ago- which is sad. But the informal formality of the Bristol Lounge with it's fire places, sofas, tables, and live jazz combo on Saturday Night are great fun. With Window opening up on the Gardens it is also fun to have breakfast. The only downside that we could see is that the furniture in our Suite (the chairs and Ottoman/Sofa) are just this side of being worn out. Given the prices that the Four Season's commands I would not expect this.

The hotel is perfectly located at Boston Common, only a short walk from either tha Back Bay or Financial Districts. The is also a metro station about 150 metres away on Arlington Road. Check in was a straight forward enough affair with young lady explaining everything we needed to know about the hotel. She even gave us a sample breakfast menu and walked us to the elevator. We went to our room which was a garden view room overlooking the park across the street. The room was quite large with a huge, comfortable bed, a writing desk and a massive tv! The bathroom had a shower/bath and again was a decent size. Bathrobe, slippers and designer toiletries were standard. The only thing missing from the room was a hotel directory or perhaps I didn't look hard enough! As it was my wifes 40th birthday, there was a cake and some chocolate covered strawberries waiting in the room when we arrived and what woman dosen't like chocolate and strawberries? A nice surprise. Breakfast is served by a host of waiters/waitresses (except on Sundays when a brunch is offered) who will tend to your every need. I went for a bed and breakfast option which turned out to be a great move. An average breakfast for two waould cost in the region of $50. A short walk down the street will get you a massive breakfast for less than $10 for two people. While it was lovely in the hotel, it all seemed a bit formal. On the 8th floor is a gym and swimming pool. The gym has a good selection of machines and the treadmills have tv screens with complimentary headphones. The swimming pool offers a great view across Boston Common and there is a hot tube that would easily seat 15 people. In the locker/changing rooms there is a sauna and steam room. A full range of toiletries are available for use and razors are providied free of charge. Plenty of fluffy towels and robes are provided and the chilled face cloths are especially nice. Behind the Concierge desk there is a computer room where guests have free access to the internet by using their room key. There was a total of five computers and a printer/copier which was useful as we could check in for our flights and print our boarding cards. On the day of departure, we had a late flight home and our luggage was stored for us by the Concierge. The spa facilities were made available to us (at no extra charge) to shower and change before leaving for the airport. The best thing about this hotel for me was the staff. Everyone addressed you by name and certainly the staff members I encountered were genuinely nice. Perhaps it's down to how I approached them but they seemed to be more relaxed and at ease with me when compared with other guests. The doormen were an especially good laugh and gave me some great information about what was available off the beaten track in Boston. In the Four Seasons, you can see where your extra money goes because the level of service is exceptional and everything in the hotel worked exactly as it should have.

The t.v.s were plasmas with a great picture, the towels were nice and soft. The Bristol lounge was a bit slow but the food was better than in room dining. The cocktails were also quite good and potent. There were two incidents that made my husband and I think that there is a little lack of communication with their staff. Each morning, we would receive a call that was meant for another room, waking us early, followed one morning by a maid delivering a pair of pants to us at 6:00 a.m., only to be told they have the wrong room. We grew tired of them waking us for reasons that were not ours. Also, when the turn down maid came to deliver fresh towels, she put them on the toilet seat before she attempted to hang them up. I told her we didn't want any new towels. By now, I thought there were some things that management should know, so I made a call down to them to make them aware of some of their staff issues. After I spoke to the manager on duty, she told me that she would comp most of our room stay to make up for what happened. We were very thankful that she handled the problem with so much generosity. If she hadn't, I could not in good conscience, have given this hotel even four stars. As it was though, she redeemed their hotel, especially by talking to each department that had made the mistakes.

We reserved the romance package for a Saturday evening. I was disappointed in the online booking process I was unable to select a smoking room. I called the room reservations after booking and they stated no problem. Valet was extremely quick (part of the package), then check-in was very friendly and speedy as well. The attendant did the standard four seasons walk around where they walk you to the elevators which I admit is a nice touch. When we arrived at the room, no ashtrays! I thought my fiancee was going to flip out. And then the weirdest thing happened. I said \"I'll call them for an ashtray\" and just as I finished speaking their was a knock at the door. It's an employee with 2 ashtrays. Knock, Knock Neo (Matrix anyone?) was all I could think of! The room itself was down to the bone clean, with a 42 inch Hi-Def TV. We did not have a view of the common back the back of Vadassha way. That didn't bother me as I was upgraded for free as I booked their cheapest room. The room I booked was $345 with the package and I got the $545 room. Interesting note, they only have 11 of the cheap rooms per their website, and 150 of the \"deluxe\" rooms. So it looks like everyone gets bumped up. For once, the Hi-Def TV did actually have some Hi-Def channels, but just the basic channels (4,5,7 Fox, etc). I'd expect a full HD cable lineup at the four seasons. Another disappointments with the room was no stereo and coffeemaker. The lack of a hotel guestbook was noticeable too when I attempted to get a ride in the complimentary limo service. I found that to be booked. So if you want to use that service on a weekend, call the concierge ahead of time to reserve it. The minibar was a little understocked in the snacks part, but the prices were not out of control ($5 for a beer, thats not too outrageous). We received champagne and treats with our romance package, we liked the champagne but hated the treats (hey, we admit not be foodies, we like chex mix so, if you are you'll probably love them!). The bathroom in the room was large and comfortable with nice toiletries. They didn't give you the whole gambit of stuff however like mouthwash etc. The shower was hot and powerful and the towels I thought were average. The robes they provide are nice. My fiancee liked the lighted make-up mirror. I hated it because I could see my poor shaving job from earlier in the day :) . We went out for dinner and drinks in downtown and came back and found our room refreshed with turn-down service. It was really nice with bottles of water, lights dimmed and everything re-cleaned. The next morning our breakfast was right on time (again, with our package deal). The food was good, someone mentioned earlier in that they limit you to eggs, bacon etc which is true. I couldn't imagine paying nearly $70 for this breakfast for two but when it's included it's good. Checkout was fast and I left the comment card at the concierge and my car was waiting for me when I came outside. I checked out the fitness and pool area quickly, and was offered a bathing suit and work-out clothes and a drink for just walking in the door. That was impressive. Every employee there was focused on making you feel special. The only other true 5 star hotel I have stayed at was Mohegan Sun, so comparing is difficult. I found Mohegan Sun to have a few extra room features that Four Seasons lacked. However, Mohegan does not have Hi-Speed wireless internet or flat-screen Hi-Def TVs as of yet. The service is not the issue at this Four Seasons, nor the location. It's the amount of technology and guest comfort within the room that is missing. I will give it a bit of a slide however seeing it's an older building. Our entire stay was stone silent in our hallway (well designed for this purpose). As far as price, I paid $380 with tax for the romance package. The regular rate was $295 (without tax). So with the package I got $40 valet parking, champagne and treats, and a $70 breakfast so the deal is very good. So is it the best in Boston? It depends. Maybe not for our age range (25-35) who enjoys a little more technology in the rooms like found at a Kimpton's Hotel Marlowe,Nine Zero or the XV Beacon. If you are dependent on the hotel for services aka packages, arranging dinner plans etc I would pick the Four Seasons as their staff is amazing. Again, it's location is perfect, a cab ride to Fanieul Hall was under $10. I would assume the same price to and from the Fenway park (kenmore) area.

I was able to get an excellent rate at the Renaissance the first time, and the location and experience from last year made us want to stay there again. While several hotels are either on the northern side for easy access to the Magnificent Mile, or on the southern side of downtown to provide convenient access to the museums and Millennium Park, this hotel resides right in between both. As a result, getting to MM is as easy as walking across the river and heading two blocks east. Walking to Millennium Park is as easy as two blocks east and two blocks south. All this being said, we are a couple who greatly enjoys walking. If you are not, taxis are never more than $10, usually about $7 or $7.50 depending on where you're heading, and you also have easy access to the water taxis when the season is appropriate. The rooms are as good as any renaissance, but the one detail that I actually found to be nice, though minor, was the fact that windows for the rooms facing the streets were bumped out, allowing you to enjoy watching the activity down the street on both ends. We stayed in a room on the east side where I sat every morning (waiting on the lovely lady to get ready, of course) to watch the activity up and down State St. The hotel is also right across the river from the two architectually famous Marina City buildings. It was always a pleasure to walk out the front entrance and marvel at their beauty.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cLarge Rooms\u201d", "Author": "Laurancn", "ReviewID": "UR126234226", "Content": "Rooms and bathroom are spacious.

Upon arrival at the Renaissance, the check-in line was quite long, and there was no real distinguished line for Marriott Elite Members. When we told the clerk we wanted to do a walk-up reservation, she said the rate was $165. I then told her the whole story, and even pulled out my Marriott iPhone App, to show her the special elite rate. After going in the back for about 8 minutes, she finally said she can honor it, as if she was doing us a favor? The rooms are typical of what you would expect from a Renaissance property, although its slightly showing its wear. Beds are very comfy, and the water pressure in the shower is very powerful! What's also great is that the hotel offers complimentary bike rentals during their summer months! What makes this hotel a selling point is it's location, and how quiet it is.

The lobby is very impressive-looking. It's large and beautiful. There's a bar area toward the front of the hotel. There's also a coffee shop in the lobby area. If you go a little downstairs, there's an asian dumpling placed called Wow Bao and a few other little shops. DINING The 2nd floor has a restaurant. The front desk said it was casual and fine for small children. We went right at 5 p.m. on a Saturday night, and it was okay, but I think we would have felt rather out of place any later than that. The food was very good. My husband had the filet and I had a salmon dish. My only complaint is that our water glasses appeared to have small bits of paper floating in them, which was odd, and my glass had a chapstick imprint of someone's lip on the edge. Something I really liked about the restaurant is that it has several \"wellness\" choices built in -- dishes low in fat, calories, or just overall better for you than the average restaurant dish. ROOM Our room was very clean. The beds were nice and firm. The bedding all seemed to be very clean. The bathroom was clean, including the shower and the shower head (a lot of times there's a decent amount of mildew build-up when you look there). Another commonly dirty spot -- the hairdryer. The one in this bathroom was clean, which was a pleasant surprise. I think it's an easy thing to overlook and therefore never clean. ROOM SERVICE Because my 3-year-old was getting antsy in the restaurant, we left without getting dessert. We ordered room service a little later. We had a spiced chocolate cake, and the kids each had ice cream. It came quickly and with four (clean) iced water glasses. There is a $3 delivery charge and a 20% service charge on top of the food price, and then you have to tip on top of that, just FYI. It was a little pricey for simple desserts, BUT worth every penny for avoiding a big scene with our 3-year-old in the restaurant. Oh, and the room service menu has a wider variety of \"casual\" choices on it. You can get a burger, a chicken or shrimp caesar salad, a French dip sub, etc... and these are not choices when you are dining in. POOL The pool was very nice and had a greeter of some sort. The pool is adjacent to their spa area. If it's a crowded week/weekend, I would recommend bringing your own towels down. The pool usually has them there, but a large group of people depleted the supply before we got down there. There's also a hot tub and a steam room. The pool was nice, but it was very crowded. BREAKFAST The breakfast was delicious. There were a lot more children around and people were overall dressed very casually (people in sweatpants and t-shirts in some cases). They had an omelet/pancake station. They had an assortment of cereals and a wide array of fresh fruit. The hot dishes available were eggs, egg whites, French toast, pancakes, potatoes (with thyme?), bacon, and sausage. You could also order off of the menu, but the buffet had almost everything you could want. LOCATION This hotel was very convenient to everything we wanted to see.

When I questioned the young lady who seated us, she said, \"They had reservations.\" So during the entire meal there were 7 other tables next to the window with views and they all remained EMPTY. This was bad customer service because I would not recommend this restaurant to others. I do a lot of networking with other music personnel and I also work at Merrill Lynch.

After complaining they were able to get us on the same floor and upgraded one of the rooms to a river view. Good to see that my platinum status gets me something. Needless to say, my wife and I are still very upset that they were not able to accommodate our request at 1pm when many of the hotel rooms are still turning over and we requested it weeks ago. The hotel staff that checked us in was not very helpful and felt that the young kids behind the desk did not understand our concern for not having adjoining rooms. Also, as a hotel that is located in the Theater district I learned that printing out tickets is quite a challenge when the concierge lounge is closed.

First off, if you have some extra money to spend, by all means, book a room with a view of the Chicago River! This will be among the highlights of your Chicago trip. From these rooms, you get an outstanding view of the river, Wacker Dr., the Wrigley Building, and (depending your location), the Tribune Tower, among a number of other skyscrapers. It's so nice to be in your room in the morning, have breakfast, and watch the boats go by in the river, and sometimes get a chance to see the draw bridges go up. Keep in mind, it's a big hotel, and most of the rooms face commericial streets, so you have to specifically request river view rooms when booking. Apart from the views, the hotel is clean, and the rooms I've gotten are sizable and well appointed. It's also located in an excellent area of The Loop. You're near Chicago's theatre district, so the famed Chicago Theatre is only about a block away, The Goodman and the Oriental theatres are around the corner, and the Bank of America Theatre and Cadillac Palace are just a few blocks away. You can basically walk anywhere in The Loop from this hotel-- Michigan Avenue and Magnificent Mile are just a couple of blocks away, and there's an \"L\" station (State/Lake) right around the corner. There is also a somewhat upscale-looking little mall attached to the back end of the hotel, and in it is a Wow Bao which I find most helpful if I'm pressed for time and want a fast dinner. Inside the hotel, there is a Starbucks, which also doubles are the gift shop, as well as a very good restaurant. I stay at this hotel whenever I am in Chicago, and highly recommend it.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrisburg, PA", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "WOF8", "ReviewID": "UR120838822", "Content": "This was my second time here.

The bar off the lobby has food preparation on site and, frankly, it stinks. It smells like a vat of burger grease. I had one drink there and fled. The smell (stink) also permeates the lobby.

I know it is not NY or LA and that generally Chicago is the friendliest of the big cities, they have that mid-western reputation to live up to, but they are really nice here, even for the Mid-West. They always take good care of me and my guest and that is a plus. One expample is this: I travel and my wife comes along, she will use check-in first and after work, I will come back to the hotel. Sometime (most of the time) the hotel will give my wife or guest trouble about checking in to their or my room early to place bags or freshen up while they wait on me. This hotel will call me and verify, but the thing is they will do that, they will take the extra step without making my guest or wife feel like a criminal. Beyond the staff, which is hands down the best reason for staying here is the property, the location is wonderful. You are on the river, close to the lake, adjacent to the loop and a block or two away from the \"Mile\", Pier, and all the transportation. You are steps from the L, Metro and other lines and some of the best shopping and restaurants are a stones throw... but don't because there is a lot of glass in this hotel. There is a bar and restaurant on property, but they are week, so leave the hotel and you are on the tunnel route so if it is cold use the underground, just steps away. You are also seconds from many theatres and the library. The hotel is situated in a unique way that allows almost every room to have a view. Don't even sweat the river view, the views over the Chicago Theatre or Daly Plaza, may even be better and the inside corner King Bed rooms facing away from the river have a double window and are twice as large. As always be friendly at check-in and you will benefit for it. The conceirge lounge is very nice, it is two story (kind-of). At night don't bother, there nibble food was kind of week and the wine and beer selection was week as well, but the breakfast items were acceptable and they lounge is very roomy. Several quick service option are on property, including asian food and a breakfast place and there is a Kinkos/Fedex onsite a real plus for me. I like this property for the intangibles, it is not as fancy as I would expect in a Renaissance in a big city, I believe it is one of the properties that use to be a stoufer like the REN in Dallas. Here is my one complaint if Marriott is reading this, you do such a good job making REN different at the your resort locations (ie the Vinoy or Hollywood) but your downtown locations are aaaaaaaa. That said, this is a nice property and I have been able to get rates here on a Thursday through Sunday for less than $150.00 a night. I never travel for biz on a Monday though Wednesday, the prices are cheaper after Wednesday and your clients are always in a better mood.

I have been here several times at various hotels, and I think this one was my favorite. First is the location. It is RIGHT at the stops for the Orange Line (from Midway) as well as the Red Line (up to Wrigley Field... we were there for a Cubs game). So it was perfectly situated in terms of getting to the hotel from the airport. $2.25 in subway fare is SO much better than a $20-30 cab ride or a car and $49 parking! The subway is world class, especially compared to the lackluster system in my hometown of Baltimore. As well, the location here was RIGHT on the river, so while we didn't have a river view (we weren't in our room much anyway), we could walk pretty much anywhere downtown: House of Blues, Harry Caray's, John Hancock, restaurants, Navy Pier, Millenium Park, Riverwalk, etc... all within a short walk. In fact my friend complained that I was making him walk too much! We were on the same side of the \"L\" and on the 7th floor, so while we could hear the train go by, it was no louder than a car going by and it never woke us up or bothered us in any way. So if you are looking for something that will save you cab fare, this is the place. The room was as nice as any other place I've stayed in Chicago - and we don't stay in cheap places in general (Palmer House Hilton was our last one, and I think we stayed at another Hilton previously). The place was sold out, so we were stuck with a room with a king bed and pullout sofa bed instead of two queens, but that was the only hitch to the whole experience, and my friend said the sofa bed was fine. I usually don't sleep well in hotels beds but these were nice. The bathroom was clean and updated. The only problem with the bathroom for me was that there was no fan or good ventilation, so when I took a shower the room got very foggy. Should be some sort of fan or something to help de-steam the room. We had a fridge in our room; I noticed some other reviewers said there were not. The lobby was rather cold, but it was also 90-95 and humid for our trip, so we didn't mind! There is a lobby coffee shop that serves Starbucks, which is fine, but there are also about 5 Starbucks within two blocks of the hotel, including a full service one in the shops in the \"basement\" of the hotel, so if you want a real Starbucks or something in particular like a frappuccino or something, you can just go down to that storefront level. Overall, this was a great experience. My friend is a huge fan of Chicago now, and being able to walk to places easily and everything being close (as well as being literally feet from the subways) made that experience even better for us. I really don't know if I would stay anywhere else on subsequent visits to Chicago - this one really gave us what we wanted (proximity and ease of travel) for our trip. I'm sure you can find swankier places or places with friendlier bartenders or a nicer restaurant in the hotel, but if you're visiting Chicago to sightsee, who wants to eat at the hotel or drink in the hotel bar when you have SO MUCH within a 5 minute walk? I don't need a nice view of the river when I am spending my day out walking along the river!

Upon check in the staff informs me that a room with double beds is not available (even though I booked that) and that I can either get a king bed or \"upgrade\" for 40 bucks a night to a room with two beds. I find this horrible. You cannot seriously think two women and two kids are going to want to sleep in one king bed. So what choice did I have but to do the upgrade. That eighty bucks will prevent me from ever staying there again. The hotel looked clean and had a good location but to allow people to book a room on their website at a certain price and then upon arrival hold them \"hostage\" unless they upgrade is not acceptable. For that price I could have stayed at a much nicer hotel located on Michigan avenue with better room amenities and quality. Had to beg for more towels and shampoo. Towels were thin. Shampoo and conditioners were scarce and the \"ambiance\" was lacking overall. Room was your typical hotel room, beds were comfy but down pillows are always saggy. Upgraded \"view\" was looking down on the roof of the lower restaurants. Hotel has a pool but it's so tiny. Good for kids as it's only 5 foot deep but for adults who want to swim serious laps or want a little R & R...this is not the pool for you. There is a steam room and a hot tub, both are adequate but not luxurious. The whole spa area looks like a after thought and you would never confuse it for a \"spa resort\" type hotel. We did not eat at the hotel since it's way overpriced. Head over to South Water Kitchen or Atwood Cafe for breakfast and lunch.

It was not my first stay at this property, but the last time I was here was about 6 yrs ago. Some things are the same, but sadly some things have changed ... Pros: Great location, easy access from both the Blue Line (O'Hare) and Orange Line (Midway), and just a short walk to Michigan Ave. Large rooms, comfy beds and bedding, large bathroom with Aveda products. All staff we encountered we friendly and helpful. Cons: They used to have complimentary coffee in the lobby, but not anymore. When the desk agent saw me looking for it, she said there should be a coffeemaker in the room, but if there wasn't she would have one sent up. The room DID have a coffeemaker, but if you hate powdered \"cream\" like I do, that is really not a good alternative. The room was booked for 2 people, but they only had 1 robe in the room. I suppose we could have asked for another one, but you shouldn't have to! At check in, I was asked what kind of newspaper I wanted on Monday, USA Today or Wall Street Journal. I asked for the USA Today, but got nothing ... There was no refrigerator in the room, but when I asked about one, they sent it right up and it was complimentary. So this comment could go in the \"pros\" also! Lastly, as I know this is primarily a business hotel and not very busy on holiday week-ends, I have always asked for and gotten a room with a river view at no additional cost. This time they charged me an additional $30 per night for the river view. This was disclosed at check in, and I had to sign off on it, so it was not a surprise on departure. But given the fact that we checked in around 10 a.m. on Friday and both room types were available, that tells me they weren't very full. I know we are all in business to make money, but good will for travel partners (I am a travel agent as well as a Marriott Rewards member) goes a long way.

I booked an executive suite for $544 per night for a weekend getaway for my wife and 2 small children. The room was spacious and had a great view of the river, but it ended there. You know that feeling when you first enter a hotel room that you paid a lot of money for, and you hold your breath for a moment hoping you are not disappointed? When we entered the room and looked around, my wife was quiet. After 15 years I know that means that she is less than impressed, but does not want to make me feel bad by saying anything right away. All 3 lampshades were broken, loose, and wobbly. The dated marble countertop of the bar was gooped in place all round the edges with old white caulk. The wallpaper was tired and worn, like many other things in the room. The next day my wife told me that she had trouble sleeping because she had found hair balls and other junk in the corners where the vacuum can't quite reach, and in front of the bathroom vanity. She was grossed out, and I felt ripped off. I would not recommend this hotel unless they shut it down and do a full renovation. Oh, and don't eat the buffet breakfast.

This is the kind of information that needs to be mentioned when booking the room; if I had know there were no bureaus / dressers, I would not have stayed here.

The breakfast was part of the room rate; the buffet had a nice mix of traditional breakfast foods as well as fruit, yogurt, an omelet station. Kids could make their own pancakes. The pancakes were cooked and kids could add whatever they wanted. If I had know there were no dressers to put clothes, I would not have chosen this hotel for my family. It was quite inconvenient to live out of a suitcase; there are hotels in the same vicinity that would have worked just as well.

We had a terrible experience through the less than 24hrs that we were there. To start off, when the reservation was made (under the name of Lisa Oleson), we were told that we could check-in at 3pm on June 12th. We ended up getting to the hotel a bit early around 2:40pm and were told that our room would not be ready until approximately 3:15pm-3:20pm because the room was clean but a manger just needed to inspect the room. Because this was just shortly after our original reservation time, we were content with waiting. Time continued to roll by while we waited in another friend's room. We continued to call the front desk approximately every 30-45 minutes because it was taking so long and we had dinner reservations at 6pm so we had to leave the hotel at 5:30. It finally reached 4:45pm and I called the front desk and asked to speak to a manager because I was so displeased with the arrangements (or lack there of). I was told that the manager was calling me from a different line so I was instructed to hang up and they would be calling me immediately. I hung up the phone and never heard from them. A steward came down to our friend's room to inform us our room was finally ready at 5pm so we rushed down in a hurry to get ready for an evening out in 30 minutes. I was enraged by the whole ordeal but decided to leave it be and not make a huge deal of it so as not to spoil the weekend. However, things did not stop there. When we picked up our car from valet the next morning, we waited approximately 20-30 minutes before we went and asked what the hold up was. The person at the window said the valet had our keys and our car would be up shortly. It was at that point that we noticed our keys hanging on the wall and informed them that in fact the valet did not have our keys. So after watching people come after us and get their vehicles first for 30-40 minutes, we finally received our car. Overall, this was an extremely poor experience. We spent $350 for one night at the hotel and I don't feel it was worth even a quarter of that price.

They are unfailingly polite, helpful, cheerful, and go above & beyond to assist. The location is superb, being convenient to both the Loop, Mag Mile, and all buses and trains. There is no sight more beautiful than the view of the river from one of the river view rooms. The view alone is worth the price of the stay, even at the outrageous convention period prices. The bedding and basic comfort is satisfactory. Rooms are very quiet, although you can hear the most obnoxious conventioneers talking loudly to each other as they return to their rooms in the wee hours. Internet is $15/day per computer. There are some negatives, none of which are any fault of the staff, but rather the fault of the people responsible for the interior design and maintenance/renewal of the structure itself. The operation of the heating/AC system in our room was unreliable. And an icy cold draft at the window ledge prevented sitting there in the evening to enjoy the view (without a blanket!) The water temperature in the shower is erratic, constantly going from hot to cold to hot to cold, so that you really have to shower with one hand close to the faucet for immediate adjustments. One colleague had very inadequate water pressure in their shower, but got moved to a room with better facilities. There was almost no storage for clothes and misc items. You get a closet and two nightstand drawers, that's it. There's no dresser or any other storage except two tiny drawers in the minibar. On the plus side, there is a decent-sized room safe, although the metal edges are so sharp and rough you have to be really careful if you store a wide laptop in it, to avoid damage. One note of warning: the hotel restaurant is a dismal disappointment if you like your food properly prepared and served. The Starbucks in the lobby is great, and if you like Chinese dumplings, the Wow Bao in the lower level is extremely affordable ($1.39 per dumpling, two are sufficient for lunch) if you want a quick bite. Oh, and I should mention that while our room was exceptionally clean and well-kept, another colleague's room had dust on every surface. Maybe a room that has been empty awhile should be rechecked before allowing the next guest in. In closing, I would not hesitate to stay at the Renaissance again if a river view room was available, because the staff is also so wonderful, but given the lack of storage space and annoying shower, you really have to consider places like the Sofitel where your room will have not only more conveniences but also many little luxuries and trouble-free showering.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay In Chicago\u201d", "Author": "wintersummer", "ReviewID": "UR47591724", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay at the Renaissance Hotel.

The red line subway is 1 block away which will take you to the Cubs or White Sox games. The connsier was outstanding. There was a Harry Potter exhibit at the museum of history and industry. She recommended it after asking my son (8) if he liked Harry Potter. Great idea. Allof the staff were friendly. The last night it rained, so after returning from a day exploring, we rented a movie in the room and ordered room service. They have a children's menu ($5 each) which is unusual in nicer hotels.

Room: The hotel is obviously a little older, however the rooms are large and the decor was clearly modernized very recently. I booked a corporate rate of $179/night, before tax, which seemed very reasonable to me for a downtown loop hotel in Chicago. Bed was comfortable and included enough pillows that even I could find one that I liked. Favorite things about the room: hotel is 100% non-smoking and has good bathroom amenities (i.e. mint thyme shampoo). Negatives: TV has no HD channels. Staff: Check-in was fast & friendly. Front desk recognized immediately that I booked a corporate rate that included free internet and even managed to get my bill correct the first time upon checkout. Wake up call was received promptly and made by an actual human (a luxury these days...). View & Location of Room: I had room #503 which is on the back side of the hotel (facing west) and had a view of virtually nothing except the top of what appeared to be a convention hall, a parking garage, and a residential building across the way. As I was in the room strictly to get some sleep, this wasn't an issue for me (check-in at 8:48pm, out by 7 the next morning). If you are light sleeper, you may want to consider asking for a room on one of the higher floors as the elevated trains run along Lake Street (immediately south of the hotel) and can be fairly noisy. Location: The hotel is located very, very centrally to both River North (i.e. Magnificent Mile shopping) and the Loop. It's basically 2 blocks east of Michigan Avenue if you walk along the river. The hotel is roughly 2 blocks from the Clark/Lake subway stop which has access to all lines (both elevated and underground) except the Red Line. Inbound, I took a taxi from O'Hare which ran me about $45 with tip. Outbound to O'Hare, I took the blue line, which only cost me $2.25 and was certainly faster (about 45 minutes) in rush hour traffic. Food: As it was late when I got in, I used room service for dinner. A club sandwich with fries ran me $21.30, including all fees and taxes. Delivery was prompt & the food was hot upon arrival.

I enjoyed it very much \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to a great extent due to my stay at the Renaissance Chicago Hotel. As known, the first impression is the most important \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so, when I entered my one bedroom suite on the top floor and looked through the windows\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 W-O-O-O-O-O-W!!! The view\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it was fantastic! Great, Mighty, Powerful, Striking, Overwhelming - all these epithets could hardly describe my silent excitement and proud of the talented people who created all this urban architectural beauty for succeeding generations. Just in front of me, there was a bridged river, and on the top of its multilevel banks - the shining newly built Trump Tower, famous funny cylindrical twin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153corn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd towers, as well as Chicago Tribune building and Michigan Avenue in remote. The whole city center is on your palm - really cool and unforgettable! I did a right thing when had chosen the Renaissance instead of the Marriott in Magnificent Mile, cause the last one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is rather trivial. Besides the beautiful view, I was very much impressed by the suite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home likeness, you know. Relaxing colors of the walls and carpets, soft armchairs and coaches, lovely commodes and cupboards, flat plasma screens in each room, small fully equipped kitchen, a nice marble bathroom with all the amenities including robes and slippers, etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all these features made my stay truly comfy. And in general, the premises are nicely decorated: the lobby, bars, reception area got many interesting artifacts including vases, lamps, bookshelves, tables and other elements of professional design. Saying about the service I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d remark that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regular. Anyway, to summarize the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advantages and disadvantages, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the following. The pluses: \u00ef\u0192\u02dc The room cleaning and turndown service are at a very high level. \u00ef\u0192\u02dc The Front Desk staff are awesome. Due to the concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absence, I \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrorized\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd them daily with a billion of questions concerning the city maps, sightseeing, entertainments, locations, routes, restaurants, weather, etc., and every time got sincere and appropriate assistance. And one day, I was talking by phone to a guy from a ticket agency that had not delivered prepaid tickets to me on time, and that guy spoke so fast like a machine-gun that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch some important nuances of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explanation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So I asked a receptionist to help me with conversation, and he took my phone and started \u00e2\u20ac\u0153translating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to me from live English into English for foreigners. Thank you again, guys, so much! \u00ef\u0192\u02dc The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant is very good. I had breakfast and dinner there almost daily and can admit that the service is outstanding. The food is delicious. Besides, its premises got a nice panoramic city view, especially at night lights. \u00ef\u0192\u02dc The breakfast at executive lounge is rather sufficient. \u00ef\u0192\u02dc For coffee lovers, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Starbucks inside the hotel. \u00ef\u0192\u02dc There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a taxi stand at the entrance with ready-to-ride cabs all the day round. \u00ef\u0192\u02dc Limousine service. \u00ef\u0192\u02dc Excellent price. The minuses: \u00ef\u0192\u02dc The thing that struck me most was the absence of the Concierge service at all during the whole period of my stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that looked ridiculous for the hotel of such a brand, as well as \u00ef\u0192\u02dc The absence of an internet terminal (while on vacation, many guests don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carry laptops with them for checking their mailboxes out just a couple of times, you know, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not an exception); \u00ef\u0192\u02dc The mini-bar service is slow and sporadic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without a phone call, the used drinks could have not been refilled for days; \u00ef\u0192\u02dc And, of course, the US Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general principle that executive lounges are closed on weekends though in Europe and Asia they are open daily. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter for business travelers, but vacationers (staying in executive rooms as well) usually arrive on weekends. Nevertheless, despite the aforementioned drawbacks of a limited partial character that obviously can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spoil the general positive impression of the hotel, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to conclude that I truly liked the Renaissance Chicago and surely am ready to stay there again, but next time in summer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a river boat architectural tour and Chicago skyline small cruise ship dinner. Concerning what to do in Chicago in winter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some stranger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tips: 1. Magnificent Mile. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough a half-day walk to get your wallet empty and to relax for the whole stay afterwards. 2. Broadway musicals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a very small choice but worth visiting. 3. Chicago Institute of the Arts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unique institution with unbeatable collection of French impressionists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a must. 4. The Field Museum\u00e2\u20ac\u201c very impressive, bigger than its NYC famous rival. 5. Lyric Opera \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highly recommended. 6. Navy Pier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fun and attractions. Nice views of the Lake of Michigan. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a whole sea, guys, now I understand why these lakes are called Great! 7. Sunday brunch at restaurant on the top floor of Hancock Tower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a must. 8. Millennium Park. 9. Observation deck of Sears Tower. 10. Chicago Black Hawks and/or Chicago Bulls at United Arena \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a must.

I booked my hotel through the conference, then contacted Marriott directly to make sure they had my Gold number.

The hotel is conveniently located - only a 5 minute walk from Manificent Mile and Millenium Park among other sites. I've stayed in other hotels in downtown Chicago and found this to be one of the more versatile locations for seeing a lot of different sites. I stay in a lot of hotels, and in particular a lot of Marriotts. While this overall was a beautiful, newly remodeled room and a lovely stay, there were a number of small things that detracted from 100% guest satisfaction. Here's the ones I can remember now: - hairdryer not in room when arrived late at night, had to request and then wait up for it to be delivered - room serviced 2x/day - of course, every day except for the one when I had showered later in the day and wished for fresh towels! Several days, they took away the bath rug on the floor too, which was just wierd. - TV only got about 10 channels in regular analog service despite the fact that it was a beautiful flatscreen TV While my room had a great view of the city and the lake, I stayed on the 24th floor in a room that overlooks the \"L\" tracks.

Upon arriving, my room was not ready yet since I got there rather early, and the front desk person was super helpful and arranged for my bags to be stored and took my cell phone number to alert me when my room was ready. He also recommended a place around the corner for lunch which was very good. I was barely through my lunch and he called to let me know my room was ready, it was very quick. I was impressed because being cynical, I did not expect anyone to call, but they did, and very promptly and politely I should add! So I returned to the hotel after lunch and retrived my bags and finished checking in. My room was at the end of a long corridor and faced the rear of the hotel. The room was really nice, I enjoyed it. My two \"complaints\", and I wouldn't even call them that, were the noise of the \"El\" train, even though i was on the 20th floor, I still heard it loud and clear every few minutes - it sounded like a strong wind blowing, that is what kept coming to mind. It didn't interrupt my sleep but I can see how it would effect some people's sleep overall. I found it soothing because I like \"white noise\" when I sleep. But, I wish now that I had asked for a front-facing room (those cost more I think, however). My other issue was the bathroom door which is set up to automatically close - it cannot stay open on its own. It's annoying! A colleague who was also staying at the hotel said she rigged it by opening it all the way and then opening the closet door so that the bathroom door could not close. I did this too and it helped - of course I closed the door when I needed to, but also I was in the room alone so I wanted to shower with the door open to relieve the steam. Lastly, speaking of the shower, and maybe this is just me, I had no idea how to turn it on, ha! I thought you would just turn the handle and the water would come on, but on this one you have to PULL the handle out and then turn. It did not say this anywhere so I thought the handle was broken and actually called maintenance - I was embarassed when they told me I simply had to pull the handle first. It sounded like they had heard this before, or at least I am going to tell myself that! Overall, a beautiful hotel with a friendly staff, in a great location in Chicago's Loop.

Some of the minuses are common to all hotels. For instance the make-up mirror would have been perfect for most males or a tall female but not for a short or average height female like myself and my roommate. Although there were two of us staying in the room, there was only one bathrobe provided. The first two days the maid only provided towels for one person. We did not have to request extra towels because I showered after swimming in the pool. The pool was swimmable but small. These, unfortunately seem to be common to all hotels. Other negatives are not common to all hotels. The bathroom door would not stay open by itself; we propped it open with my backpack so that we could use the mirror on the door. I needed to plug the phone cord in my laptop so that I could dial up my office network but the phone cord on the desk phone was caught in a cable-holder that would not allow me to pull it up onto the desk. The phone cord for the bedside phone was more flexible but there was not an empty electrical outlet to plug the laptop into; this limited the length of time I could work to the battery life. The inflexible desk phone cord also meant that you could not move the phone around the desk. I would have loved to watch TV and work at the desk since there was a very good selection of channels; you cannot see the TV when sitting at the desk. There was a great CD/radio/alarm clock but there were only instructions for setting the time. We were able to figure out how to set the alarm but a colleague was not able to figure out how to switch to radio from CD. Although we were in a room with two double beds, there were only two very, very small drawers. This would barely meet the needs of one person in the room but was totally inadequate for two. They did provide us with extra hangers based on my request in my Marriot Rewards profile. Unlike many hotel rooms with two beds, there was plenty of open floor space. We were in an upgraded room at not extra charge. This meant that we faced the river which was a very nice view.

The hotel lobby is unoffending, but totally forgettable. The lobby level lounge is good with furniture arranged ideally for relaxed conversation. The second level has the main restaurant and the meeting facilities. All of it is entirely forgettable and in need of a renovation. However, for a weekend getaway, it was fine. The guestrooms and guestroom corridors look as though they did have a recent renovation. It's all Renaissance standard, but the room was a nice size and te decor was nice. The bathrooms were spacious. However, the spring hinge bathroom doors were down right irritating. I don't need a bathroom door to automatically close. It was very annoying and caused the bathroom to get incredibly foggy and damp. The location is ideal for business as it affords very easy access to the business district and the el.

Before my trip I read all the reviews and was excited to stay here, but after my trip I don't know if I would necessarily stay here again. The room: The room in general was really nice. It was spacious, well appointed, and very clean. We had a view of the construction site next door, but that was expected since we are associates of the company. The bathroom was great. It was nicely decorated and a decent size. What we didn't like however was the temperature in the room. The room was at a constant 74 degrees all four nights of our stay. On the second night we called the engineer to come take a look at it. He told us that the hotel was having problems with the heating/cooling system and that unfortunately there was nothing he could do. He offered to comp us a movie, however that did not make up for the fact that it was ridiculously hot. His only suggestion was to open the windows, which we did, but being in downtown Chicago all we heard all night long were sirens, car horns, and the sound of the train. Needless to say we were unable to sleep well at all. The pool: I was hoping for something nicer. The atmosphere was very tranquil and sirene which was relaxing however the temperature of the pool and hot tub were not regulated properly. The pool was pretty cold each night we were there, and down right freezing our last night (mind you this is supposed to be a heated indoor pool) and the hot tub was so hot it burned your skin. Now, I understand that it is supposed to be hot, but this was definitely hotter than the regulation 104 degrees. The pool water was pretty murky and the one day it wasn't you could see obvious dirt on the bottom. Also the pool closes at 11pm which is kind of disappointing. Guest Services: The staff of the hotel was under par in my opinion. We had a very nice gentleman check us in and give us some details about the area, however he did not explain any of the amenites of the hotel. Is there a business center? Which floor is the pool on? Where is the restaurant located? These are little things but it should be explained at check in. The concierge is helpful if you go downstairs to speak with them directly; don't try to call them from your room because the phone will ring 50 times and when they do pick up the will say \"all lines are busy can we call you back?\" At check out we ran into a few problems. The desk clerk never bothered to ask us how our stay was, to which we would have told him we didn't get any sleep, but I guess he's not too worried about that. He did find it difficult however to charge two separate credit cards. I wanted the room and tax on one card and the incidentals on another. He was unsure of how to do this, which was fine, and asked another associate for help. She helped him out and said everything was all set. When I finally got home I noticed that the clerk charged the same card for both charges so I called up the hotel and asked them to fix it. The woman at the front desk said she took care of it, however now the other card was charged both charges. Honestly, it is not that hard to split the charges between two credit cards, and I won't call back to have it fixed a third time but its not worth it. The restaurant: The restaurant food was great. I loved my fish entree. However our server was a little off. He poured my boyfriends beer, foam over flowing, and just walked away from our table!! Left the soppy mess right there and didn't look back.

The hotel offers a complimentary shoe shine service which is especially great in the winter. I called to have my shoes polished over night and they were returned gleaming in 10 or 15 minutes. The location is excellent. You're about a block or two from all of the wonderful shopping on Michigan Ave and just around the corner from the flagship Macy's on State Street. The health club, pool, and spa are very nice. They've were renovated last year. The equipment is excellent and they actually have a good selection of free weights in addition to the usual machines. I ordered room service for breakfast and everything was delicious and served very promptly. The high-speed internet service was fast and dependable. It was a little pricey, but no different that other hotels I've stayed at. Chicago does have other and even more upscale choices such as The Peninsula, Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton with the Mandarin Oriental and Shangri-la on the way. A night at one of these hotels will easily be 2-3 times the rate at the Renaissance. They are beautiful and luxurious 5-star hotels, but it's hard to justify the extra cost when you can get affordable luxury at the Renaissance. I can't think of anything negative about this hotel.

LOCATION (GREAT): Great location on Wacker drive right on the river and just a relatively short walk to Michigan Ave and Millenium Park and several of the downtown theaters. HOTEL PUBLIC AREAS (GOOD): The decor is a bit dated but still upscale. I think it's time for the Renaisance to renovate its public areas but the hotel still has a luxurious feel. ROOM (GOOD): Our room was very nice and the bed was outstanding (A+).Room was clean and well maintained ( as it should be for these prices). OTHER (VERY GOOD): The weight room, pool and spa area were all very well equiped and kept up. SERVICE: (?). We didn't have any problems or much interaction with hotel employees so not much to say. RESTAURANT: (?) We did not eat at the restaurant (GreatStreet) this time but we've eaten at the restaurant in the past and found the food to be very good. Nice view of the river. OVERALL: I have no problem recommending the Renaissance, it is a top tier hotel with a great Chicago location. A decor update in the public areas may be due but it is still very nice. ONE LAST THING: I love big cities and I must say that Chicago is perhaps the most beautiful big city in America. Clean and well kept with tremendouse architecture and many things to do.

Overall, it is a nice hotel and I would stay there again. We used our marriott points to stay for free which is always an added benefit..free rooms are good! We were able to check in without waiting. I requested a river view room which they gave us. I'm sure it's prettier in the summer when the river isn't frozen but the lights from the buildings acrossed the river were beautiful at night. When we were trying to decide what to do and had the television on, it suddenly went off without warning and did not come back on. I contacted the front desk and was told they would send maintenance right up. After an hour I called them again because no one had come. Then after we had drinks in the lounge and the tv still wasn't fixed I requested a new room because I did not want to find out late at night that the tv couldn't be fixed and have no other rooms available. They switched our room without a problem. We actually got the same room location but 3 floors up. The water pressure in the shower was absolutely awful -- the worst of any hotel i've ever stayed at. I do not know if other rooms are this way or something was wrong with our shower but it was pathetic. The exercise room was wonderful for a hotel. Numerous tredmills and ellipticals, plus i believe stair stepper and bike(s). There were also strength training machines & free weights. The only thing I did not like is that the room was very hot (perhaps because it's attached to the pool/spa area) and there were no fans going so everyone was really sweating more than was necessary. We used the hottub, pool and steam room. The latter was wonderful given that you dont' see those too often anymore. We also had drinks in the lounge which were fine but the lounge itself was nothing to write home about. We did not eat at the hotel. I was disappointed to find that there was not a refrigerator for use in the room. The bar was fully stocked but that meant no room for any in room munchies, drinks & such. We were also very disappointed in the one time we tried to use the Concierge. Perhaps on the weekend they have less experienced personnel. That is the first time at a Marriott I have felt that way though. As I said, i would definitely stay here again. The hotel was nice & above average and the location great.

I expressed my complete dissatisfaction to the management during my stay and upon leaving. I thought i'd give them another try. What a mistake.

Calls to management were met with apologies but no solutions. They have two types of coffee in the room--the typical Marriott brand and Starbucks. If you use the Starbucks, you get charged $4.50 per pack. To their credit, there is a note attesting to this charge, but I never read those notes as i never buy the extras. This is the first Marriott property where there is a charge for ANY of the coffee items on display at the coffee maker.

We stayed two nights and used our Marriott Rewards points for both. We had been looking forward to our stay, as we booked six months in advance. When we arrived at 4pm, we were greeted with pop music playing in the lobby! Quite out of place in such an elegant hotel. We thought classical music or piano would have been a better and more logical choice. We checked in and were given a room on the 15th floor. Never having been to this hotel, we asked about the location of the room and if we were going to be put on the Club floor (which is where Marriott puts Silver Rewards members) and we were told rather abruptly that the hotel was sold out and that was the only room available!! So, here we go to the 15th floor..... the room was nice, not overly big, but the bathroom was good size and everything was nice and clean. No complaints there, as the housekeeping staff really did a great job with the cleaning. There was, however, a room service tray outside our door from the previous guests night before meal!!! We called to have someone come and remove it. Then we looked out of the window and saw the L Train fly by, and then another, and then another..... oh, boy. Directly below us! We went out to dinner and to a concert, deciding that if there were no other rooms available, we'd make the most of it. We came back at about 9:30pm and after a brief discussion, decided to call and speak to the manager. We explained our situation and told him we thought Marriott could at least give us breakfast since they didn't give us a particularly good room. He said they couldn't give us breakfast, but offered us \"milk and cookies\". What? Then he said, oh, I can move you, we do have better rooms...... What?!! That's not what we were told when we checked in. My husband was in the shower by this time and we were pretty much settled in the room for our 2 nights stay. He offered cheese and crackers.....we declined, he offered us $10 off a massge. We declined. He then called back and gave us a $20 credit for the hotel restaurant. What a carry on! We asked him to please removed the tray that was still sitting outside our door!! The following night we got turndown service with one chocolate and the next morning a bill under the door that had a charge for a Starbuck's coffee packet, ($4) that we didn't even use! If the maid had looked, we used the free packet and the other was still there! Well, that prompted us to speak to the day manager before we had breakfast. She was wonderful and went the extra mile and refunded our points! She said we should not have been given that room and gave us her business card and said to call her prior to our next stay. We blame the person at check in for being so awkward. In the future we will ask to see a manager at check in to avoid the carry on we had. It effected our stay in Chicago to a degree, but everything else about the city was great! I hope when we come back to this hotel, they have appropriate music playing in the lobby. it sounded as if they had teenagers at the contols! After all, when you think about it, doesn't the type of music you're hearing, set the mood?

Recently, we saw the Hubbard Street Dance Co. near home in Florida, and vowed to see them in their home venue at the Harris Theater in Millenium Park. And while looking for other Chicago activities for our weekend we discovered that the Goodman Theater had a David Mamet Festival, and the Renaissance offered rooms at $139 per night for Goodman patrons. Despite a 750 person Italian/Indian wedding at the hotel and an orthopedist's convention in town, the Renaissance had a room for us at that rate.(without any verification that we had theater tickets-when booking or while there)The Renaissance is around the block from the theater, 5 minute walk from Millenium Park--2 minutes to Michigan Avenue shopping and a restaurant(Bandera) recommended by the concierge which was a wonderful choice for two of our meals. The hotel staff was friendly, genuinely helpful (no problem with early check in)and knowledgeable, the room cozy, without being small, the housekeeping staff friendly and accomodating. We had a view of the river and the lake from the 17th floor room which had a comfortable king bed and well appointed first class bath.This is not a 5 star hotel--if you want the ultimate in \"luxe\" go elsewhere-but if you want a comfortable, well located hotel with virtually all the amenities you could want, don't overlook the Renaissance.(NB. the fitness area and pool is undergoing a renovation which began March 27--call to see when they'll be done.)If I were paying the published $339 a night rate, perhaps I wouldn't consider the hotel such a great choice-but then again, I didn't do an extensive search for alternatives, once I secured my reservation at $139.

The Renaissance is a very luxurious experience. The room was extremely spacious - we had a corner deluxe with 2 queen size beds - as was the bathroom. The beds were the most comfortable we have ever slept in. Even our teenagers raved about them - they wouldn't normally notice something like that. The pillows, sheets, linen were all absolutely top quality - you could really feel the difference. We also had a superb view over Chicago and the Chicago River below us - one of the best views we have ever had. Our room number was 1524. The hotel was busy - there was a wedding on - but the accommodation floors were quiet - we got a great nights sleep. Breakfast was superb - an amazing buffet - with most unusual and delicious sounding a la carte offerings too. Service was impeccable without being in the least obsequious. Location is great: right on the river. A few blocks walk to the Miracle Mile and around the corner from the main Marshall Field store. A really nice area in the heart of the theatre district.

There is a coffeemaker with plenty of Starbucks, as well as a well-stocked mini-bar, in every room.

We had many requests during a recent stay - we needed several ice buckets, more robes, and a toothbrush - and we were taken care of promptly and with great care. Some people have commented about the breakfast buffet being expensive, but $16pp in the city is actually very reasonable, plus it's a very good buffett. We've had very good room service breakfast here as well. The lobby bar is wonderful, with live jazz most nights and excellent drinks and service. It may not be right on the Mag Mile, but it's a very short walk to get to all kinds of great shopping. As has been mentioned, the huge Marshall Fields State Street store is about a block away, and it has just about anything you could ask for. Taxis are plentiful from the Ren, and you can quickly get to just about anywhere in the city. As for rates, they vary tremendously.

We stayed there for 2 nights, a Saturday and Sunday. The only good thing I can really say about this hotel is the location. It was only about a 10 minute walk from Michigan Ave. and had every type of restaurant/store nearby that you could want. When we first walked in the decor was great and the lobby looked extremely nice. The staff when we checked in was not too friendly or overly nice but everyone is entitled to having a bad day. We then were told that we had a smoking room, which we were unaware of. When we stepped off of the elevator the entire floor wreaked of smoke. I have stayed in other hotels on the smoking floor and have never had this problem. When we walked into the room we noticed the decor was very cute and colorful but the size was extremely small. Not only was the room extremely small but there was a spider on the wall which had been killed and smeared across the ceiling..quite disgusting. The TV looked to be about a 19\" from the late 1990's and was somewhat hard to see from the bed because it was so small. The bathroom was fine and was the most modern thing in the room, although the sink did back up when I brushed my teeth but eventually went down after a few minutes. The room was equipped with a keurig, however we were given only decaf coffee. I'm sure we could have called down and asked for regular but did not feel like going through all that and went to starbucks instead. The worst part of my stay was the fact that the walls of this hotel are EXTREMELY thin. For approximately 30 mins we could here people in a room down the hall have sexual relations. It was absolutely disgusting and for this reason and all of the others, I will NEVER stay in this hotel again.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte,NC", "Title": "\u201cdissapointed.\u201d", "Author": "codyadalyn", "ReviewID": "UR126088959", "Content": "I'm currently sitting in my room in this hotel, with my view of the fire escape and my 1992 era television. Upon arrival around midnight last night, I was told there was only a public parking deck next door but if I wanted street parking, I could come down and start feeding a meter at 8am. It would seem I was lucky there was a $39/day deck next door. I then attempted to enter my room with what would appear to be 2 bad keys. After returning to the front desk (I was treated very nicely by the night manager) she came up with me and it turns out the key has to sit in the slot for 10 seconds before you can get in. Wow. The room is ok. The laminate hardwood floors would be a decent touch, if they werent uneven and chipped in parts. I can also hear everything my neighbors are doing. When I called to order some coffee and breakfast, the chick in the restaurant said she would call me back and when I picked up the phone when she did, she just said \"yeah?\" as if I had interrupted her mid-conversation. When I asked how long I could wait for breakfast she complained about how she was the only one there, and there were other people waiting, and it would be 20 minutes for my yogurt, fruit, and coffee. I'm not impressed with the service, the room, or anything else I've seen. I've stayed at an Indigo in Asheville and LOVED it so I was excited to try this one in Chicago.

I have stayed at Hotel Indigo in Vernon Hills before and remember how nice and inviting it was. I called the night before since check in wasnt until 4, but I had luggage with me and had afternoon plans before and wanted to make sure i could drop my stuff off early and the guy on the phone said yes. So it was nice I was able to drop my things off and not worry about it. The girl at the desk wasn't necessarily rude but she wasn't friendly. When I did come back to check in, i asked if I could have a later check out and the rep said I could, but I had to sign up for the rewards program. Which I did since it was free, but I found that a little annoying, just a simple request for a late check required me to be a rewards member. When I arrived to my room, it was smaller than I expected but it wasn't cramped. It was very inviting, bright and clean. About 10 minutes after I was in, the front desk called to make sure everything was okay. A few things i noticed, once of the bed side lamps didn't work...not a big deal, I used the other one. The lamp on the side table wasn't even plugged in which was weird. The maginfying makeup mirror didn't light up as well, but it was nice they had that to do eyemakeup. I loved that the bathroom had a nice shelf all along the mirror to make up for no vanity. The shower was nice however, the pressure could have better and the shampoo and conditioner weren't the best either. I used the hair dryer in the room...but it was blowing out cold air! I called the front desk and within 5 minutes someone brought me a new one that worked much better! The bed was extremely comfortable...I slept like a baby. I just wish the curtains were better at covering the window, I had too much sun coming in this morning that woke me up early than I wanted. Also, the tv is set up kinda high, so you have to raise the remote up at an awkward level to change the channels. I did take a look at the menu in the room for the restaurant downstairs and the prices seemed reasonable. However I did not order food, so I can't write about the quality. In the morning, it seems like the doors slam behind guests so that was also annoying as I'm trying to sleep in the morning with the doors being shut. Overall, I would come back and recommend it to others. It is a great location...only a block away from the red line (clark and division), less than a $10 cab ride to union station.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Solihull, UK", "Title": "\u201cMixed blessing\u201d", "Author": "StevieBatesy", "ReviewID": "UR124011057", "Content": "I stayed in Hotel Indigo for four nights while attending a conference at the Newberry Library, for which it is conveniently placed - a five-minute stroll down Dearborn.

However, I could not get served at the restaurant (there never appeared to be any staff serving, or guests eating) and struggled to get room service. The heater was also very noisy and I ended up turning it off to sleep. The most significant incident, however, occurred on my final morning when I was woken by someone posting a bill under the door. I had made a 5-minute phonecall home to the UK having checked the cost in the literature in the room: this only said that overseas calls would be charged at an international rate. I figured a premium call would be about $1 a minute, but the bill was $26. It made me feel a bit of a fool, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a ridiculously expensive rate.

Despite others' experience with third-party booking, I was actually treated very well. Due to travel delays, I arrived in Chicago near midnight (several hours later than scheduled). I was concerned about the room status since this was a Hotwire booking. But the front desk clerk, Lissa, could not have been more helpful. I phoned ahead and she said, \"Yes, I see your Hotwire booking\" -- [so she knew this was 3rd party] -- and I have noted your delayed arrival for a reservation of one night.\" I replied it was actually two nights -- we had added on a second night after the initial reservation. Lissa quickly found this information, and remembered it when I finally arrived very late that night at the hotel. Her greeting was friendly and professional -- as soon as I identified myself, she let me know she was the person to whom I had spoken on the phone, and she expressed empathy for the long day of travel delays. (A small thing, perhaps, but it really makes a difference to a tired traveler.) She also told me just to come down to the desk in the morning and they would work out having the \"second\" reservation applied to my room without necessitating a move. When I came down the next morning, the only downside was a non-uniformed woman working at the front desk computer. I explained about the reservation consolidation and she *rolled her eyes*(!), made some sort of snorting noise and said \"I don't think so,\" and went back to what she was doing. It was appallingly rude. Luckily a woman standing next to her (who was in the \"uniform\" of other clerks) quickly said, \"Yes, Miss ____, I took care of the reservation this morning and you are all set!\" I said the other woman had been very rude; the competent clerk apologized and asked if she could take care of breakfast. I had already eaten, but I appreciated the offer to make things right. Note to management, though: the older woman who works the computer and is not dressed like the clerks should not have contact with guests. Kudos on the excellent night clerk and morning clerk. I typically book directly through the hotel, although in this instance I used Hotwire on a whim -- and I am pleased to say that I have been treated cordially no matter the booking source (as should be the case in a competently managed hotel.) P.S. -- The only oddity: since the elevator is near the front door, I realized many guests do not realize there is a small restaurant in the back of the lobby.

Ate across the street at Mario's-great Italian food with half portions available for good cost, then walked down to Michigan Avenue, which was an easy walk with wide sidewalks and well lit. Parking gargage with valet parking was conveniently located beside the hotel and got the car shortly after calling for it. The bad: If you book your room through a third party, they place a $50 hold on your credit card for incidentals, then refund any balance; they will not participate in valet parking, such as calling them for you, as it is a separate business; they will not take responsibility for any offers/services listed for their hotel on the third-party (Expedia, in our case) web site and will not provide any kind of a receipt other than for whatever incidentals you purchase while there. The ugly: Both check-in and check-out hotel staff seemed very resentful that we had booked third-party, rather than directly with them. There were 3 of us in the room, as we noted when we made the reservation. We had opted to upgrade from the room for $139 to the $180 offer, which stated it included a full breakfast. My husband was the first down to breakfast and found there was no such offer of a full breakfast -what was available for the extra money ($41) was a roll, coffee and juice. My husband tried to cancel the breakfast and get a refund, but the staff refused, saying they had to pay Expedia for it and it could not be refunded. When my daughter and I came down, we found they had collected the breakfast coupon from my husband and that the breakfast was only good for 2 guests, not 3 and we needed to negotiate for the coupon that was required to redeem the roll, juice and coffee breakfast that only 1 more of us was allowed to redeem. Some expensive breakfast, huh?? Our dismay was increased as the night before we had ordered a dessert that came with ice cream, but were told they had run out of ice cream and no adjustment was offered in the price. Seems we were offensive to them by booking third party and not entitled to any refunds for any reason -staff said they sell blocks of rooms to the third party bookers and were not responsible for anything they listed, such as the \"full breakfast,\" and claimed the bookers merely lifted things off the hotel web site. Apparently, that was where Expedia got the full breakfast idea -we suggested they contact their third party bookers and give them the correct info to avoid other guests being as deeply disappointed as we were, but got only a weak half-smile in response.

Our room was small but quaint and nicely decorated. It was definitely big enough for a romantic couple. The bed was very comfortable. The room had Aveda products in the bathroom and a Keurig coffe maker. The whole place was a breath of fresh air, but not where you should go if you are looking for glamour. It felt kind of Bed and Breakfast with a touch of class. The hotel is located on Dearborn Parkway, which is lined with trees, quiet, and residential despite being just a few blocks away from the Rush and Division bar scene. The only negative thing that happened was some noise from drunk people trying to get to their rooms while we were trying to sleep.

The hotel itself is a re-purposed older building. DO NOT expect a typical roomy ichoice hotel.

On first glance, my room seemed more on par with the lobby- hardwood floors, white \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coastal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd furniture, and crisp bedding, but upon further inspection, it was very small and oddly-shaped with a very low ceiling. There were few lights in the entire room, and the bathroom (no tub) was so tiny, you had to straddle the toilet in order to close the door! (Also, there was no bathroom exhaust fan, so the entire room felt humid after a shower.) Did I mention the blueberry wallpaper? We're not talking a quaint petite print. We're talking strange GIANT 3-FOOT BLUEBERRIES across the entire bedroom wall. I felt like I was sleeping in the produce section of my local grocery! (Was this a miserable attempt to give the room a more spacious feel?) I'm usually not one to complain, so long as the room is clean and maintained, but the entire environment was just plain ODD. Couple this with the startling noises coming from the hallway (and the street) at all hours of the night; my entire stay was less than relaxing- an absolute disappointment for $200 per night. It seems as if they intended to transform this downtown building into a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153retreat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but ran out of money when it came to the common areas above the ground floor, and decided that since real estate and hotels are at a premium in downtown Chicago why not add a few extra rooms on each floor? Bottom line: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re above average height or breadth, you will definitely feel uncomfortable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m neither, and still felt cramped- sort of like how it feels to fly coach on an overbooked flight. You get the picture. The front desk staff WAS polite. All 10 words he spoke to me were cordial\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. The location IS perfect for anyone planning to shop the Gold Coast. Although I doubt you could fit more than two girlfriends and a few shopping bags into a single room. Also, please take note that the parking garage is located in the next building, and is an ADDITIONAL $30 (typical of downtown Chicago). If you dare park your car, you will be required to wait just inches from the sidewalk (and the elements) at the entrance to the narrow, tiny, dirty garage.

Booked this through a travel site and was excited that it was the Indigo, as co-workers (in Denver) have stayed here before and raved about it. Even my stupidity could be overcome -- I pride myself on being a \"good guest,\" not showing up hours before check-in and being knowledgeable about the hotel area. So silly me, even after seeing us outfly horrible storms into Chicago, decided to kill time in downtown (shopping, parade etc) and then head up to Gold Coast (grocery shopping for in-room drinks-snacks, fruit etc). By the time I finished, it was pouring rain outside but hey savvy-traveler me knew the hotel was only 2.5 blocks away -- which woulda been great had I not looked at Clark St in reverse and instead headed south (thinking I was going north) and then west (thinking i was going eat). Made for a 10+ block walk (wrong way and back to hotel) in pouring rain with luggage, backpack and groceries. When pathetic me, looking like a transient person (all wet and disheveled), entered the hotel, Tom Hilton at the front desk greeted me (I'm sure I was quite the spectacle). I was till a few minutes before official checkin time and the room type I was entitled wouldnt be ready right away but I was first on the list, Tom assured. I was fine with that, knowing I had a great rate and that i was early (I'm a reasonable traveler, nonsmoking room as I have allergies is my main requirement). The next thing i knew, Mr. Hilton was giving me my room key, I asked when I should head up there (thinking Id need to wait in the lobby a little) and he said go right up. I was amazed that he was so accommodating. It was greatly appreciated as some dry clothes were definitely needed after all that traveling and the rainstorm/mess. In general the room was great...yes they're a bit smallish but in line with Chicago and dont forget this building was built years ago as apartments/hotel so rooms cant be adjusted. In fact the recent renovations maximize the space for guests in my opinion ; it reminded me a bit of the Intercontinental in that regard. It was plenty big for me, extremely comfy bed, great art-deco decor and design, very well thought out in terms of amenities, guest needs (for example: the tray for goodies like snacks was great touch for breakfast or a meal in bed). Loved the hardwood floors too. The free in-room wifi was great in planning my Chicago out-and-abouts -- the free computer internet and printer in the basement was quite helpful for printing important stuff (boarding pass, directions, bus schedules, restaurant coupons etc) and was a nice touch. The staff was just very upbeat, warm and welcoming all the way around. Tom was awesome -- he even called after my checkin to see if everything was alright. The other front-desk folks was wonderful/friendly -- Lissa in particular. Also, housekeeping staff was awesome -- I actually didnt get housekeeping on all days, but the one on my floor was so nice; when she saw me coming from a distance, she even pressed the elevator button so there'd not be a wait (and the elevators are fast regardless).

The beds are amazingly comfortable, the decor is bright and fresh, the rooms are fairly spacious (although a small bathroom). The service was ok. They were not rude at all, but no overly nice either.

I stayed at your lovely hotel on September 4th 2010. The reason I am writing is that while on an arduous 6 day trip between the US and Europe Tom Hilton helped me more than I thought possible. I had destroyed 2 of my uniform ( white ) shirts with a shaving accident that would not stop, and a leaking ink pin. I called downstairs upon check in early afternoon Saturday the 4th. I loaded up the shirts and asked could they be laundered. Tom said he was not sure but would do his best to get them done before our check out the next day at 1830. He admitted that it might be expensive to accomplish the cleaning. So I brought them down ASAP and left them with him. The next day I came to collect the shirts at front desk and the clerks told me that try as he might Tom could not get any laundry to clean and press the shirts. The clerk walked away to the back office at the Indigo and came out with both my shirts hanging, clean and pressed.........Tom was off duty but he and his wife had taken my shirts home and personally worked them over the night. He then came in on his own time and left them for me to pick up. No charge !!!! Blood stains out of the white and 99% of the ink out too ! I cannot thank Tom enough for saving my professional appearance and his actions remind me of why I became a airline pilot...because we care to provide service over and above expectation or immediate income !

We chose the Hotel Indigo because of the awesome location. Chicago is a very walkable city and we took full advantage. Walking north to northwest takes you to OldTown with many great restaurants and bars. This area of town has a local feel to it. This walk is short and safe. Walking south takes you to Rush Street with many nightclubs and bars and some restaurants. A short walk east takes you to Michigan Avenue with its large scale shopping and very touristy restaurants. We even walked south to Grant park and the Art Institute. This is a little longer but still pleasant and doable for most people. The hotel itself had small pleasant rooms.

The bed was comfortable. The room overall was clean. Some reviewers have complained about the blue decorating scheme. I agree that there was a plethora of blue. Blue is a warm and inviting color that has a calming effect on the viewer. It suggests excitement and possibilities without being startling or disturbing. I found the many shades of blue well thought-out and enjoyed the decorating scheme. If you don't like the color blue, don't stay here. We did not try the hotel coffee shop or restaurant. The lack of doorman or bell service or concierge was not an issue with us.

It seemed like a cute, fun place for a girls' weekend. We were in town to catch some Blackhawks games and do some sightseeing. I arrived early and asked to check my suitcase, but they let me check in. I thought it was a little strange since the reservation was in my friend's name, but at the time, it made life easier on me, so I didn't care very much. Nor did I think anything of it when they asked for a card for incidentals. I asked what that meant, and I was told it was for things like room service. This came back to bite me. No one was there to grab the door or offer to take my bags, which was a little surprising at a hotel with this sort of rating. Everywhere else I've stayed in Chicago (Intercontinental, Hilton Chicago, Hotel 71) had at least one great doorman. I later found they hold $50 for each night of your stay, which can be a big problem if you're on a budget and/or using a debit card, like myself. When I checked my account and saw this $100 hold I wasn't expecting, I called to the desk to inquire what was going on. The girl on the other end was extremely rude and told me how there was a GIANT sign at the desk I should've read and that it's not their problem I didn't, and how I should be happy they did me a favor and only charged $50 for two of the three nights. Folks, I read everything I see. I even read the fine-print on the check-in paperwork to decline the 75-cent/day fee for the newspaper we wouldn't read. I saw no sign. When I next went down, I made a point to find the \"giant\" sign - a 4x6 piece of paper in a frame hiding behind a massive bowl of hard candy on the opposite side of the round desk where I checked in. I don't call that \"giant.\" As my friend said, it's horrible customer service not to tell someone you're going to hold that much money. That particular staff member really left a bad taste in our mouths. At check-out, the people were much friendlier, offering to get us a cab (which we didn't need, but thanks), handed out coupons for Macy's and the 900 Shops, and got the door as we left. Thing is, coupons would've been better at the start of the stay when we had time left to go shopping and no one helped with any bags or doors when we arrived and were exhausted. Nice now, but it would've been nicer to have the service for the whole stay. One highlight was a staff member bringing up delivery menus for us late at night when we were hungry. The rooms aren't exactly small, their problem is way too much furniture. Two beds, a table with two chairs, an armchair and ottoman, bench, tv/coffeemaker table, nightstand, lamp table, side table, and a breakfast tray thing... and no space or dresser with drawers. Three girls need a place to put their stuff, and there just wasn't any room. We couldn't unpack anything, and we had to stack our suitcases in the closet then drag them out every morning. The bathroom is pretty tiny, and the shower curtain was too short, so the floor got wet each time we showered. There were some housekeeping issues that we couldn't stop laughing about, mainly the insanely dusty wall and the duvet with the cigarette burn on it that the maid didn't even bother to try and hide by folding it differently... after we left the card out asking for all the linens to be changed. I don't know if they're going for the \"shabby chic\" look or what, but the wood furnishings are looking pretty worm and busted. One bright spot is definitely the location. The hotel is on a residential street around the corner from a Red line stop. There is a 24-hour Walgreens at the corner, a Starbucks across the street, a couple of restaurants (try the barbecue chicken pizza at Eduardo's), and a cool \"dive\" bar called Mother's across from the Walgreens (where were saw a laughably horrible Led Zeppelin tribute). As internet-addicts, my friends and I were happy to see they offer free wireless internet. We were able to handle all of our online business from the comfort of our laptops and not in some uncomfortable \"business center\" room. That said, we did need to use their center, which is nothing more than two computers at a table with a printer, to print out some last-minute tickets. Printer was handy, but we had to mess with the computers to get one to go online, and then again to get it set up to the correct printer. I'm not sure if those issues were due to the staff not setting things up right, or if another customer had messed them up. Thankfully, we were computer-savvy. Overall, it's not a terrible hotel, but it's not a place I'd seek out again. One horrible staff member is all it takes to turn my friends and I off of a place, and the less-than-helpful desk lady certainly did it. For the price we paid, even with Hotwire, we can find somewhere else for next time.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIt's All True...

We were only in town for two days of sightseeing and to see a hockey game. I was very impressed with the accommodations and would highly recommend the hotel. I purchased a package deal on Expedia which included roundtrip airfare from New York, two nights, fees, and taxes for $625.00 total. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing I paid about $80.00 a night. Hotels in Chicago can be very pricey. However, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to stay just north of downtown, this is a good choice for you. The hotel is located just a three-minute walk from the Division/Clark red line train stop and a short walk to Michigan Avenue. The neighborhood seemed very safe with lots of restaurants and a Walgreens right down the street. To save money you can take the blue line train from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare Airport to Division and take the 70 Bus to Division and Clark, all for about $2.00. If the weather is cold or rainy, take blue line to Jackson, transfer to the red line, and take the train heading towards Howard. Get off at Clark/Division. We bought a three-day CTA pass for $14.00 and went everywhere on the buses and trains, including both airport trips. The room was spacious and very clean. The television had a large selection of channels and two phones. The bed was very comfortable with nice pillows. The sheets were of a high quality. There was plenty of closet space and a large table to dine at. A negative to report about the room is that the toilet and shower were on the small side. The sink was outside the toilet/shower area so that was a plus. The water pressure in the shower was very strong and the water was nice and hot. There were plenty of towels and a hair dryer was provided. The complimentary soaps and shampoos were of a high quality. Maid service was very good. I enjoyed the blue color theme of the room. They had a decent alarm clock radio, not the cheap ones you might buy at 99-cent store. The room was not in a noisy area so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to sleep well. The staff of the hotel was very friendly and helpful. Even if we had zero interaction with a particular employee, they still said hello and good-bye. I was very pleased to see that they provided two free internet stations 24 hours a day. We had some of their breakfast and it was pretty good. The dining area had very nice furniture to lounge on. They even microwaved some food we had from the night before. Overall, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to save money and want a good quality hotel stay, this is the hotel for you. You can pay 3-4 times as much staying at a Hilton or Sheraton in The Loop area, but a 5-minute train ride to the north side of Chicago will get you the same quality room for much less. Leave your car at home because parking can be very expensive and you can take the subways and buses anywhere. I would definitely stay here again. Marc T.

We stayed at the Hotel Indigo May 12 and 13, 2009. We booked the hotel upon recommendation from a coworker of mine, and we were not disappointed. As a matter of fact, we adored the hotel and its staff! The hotel was bright, cheery and clean. The staff bent over backwards to be accommodating and friendly. We had to cancel our first reservation, but the person on the phone was happy to help us both times. We arrived early, prepared to check luggage and tour before checking in, but a room was immediately available, even fulfilling a request for a nice view. Two of the front desk receptionists learned our first names and called out greetings every time we entered the lobby. My mother had just recovered from skin cancer surgery, and these same women treated us as preferred guests, making sure we had everything we could possibly need, including a small refrigerator delivered to the room, a birthday balloon and cupcakes, a card wishing her well and happy birthday, and full directions to any sites about which we inquired. One night upon late return from eating way too much delicious food at Greek Islands restaurant on Halsted Street in Greektown, we wished for a soda. The machine was inoperative, and the night clerk noticed I was returning to the elevator with dollar bill in hand, but nothing else. She asked if there was something she could do, then dashed off to get complimentary glasses of iced soda from the lobby deli which was closed for the evening. We lacked for nothing! Several points of interest about the hotel include a CVS pharmacy with a pre-packaged fresh food and grocery section only half a block away, plenty of fast food and coffee shops within a block\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s walk, a subway stop only one block away, a nice little internet nook with a working printer which was useful for hardcopies of last minute tour reservations, and a safe clean neighborhood location. Even though the hotel is close to the waterfront, and not the airport, we easily caught the subway directly from O'Hare to within a block of the hotel, with only one changeover at a centralized station. We did have to carry suitcases up stairs at the stop nearest the hotel, but that was not a problem for us. Perhaps another stop would have an elevator and then a short cab ride would get you to the hotel? CTA would be able to help with that question. The ride from the airport to the hotel was approximately 40 minutes, but we enjoyed seeing different parts of the city for the aboveground portions as we traveled. We purchased a three day subway pass with unlimited rides at the airport kiosk for fourteen dollars, so our transportation to and from the hotel was included in that price. What a bargain! (The pass is good for the subway and city buses. All were clean and efficient and easy to access.)

I stayed in this hotel in December while I was attending the RSNA conference.

I was placed in Hotel Indigo but the organisers and was a little concerned after reading the previous reviews. I e-mailed the hotel before I arrived to request a fridge (thanks to tips from previous reviewers) and was pleasantly surprised by the quick and friendly response from the manager, Se\u00c3\u00a1n. On arrival I was met by a friendly doorman who carried my bags inside. Check-in was effortless (and sweet thanks to the candy bowl) and I was given a room on the 12th floor. Reception was small but welcoming-a very laid-back, beachy feeling in snowy Chicago! My room was small, but I was on my own so that wasn't a huge issue. No fridge so I rang down and had one in my room in under 5 minutes. Everything in the room was completely spotless. Big TV with cable channels, free WiFi and a coffee maker. Alarm clock is a nice touch. The bathroom was small but immaculately clean and stocked with Aveda products. Bed was sooo comfy. Slept like a log each night. Breakfast wasn't included in my room rate and I just had my own anyway but there were very affordable options in the little restaurant downstairs. I did avail of their Starbucks coffee and loved the staff there. I only got coffee maybe 4 times but the staff were so friendly and remembered me. It was lovely! The onsite gym is open all day and accessible by keycard. It's small with 2 treadmills, bike, elliptical, stepper, weight machines and free weights. The equipment is in good order however and they have pretty much everything you could want-including kettlebells, Bosus and extensive free weights. Loved it! Potential temptation lay in the snack machines just outside the door ;-) Didn't use the hairdressers or spa but it looked clean and friendly. There was also a business centre downstairs with 2 computers and printing facilities. Very handy for online flight check-in! I was allowed to get a package delivered to the hotel which was extremely handy. I was also completely overwhelmed by the helpful attitude of one of the reception staff. I have unfortunately forgotten her name, but believe she was from the Czech republic. She went above and beyond the call of duty to help my fax details when I was trying to order a digital camera and helped me with problems with the order. When I was leaving she gave me a photo album to use with the new camera. Apparently the hotel has a little fund for such little gifts. I have never ever been treated so well or had such a good experience and I have stayed in many hotels and guesthouses. I was upset leaving because everyone was so sweet from the doormen to reception to the guy on the early coffee shift... Location is great, only a few minutes from Michigan Avenue and within a few blocks of Whole Foods and a Dominick's.

Indigo has a contract with one of the airlines to house their overseas flight crews. The airline crews get to check out of the hotel after 5 pm, which means that the hotel has a shortage of rooms for people checking in. The email that I received from the hotel a couple of days before our stay had a cheery message, \"Your room is ready!\" The email stated that check-in time was 3 pm. We arrived at 3:40 and were told that check-in was at 4 pm and that our room was not ready. We walked over to the Starbuck's and hung out for an hour and our room still wasn't ready. We finally checked in after 5 pm. And this is not the first time this happened. There has been a check-in delay each time in the last three years that we stayed at the Indigo. I wrote a (very polite) email to the manager to point out that this was a problem, and he never responded to my email. The location is great, but once you've stayed at the Hotel Indigo, the decor isn't enough to overcome the downsides: very small rooms, lackluster management, long waits to check in.

I had to change my flight to an early flight and got to the hotel at around 11:30am. I absolutely knew check-in was many hours later and had no problem waiting if they did not have a room. There was one middle aged guy at the front desk who helped me check-in. He stared at the computer for a good 10 minutes before he told me they had no rooms available. I asked if he could let me know when they did and he just nodded. He was in no way friendly, personable or even acted like he cared about his job. He felt the need to remind me at least half a dozen times check in was not until 4, ok, I get it. Nearly 30 minutes later another couple checked in and there room was not ready. He said if they wanted to upgrade they could for xxx a night and get a King Room. I was pretty livid as that is exactly what my room was. Nearly 2 hours later I asked if there was a room yet and he said, \"yeah, it's been ready for almost an hour and a half\" Room: They do a good job of making them appear bigger online however they are in no way unlivable or uncomfortable. They placement of furniture (and amount of it) is a little odd. Note: the chair in the middle of the floor? Bed is a king and very comfortable although the little pillows are rather crappy. The decor is great and bright and I loved it. I have read some complaints on the bathroom and had no problems there. Amenities: The cable is pretty bad, no channels at all. There are either news or Chicago tourism channels. The internet is free but the connection is so-so most of the time. Better than paying though so they get a huge plus for that. Also Aveda products in the bathroom, my favorite! I drank the $2.50 water in your room left to tease you but ah well. The coke machine does has .50 cokes though!

Right on the corner is a Walgreens and another block away you have Costco and Jewel. There is a Subway, Jimmy Johns, Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts also right within 2 blocks. Overall, it was a good stay. I was on business so I worked nearly all day and everyday so didn't have much time to do anything else.

The breakfast restaurant and the bar are very nice. The decor is also interesting and pleasing. My room was tiny. I normally don't unpack my suitcase when travelling but just leave it open on the stand. I couldn't do this here as that took up 80% of the open floor space. It would be impossible for me to have my suitcase out and also pull out the ironing board. There was a large tray with glasses on the bed when I checked in. It looked nice, but it was too big to put on the small desk. The only place to put it was under the bed with my suitcase. I asked after I checked in if a larger room was available but was told that the hotel was sold-out and the only option was to upgrade to a suite for $600+ a night. I thought that I could maybe adjust as I wouldn't be in my room that much. The curtain was broken and could not be raised. Despite every effort, the beautiful shower completely flooded the bathroom every time. A flawed design I guess. For the first 3 nights only one elevator was working. Therefore when coming or going to the room I was almost always in a crowded elevator that stopped at every floor. Housekeeping also left something to be desired. I worked in the hotel industry for many years and always tip the maid heavily as they are generally the hardest working and lowest paid employees of the hotel. Despite this, I was NEVER replenished with soap or shampoo during my 6 night stay. When on day 3, after leaving the maid $5 each day, she just put the empty shampoo bottle back on the shelf, no more tips from me. I called housekeeping asking for more shampoo and got a voicemail. Luckily I had some shampoo of my own. Three days later and no one responeded to my voicemail, no more shampoo for me. Lastly, on the final night I stayed in and watched a movie. During the movie I saw a HUGE bug crawling up the wall which I promptly killed. After day 2 I started to call around to change hotels. Unfortunately it was a big convention weekend and everyone was either full or charging their highest rates, I toughed it out. But at the time of booking there was many other hotels for close to the same rate that were certainly not dumps like this. I have always trusted tripadvisor to help me find hotels in a new city.

Even though we arrived hours ahead of check-in time, the desk clerk was happy to give us a room - which was an oasis after where we'd been staying in Iowa! We had only been in the room about 15 minutes when the desk called to make sure everything was satisfactory. Although the room was small, it was find for my 13-yr-old daughter and me. She lounged on one of the incredibly comfortable beds watching the large TV while I sat in the small sitting area with my laptop. We weren't tripping over each other and didn't miss the lack of room service. There are plenty of restaurants close by that deliver, so we had lunch set up.

Again, no safety issues, just a nice stroll in the city. I think the best part about the Indigo is the attention they pay to the \"little things.\" 1. The drinks in the Coke machine were only 50 cents. Most hotels stick you for a dollar or more. That's not a big deal, but it's nice not to be gouged. 2. Everything was squeaky clean and looked brand new. The hair dryer was a real dryer - not one of the half-working models stuck on the wall. 3. Everyone was smiling and anxious to be helpful.

We stayed in room 1108. This was the 11th floor out of 14 and faced downtown Chicago to the south (very nice view). The biggest positive to us was the location. To get to the red line of the \"L\" you need to go one block south and one block west - about 5 minutes. The L train is an excellent way to get around the city. It's two stops away from the Mag mile. We were in town for a Reds vs. Cubs baseball game and the red line takes you right to the stadium. The other positive of the location is being in the Gold Coast neighborhood which is the most exclusive neighborhood in Chicago. The blocks north and to the east (towards the lake) make a nice little walk to check out some really neat, old houses (millions of dollars if you have the means). I've stayed in Chicago a number of times. While the larger chain hotels by the loop are closer to the shopping and tourist stuff, this was the first time I felt immersed as part of the city as opposed to a visitor. The room and hotel have a nautical feel. It was our first stay at the Indigo brand. I've stayed a ton of Holiday Inn's and US hotels. This did feel like the nice version of a Holiday Inn express. Everthing was nice, but it didn't have the quality feel of a Marriott or Hilton. Again, it was nice but the colors and theme just weren't our thing. Not a problem as we were there just to sleep. The drawbacks 1. The friendliness level of the front desk could use some improvement. Nobody asked how my stay was which I think is a minimum for the front desk. They were also complaining to each other about people trying to check in early. 2. The single window in our room did not shut completely and we could hear all of the noise from the street below. I didn't let this impact my rating becuase a) it was room specific and b) it's the city, there's going to be noise. 3. THE VALET PARKING NEXT DOOR WAS $35 A NIGHT.

However, since this was a reward nights trip, I was not going to ask for more. We arrived into Chicago very early and headed to the hotel on the CTA trains from Midway. I was delighted to find that they were willing to let us check in at 11:00 AM as the room was ready. The hotel was very easy to get to using the orange and red lines. The red line which will take you anywhere in the city you would want to go was about a block and a half away from the hotel. My husband and I used the red line late into the night and I never felt unsafe walking back to the hotel. The hotel is very close to lots of restaurants and bars on Rush Street as well as not too far from the Mag. Mile. THIS WAS A GREAT LOCATION! The only bad thing would be that there was only one elevator in service and a rule that only four people could be on at a time. THis was a tad incovenient and we did use the stairs but we were on the 8th floor so it was a little hike. Also, the staff was a touch unfriendly. However, I did all of my planning beforehand so we didn't really need them for much. If you want a staff that will bend over backward for you this is probably not the best choice. Edwardo's Pizza right next store is a great cozy restaurant as well and with Walgreens right down the street you can go and pick up anything you may have forgotton.

I spent a February weekend there with a friend in a double room that we booked on Hotwire. The original room they gave us had only one bed and so we were upgraded to a larger one with a small sitting area and windows looking out onto the cityscape - a fine view of old victorians and vintage high-rises. Had we not gotten the upgrade, however, the first room would have been impossibly small even with two beds. The bathroom in the new room- in particular the toilet 'area' - was still very small. The ceilings in the room hovered just above our heads and the door let in all assortment of sounds from the hallway. There was also a lot of flood damage from burst pipes (wall sections removed) and the smell of mold in a few of the common areas. My friend complainded about the lack of television options (only about ten channels) and our remote control was broken and had to be replaced. Only one person was at the desk downstairs, although she was at least friendly. The 'design' of the hotel is more of a make-over with too many bright colors and cheap furniture in the lobby (wooden 20$ deck chairs with bright paint and cushions). The hotel's saving graces are an excellent location on the Near North Side close to entertainment and shops and interesting views from the rooms. Once again I feel obligated to talk about the great fluctuations in prices of downtown Chicago hotels. This hotel was reasonably priced (under 100$/tax incl.) on Hotwire for the time we were there (with the upgrade), and the rack rate was too high, but nothing compared to the price when Chicago hosts one of its many large trade shows. The prices are more than doubled and sometime tripled at such times. Beware of this when planning a trip to the Windy City.

The location is not too far off Michigan Ave and you are close to Rush St. and State Street. We relied on taxis and never had a problem finding one. The walgreens right on the corner was a great benefit to stock-up on snacks and drinks for the kids and we preferred the cafe nextdoor to the on-site coffee shop for breakfast.", "Date": "October 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "mdin", "ReviewID": "UR5809449", "Content": "The hotel indigo is situated in a wonderful neighborhood north of downtown. The tree-lined streets and relaxing feel of the area add to the charm. The room was very clean, nicely decorated with hardwood floors and bright colors throughout. The beds were comfy, the air conditioning was very good, and the rooms were well lit. My only complaints would have to do with the size of the room...rather smalll for the 2 queen beds, and the storage space was lacking...barely enough room for two peoples things, but not for suitcases that had to be stacked in the room. One other difficulty was the lack of cabs in the area. One rainy day we waited 70 minutes for pickup. Other days we took a short walk to the Ambassador East to pick up a ride. The staff is great, the bar downstairs is fun and overall is was a great experience. Quite a contrast from our last trip to chicago when we stayed in the icky congress plaza. Great tip...Mario's Italian Restaurant across the street is EXCELLENT.

What a fantastic hotel! The location is great - it's close to the Red Line (5 minute walk) so it's very possible to take the El from either airport. If you're looking to explore the area around the hotel, walking in one direction from the hotel entrance puts you in the middle of the city - walk the other direction and you are in a great neighborhood (think: diverse architecture, people walking dogs, the whole bit...). The lobby was nice - a lot of people were having cocktails in the bar area. The rooms are pretty small, but well decorated and bright (makes it feel a bit larger). We didn't eat at the hotel (except coffee in the AM), but had a great breakfast at the 3rd Coast Cafe and Wine Bar, a 30 second walk from the hotel (try the stuffed french toast).

I felt like I was walking into a spa when I first walked in....it looks awesome, almost like a quaint Florida/Carribean hotel and smells great too. The rooms were pretty big and I loved the decorations and hardwood floors. I also used the fitness room when I was there and that was great as well. The hotel is close to Rush Street, where there are tons of bars and restaurants. It is also close to the Clark/Division red line stop so you're minutes away from everything. I also loved the fact that there's a Walgreens a couple steps from the hotel, so you could buy things you forgot to pack at a reasonable price. I loved the location because you're a little removed from Michigan Avenue and have a more neighborhood feel. My favorite part of visiting Chicago is checking out all the indendent and unique stores and restaurants, not necessarily the ones on Michigan Avenue, so I am a little biased : ) But I showed a couple of my \"Chicagoan\" friends my hotel room and they could not stop ooohing and aaahing over it.

Although we arrived early before check-in, the staff graciously stowed our bags and within minutes, our room was ready. We stayed on the 14th floor where it was quiet and serene. The room was decorated adorably with beautiful hardwood floors and retro style and colors (bright white painted wood with lavender, navy, and apple greens) all very clean and welcoming. In the mornings, the Starbucks within the hotel provided a nice selection of coffee, juice, bagels, and muffins. They even had a complete breakfast offered. The hotel is in a fabulous location within easy walking distance to shopping and sights of Chicago.

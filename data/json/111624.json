All staff members were extrememly helpfull and all but one was friendly (one of the valet parkers seemed to have an attitude). The building is very old, but Hampton did a good job creating a modern hotel out of the antique building. There are only two negatives that I can come up with: First, the parking is valet only and costs $15 a day so adds to the expense. Second, I had to literally run the water in the shower for 20 minutes to get hot water. Other people who stayed there told me their water was hot almost instantly, so maybe it was just my side of the hotel. There was actually a sign in the bathroom that stated to let the water run for several minutes for hot water.

The Good: The hotel is located in an area close to everything. If you like being in the middle of the action then consider booking here. The free breakfast is a bonus, although you may run into a full dining area and warm (as opposed to hot) food. The building itself is historic, I like that. I pre-requested a mini fridge and got one. The bathroom was a good size. Staff was pleasant. The Not so Good: My room had a view of a brick wall / alley. Not the fault of Hampton, they can't control the buildings that are built around them. I assume a lot of the views aren't great at this location. My room was sort of small, but not too bad. The wireless internet went in and out for awhile, they fixed the problem but it was a pain. Too bad they didn't knock $10 or so off the bill because of it (I mentioned the problem a couple of times). My room had some noise issues - minor though, just someone either in the room beside me or above me slamming a door. Also, if you don't need / want to be in the middle of all the action then consider something on the outskirts of downtown. I'd recommend this hotel if you first eliminated some of the other downtown hotels - usually they're priced much higher making the HI a good deal. This hotel had good bang for the buck when I booked it but if I was returning to downtown Indy I'd consider other options but I'd also be willing to stay here again if the price was right.

I travel about 40 nights a year for my job so when my son and his friend needed to attend a conference for college in Indianapolis I booked them at this Hampton Inn. Because it's downtown you have to pay for Valet Parking ($14.00/night) which was fine. But apparently at 2:30 am some \"unknown\" person \"illegally\" parked in their secure valet garage and backed into my son's car causing over $1000 worth of damage to the driver's side fender and door. You had to really pull hard to even get the driver's door to open so he could get into it and get home. This car is his only means of transportation, his college is 2.5 hours from home and 5.5 hours from Indy. The hotel filed a police report and called my son's phone and left him a message that there had been an incident. Initially they sounded like they would make sure the repairs were taken care. However, once my son left the facility (and was still charged the $14 parking fee) it was nearly impossible to get someone to call us back to try and make arrangements for the repairs. After several attemps I finally reached the manager and he said that if I faxed over the estimate from the body shop that he would have us taken care of by their insurance and they would work on getting reimbursed by this \"third party\"...a week went by and I didn't hear anything. Then I get a call from their insurance agent and she was extremely rude, condescending and basically called me a liar because they had no intention of paying for the repairs and didn't know why the manager would tell me that!!! I have no information on who this other \"third party\" is - no insurance information from them or a name, nothing. The insurance agent said I would just have to report it to my own insurance (causing my rates to go up for having a claim) or call the police department to see if I could find any information on this other person. I was furious!!! I have attempted to reach the hotel manager again but of course he won't respond to emails or phone calls so I want to spread the word about what they have (or in this case haven't) done and I also let the corporate offices know that Hilton hotels will no longer be my choice of accomodations when traveling.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Troy, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "msu_mom", "ReviewID": "UR87036556", "Content": "We've stayed here 3 or 4 times.

But the negatives far outnumber the good things. The lobby is definitely not a place you'd want to hang out. Think old bad 80s tile and lots of stained and worn out laminate. This along with the elevators gives the whole public space area a sort of hospital or industrial vibe. The rooms are very sub-par for a Hampton Inn. The ventilation system was so loud I felt like I was in an airplane hangar and I actually had to turn it off to even hear the television. The bathrooms are in dire need of an update, again with 80s icky beige tile with gray grout that just looks old and dirty. And even though I was in a non-smoking room I swear I smelled smoke. Not fresh smoke, but maybe smoke from 20 previous years of smoking. Or mold in the vents. Ick. Dust on all of the switch and outlet plates. Thin, sorry towels. Just bad in general. Maybe I wouldn't be so harsh in my review if I weren't comparing this property to all of the other Hampton Inns I've stayed at in my life. But they have all been so nice!

I came in very late and was given a room upgrade which was greatly appreciated. The suite looked like it had at one time been (or still was) a handicapped accessible room. Strange though that it was at the extreme (and I mean extreme) end of the property away from the elevator. The room was very nice and clean. The bed very comfortable and despite being right across from a music club, I slept very well. I appreciated the free internet service and the free business center services (computer & printing). The bad news: I had to clean someone else's toe nail clippings from the carpet before I could really feel comfortable, the lobby REEKED of old cigarette smoke and I suspect there are rats about in the building. I left at 3:30 am and two rooms had left their garbage outside their doors. It was ripped apart like, well....like a rat or two had been on the prowl. I guess this is to be expected being that it is an old building. Overall, the location was awesome, the staff very friendly and I felt safe and comfy.", "Date": "July 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reston, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cA nice, boring stay for a business trip\u201d", "Author": "KazariKid", "ReviewID": "UR7682016", "Content": "I was looking for a boring place to stay, and cheap, for a meeting in Indianapolis.

Our main reason for the trip was to attend a Colts game and do some early Christmas shopping. We booked thru the Indy.org visitors site. We got a holiday shopping pkg. The room,free valet parking, and a $25 gift card to the mall for $159. The Indy.org site was cheaper than the Hampton website. I booked the Hampton Inn after reading all the positive reviews here. Our stay went smoothly. The room was clean and decorated nicely. The beds were comfy.The valet parking was very handy and one of the cheaper deals for valet.... $12 per day. The free BF was nice as well. We were on the 2nd floor the same floor as the BF room. The hotel located right across the street from Circle Center Mall and a vey short walk to the RCA Dome. For meals near rhe hotel we ate at The Spaghetti Factory located nearby and had a great affordable meal in a neat historic building.We also dined at Johnny Rockets in the mall. Way over priced and not that good of food for the price....wont do that again. Lots of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. We will book the Hamton for all our future trips to Indy. Very satisfied with our stay.

Only problems that we encountered were that you could hear the traffic from the street below and being a Friday night there was a lot. We adjusted the ac to cool the room and it didn't seem like the temperature changed at all. The room was a little on the small side but very clean. The beds were very comfortable.

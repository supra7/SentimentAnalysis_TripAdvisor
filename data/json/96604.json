Just off the strip enough that it was no problem getting in or out of the parking lot at any time of day or evening. The staff was very friendly, especially the lady that kept up the dining room area during breakfast. The pool as very nice and was cleaned every morning before 8am. We left our room later than most each morning and each evening when we returned our trash had been emptied and fresh towels had been left, which I thought was nice because I know the housekeeper had already cleaned most every room on in area before we even removed our \"Do Not Distrub\" sign. My only complaints would be that there were stains on the carpet in our room but I do understand they are cleaning all the carpets in the hotel this month. I was not impresses with the breakfast...but it is complimentary and the area is kept up very well. My husband enjoyed just fine...i am just a picky eater, but I did enjoy the bagel that I had, I would have really enjoyed a waffle maker or something like that. Being former \"pageant people\" that are used to traveling and staying in types of hotels, I would say this one is GREAT for the price we paid. Overall we had a VERY pleasant stay here and would consider this location the next time we are in Branson.

The room we were assigned was a double Queen overlooking the pool and on the same level as the front parking lot/lobby, perfect for my elderly grandpa. I smelled clean room as soon as I walked in, the bathroom was tiny but clean, the carpet looked recently vaccumed and the a/c was working. The beds were comfortable with the mattress toppers but I could tell it's time for new mattresses. The linens were fresh and comfortable, not soft but not rough either, just fine. The flat screen tv worked ok, some issues with the remote but nothing too bad, prob just faulty batteries, there was a blow dryer in the room we didn't use, do bring toilettries because a soap, a hair conditioner and a shower cap were given only. there was a coffee machine but didn't use it. The hot breakfast was great, everything looked clean and was tasty, I liked that e/a slice of bread came in its own sandwich bag so I knew nobody had manhandled my slice of toast. There were three kind of juice, good yogurt, biscuits and gravy, sc eggs and sausages. Overall a great stay i would def. go back, the only reason I didn't book in advance was because I had a horrible experience at the Ramada Inn so I wanted to check the room before checking in. The staff was excellent, very helpful when it came to directions, advise on where to eat, etc. The only bad thing if I can even call it that, is that the parking is a bit restricted with a limited number of spots up front and the location is not within walking distance of strip but with Branson traffic I call that a Major positive Big plus!!", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Ozark, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value!\u201d", "Author": "corvettefan", "ReviewID": "UR132057976", "Content": "Previously a Ramada Inn which has been cleaned up somewhat.

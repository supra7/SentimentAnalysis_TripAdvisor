The room was very very very small. Too much furniture in it, but in saying that, you dont spend a lot of time in the room. What got me about this place was that they are doing renovations downstairs, but in the parts that guests dont use. The restaurant for breakfast was pretty average, and the food pretty basic, but ive had worse. Some of the staff were great, and some not too good. The lift was the slowest i have ever been in. As far as attractions, we just caught the subway (a five minute walk). If you stay there, about a 10 minute walk down the road is a fabulous 50`s Restaurant, definately worth a look and you must try their Shakes. As far as safety was concerned, it was ok.

The hotel was clean and I had no issues with anything here. It was secure with parking in the back. My friend and I are from vancouver, and we have decided to stay here again upon our next trip to LA. The location is perfect and you will not be stuck in traffic, as it is very central to all the sightseeing around hollywood. Going up the street of Vermont for a 5 min drive will take you to griffith observatory(must see in LA). It was not noisy at all, and the service here was superb. I could not have asked for anything better, and am glad to have stayed here. The management and the associates were a pleasure to talk to, and offered a personable experience.

I would 100% stay again at Hollywood Hotel for the most important reason of all the location. How much close to the action can you possibly get. It is a block and a half walk, less than 5 minutes to the Red Line Metro station and that was my main mode of transportation the entire time I was there. I had ZERO problems with the location and found it to be safe either during the day or at night. In addition, there is a Rite Aid open until 11 pm a 2 minute walk from the hotel where I was able to get anything I needed. It was 4 stops to where the action was at Hollywood and Highland and perfect for all my tours I booked and just a couple more stops to Universal Studios which made my entire trip. As for the cleanliness, I found it to be spotless. I have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels in Mexico that weren't as clean. The maids were always smiling, never failed to say good morning and as for the so-called rude front desk staff???? I never encountered any of that. Anyone I dealt with was more than welcoming and helpful. I never found any issues with the air-conditioning; there was a switch that I could control at all times and it was ideal for the hot, hot weather I encountered. As for my room, I found it to be perfect, especially the bathroom. Loved the shower that you could walk right into, the abundance of clean towels and again very well maintained. I had requested a safe and I had a room with one so I was quite happy with that. As for the free breakfast; again what is up with the complaints people???? I had toasted bagels with cream cheese and orange juice along with fruit each morning followed by yogurt and I was more than happy with that. In addition, there was a fresh omelette station if I so desired with pretty much any sort of filling I could dream of. I must comment on the mgr Jeff's assistance in making sure I was happy with the room and made sure I was promptly taken care of weeks in advance. Excellent customer service that again you don't get in the big so called \"name brand hotels.\" All the amenities, great staff, wonderful room all adds up to a return trip for me and like I mentioned I wouldn't stay anywhere else.

It's lengthy, but will tell you everything you need to know if you are considering staying here. We stayed for four nights at the Hollywood Hotel. Upon checking in, I was told there would be a $100 authorization on my credit card and that I would be paying for the room once we checked out. Not only did they authorize that fee, they also authorized the full booked stay and the parking, which was 20 bucks a night. To be honest, I prefer to be charged in the beginning of the stay so I don't have to worry about it later, but I also prefer to be told this. Communication was not the best in this situation. The second and third day, we had no hot water and the elevators were not working. This was due to the generator breaking down. We had to take a warm bath using an ice bucket full of microwaved water. Understandable, because things happen. However, we also came back to our room to find an entire shopping bag full of food gone. I would have given the cleaning staff the benefit of the doubt on this one thinking that it could have been trash, except the bag weighed a good ten pounds or so. So, at this point, we had no hot water, had to walk the stairs everytime we went outside, stolen food, and bad communication at the front desk. Then, I log onto my bank account to see an unauthorized hold on my account from the hotel. They couldn't exactly tell me what it was for. Ahh. So, with everything going on, we asked what the hotel was going to do to compensate us for the inconveniences that were adding up. They offered to take parking off for one night. We eventually got them to take it off for the entire stay, so that was nice. Though, it only ended up being for our first three nights instead of the agreed full stay. On Sunday, the breakers in our room kept blowing and maintenance had to come three times to try and fix them. We only had one working plug that night which we used for the space heater. That meant none of us could charge our phones. We couldn't make coffee or use the microwave. Also, the parking gate was broken, so our cars were not that secure. For us, this wasn't the worst stay ever, but it was the worst one we have paid $140 bucks for, hands down. Our last night we went two blocks up to the Travelodge. It's not as pretty on the outside, but everything worked and everyone was nice and friendly. I do want to be fair and give this hotel props for what they do right. The beds are extremely comfy and have thick, down comforters on them. Best bed I've ever slept on in a hotel. The breakfast is awesome and there is a wide variety of foods to pick from. Waffles and omelets are made in the spot! The location isn't as good as it could be for the same price as something closer to the attractions but it certainly is NOT the ghetto. At all, not even close. I never felt in danger during my stay here. In conclusion, will I stay here again? No, not likely. Had we been compensated more, perhaps. But we weren't and nothing worked. We were on vacation and had to deal with everything being broken when all we wanted to do was enjoy ourselves. I will say that I don't think my stay was a good representation of the hotel because these things do happen sometimes. However, the way in which the staff handled our inconvenience was not appropriate nor helpful. It's a nice hotel and would've loved to come back but there are other hotels out there just as good that are cheaper and friendlier.

My stay at The Hollywood Hotel, \"The Hotel of Hollywood\" was NOT a pleasant one! Let me start by saying that the original hotel I wanted to stay in stated clearly on their website that they were having renovations done and thus, because I'm on vacation, I didn't want to deal with noise or any inconveniences so I chose The Hollywood Hotel. Big mistake! What This hotel failed to mention on their website and even upon my checking in, is that they too were undergoing renovations! So on Monday morning, while I understand it is a work day for most, the hammering began at about 9:00 AM at a noise level that can only seem to be coming from, literally, inside my room! \u00c2\u00a0I tried to ignore it in hopes that it was just a quick job that was absolutely necessary as, again, it was NINE AM! By the way, there is a three hour time difference from my hometown to LA time, a change that naturally affects ones sleeping habits.\u00c2\u00a0 Once I finally couldn't handle the incessant hammering any further(2 hours) I call the front desk to inquire about the noise and see what can be done. The unhelpful lady on the other end of that phone responded by saying \"ma'am it is 11:00 AM\". As if A. I don't know the time, B. I should be bright eyed and bushy tailed at 8:00 AM before the hammering on MY vacation or C. Hammering at a hotel where patrons clearly have traveled, in my case, quite far to escape the noise and chaos of our regular lives, is perfectly ok.\u00c2\u00a0 I immediately ask to speak to her manager whom is no where to be found. I then get up and get dressed, against my will to get some answers. Why the hammering? Why the lack of notification? Why the lack of customer service at \"The Hotel of Hollywood\"?\u00c2\u00a0 I confront the attendant with whom I spoke to on the phone (I shall refrain from using her name, as I believe in karma and perhaps it was her first day on the job... It wasn't). I tell her I need to speak to the manager. Manager is still no where to be found. She is pretty clueless as to the LACK of customer service and how she merely brushes the incident off. I tell her to have the manager call me immediately, there's a long pause as I expect her to take down my cell phone number. She doesn't and assumes that now that I've been rudely awakened I'm actually going to hang out at the hotel to listen to more of this heavy metal clanking to await the managers phone call! I have to direct her to write down my cell phone number...\u00c2\u00a0 It's been 24 hours now and I still have not received ANY form of communication, despite my leaving a message via telephone to the unhelpful lady from the front desk, seeing the same girl in person, leaving a voicemail to him, and speaking to the night manager! Needless to say, I will never stay at this hotel again. The amenities and service from all staff except one was beyond sub par. The website is deceiving. It is not close to much. The rooms aren't as wonderful as the pictures on their website and the shuttle information is also a little tricky and vague.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0I will however mention Elvira, she makes wonderful eggs with a smile and great pleasure.

The hotel push a tour around LA for what it is I would well avoid quite boring and couldn't see much from the transport provided cost nearly $200 for both of us and it was quite disappointing.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis MN", "Title": "\u201cJust fine\u201d", "Author": "MinnesotaMaven", "ReviewID": "UR124374342", "Content": "Was here for just one night in early February.

Bathroom was basic - shower, sink and toilet (plenty of towels) - clean so what more do you want? Free wireless was great but at times was a bit slow but nothing unsurmountable and having a laundry room was helpful. We were on third floor and near sauna room which unfortunately we had no time for. To negate some myths, we never had any issues with the temperature in the rooms, and the location contrary to various negative comments, is absolutely NO ISSUE. We walked or used metro for three straight days and had no car. Never had any issue going to Hollywood or Universal. Metro contrary to various myths, is literally 3-5 mins walk and not a distance at all. (Vermont/Santa Monica station). Its three stops from main Hollywood and about 5 from Universal (20mins). We took airport shuttles to and from hotel to LAX (cost \u00c2\u00a329 -\u00c2\u00a331) total one way for three people. Bear in mind you are in shuttle for up to 2 hours as you pick up various people, Bit frrustrating but knocks off considerable amount considering cab fare. Just read my book and slept and to be honest driving around various suburbs of LA was not a major hindrance and got to see things I would not have seen. Back to room, various takeout options (hotel lets you get this delivered), and restaurants nearby. If you walk up towards Vermont/Sunset station you;'ll find a brilliant Mexican (Yucas). Breakfast in hotel was absolutely fine. Okay so its not fresh juice or made to order eggs, but it was absolutely fine and set us up for the day. Toast, tea, coffee, fruit and FRESH WAFFLES made to order - what more do you want. Also sausages and bacon as awell so not sure why all the negative reviews. Okay I think I would have eaten out if it wasn't included, but really for the inclusion in room price, it was a steal and very filling. Staff in the breakfast room very friendly. In fact the staff we encountered were all friendly, particularly one who made sure we didn't lose our money in the detergent vending machines as they were temperamental and sent us across the road to convenienvce store which was selling detergent farily cheaply. The only ngative is LA hotels are expensive - lets just say I stayed in Vegas for 8 nights in various nicer hotels sand it cost me the same as 3 nights in LA!!

Overall, it is a good value, and I would definitely give it 4 stars if the temperature was comfortable.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cOvercharged us and wouldn't refund!\u201d", "Author": "telliott76", "ReviewID": "UR121902943", "Content": "Not only did they overbook the hotel and send us elsewhere the first night (a huge inconvenience), they charged us for parking during our visit and we didn't even have a car!

Check in was swift and drama-free and the concierge went out of their way to advise us on local nightlife. The room we were allocated was on the ground floor and 10 yards along the corridor from the main reception. Overall i was delighted with the room. The bathroom was large with a massive walk-in shower and the main part of the room featured two large beds with an ample array of ammenities. There was a small gym and outdoor pool area which were small but surved there purpose. The hotel laid on a free breakfast which although the choice was limited, it was certainly tasty and as it was basically complimentary, u wont be hearing any complaints from me. Cererals, waffles, pancakes, sausage and eggs primarilly made up the daily menu. I've noticed certain reviews on here having a slight dig at the hotel staff. I'd like to tell u from first hand experience that these viscious rumours are nothing short of false propoganda. We were regular visitors to reception whilst grilling the staff on everything from beaches to nightclubs. On each visit we were met with a pleasant smile, foolproof recommendations and pinpoint directions. I believe it was Michael who checked us in and regularly did his utmost to meet our needs, we formed quite a rapport with \"Micky G\" and id like to take this oppurtunity to lavish him with praise. The only slight problem we had was the computer in reception saying as it was constantly occupied but in all fairness this is being severely facetious. Location-wise u couldn't realy ask for any more of a budget hotel. With LA being so vast its impossible to be able to cover all areas in 1 day but The Hollywood Hotel gives u the best opportunity to get around as best you can. We chose not to drive as we found the bus and train service excellent and a matter of 100 yards walk from the hotel entrance. The subway took u straight into Downtown, Central Hollywood and surrounding areas. Santa Monica was easily accessible via a 30 minute bus ride basically along 1 straight road. Whilst previous reports may have labelled the area intimidating or sketchy i have to say i disagree and felt completely at ease. Four nights in a row we returned to the hotel via taxi at 2-3am and the streets were deserted. There was however one night we decided to take a stroll down to a 24 hour subway 200m away and as we entered there appeared to be a group of elderly asian women throwing punches in what was a heated dispute. Swiftly but safely we intervened and used training techniques to subdue and disable the OAP's as we awaited the police to arrive and disperse the handful of onlookers. To show their gratitude we were each given a footlong meatball marinara and went on our way happy as larry. All in all i have to conclude that the Hollywood Hotel is fantastic value for money and provides an exceptional start base to explore Los Angeles. 5 star at a 2 star price", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDon't ever stay here\u201d", "Author": "Cozzybay", "ReviewID": "UR121440949", "Content": "1) When we reached the hotel, no one was there to help us with out largages.

I agree with some of the comments that the buffet is quite small but we never felt disappointed by it.

Simply put, it is nearby, clean, friendly, still local and reasonably inexpensive. I have been a customer of this hotel for several years now and I almost always recommend it to friends; whom don't wish to embarge on me, and who wish to be in a centralized area of Los Angeles. As briefly mentioned, the hotel is local, it's clean and the staff is friendly. If you are looking for a place where the area/neighborhood is superb, then this isn't the place, but if you are looking for a place, such as a hidden little oasis in the rough, then this is it. I am always often welcomed by a friendly staff and this time I checked in myself a little early. The day staff is always friendly as well as the evening staff. In all areas and/or department of the hotel. One staff member, in particular, stands out a bit more. The front desk girl, Gisel. She is always friendly, smiling and I was bolstered at the fact that she remembered my name. Great smile, we exchanged some laughs and as always, friendly. I told her I wanted to treat myself to Boiling Crab and she immediately told me of a place up in Hollywood and Normandie that I was unaware of; The Boiling Shrimp. She explained the difference, other than the name of course, was the waiting factor and also the commute. I never knew there was such a place near by. Anywho, I settled in, relaxed a little on my comfy bed and set my way off to eat. Glad I went and glad it was recommended. The next day I enjoyed myself some complimentary breakfast and went out for a walk. As I returned to my room I ran into the charismatic Gisel again and she inquired about my stay and also my dinner. I told her about it then she began telling me of other places in the vicinity to go eat at. Being a food blogger myself, I was impressed by her knowledge of decent dining spots I myself have also enjoyed. I went back to my room to an already made bed for me to crash out in and enjoyed the rest of my weekend stay. As I was checking out, the staff, once again, friendly, inquired about my stay and invited me to stay once again. :-) This place is highly recommended on my end.

It's not a neighborhood I felt comfortable walking around during the evening even in the company of my fianc\u00c3\u00a9. Check in was fine & after a long journey from Australia we were able to check in early which was a blessing. However no instructions about 'take a lift to the second floor and your room will be to the right' etc was explained. Small gestures go a long way. The woman that assisted us wasn't overly friendly & not a lot of smiles from day staff at all. In fact when questioning them about directions we weren't even offered a map! The evening staff appeared friendlier and would greet us as passing through the lobby. We got to the room and were pleasantly surprised. Whilst being small, it was very clean with a super comfortable bed. Unfortunately there was no in room safe but they do have deposit boxes at the front desk. There is a book with information on local restaurants but nothing on what services are available here such as laundry etc. Our room was on Vermont road side & hence quite noisy with a lot of traffic. I think a room on the courtyard side would have been better. This is why I rated it as a 3, and lack of size. Cleaning service is done everyday and without fault. Hopefully the cleaners are made aware of the great jobs they are doing. I rated service as 4 due to the cleaning staff only & not front desk. They do offer free wi fi which is super easy to connect to & fast. They also offer a complimentary breakfast which is totally adequate. Bagels, juice, cereal, toast, eggs, yoghurt & some fruit. Perfect way to kick off your day. Now as I mentioned earlier the neighborhood is less desirable. However, it's only minutes away from Hollywood Blvd, Walk of Fame etc. All you do is just jump on the subway a block down for $1.50 or buy a day pass for $5.00. There doesn't appear to be many great choices for dining out however we did find a cute 50s diner a few blocks down. Plus there was a pharmacist/mini mart just around the corner.

Our office/production manager back in NY tried to speak with Devon through my cell phone (1AM NY time) but Devon said it was against company policy to talk on a customers cell. She then called him direct. He said there was nothing he could do. The manager was out. I offered to put down my credit card just to get the talent checked in since they were beyond exhausted from thier 6AM flight from NYC. One of the crew offered to put the rest of the crew on his credit card and Devon didn't like his tone and accused him of being \"belligerent.\" I was there the whole time and while our crew member was exhausted he did not curse, call names or yell at Devon. He was impatient but that was it and Devon said he was uncomfortable and refused to check us in because the crew guy was \"belligerent.\" He called the manager and got him on the phone and said that we were accusing him of sabotaging our travel plans! THAT WAS NEVER SAID. Then because he was uncomfortable he asked permission by the manager to make us wait for another person to check in. I then offered to deal with Devon and he refused saying that he was \"done with us.\" The hotel manager NEVER called our office person back and one week later we are still trying to get in touch with him!!!!!!! Long story short Devon refused to check us in and the manager approved that. Rather than be subjected to more rude treatment, our office manager made reservations within minutes at the nearby Wilshire Hotel where we were well received. I was billed for the one hour our talent were in their rooms at the Hollywood Hotel which I am still contesting. I used to be in the hotel business and I understand that not everyone is going to be a happy customer.

The parking is not free, it was $18 every night. The decor of the hotel was very hollywoodish! Nice overall. Their bathroom toileteries are good comparitively so dont worry about that. They give lotion, shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, bathing mit, soap. All not bad quality. So good.

The hotel is pretty nice inside with a private fenced parking lot that made me feel pretty secure leaving my car there although they do charge for parking you want to note (I believe $18 a night). The suite we stayed in was fairly large with a mini kitchen, desk, couch. Some of the items in the room are up to date (TV's, refrigerator, desks) but other things like the carpet and AC system seemed a bit outdated. I am not a very picky person when it comes to staying places so I was happy with my room, but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for something lavish and lush you might want to look around more. You also share a balcony with the room next to you. You get free Wifi which is nice and a free breakfast every morning with a variety of foods. Nothing special but enough to mix it up for a few days. My negative experience came with a situation where the night we checked in. Coming in off a redeye flight, my girlfriend and I were anxious to say the least to get to our room. Upon arrival we checked into our suite around 1:30 am. The sink was dripping pretty bad which made it hard to sleep. Looking further into the sink, water was dripping pretty bad all over the place. We needed to get buckets to save the wood from any damage. I called Mike who worked the desk (a extremely nice guy much like almost all the staff) who did as much as he could to help us. The issue could not be fixed until the morning due to no maintenance man. We were able to stop the drip almost fully but still had to empty a few buckets over the night. Like I stated before Im not too picky, but this was obv something I wished to be accommodated somehow for since I was saving the hotel from pretty bad water damage. To make a long story short the manager Roman (refraining from putting a side comment...) basically dodged me for a week of my stay after emails and messages sent. I contacted him 3 times until the day I left I had to just go to his office. When sitting down he said what can I do for you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I asked him if he got my email (which was very detailed) and he told me he did. I reiterated to Roman that I simply wished for the hotel to waive my parking for my stay and I would have been happy for my troubles. He told me he would waive 2 nights parking and rushed me out his office to tell me that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all he could do after talking to the GM. Roman was very unfriendly and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apologize once for anything. I decided to talk to the GM since ol Roman really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing his job. I spoke with Jeff Zarrinnam who was a very nice guy and did the job Roman was unable to do. He accommodated me in every way and resolved a sticky situation that shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have even gotten to that point.

To be honest with you I was unsure about this hotel but because it was in the right location I decided to go with it. There was a lot of talk on here that it was not in a good area. This hotel is near hospitals and the area is safe. It is between two subways station - one around 5 minutes walk at the most the other is around 15 minuite walk, which is very handy for those without a car. We had a car so it wasn't an issue. This hotel is not actually right in the centre of Hollywood, it is around 5-10 minuites drive at the most from the centre of Hollywood. There is a carpark at the hotel but it is expensive. We just parked on the road at the side of the hotel. You need to read the sign because one day in the week they clean the road in the early morning and the road must be cleared. All you do is park on the opposite side for that one morning. Now comments on the hotel itself.... There was a guy on the reception that was lovely, his name was Peter, he was so helpful and it was nice to come across someone like that when you've travelled thousands of miles. However, not all the staff are that nice. The Manager there I found very off hand and unfriendly, it was same with the girl who worked on the reception desk from time to time. Had I spoken to them on my first night there I would have been very upset. The rooms there are very nice and spacious, I cannot fault them. They cleaned the rooms every day and the cleaners were very nice. Breakfast... do not expect any thing fantastic! The breakfast is very basic and never varied. Everyday they had waffles. To be honest with you half way through the holiday I just got tired of what they served and ended up skippping it altogether. Having said that most hotels in Hollywood offer room only so you could say its better than nothing! However, I thought nothing was better!!!

The Hollywood hotel had reasonable reviews and we stayed there recently for 6 nights on our round the world trip. We were given a ground floor room at the end of a corridor which was very noisey, the hard marble floor and main street outlook did not lend them selves to a peaceful sleep. We had recently stayed in a hotel in Union Square in San Francisco so the mix of homelss and night people was not a surprise. Around the middle of our stay we returned to our room at approx 10pm to find that the ground floor sliding doors had been left open. We had not opened them at all during our stay. We telephoned reception immediately to report the situation. The guy on reception could not have cared less.His response \"What would you like me to do about it?\" I calmly explained the situation. He repeated what he had said before and did not ask anything about the room or if anything was missing. He would however email the hotel management to let them know. I was gobsmacked at his attitude and lack of empathy. WE COULD HAVE LOST EVERYTHING. The next morning we asked reception for an update, the receptionist said that she would contact the director of housekeeping but we could not change our room to an upper floor till later that afternoon. We wanted to leave. We were not very happy and requested no more room service. Reluctantly as we had an early start we deceided to remain and lock our luggage to the furniture as we had an early start to Disneyland. We returned to find out that room service had visited despite our request not to. The Hotel management have not even got back to us, they don't listen or seem to care. We have travelled all around the world (Cairo, Luxor, Morocco, Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, Ho Ghi Minh City, Brisbane, Auckland, San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York, London) staying in rooms no bigger than a double bed in Hong Kong to the Wynn in Las Vegas and in all of them big or small cheap or expensive you expect a level of service and security.

I, in fact, called up and requested a room on the 3rd floor that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face the street so I covered my back before we ventured out there. I did this 2 days before we flew out.

Our standard room, whilst very clean, showed signs of ageing paintwork, walls, and carpets whilst the bathroom showed the first stages of mould on the tiles. The bed was very comfortable with lovely pillows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although the annoying heavy bedspreads slid off at night. They were cleaning the hall carpets during our stay, but continued to use the noisy machinery into the evening. The room had a very large chest of drawers with an old, huge TV in top. A hanging rail is supplied in place of a wardrobe, but with very few hangars. Tea and coffee are provided \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one decaf and one normal per day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not enough if there are two of you in the room. And, as there is no room service or cafe at the hotel, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to ask for more if you like your own hot drinks. Vending machines are on all floors for cold drinks and snacks. A low-noise fridge was great for keeping drinks cold. Our balcony was very pleasant, although there are no chairs to sit on outside. The pool area (just across the hotel car park) was a surprise. Nice pool, pleasant gardens and clean towels. For some reason the lift (elevator) is very, very, very slow. Be prepared to wait! A continental Breakfast is served from 6.30 in the morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great if you have a full day planned. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something for everyone. The hot selection has sausages, eggs (bizarre omelette/pancake-like creations) and freshly-made waffles. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good selection of cereals and breads. The coffee is good for hotel coffee. Fruit (get it before the cut apples and bananas go brown); cheese, spam (yes spam!), yoghurt all made an appearance in the week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although not all were there all the time. They are catering for large numbers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so it may be a case of the early bird catches the selection.

Michael G checked us in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he was helpful, polite and genuinely looked pleased to see us. But it was all downhill from this point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as his other colleagues were much less enthusiastic.

It is so very difficult to find a location in Los Angeles that is affordable for a nice classic wedding. Downtown LA is waaay to loud. And everywhere else is way to far for our guests to enjoy. This Hotel is in the perfect location for our guests (we had a lot of friends and family from out of town who flew in). They have a metro station on both sides of the hotel, walking distance, that takes you straight to Universal Studios. It is surrounded by great cafes and sights and attractions. Our guests LOVED their stay here, the rooms are so clean, modern, and roomy. And the service was just outstanding. Now, our wedding was unbelievable. Mandy took care of us 100%. We were kind of nervous since the prices were so affordable we didn't know what could happen that day. EVERYONE loved our appetizers and cleaned their plates. I can't say enough about this hotel it is such a diamond in the ruff for a wonderful affordable wedding. Mandy checked us into our suite and brought us appetizers from the cocktail hour (we wanted to wait to make our entrance). HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this hotel for your wedding. The only thing I say to be aware of, parking is a bit pricy but once you pay your car and belongings are carefully watched by security within a gated parking lot. (very important in LA) and lastly , their bartender is a little mean.

I was pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail in the decor--more tasteful than some hotels at a much higher rate. The room was truly lovely, nice perimetier tiles on the floor and a nice carpet where the bed was, and an ample size, with sliding glass doors. It didn't have any of that slight \"ick\" feeling you can get from some hotel rooms. The bathroom was nice and they even included a luffa pad. With the lush plants around the exterior it, all in all, made for a cheerful place to come home to and wake up in for 4 nights. The pool seemed nice though I didn't have time to use it. The front desk staff was really helpful and the hotel is well-situated for jumping onto Santa Monica, Sunset, and Hollywood Blvds., and is a straight shot right up to Griffith Park. I went to a concert at the Hollywood Bowl and it only took me 15 minutes to get there; coming home from the House of Blues another night took about 20 minutes. Going to Disney Concert Hall took about 10-15 mintues, same for getting to Rodeo Drive. Getting to Malibu was about 30. Of course, I stayed off of rush-hour freeways. I paid for hotel parking so as not to have to look around for a spot. I hadn't realized a full breakfast was included--even with freshly made waffles while you wait--so I didn't feel too bad about paying for parking. This hotel is a really a great find! I would absolutely return there and recommend this hotel highly. The neighborhood isn't high-end but that's the case with a lot of sections of LA. I never felt unsafe and it was always a pleasant vibe and I found a great deli across from the Wendy's (same side of the street as Wendy's, across a little driveway) which had really fresh and good humous and salads and soups--took stuff to go a couple of times. Right across from the hotel was a place that sold alkaline bottled water that I really enjoyed drinking the whole time I was on this trip. So it's not like the neighborhood had nothing to offer.

After reading the reviews below, I was really apprehensive about the hotel. But, I was pleasantly surprised! I really don't know where some of these people who wrote the bad reviews could be coming from... I arrived @ 1:30 and asked if early check-in was possible. Gizelle, one of the two young women working the day shift, said a room would be ready shortly. I took a seat in the lobby and started giving it a good look - since I had time on my hands and was trying to see what was wrong with it. I saw beautiful marble floors, very tasteful lobby furniture and accessories decorating the area. Three rolling luggage racks on the ready for people to load their luggage onto (don't know what that one reviewer was saying when she said she had to lug her bags around!). They have a separate desk to the corner where you can rent a car. Now, on to the Customer Service. Gizelle couldn't have been nicer and more accomodating. (Bad customer service on previous reviews...could it have been the guest who was unaccomodating, huh? lol) And you should have heard some of the questions that the traveling nincompoops were asking of her and her co-worker (!). I wouldn't have been so patience. LOLL How many times did they have to tell that one guy that it was the 4 and the 8 bus to Santa Monica.?? (3). Oh, there was a pretty Russian lady co-worker who was also very nice, giving directions ad nauseum, etc). Gizelle got me my room at 2:30 and I checked in. The Room was recently renovated and very well thought out, too. Good designers they had. Tile floors throughout with an area rug under the bed - very nice. I especially love tile because it can be santized between guests. The room had a queen bed, nightstands, alarm clock, bureau, arm chair, desk w/keyboard for Internet and a flat screen LCD T.V. Con: It was a little difficult to maneuver around the channels on the remote and I almost hit a BUY button by mistake. So watch your channel surfing. On to the closet area with iron and ironing board and also a safe for your cash, laptop and family jewels. There was an adjacent area for Fridge, micro and coffee maker. The bathroom was spacious and again all in tile even the walls. There was no tub but people shouldn't be coming to southern California and wasting so much water to fill a bathtub anyway. Conservation is the way to go! Get with the program tourists, please? Bravo to the hotel for thinking ahead! The bathroom was stocked with all the amenities even toothpaste and a shoe shine sponge.Good thing because I forgot my toothpaste. Thanks, guys! Towels were plush and folded beautifully. Kudos to the housekeeping staff. I did not see anything untoward and believe me, I checked!!! Open the patio door to a small balcony overlooking a quiet courtyard. Suggestion: They could use a small cafe set to sit at out there for your morning coffee. How about it Management? Would be a nice touch. :-) Obviously you can see I loved my room. It was just very comforting to walk in and see how it shined. In the evening, I took my book down to the pool and enjoyed the families having fun. Met some very nice people from France. Next morning, I took in the Free breakfast. Let's see, coffee, tea, milk, orange juice, cereals, fruit, toast, eggs, saugage and waffles made to order. All for free. I don't understand how anyone could complain about a free breakfast but previous reviewers did. One thing could be better about the breakfast - coffee was too weak but hey, it was FREE so I'm not really complaining. One more con is the location if you are the type that likes to walk everywhere. I felt very safe in the hotel and grounds but the street was a bit iffy at night as others have said. During the day it is fine to take mass transit. One last thing, the parking situation. One big PLUS is the fact they even have a parking lot!!! This is for all you whiners before me who complained about the $18 charge per day to park. I didn't bat an eye because I was just glad they had one and it is gated with an attendant. I originally checked the Roosevelt Hotel for $300 a night, as a treat, but they only had valet parking and they would park you within a THREE MILE RADIUS. No thanks! I like my vehicle nearby.

This is going off of word from a group of Australian tourists who I encountered in the elevator - Service was fairly good. I'll elaborate on this in a bit. Cons: - The building shows its age in some spots, namely with some of the rooms. - The building's age also becomes apparent when using some of the services, such as wired internet (it's just how their system is structured. Your best bet would be to use wifi unless you need a secure connection. If you need a secure connection for things like banking, that's when you can fall back on the wired connection, even if it means moving your laptop next to your bed). Now, with regards to service, service was promptly rendered by one of the GMs of the hotel when I noted that internet access (wired and wireless) had been flawed in our room. He promptly got back to me and tested out the wifi not just in my room but in other rooms as well, and when it became apparent that it was a systematic problem with their setup, he and his contracted staff promptly resolved the issue. Speeds are fairly decent for their internet access as well now that it works. Anyway, getting to my point: it's a good hotel. It's better than the average 3 star hotel I've been to, which I suppose is what anyone looking for a 3 star hotel (okay, technically a 3 diamond hotel) would want.

We asked for a new room because upon sticking my head out my door after hearing pounding on the wall, a group of drunk girls threatened to kick my [--]. I did not know them, this was at 2:30 a.m. We asked for a room change the next morning and was assured new keys would be waiting when we came in that day.

No. It was quite obvious that considerable effort has gone into the property to renovate the facilities and there wasn't much to fault, I am plead to say. The rates are very reasonable, which explained why the place was quite busy, and could not accomodate me for additional nights. While I would not call the place elegant , it was much better than I expected in appearance and comfort. Breakfast was also more than acceptable.

I'll first say that this area is a bit questionable in some parts, but near the hotel it was fine and we had no problem. We picked this hotel based on its location as its very close to the Kaiser Permanente Hospital on Sunset where my father in law was having surgery. So for us it was perfect. The hotel is located on a busy city street. So the driveway is small and cramped and very steep. A friend picked us up and dropped us off which was good as another car had also pulled up and had we needed to stop there for very long, it would have been a problem. There is a gated parking lot with an attendant that I believe is around $17 a day. We didn't need that and I am happy to say we didn't have to pay that fee. Sadly I have stayed at hotels without a car and still had to pay some \"resort\" fee which is generally all about parking. So I was happy about that. The lot never looked all the way full. We were greeted by a very nice front desk employee who got us checked in very quickly. Our requests of a top floor room near another family member were both met. The room was on the backside of the building, it had a walkway we could have accessed via a sliding door but we never did go out there as there were no chairs and nothing really to look at. Our room was tiny! But for two of us it was fine and very comfortable. We had a queen sized bed, desk, two nightstands, and a chair. The closet was a free standing piece of furniture that also housed the t.v. It was small but ample since our trip was short. Inside it also had an iron and ironing board and a couple of drawers. The bed was very firm, bedding was fine, not worn a bit and we had four nice pillows plus another decorative pillow in a sham. The carpet was a bit worn but not dirty. They had free wifi which was great for my husband and he always got a good connection with no problems. It was unfortunate that the connection was on the nightstand. The cord didn't really appear long enough to reach over to the desk but he didn't try too hard as the nightstand was fine if a little awkward. The bathroom was really the weakest part of the whole stay/experience. The sink counter top was newer but the rest of the bathroom looked old. The sink and floor were very clean, but the shower did have some mold. The shower curtain was one of those kind that slopes out which was good since it had some mold too. The shower head was so low that even at 5'5\" I had to sort of stoop down to rinse my hair. But the water pressure was fine, they provided plenty of towels and toiletries and other than that mold (and I have seen worse at other hotels) it was fine. It was an older bathroom and large in size but the counter was small. But it worked fine and the lighting was good and it had a hair dryer plus two outlets. The room was so quiet! The ac is very loud and that helped but also I think it was just built well. Across from us two of our nights were the nosiest people. Whenever I opened our door or came up the hallway I could hear them since their kids were always yelling, crying or running up the halls. But inside my room, I didn't ever hear them. I found the room carpet fine, but the hallway carpet was a bit worn and in the hallways and in the breakfast room there were lots of areas with bunched up carpet I was really worried my aunt might trip but thankfully she didn't. But that carpet in all common areas needs to be stretched. I would totally stay here again. For the area it was fine. We had no problems with anyone scary near the hotel. My husband and I walked down to the little Mexican place two doors down and it was fine. I only saw one homeless person near our hotel the whole time. The other guests were all nice (even our noisy neighbors) and it seemed a mix of tourists and some business people. The free breakfast was very good. They had the same thing each morning so if you have lots of days, be prepared for that! But they had waffles (an employee made those for you fresh), scrambled eggs (these weird patties of eggs but they tasted like little plain omlettes), three kinds of cereal, sausage, croissants, toast, bagles with cream cheese, canned fruit, orange juice, milk, lemonade, coffee, tea and ice water. The people that worked there were very nice and the eating area was very large and clean. They had staff to bus the tables and they kept it clean even on the busy days. I know some people have had some issues with this place, we didn't. We got a very good rate, the staff were all nice, it felt secure, the area was not bad, and our room was comfortable and clean. The maids did a very good job each day on our room. I would totally stay here again and recommend it to anyone who needed that area. And believe me, compared to the Travel Lodge down the street, this place is much better! I saw it from the outside, it looked sort of nasty and my father in law had toured it before our visit (since it and the Ramada were the closest) and they wouldn't even let him see a room.

Since it is a 3 diamonds hotel, we expected at the very least better than average. We were at Universal studios all day, checked in later in the evening. My daughter was having problems with asthma, so we were anxious to settle her in. The lobby at first glimpse was very nice. On the way up to our room we realized that the hotel was less than clean. Huge stains on the ceiling and hall carpeting. On entering the room, we very disappointed at how shabby and worn it was. The carpet was soiled, and rippling. The furnishings \"well used\". The bed coverings were lumpy, bedding thin and well used. At first we thought the beds hadn't been changed. After checking to make sure the beds were fresh, my daughter was going to shower and go to bed. First thing, walking thru the bathroom door we saw a big chunk out of the bathroom countertop. We tried to call the lobby about this and the fact that there was no soap, shampoo etc. After 3 efforts we did get a desk clerk. None of the personel was aware of the damaged countertop or seemed to even care. We didn't have small children with us. If we had that broken edge would have been a hazard. It doesnt end there tho. At any other time, we would have asked for another room, but our daughter was quite ill. After she was in bed, I went into take my shower (with soap I brought) and discovered ants all over the floor. Second floor room, how do you get ants? I looked around. The door jamb is metal it was rusting at the base and top, paint long gone. This is where they were coming from. As I stood back up, I realized that the lowered section of ceiling on the shower entry was separating and molded. The shower ceiling was also molded. Too late to go elsewhere, we stayed. The neighborhood was not one I would chose if I knew the area. We are not familiar with L.A. or Hollywood. Its not an area I would wander around in and sightsee if there was anything to see. We did go down for the continental breakfast. Usual fare, cold cereal, canned fruit, toast and juice. They have 5 toasters 2 l/2 of the toasters worked. Afterwards, my daughter made a powder stop at the guest bathroom in the LOBBY. It was disgusting. One toilet was broken and \"filled\". One sink was broken, there was dirty papertowels, q tips all over the floor and sink top. This bathroom can't be more than 20' feet from the registration desk.

I built Hollywood up so much and It truly was as crazy and as fun as i imagined. firstly, we didnt want to spend loadsa money on flight and accomadation, we found a good package on Expedia: Ramada Inn on Vermont with Air New Zealand. Air New Zealand was great. Ramada was also good, however there were a few issues, but nothing major. 1) the Location is fine if you hire a car, I couldn't as i am only 24 and you have to be 25. So we spent a lot in cab fares, which was annoying. Ramada is close to universal studios, which is great. It is also about a 10-15 minute drive to both Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset Strip in west Hollywood. If however, you are able to spend more money on your hotel, than you cant beat the renaissance hotel. It looked amazing. Anyway, back to the Ramada. The Hotel staff in general were quite moody people, but they were helpful enough. We found that we were always greeting them rather than the other way round, but who gives a crap, they did their jobs and thats all that matters- although a smile couldn't hurt hey. The pool was great, the gift shop keeper was very helpful and sweet. We didn't have enough time to check out the gym and sauna, but they were there.... The Bar was never open- it looked small and boring anyway. the Breakfast was repetitive, but it was good enough, you got the usual cereal, toast, fruit, tea and coffee and then the sausage, eggs and waffles, it was nice actually. the rooms where a bit small but 3 girls with loadsa luggage managed it. There wasnt enough storage, that was the main issue. The beds were very comfortable. Oh and the maid service was great, the room was immaculate, really impressive service. Overall, our stay at Ramada was good enough considering what we paid. It would of been nice if it was a touch closer to the Hollywood Blvd mainly. West Hollywood is a bit pretentious, but I still wouldn't say no. Oh yes sorry I forgot, the street that Ramada is on is a bit vile, quite a few hobos around, but in the day it was fine, we walked to the supermarket and the subway and it was fine. It is a bit seedy but we are from London so we are used to these sorts of areas I guess. Its surprising how many homeless people there are in LA overall actually. Ok so, the subway and buses are easily accessible. The staff were quite helpful with where to go, which buses to take etc....... Go to Santa Monica for the day its beautiful-or stay there if you can. Venice beach is crazy too, there is some man that sings, \"jingle bells jingle bells help me get drunk\" hahaha, so give him a few dollars if you see him!! : ) Loads of nice restaurants- Katsuya is great! Les Deux bar and nightclub is great! Saw a few celebs about like Fat joe, Kim Kardasian.... oh and go to Madame Tussauds, that was fun too. Ramada offer all the excursions with travel included so that was good too. I think thats pretty much it, the best thing I can say about Hollywood is that you have to see it for yourself to make a judgment, no one can tell you what to expect I guess.

We had a fantastic room singled off from the others with a generous sized living room, TV area, separate bathroom and plenty of space. We had 6 bags and they were able to be stored without interfering with our living space. The included breakfast made a huge difference in our budget. It's the same every morning but it's GREAT VALUE. The beds were large and comfortable and the room was EXTREMELY CLEAN and made over every day before we returned. The fridge and microwave in the room saved our lives. For those on a budget or those who just appreciate having somewhere to store a cold drink and sandwich, then this will make your stay fantastic. We spent $25 on food the entire week because we could store it. It was also nice to not have to go out for every meal, especially at the end of a long day. The staff were pleasant enough and helpful when asked. The pool area is great, towels were provided and it was relatively quiet. Being young and our first solo trip, all of these things made a huge difference, granted we were out every single day we were there. For the younger crowd and those wanting to travel on a budget, I could not recommend this place enough. It is literally a block from the train station - which we used every day. A walk in the other direction took us to Los Feliz Village - an up and coming trendy area with several cafes, vintage stores and things to look at. This hotel is also a pickup and drop off destination for Star Line tours if you're looking at doing anything around the area. Excellent value for money. I would stay here again as opposed to paying double for a better zip code. I've also stayed at the Ramada Plaza and think it's way overpriced and further out of the way as far as public transport is concerned. A great middle of the road hotel so please disregard the reviews that nit pick every detail. Some people want everything for nothing. You don't stay here for luxury, you stay for value and comfort. I was pleasantly surprised. As a side note, the area is also not too bad. We went out a few times and caught the train back late at night.

They even threw in 9/11 to try to make it seem like it was a matter of security. Exhausted, I went to my room turned on the heater and went to sleep only to wake up in the morning freezing cold.

I think it's worth mentioning that as I am British my expectations will be different to those from other countries, so whilst this review isn't aimed solely at Brits, it definitely has that perspective. The first room I was put into was 103 - remembering that in the US the ground floor is called the first floor. I moved from this room as soon as I could because although it was a good room and easy to get out of without using the lifts, the receptionist told me that they have event nights in the bar downstairs and one of the nights it was a club. I could definitely hear music etc before I moved rooms to the 3rd floor. Both rooms were great. The shower was hot and strong and the bed was good quality with decent bedlinen. I couldn't fault the room at all. Breakfast was continental European, and there was lots of it, much better than I have had in other hotels in the same range. The reception was clean and tidy and the receptionists were generally helpful. Only one of the younger girls had some kind of attitude and made me feel stupid for asking about the car park, the rest were all very helpful. Although the car park was a little expensive it was safe and had lots of spaces. The hotel was well placed for me, only with trips down to Santa Monica did I feel the distance, even then at the right time of day, it's not so bad. I don't know why they say it's near Universal, because it's not. In real terms it's a twenty minute drive at least. I looked at lots of hotels in this price range and as I drove around LA checked a few of them out - they were really grotty and I was very pleased I hadn't stayed in them. Whilst the area the hotel is in isn't great, it isn't that bad either and reasonably safe enough to walk around in at night. It has to be remembered that walking ANYWHERE in LA at night isn't such a great idea, unless you're in one of the shopping districts. I felt perfectly safe and when I come again with my family I would stay in the hotel quite happily. There are some restraunts nearby, I drove five minutes up to the House of pies one night - great nosh, reasonably priced and further up in Los Feliz there are some trendy bars and cafes.

The location of the hotel isn't great but I think that's reflected in the rate. I simply couldn't afford to stay at a decent place in a good location and a nice hotel in a not so nice location was a fair compromise for me.

There was no sweetener for the coffee. My waffle was cold and hard. No matter, even hot they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that tasty. The room itself was decent, though very small. The smoke detector seemed to be missing its batteries, and the full-length mirror faced the toilet. There was no blanket on the bed, only the flat sheet and comforter. Wireless Internet was also offered, but the connection was so slow that it was unusable. The towels, which we hung up to re-use the next day, were replaced by fresh new ones. So much for their eco-friendliness. (But maybe that had more to do with the maid thinking that we were there for only one night?)

Yes, both mornings they knocked and tried to come in. On the plus side, this hotel was exceedingly quiet. Most hotels have the heavy pneumatic doors that slam closed behind you. Not this one.

Fortunately, everything was fine. Yes, the hotel is a bit \"dated\" but it's clean, the room was great and it has plenty of facilities (fridge, microwave, coffee, internet access, free breakfast, swimming pool, etc) What do you expect for the money?! I really do think that some people want a 5 star hotel experience for the cost of a 2/3 star and when they don't get it, they write a bad review. I think if you want a 5 star hotel, pay for a 5 star hotel and then write a bad review if it doesn't live up to your expectations! Anyway, back to the hotel: Good points 1. Great location for metro and buses. Don't even think about driving in LA - it took us an hour to go 5 miles! Metro is clean and safe and only $5 for a day pass. 2. Great room facilities - A/C, fridge, microwave, coffee in china mugs and the most fantastic bed I've ever slept in - great night's sleep! 3. FREE breakfast - yes, FREE! A rarity in USA and very nice it was too. Hot eggs, sausage, waffles, pastries, toast, breads, cereals, juice, milk, tea and coffee. The same every day but very tasty and enough to keep you going til lunchtime. 4. Hotel facilities - ice machine was great, didn't use the swimming pool but wandered around to it and it looked lovely. 5. Staff - very friendly and helpful Bad points 1. Lift was slow 2. Not enough restaurants within walking distance. Plenty of fast food places (Pizza Hut, McDonald's, etc) but not enough \"nice\" restaurants for me.

I found the location convenient for business and pleasure and used public transit for the duration of my stay. This hotel is ideal for business travelers and tourists who do not want to rent a car. Locational advantages notwithstanding, I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. During my stay, the hotel itself was sorely lacking on many fronts: -The elevators are very, very slow, and the stairs are roped off as emergency exits only. -My room (one queen) was smaller than average. -The television set did not work well, and the cable went in and out every night. -The floor in my room was stained, and the comforter was severely worn. -The bathtub was elevated far above floor level, resulting in unsafe entry/exit and a lack of headroom. I am able-bodied and nearly fell getting out of the tub EVERY night. And at 6'1\" my head was uncomfortably close to the ceiling. -My room was remade despite hanging up the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. I inquired at the front desk and was informed that I should stop by every morning and request that my room not be remade. For the record, I did that the next three days and they did not enter my room. -Each room facing the courtyard has a patio, but the patios have no chairs. And because the courtyard is so small, there is no privacy. -Access to the swimming pool is through the parking lot, and it closes early (8 PM). Also, there is no hot tub. -Breakfast is served in the basement, which requires a painfully slow elevator trip. I was in a hurry every morning and was disappointed at the lack of \"portable\" pastries and fruit that could be consumed on my way to the subway station. The Ramada is located near L.A. City College \"somewhere\" between Hollywood, Little Armenia, and Silverlake but not actually in any of the three. The neighborhood is walkable but a bit worn in, and I suggest that women be careful walking around by themselves at night. There are several nearby restaurants of varying quality, but the best are a healthy trek away. I walked to them, but most people would be better off driving. There is a Rite Aid at the corner of Santa Monica, but the nearest grocery store is located north at Hollywood (not too far from the restaurants at Prospect). At $105/night (20% discount for staying >3 nights), the Ramada is not a bargain. Parking is $15/night, which didn't matter for me, but is a bit steep for this part of L.A.! I feel ripped off. Well, I feel like my company got ripped off! Really, the only redeeming feature of the Ramada itself was my ability to print out my Southwest boarding pass before heading to the airport. If the subway station weren't a block away, this hotel would probably devolve into some cheap motel of last resort. Overall, I suggest you look elsewhere. This place won't kill you or give you bed bugs--I survived here for four nights--but this is not the way to see L.A.

Of course after several reviews stating this hotel was terrible and so on, i was so reluctant to stay that i tried to cancell our reservations on MANY occasions, of course to no avail. To my relief when we got there and checked in we were all fine, yes the neighborhood could be improved upon, well i didnt like walking at night but we were fine nothing happend. The hotel is being refurbished as we speak, there doing alot of work to it and its looking really nice, the lobby has some couches and a little internet service nook and is tastefully decorated, check in went smoothly, but i can see how some of the reviewers would say that the ppl at the front desk were incompitent, it really all depends on who your dealing with, so if you want to know something try and speak to diffrent ppl on different days, the 2 ladies that were there when my husband asked about the bus to Dodger Stadium they said there were none, when i told them i had done research before getting here and know for a fact that the # 4 will take them she replied \"there are so many buses around here, i dont know where they go\". I spoke to a guy THAT NIGHT that gave us step by step instructions on how to get there via bus, he also sat with me and tried to find us a place to go at night, sorry i didnt get his name 4 u guys. Ok now the rooms, very comfy, yes some were small (8 ppl in our group, 6 rooms), but ours had a flat screen tv, a micro wave, mini fridge, ironing board, coffee maker, tile floor with area rug, really nice bed spread, lots of outlets for charging electronics, closet/hangers, desk, bureau with 6 drawers, lots of room for clothing, bathroom has somewhat of a weak fan some of the silver accents were rusted but who cares, the bathroom was NOT mildew infested, seamed very clean, massaging showerhead (positioned very low, btw) you also get free paper in the lobby, and free breakfast every morning, yes it was somewhat monotnis but if you were wise with your choices you could break it up and still have a decent experience, i hate to be repetative but i will list the stuff that was available: First there were 3 kinds of cereal ( raisin bran, rice crispies & I cant remember the 3rd) next was the milk and OJ, then some eggs and sausage linx, then was the waffles made to order station, they were pretty good BTW, then was some canned fruit and a tray of Crossants and other breads including whole wheat toast and all the trimmings, butter, jelly, cream cheese and then the coffee station, so ya see? you can totally have cereal one day, eggs, sausage and toast another day, a waffle another day.....u see where im going here? we had the balcony overlooking the courtyard, which 2 foreigners and a bunch of teenagers who failed to realize that there voices were echoing thru the courtyard, but thats not the hotels fault, but if your really into your sleep i would request a room where the balcony dosnt face the courtyard. As far as the pool, i didnt look for it cuz it was way too cold and i didnt visit the gym either so i have nothing to report on that. The elevators unfortunately are very slow so just make sure u alot yourself enuff time to meet in the lobby or down for breakfast. Parking was $12 a day plus tax wich was fine, at least we knew we had our van in a safe place. If you have a vehicle your basically a 1/2 hr from everything u wanna see. Well thats about it, no its not the Ritz but if your looking for something under $100 bux a night, so u can shower and sleep, there is nothing wrong with this hotel!! OH very imprtant, make sure you look at your bill upon check out, they tried to charge one of our party for movies he never rented, when front desk and manager were confronted there response was \"im sorry but we have to charge you\" WTF?

It has the slightest incline but don't worry if your bags have wheels. The Internet TV is poor but the hotel offers free wireless access. Great if you brought your laptop but if you didn't - use the Internet Cafe across the street $3 per hour. The room was clean, comfortable and the hotel also has a car hire facility. Breakfasts were great with a huge array of waffles, toast, cereal, coffee, juice, sausages and scrambled eggs. The only thing I found a bit of a challenge is that they don't seem to do the cross selling of their offerings very well. For example, there is a gift shop which I only discovered on my final day there. The hotel service directory needs and update and although the hotel has comedy nights I frequently found the posters advertising this were displayed after I left the hotel that morning and the event was over by the time I got back. I would highly recommend this hotel for its proximity to Universal Studios and the Kodak Theater. Use the Metro if you can. Universal City is the stop for the Studios only 7 stops away (15 minutes) and the Kodak Theater & Chinese Theater are just a few steps away from one another, again on the RED Route. Check out http://socaltransport.org/tm_pub_start.php for more details on getting around. The Metro is very clean. However, if you want to take the bus to the Chinese Theatre, use route 217 which you can pick up 200 yards up the street which will take you straight to it.

Some very nice lounges and restaurants only 3 blocks up the street (e.g. Dresden's as seen in the movie Swingers) Staff were quiet and friendly and very helpful to our questions about postage, internet and room fees. It's a bit of a grubby neighborhood, but pretty safe. There's an affordable friendly Mom & Pop convenience store a half block down, a drug/variety/liquor store in the mall 3/4 blocks down and even a large office franchise store in that mall if you need copies, paperwork, etc. All amenities available... Only huge down note was the bar downstairs. Way overpriced and poor timing for the entertainment (they leave the TVs on at the back bar with a comedy show in the lounge). On the big plus side: Wireless internet was free. We loved this for researching tour packages on my laptop. Don't take the tour from the hotel...way overpriced. Tons of coupons out there to take anywhere from $4-$10 off per person. The continental breakfast was really good. It was not a simple continental breakfast as many other states. Fresh-cooked waffles with syrup, mini-bagels (can't toast them though), toast, juices, coffee, tea, jelly buns, sausage..The eggs need tons of pepper and ketchup (you'll see - lol).Overall you could fill up and tour all day until suppertime.

The manager (Roman Baranov) could not have cared less about my situation, and actually said that I should have used the Internet the Ramada provides at a $10 per day charge instead. He could have waived the charge ($220 for two local phone calls), but he refused. The deceptive, hidden charges, and bad management, make me never want to stay at another Ramada again! Too many other hotel choices, anywhere in the world, to put up with Ramada's indiferrence to its guests....", "Date": "July 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAnts, Mold, and Hair\u201d", "Author": "vegas_trip_2007", "ReviewID": "UR8043563", "Content": "Before leaving for our vacation my friend and I did a lot of research on this hotel. On the website we looked at it stated airport shuttle, absolutely a load of crap, when we arrived at the airport I proceeded to call the hotel and was informed that they don't offer a shuttle and we would have to ride the \"Super Shuttle\" which costs $15 one way and that didn't include the \"tip.\" ( Just a personal tip for any single woman going, DON'T take the super shuttle, we were offered a \"special tour\" in our drivers mercedes for 5 hours for $100!) When we arrived at the hotel the front desk man wasn't very helpful when I asked to have extra linen sent up to the room. We were told that there was only one houseman on until 11, like this would be a huge inconvenience. When the houseman came to our room he told us that they didn't have enough extra linen to give us ( I was literally stunned, I work in housekeeping at a hotel so the mere thought of them not having enough linen for us was ridiculous) He then brought us a rollaway instead and told us not to tell because we would be charged for it. He also informed us to keep our safety bar on our sliding door secure because other guests could come to our porch and potentially get in our room. Upon looking at the state of the rollaway my friend and I decided the queen bed would have to work, and on a positive note the bed was actually one of the nicest I have ever slept on in a hotel. When we entered the bathroom we found an array of surprises including the previous guests glob of hair on the shower wall, mold growing in all corners of the room which seemed to house our other room mates, ants! after seeing this we walked to rite aid and I purchased some mr clean and did a serious scrub down. Other than that the room was ok, the one other note worthy comment is that they don't allow the Do Not Disturb signs to be used as a form of security and every day after 12 housekeeping would enter your room if you weren't their and service the room. The breakfast was okay, for being free, but I would suggest looking at the eggs before eating them. They also provide free entertainment on monday's and wednesdays which is usually a comedian. The only positive thing about the location is that it is about a 5 min walk to the metro-subway system which connects you right to hollywood blvd. Thats it.

I was one of only three sorry audience members, apparently jet-lagged and looking for a laugh or two. But there was nothing funny about the show, which featured three quite drunk guys who had absolutely zero professionalism and were actually scary. The warm-up \"comic\" almost fell over he was so drunk, and his act consisted of swearing and trying to degrade audience members with silly comments meant to be philosophical. I almost walked out at that point, but then remembered that this was a free show and I probably should give them another chance. So the next guy told sad tale after sad tale about his sorry life. Nothing to smile at. All in all, a nightmare evening (and a beer was something like eight dollars). Finally, do not think that this hotel is in the Hollywood you probably have in mind.

The sidewalks are not glamorourized - infact, they're dirty in typical city-style. I stayed with a friend and I did not feel very safe with us two being girls.

The hotel breakfast is average and repetitive - the standard eggs, bacon, toast, juice. 3) The metro/subway is a short walk away. About 5 minutes of brisk walking. This takes you everywhere. I love the all-day transit rate also! $5 if I recall. 4) I found the rooms of the hotel interesting, tolerable, and fun. If you're expecting glamour and glitz, you'll be disappointed.

The next day as we checked in I explained all of the above to the manager and asked him for some LITTLE form of compensation (like the airline did the day before) for their complete disregard for our plight the nite before such as a room upgrade to make up and we'd be happy once again. He seemed to agree but then proceeded to assign us our standard room. There is just something about Ramada's culture that is down right offensive. I hope to NEVER have to stay at a Ramada EVER again.

Me and 3 other friends shared a double room. And even though, we were sorta nervous (after reading the reviews online) We went ahead and kept our reservation. Well first of all, this hotel really isn't that bad. I think a lot of the reviews are a bit on the dramtic side. 1) The location: Yes, this hotel is located in Hollywood. However it is NOT in the \"glam\" end of it. I wouldn't call the neighborhood \"scary\" at all. It's just a hispanic neighborhood, but we had no problems and ventured out often. The metro line and busses are about 1 block away.The hotel is pretty close to a lot of touristy spots, and there are city tours daily from the hotel. I would advise buying a map before heading out. 2) The building: Although the outside of the hotel isn't attractive-at all. The interior isn't too bad, I found the place pretty clean and some of it looked a lil more \"modernized\". The room we shared wasn't a bad size, we had a balcony, fridge and small sofa. The bathroom was a decent size and the shower was huge. The hotel has an outdoor pool, it is in-ground, it's not the biggest pool, but it was refreshing, and has lots of loungers and plants around it. 3) Continental breakfast: Every morning there was a free breakfast. We all found it decent, they serve cereals, fruit (like fruit cocktails), toast, bagels, croissants, eggs (meh) sausages (yummy!) and waffles (also good). The eating area is pretty nice and it's well maintaned and clean. 4) Customer service: This is the only issue, I had with this hotel. We did have one bad expirence. On Monday nights, the hotel bar has a \"comedy show\" Well I did find the show a little amatureish, but for the most part it was great...That is until they had one comic come on. He was the most vulgar, rude performer I have ever seen. He not only made disgusting jokes about incest, rape and drug use. But he \"picked\" out people in the audience and made extremelely rude comments and jokes at their expense, and on top of all that, all he did was yell. We did end up walking out. When we brought this issue up to the front desk, they simply stated \"That's how comedy is here\" And to this I replied \"You guys find incest, rape and drug use funny?\" The older gentlemen at the counter didn't take us very seriously and shrugged us off. Also, when it comes to calling cabs, make sure to tell the front desk to call you a 'Yellow cab' the \"Hotel cab\" they use there charges you more than double than all other cab companies. We also, found the front desk staff rude and always quick to get rid of you. They don't seem to know a lot of basic questions/directions. When we asked them where malls, grocery stores, good bars in the area were...they look confused and just sorta mumble an answer. This is a very honest review.

The location of the hotel is in a poorer part of west hollywood. Its just a hispanic neighborhood. It is not threatening by any means, just not as classy as you probably have been used to. It is about 2 blocks away from the LA metro system,which is just like the DC metro system. The only drawback is that the metro doesnt take you to too many places. it basically runs between downtown and hollywood. so if you are going to check out downtown or hollywood, the metro is just fine and you dont need a car. for all other places you are better off driving. The rooms are small, but decent. We got a room facing the road so i must admit that at night if you are a light sleeper, you can be woken up by the sounds of passing trucks or buses. The rooms are clean. The hotel has a complimentary breakfast- standard waffles, croissants, cereal, sausages and eggs. Its the same breakfast everyday. But hey, its Free. This hotel i think is a misfit in the neighborhood- it was known as the hollywood hotel earlier- i think the ramada must have bought it now or something. Anyways there are big boardrooms and the facilties for a restaurant- maybe they just closed it because they didnt have enough business. There are no good restaurants within walking distance. There is one Thai place about a block away- which has decent food, and they do deliver to the hotel. We flew from DC to LAX and rented a car to the hotel, which has plenty of parking, but at a rate of 12 bucks a night. So on the whole, this is a decent hotel. Its by no means a really memorable or romantic one, but if you can get it for about 70 bucks a night and you are on a budget, then its OK enough.", "Date": "May 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cYes, it's as bad as people say\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5044233", "Content": "I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ramada Hollywood.

We ventured out at night on the metro to Hollywood Boulevard to see the sights, only 3 or 4 stops away and it was fine, a few homeless people about but I'd say the area around the hotel is more of a poor area than a rough one, and people seemed to keep themselves to themselves.

We also caught the bus to Santa Monica although with the awful traffic jams it did take over an hour. You don't NEED a car in LA, we managed quite well with the bus and train, managing to get to Universal Studios in 10 minutes by metro, Hollywood Boulevard in less than 10 minutes and West Hollywood bars and restaurants in 25-30 minutes. We even caught the Amtrak train to San Diego from Union Station for $25 each and it took about 2 and a half hours. Overall an excellent stay in LA and I would recommend the hotel for people on a budget or travelling around the States. We loved LA and Hollywood, we would definitely go again though would probably stay at the Ramada West Hollywood as this was more central for what we wanted to do.", "Date": "November 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rosharon, TExas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Service!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4105896", "Content": "I just wanted to take this opportunity to express the wonderful service I received on my recent visit to California.

My husband and I were traveling with another couple and only planned to stay one night in Hollywood before heading south for a wedding. Our plane from Honolulu arrived at LAX about 6pm and we drove around the area exploring for awhile before checking into the hotel at 8pm. The front desk clerk informed me that he only showed a reservation for one room (and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care at all that I had a print-out of my confirmation with Hotwire showing two PREPAID rooms). He said they were sold out for the evening and the four of us could share one room or we could try the Travelodge down the street. He also said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see our reservation as being prepaid. No manager on duty to assist us. We ended up sharing the one room and I called Hotwire to refund the cost of the other (no problems on that side). In the morning the front desk clerk (the same guy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they sure do work long hours!) confirmed that our room was already paid and said another room had opened up later that night, but he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to disturb us since it was late. Um, okay. Thanks for letting me know after the fact. He tried to charge us for the parking ($9 I think) and I told him there was no way I was paying for that when they gave away one of our rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the LEAST they could do was comp it. He said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the authority. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until after I asked to speak to the manager he finally got up and went to ask for authorization to comp. Other Details: Our first floor room was fine. Not a bad size - two double beds, small couch and coffee table, mini fridge and microwave. Clean. Fairly quiet. View of parking lot. Elevator down to breakfast area was unbearably slow (5 minutes both ways, seriously). They need a set of stairs nearby or something. Breakfast wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great, but it was free so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really complain. When we were there they were out of forks, juice glasses, and syrup. Eggs and croissants were gross, but there was plenty of juice, milk, cereal, toast, waffles, and sausages that were fine. Area was somewhat seedy, but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re driving it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine.

All of the staff were very friendly and happy to help with making bookings and giving directions. Being near to two Metro stations was the real reason we selected the hotel as we had no car and it proved to be a real success. The area is not wonderful but neither is it worryingly rough.

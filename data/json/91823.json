The rooms are nice, great mattress, flat screen TV, updated bathroom with coffee maker. I would like to see a safe in the room, but valuables can be stored free in the cashier area. 2. Plenty of slots and table games. I like that the video poker machines allow you to split aces or double down. There are some casinos that don't offer this type of play. This is where the locals go to play... I lost a ticket once and thought that it was lost. A half hour after I reported it missing the manager tracked me down at another machine and paid me for my lost ticket that wasn't cashed in. That was quite a surprise! 3.

GOOD: rooms are clean, fairly good sized although the toilet / shower area is small. price was reasonable for a vegas hotel. cost us $325 for 6 nites total, including taxes, fees and of course the dreaded DRF daily resort fee which is ONLY $3 per day at the Gold Coast. it has cheapest DRF of all the hotels that charge this fee. the average DRF is $15 and goes as high as $25 at some of the strip hotels. our room had only faint smell of cigarettes in it so wasnt too bad. The buffet at the GC is average, the price is decent. i think it was $6 for breakfast $13 for lunch and $16 for dinner. TIP#1 get the B-Connected card which is free to get at the GC and they knock a $1 off of every buffet meal PP so you save a few bucks with this card. breakfast was our favorite buffet meal. the omelet station is very good. other buffet highlights: the prime rib dinner buffet is very good. they have ice cream for dessert for lunch and dinner. nothing too fancy here at the buffets. we did eat here a lot as it was just convenient for us with all the other things we wanted to do in vegas. BAD: walls arent too thick so we were bothered by adjoining room on 2 nites with someone talking loudly. 2nd nite we complained and they sent security up to tell him to keep it down and we didnt hear a peep out of him after that. so props to the front desk and security for taking care of this so we could sleep. i know its vegas and all but its very annoying laying there listening to someone carry on about how great kobe bryant is for hours for 2nites. we stayed at sams town several years ago and we liked the buffet food and the size of the bathroom more then the GC. bottom line: if you want a cheap hotel that is 1 mile from the strip ( very convenient ) low DRF $3 with average buffet then the GC is right for you. would we stay here again. probably not as we will try a different hotel the next time just to see if we can get something better for around the same price. i was surprised at the very good reviews that this hotel got as i would not rate it as high as other people seemed to rate this hotel but then again i have only stayed at 2 hotels in vegas: sams town and the gold coast so this is my reference points to compare.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubuque, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cSurprisingly Nice- Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "paulobster", "ReviewID": "UR126270879", "Content": "We had played once at the Gold Coast and were pleasantly surprised to receive a generous offer for a room, food and free play.

Small front desk but no line up. This was my 3rd time staying at the Gold Coast (Jan '09, May '11, Nov '11), and I have never been disappointed.

The casino is laid out nicely, easy to navigate with lots of slots. The buffet I enjoy for breakfast and it is really cheap. TGIF is a decent place for even a late night eat as it is open 24 hours. I like the fact they have a free shuttle, you go to The Orleans first then to The Strip. Seems most of the people on it when you get on, are getting off at The Orleans. I believe 30 people can only fit so make sure you are there early. Coming back you may not get on as the dop off/pick up beside Bill's Gamblin Hall gets quite the line up. Sometimes I will take the bus back, or maybe walk in the day. The Rio and Palms are right next door and across the street so if you are more for gambling, you really have no need to go to The Strip. As well with all 3 properties, lots to choose from to eat. Best thing is, the walk to and from your oom is not like the mega resorts where you need a golf cart. Easy short walk. The staff are terrific at GC, always pleasant and helpful. I am looking forward to my next stay for the Memorial Day weekend.

After unpacking I took a shower and even though the decor reminded me of a track home built in the late 50's the shower head rocked!!! I weak stream of water is one thing I hate. This stream was right on, easily able to loosen up the old neck. Location, location! This hotel houses one of the best low limit blackjack scenes around! I easily found a seat on a $5 dollar table. The hotel also houses one of the best Chinese food places in Vegas! I had a noodle dish, tender beef dish and hot and sour soup. Perfect to mix with the beers I had been drinking. The hotel is also across from the Palms Hotel with a great movie theaters. When I woke up I went across the street and watch two movies to pass the day before heading out to the airport. Sure, the room wasn't glamorous but I do think I got a little more than what I paid for.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cFine if you have limited choices\u201d", "Author": "mizdiz517", "ReviewID": "UR124185543", "Content": "This was my first time staying at the Gold Coast after having stayed at the other Boyd properties in Las Vegas so I will be comparing this stay to those places (i.e. Orleans, Sams Town) rather than comparing GC to the mega strip hotels. Front Desk personnel were very friendly (although my guy was still training so check in took longer than necessary) and amenable to my complimentary upgrade request. We ended up in a Premium King room rather than deluxe or standard which I highly recommend since these have been renovated with newer furnishings and carpeting. The room itself is pretty basic, (no fridge, no safe) with a nice flat screen tv and the standard hard flat pillows that are common to all Boyd properties. The linens are decent but you may want to request an extra blanket since there isn't one in the room. BEWARE::::rooms at the ends of the hall don't get HOT water (someone else wrote something about that here but I had forgotten about it until I got a room at the end of the hall and had to take a shower with tepid water. I moved the next day to a middle room on the 4th floor and the water was fine) Restaurants: Ping Pang Pong -- I tried this based on other positive TA reviews but it is not for me. I guess I just don't get the whole dim sum thing and none of the servers spoke much English so it was hard to figure out what they were trying to offer me. The concept is interesting with them rolling a bunch of carts around the restaurant, stopping at each table to offer food (even if the food is indescribable) but I would prefer to see a menu with food choices and prices. Noodle Exchange -- this is more of a traditional Asian restaurant with fairly good food and very good prices. We had the Bento box lunches more than once. Buffet -- the buffet does not have a lot to offer as far as choices, but the food here was also okay. If you are a big buffet fan, there are a lot better ones to choose from in town like the Rio which is within walking distance. If you don't want to leave the hotel, the buffet is fine but not a first choice. Red Zone Bar -- advertises things like wings, pizza, burgers but it turns out that they basically order the food for you from the snack bar at the bowling alley upstairs and then have someone run it down. Not that this is a bad thing, but it is snack bar food so don't expect anything elaborate. TGI Fridays -- is open 24 hours and the menu is the same here that you will find at any TGIF in this country. The breakfast, however, is especially good and very reasonably priced. We ate here every morning and tried pretty much everything they had to offer (eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc.) and it was all good. Java Vegas -- typical Starbucks wanna-be cafe with bakery items. Nothing outstanding to recommend here. There is no spa on the premises (sadly). The pool area was open even though it was too cold to swim but people did try the hot tub. It is a small area, no ambiance, and the pool is small as well. The 70 lane bowling alley is very nice for a family activity and it contains a small arcade. The casino is not too large but laid out very well with a good mix of slot and video poker machines. All of the table games are centrally located but they are right next to the sports book which is wide open so the area gets very noisy. The cocktail waitresses come around frequently so that is a big plus. Although there is really nothing wrong with this property, if you are looking for a nice off strip hotel with good payback on the machines and a good price for the rooms, you are probably better off choosing the Orleans.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cA decent off strip property worth a visit\u201d", "Author": "SecretAgentReview", "ReviewID": "UR124070916", "Content": "Ok, most of the reviews are fairly accurate. Hotels: The rooms are small as is typical of old vegas. I was in an upgraded room on the 8th floor. modern and clean, bad pillows (a pet peeve) good flatscreen TV. NOTE: if noise is a concern ask for a north facing room otherwise the south is in the direction of the casinos air conditioning system. The halls can be long so if thats a concern ask for something closer to the elevators. While it should be nice regardless, How much time will you be spending in the room The dreaded resort fee: if youve read my other reviews you know that resort fees pss me off. If you advertise a room at 50.00 that should be it ( plus tax of course) to be forced to pay a fee for standard hotel services OR other services youll never use is obscene and should be illegal. And things you need, i.e. internet. is usually ridiculously priced. How can you compare hotels rates when there may be a resort fee at one property and not at another. Who wants to search in detail to find if theres a resort fee when they advertise a fee which does not include it. Since its mandatory it should be part of the rate quote! whats next ..a bed fee?? Ive seen reviews of these types of properties where they mention Vdara, Venetian,Caesars, Bellagio. Thats absurd! You cant compare a 29.00 hotel with a 400.00 property Casino; large and with all the modern machines and table games. Can be VERY smoky however if find that the norm in most casinos. If you have a players card ( and you should) you can use it for discounts on food, liquor etc. The gift shop - liquor outlet is quire reasonable. Your card gets an additional 10% off the well priced booze. FOOD: The noodle bar has great lunch specials. The locally famous Ping Pang Pong is authentic asian food BEWARE: Its authentic asian food that asians eat, its NOT the american asian food such as Panda Express. It is fresh and expertly prepared. There is a 24 hour Friday's with breakfast lunch and dinner specials. They also accept Friday's coupons. OVERALL: A decent first time visit.

Typically my wfe and I stay on the strip but prefer to gamble at Gold Coast because the table minimums are low and they have a nice Bingo room which my wife enjoys playing at. Food at the buffet is good deal for the price and staff and dealers are helpful and friendly. So when we recieved a postcard from GC with a comped room offer, we decided to try it out. We figured we'd save time and cab fare by staying where we typically gamble. We also figured if room was terrible we would move to one of the aforementioned properties that we've stayed at before and liked. I thought the reviews on trip advisor were helpful and generally accurate, but I think the variability in reviews is a function of people's expectations vs. variations in room or service quality. I typically stay at the hotels listed above and 4/5 star properties when I travel on business (see my other reviews). While the Gold Coast hotel room we received was clean and quiet, we would not stay here again even if room was free. That doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend it to others. Gold Coast reminds me of a truck stop hotel - somewhere you'd stay on a long road trip when you're too tired to keep driving. Ok for a night but not a destination by any stretch of the imagination. Pros: clean, quiet, hallways no longer than any other large hotel in LV Cons: Very small room (think dorm room with a small bathroom), bathroom door is a sliding door that makes a lot of noise to open/close in the middle of the night, strange/dated decor (again, it's like your kid's dorm room full of hand-me-down stuff you no longer want in your house), flat panel TV was nothing special and had very poor reception, internet was $15/day.

It's not because the pool is small and poorly located. It's not because we had to wait to get the TV fixed or that the internet was not working properly. It's not even because we had to ask to be moved because we were directly over the nightclub and the boom boom boom of the bass prevented our sleep. It's because the front desk moved us with such reluctance and without apology for our inconvenience, and IT IS inconvenient to repack and drag your bags back down to the front desk. At this hotel there is quite a distance from room elevators to the front desk. You are also made to navigate through a vast expanse of slot machines. While it is only early evening here in Vegas, we've undergone a 3 hour time difference, so it is late for us and we're tired. The \"new\" room is further down the hall from the previous one, so it was quite a trek. The internet doesn't work there either. Oh well. We've got this hotels measure by now. Luckily there are plenty of other hotels. BTW - although this place was inexpensive, we have rebooked ( on Hotwire ) to a better, newer hotel on the strip, at a LOWER COST. No shuttle, no \"resort fee\". If you read my previous reviews you will see that I am a big believer in you get what you pay for. Unfortunately-sometimes, like at the Gold Coast, you get less. I would like to make it clear that in no way was our manner demanding or rude. We did not ask for an upgrade, but sort of expected it I guess, if truth be told. We've been upgraded for less cause. Beware of the lastest cash grab, \"resort fees\", an extra charge which hotels divulge very reluctantly. They say it is to cover shuttle service, pool, fitness room, etc. In other words, it's an extra fee to cover the costs for the amenities which were featured in the room cost when you booked the hotel, as included. What a rip. There are many hotels here who advertise that they do not charge this. My advice is to ask in advance, protest if they do and take your business elsewhere. At the Gold Coast it is $3.00, at Treasure Island it's $20.00! The consumer can make a difference.

Our mid December choice for five nights in Vegas became the Gold Coast even though sister property, The Orleans, was equally priced. Top marks went to reception for allowing us early check-in (10:55am) and then assigning a nice room on the 8th floor. We love smaller hotels like the Gold Coast with short corridors and rooms near the elevators. The room was well furnished with a comfortable bed, large flat screen television and a partial view of the Strip, but we wondered why the Gold Coast (and most other hotels) only provide one luggage stand when most rooms are occupied by two people. The bathroom was spacious but with shower only (no bathtub). We were travelling with the usual electronic equipment, computer and ipod, but found there was no safe in the room. We opened a safety depoist account at the Cashier's Cage to leave our valuables, which was a tiny bit of a hassle even though the agent was friendly and full of fun, but we had to leave our computer in the room. It was not a problem but in many places around the world where we have stayed there would have been. Large room safes would be a nice upgrade. We always love the Gold Coast buffets for selection, quality of food and price. We were not disappointed and enjoyed several breakfasts including made to order omlettes. Our friends visited Ping Pang Pong twice and raved about the delicious Asian food.

The dealers are fun and try to make losing as soft as possible. It is also NOT overrun by families with kids. It makes for a much better, more relaxing Vegas experience. The only negative thing I can say about the place relates to the lack of safes in the rooms. Because there was no safe in the room I went downstairs to the cashier's cage to put our cash in a safe deposit box. Normally I wouldn't have that large of an amount to be worried about, but this was our first stop on a 14 night Vegas stay. The process of getting a box is lengthy and requires a $100 deposit. I was told if I lost the key I would lose the deposit and be charged an additional $150 to drill out the box. That seemed excessive. When i closed the box three days later it again took 10 minutes and required several signatures. The process was much longer , complicated and expensive than any other place I've stayed.

I play at several Boyd houses and always feel at least I get a fair shot at winning something. I've played many times on the strip and for the most part didn't do nearly as well as the Boyd properties. I've paid for a few trips, and went home almost broke a few trips, but at least I had a good time and felt I did have a fair shot at a good win. The hotel rooms are always clean at the \"coast\" and comfortable with reasonable rates and pretty darn good comps offered even though as I said, I'm certainly not the \"whale\" player you need to be at the big strip hotels. Breakfast buffet is good, and you club card will offer a nice discount. Lunch and dinners are priced reasonably and always enough to fill you up for another round at the tables, or slots LOL.

Room Review (king size bed) - nothing special, comfortable for the price we paid ($38/night). - no duvet or comforter, just a couple blankets (a top sheet, a regular blanket and a polyester coverlet like the kind you might expect in an old hotel) - washroom was REALLY SMALL. The sink is actually just outside the toilet/shower/tub room. - there is only enough room for one person to stand infront of the toilet, so changing in the washroom is very tight - the tub/shower was old. In my parents room, the nob to release the plug for the drain actually got stuck and I had to use some muscle to open it up. - water pressure was weak and it was dark in the shower because the only light was above the toilet. - staff did a good job keeping the room clean Casino/Amenities: - the casino was nice. I don't gamble much but played a few slot machines and it was never packed to the point where I couldn't find a machine to play on. - there is live entertainment near the buffet - the buffet isn't spectacular but when you're just hungry and you're with a bunch of people, it was a great option for instant food. I believe it was around $14 for dinner. - there is a TGIFridays on the main floor near the exit to the pool, as well as a convenience store and Cafe - the pool & hot tub were okay. The pool isn't gigantic but it wasn't busy when we were there so we only had to share it with a few other people Again, this wasn't a fancy hotel but if you just want to get away and don't anticipate spending a lot of time in the hotel, then this would be a good option. This is also a good option if you have kids because it's a really relaxed environment and the hotel's smaller size (in comparison to other hotels on the strip) makes it easy to get your kids from the room to the pool to the buffet or to the car without really worrying about getting lost or separated.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "germany", "Title": "\u201cthe alternative choice\u201d", "Author": "joedi2", "ReviewID": "UR118045599", "Content": "i choose the goldcoast again for a short trip to vegas for presentation at unlv. located in the 2nd row of casinos/casino hotels the gold coast is within the focus of the us-people. my people (germans) or other european can not be seen so often. the room was booked directly using the hotel webside. i took the kingsize room for 37 dollar and the room was exactly as described. everything works well, looks fine etc. ------------------------- whats should be known from gold coast: - wifi is not inlcuded and must be booked additionally by using tv in situ. works nice, fast, and well. - breakfast is not included but can be arranged easily at the buffet in the casino. from the elevator to the casino, keep/turn right go to the ende of the casino. the all you can eat buffet cost 7.99 person (one dollar less when you have a gamers card (i never game, so ... no problem, i save more than one dollar by not gaming)). - the room with the view to the street can not be recommended especially not at the lower floors, they are located close to the ventilatio of the casino (at the 2nd floor). choose the rooms back with view to parking) - parking: use the parking place behind the hotel, here the employees are parking (> safer). - the personal was friendly. general comment: perfect place in vegas, easy access to I15, to flamingo (from where you can easily go to unlv parking area (eng. building).", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Keller, Texas", "Title": "\u201cRooms are very well kept and everyone is very friendly\u201d", "Author": "bossman0216", "ReviewID": "UR118034843", "Content": "Wife and I decided to stay at Gold Coast this trip.The service was great at not only the casino/hotel,but at all resturants we went to.Have a little something for everyone,even if you just want to go bowling.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamden, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel when you get tired of the \"Tourists\" on the Strip.\u201d", "Author": "mvmf1973", "ReviewID": "UR117865255", "Content": "My wife and I have been vacationing in Las Vegas since 1980.

The accomodations were fine. We booked a renovated room which, frankly, seemed better on the internet than in person. It was a fine room, but nothing special. Both my wife and I felt that the $$ value of the hotel was in line with physical plant. We used the fitness room repeatedly on our visit and we found it uncrowded with working equipment. The casino was fine. We passed on most of the restaurants but the coffee shop served Starbucks coffee and had nice breakfast items. All in all, a good value for the $$. We had two surprises that would make us think twice about booking here again, however. The first was on the second day. My wife and I returned to our room at about 5pm to find ourselves locked out of our room. I left my wife, alone and with bags of shopping, at the door to the room while I returned to the front desk. According to the desk personnel, we had been checked out automatically after a single night, even though our reservation was for 6 nights! Scary! The desk clerk offered to recheck us in, but at a high rate than I had reserved the original room at. I discussed the matter with him and I agreed to go get the printed copy of my original booked rates in order to have the rates adjusted. The important point I want other Tripadvisor customers to take from this is that it is good to print this out and have it if you need it. What was strange was that all of our things had not been touched, which surprised me given that we had been \"checked out\". The desk clerk insisted that we had been checked in for only 1 night, but I distinctly remember signing an electronic acknowledge for all six nights the day before. It made both my wife and I a bit nervous about our stay and the security of our room. The desk staff was polite and helpful, but not illuminating (regarding the problem) except to say that we had been checked out early, perhaps by mistake. It wasn't reassuring in the least. The second issue occured on the 4th night of our stay. We received a notice that the hotel would be under construction on our 5th and 6th days and that there would likely be noise from tile being removed in other suites. This was something of a \"last straw\", as we had planned to spend these days chilling out in the room and at the hotel. My wife and I are both readers and this would have been very disturbing.

We chose one of the new renovated rooms, they were very nice. Chic and moden, comfortable beds/pillows, nice TV and bathroom. We asked for a non-smoking room and when we opened the door, we could tell it had smokers in there, the bellman heard me say 'Phew it smells like smoke' and said I'll call down to the front desk to get you a new room and within 20 mins he was back up with a new key; we went right across the hall and it was great! Great Service! Most people do not like buffets but we had lunch there at the Port 'O Call each day, for $8 it is worth it! TGIF for dinner was great, as they have 24 Hour Happy hour, great deals on Apps. if you are not too hungry. Our 2 favorite hidden 'treasures' were Kates Korner for Ice Cream, there single scoop can feed to and reasonably priced, great little treat! And the huge 60 + lane bowling alley upstairs, which you can't hear while in the Casino (always a plus). They have a grave yard special $1 games, $1 Shoes, so we woke up early and went, nice and quiet! The only negative comment is the casino smells of smoke very bad. Almost all of the 'upscale' hotels seem to have air fresheners throughout the casino so you don't smell the smoke. This one you do and it started to bother me but what can you do.

A wise choice as the premium rooms were nicely updated, firm beds, 42 \u201c flat screen TV, coffee maker w/coffee (part of the reason for the $3.00 resort fee), however no in-room safe. The bathroom was a shower only, but hot water was abundant as was the counter tops (with a single sink). The only other small negative was the (1) one closet was part of the Entertainment Center and on the small side\u2026..seems really meant for one guest's wardrobe. A nice feature\u2026\u2026the windows (one at the rear of the room and one in the shower) actually opened. One funny note\u2026.leaving the Guest Elevators on our floor if you make a right at the hallway the Deluxe Rooms were located as noticed by the older hallway carpet. It almost like the Gold Coast split their Hotel in half\u2026..right side Ghetto and left side Suburbs. I must assume they simply ran out of financing for the right side for upgrading. Meals \u2013 We ate at TGIFs which actually food wise was better than my previous experiences at TGIFs around the country. They have 24-hour half-off appetizers menu and drinks\u2026.not a bad deal. We tried the Buffet for breakfast one morning\u2026.not very impressive. We did enjoy my made to order omelets\u2026.otherwise forgettable. Casino \u2013 Surprising the table games were packed Saturday and Sunday\u2026.half locals and half tourists is my guess. The off-strip Hotels (Rio, Gold Coast, Palms, etc.) received quite a few visitors in town for the World Series of Poker. I don\u2019t play slots, but based on my fellow travelers experiences they had fun.

Internet access is available but not free - at $12.99 for a 24 period it seems a bit high considering how much they must take downstairs. On a positive note, one of the girls on the desk did give us a free pass for a 24 hour period as we had booked this hotel through hotels.com and the site had not made that point clear (at the time of booking anyway), so that was a good plus for their helpfulness and understanding.

The \"deluxe\" room is the same size as the standard room but with the more modern decor - had I known this I would have opted not to do this. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. This is NOT a luxury resort -- but for the price (all our rooms were less than $40) this is great value. Rooms were clean as were the linens; you get LCD TVs with HBO and cable thrown in. No in-room refrigerator (I think you can pay an extra fee for one...check with the hotel), but overall we really liked our room. About the same size as a standard room at a Hilton in Los Angeles/Pasadena where we're from. Staff was courteous and friendly -- I asked about comps or upgrades (I had booked 4 rooms afterall) but was told they don't give out the discount coupon booklets anymore and the property was booked solid.... We were able to get late checkout without any problem though. We didn't eat at the buffet, but did eat at the on-site TGIF -- like any other TGIF -- good food at a good price. The happy hour special at the casino bar was a GREAT deal -- check this out if you want to have a few cocktails before dinner or starting your evening. Since istwas winter and cold out, the pool was not available; we didn't have time to check out the workout room (but in honesty, I didn't come to Vegas to work out!).

This was a GREAT choice for us as it was right across the street from the Palms and walking distance even in heels! Check in: When we first checked in we were given a standard room. Upon arriving and checking it out we noticed the sink was dirty and there were stains on the door. We called down to the front desk and they moved us to an upgraded room on the 9th floor that was more expensive on Orbitz, but they did this upgrade for free. This room was MUCH MUCH BETTER! After settling in we were all pretty hungry so we went downstairs to get some food. The food: Honestly? We are all late twenties and early thirties and LOVED That they had a TGIF in the hotel. We ate there just about everyday (sad but true and it was great!). They had great happy hour specials (altho the free drinks in the casino were just as great!) but the food was half off during certain times and that was a surprise. Gave us more money to gamble with! Casino: We actually won more at Gold Coast than we did at the Palms. I lost it all at the Palms haha. Bingo was fun! We were just looking for something to kill time and found out that they had bingo! Well let me tell you, we played often and although we never won, it was extremely relaxing and fun! Okay maybe not so relaxing but it was fun! The staff in Bingo is great and very helpful! Beds: The beds in the upgraded room were great! Showers were great! No doors on the showers, I thought that would be a problem but it wasn't. Look, the bottom line is, you pay for what you get and in my opinion we received more from this resort than we paid for. In economic times like these, this is a great place to stay if there's a concert at the Palms or you just want to get away from all the hustle and bustle of the strip. However they have a great shuttle that took us to the strip and we had a lovely dinner at Joe's Steakhouse! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! Swimming Pool: It was pretty decent. Nothing too fancy. Just enough to lay out and get some sun and go for a dip. Clean and decent. I recommend this hotel for people who are looking for a decent place at a cheap price and don't stay in the room much to care about the small things. Our room was cleaned daily and the staff was courteous. If we ever decide to take a quick trip to Vegas and are on a budget again we would totally stay here and be happy doing so.

I went on TripAdvisor and could have gotten about a $70 rate through them but I found a $34 rate at the Gold Coast which is right next to the Rio. There was an additonal mandatory $5 a night resort fee but I was aware of it because of another review on Trip Advisor. Since budget was a major consideration, I booked at teh Gold Coast. Arriving on a Monday about 12:15 the front desk staff seemed overloaded. There were 2 people behind the desk and a line all day long. Since I was a little pressed for time I checked my bag at the bell desk and went for the afternoon conference sessions. Coming back at 5:30, the desk was still a bit overloaded. But I got in line and waited about 10 minutes. Reservations were on file and away I went. My room was on the 3rd floor facing the back parking lot. The room was clean, the king sized bed comfortable. The bathroom was small and but very functional for what I need to do in there. There was a coffee maker which was helpful as I was still on Central time and woke up rested at 6AM Pacific. Sine I really did not want to go down for breakfast, I made coffee in the room to take care of my vicious caffeine habit. The food trucks and garbage trucks came in with a bit of noise right below, not bad, but I was up anyway. Location: The Gold Coast is off the strip, it is a 20 minute brisk walk to Caesar's Palace across the freeway. There is a sidewalk next to the Flamingo Road. There is a shuttle but it is infrequent and the line is long to get on it. With my conference at the Rio, I could walk there in 5 minutes to the side door of the Rio if I went up to the 2nd floor of the parking ramp and walked down the stair and jaywalked across a very wide street. There was not so much traffic on the very wide street and with a center median it felt safe to do. Food: The buffet is fairly marginal. There are lots of choices though and I easily found things to my liking. The first day, the prime rib was tough and tasted a bit old. The Wednesday prime rib was better, I think owing to the marketing campaign of free buffet for seniors in their club. The package I got on line included 2 free buffets so budget ruled over palate. The TGI Fridays open 24 hours is nice. I ended up eating evening meals there, I am a fan of the Jack Daniels burger. Plus they enforced the non-smoking very well in TGI Fridays which I also enjoyed. Don't go in there if you plan to smoke. I used the hot tub facility, temp was good, very few people using it. Some thought the 70's temp too low for the pool area. I am a Minnesotan and thought it just lovely. Communications: I hate paying for internet, it drives me crazy. I can go to a dumpy motel in the middle of Montana and get free wireless but go to a $200 night hotel in Chicago and they want to tack on an additional $18. Here it was an additional $15. Not worth it. I did need to print off my e-ticket for my return flight so I used one of the little internet kiosks with a printer attached set up just for that purpose spending $5.95 (I maybe could have gotten it for $5 at another kiosk). TV: The television worked fine, kind of a long delay in the on/off button, patience is needed. Checkout: I used the video checkout option on the television. Got to the last screen and I needed to get a receipt so I pressed the button to get a receipt emailed to me. The next screen told me to type in my address on the wireless keyboard. Wrong! There was no wireless keyboard. So I called the front desk who said no there are no wireless keyboards and happily printed one out that I could pick up at the front desk. That was fine.

Gold Coast is right across the street, maybe a 5 min walk and it's a whole lot cheaper than the Palms. It's also right next to Rio, also a 5 min walk. There's a lot to do right there with those three casinos and if you want to go to the strip Gold Coast runs a shuttle over to Bill's Gamblin' Hall every 20-25 min depending on traffic. It's on the same corner as Bally's and Bellagio. We took the shuttle over there and then walked the mile down to New York, New York to see Zumanity. I wouldn't want to walk it in the summer heat but it was a really nice night when we were there and the walk was quite nice. A cab shouldn't be to expensive if you don't want to walk, it's only a couple miles from Gold Coast to New York, New York and would be roughly the same to most any casino on the strip. We had plenty of time and thought a stroll down the strip would be nice. At Gold Coast we had a Deluxe King room and it was quite nice. Everything was in real good condition. It didn't look run down at all. The bed was very comfortable! The shower was awesome! No tub, big enough for two and one of those big rain shower heads. No crazy hot or cold water spurts that happen in some hotels. One other thing I liked is that the big casinos are like a maze and I tend to get lost but Gold Coast is small enough to find your way around easily. We aren't gamblers so I can't tell you much about the gaming. It looked the same as anywhere tho. The tables were pretty active. We did get pretty drunk one night. There's a quiet little bar at one end of the casino that has a pool table. We enjoyed playing pool with a group of Japanese business men till the place closed then we found our way down to the TGIFridays that's open 24 hours. We were there till about 4am and we had a great time. Negatives are few, the views from the rooms aren't great but I don't really care about that. The pool isn't much, it's pretty small but we didn't have much time to hang at the pool anyway. There was no one even at the pool when we went out for a swim so at least we had it all to ourselves such as it was. The buffet wasn't great either. We had free coupons for breakfast and dinner. The breakfast was pretty good. They had an omelete station where they would make anything you wanted fresh. The dinner was a little more depressing. For free it was ok but I wouldn't want to pay for it. We like TGIFriday's tho and Rio has a seafood buffet if you really want a buffet.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cpretty good\u201d", "Author": "fooditee", "ReviewID": "UR46283768", "Content": "it was pretty good for the price.

I got a great rate at hotels.com (they were having a 50% sale), even for a weekend. I think it was $138 for both nights, all total. Our check-out person was very nice.

The furnishings of the room were very nice and trendy, and the bathroom was large and spacious! The shower was more like a walk in shower as it had no door to close it, but it was cool. The lights in the room were minimal, an orange lamp by the desk, but the bedside lamps were powerful enough. There was a large flat screen tv, and we did the express check out through the tv. The hotel itself was great with lots of amenities, the pool was great, they had a number of restaurants in the hotel, and it was cool they had a bowling alley too. It was also convenient that they had shuttles to the strip every 15-30mins until 12midnight. To walk to the strip is doable because we did it.. but keep in mind you're walking over a freeway etcc so in high heels it could take a while (say 20mins). We ate at TGI Friday's and it was great, and they had breakfast until 4pm which made complete sense since this is vegas we're talking about. The hotel's casino was great!! Great atmosphere and we won so that's always going to make a good impression to anyone! The dealers were nice, their tables would start as low as $5 for blackjack which was great! They did not have any hot clubs or lounges but Rio and Palms were close or go to the strip for that and come back to Gold Coast after partying to hit the tables!

The buffet restaurants were very tasty...we did not eat at any of the other restaurants except for TGIF...it was average.

We did not like the smoke filled casino areas since we are quite sensitive to cigarette smoke. In the early mornings and afternoons there was much less smoke...the evenings were terribly smoky.

There was a 1/2 glass wall down by the shower head, but nothing to cover the rest of the shower. My best suggestion to you is to turn up the heat in the room, close the bathroom door (which slides closed) and don't open the door until you are done with your shower and have something on. Otherwise you will be cold as soon as you shut off the hot water in the shower. Make sure you have the bath mat on the floor, because the water will go all over the floor. Check in went well for me, but not for the others that were with me. The lady that checked me in was very nice, she offered me a cheaper room, and in exchange would give me a $15 food voucher for each day. When I said no, she was fine with it. But when my friends where checked in by someone else, and they turned down the offer the lady that was checking them got all upset and became very nasty with them. Check out was a little different, the day of checkout I was sick, I called down and asked for a late checkout. The lady that answered the phone didn't skip a beat, she said you have one extra hour, that is it. I came down at 1:00 p.m. and got in line to check out. It took over an hour to do so. They do not have just one area for checkout like most hotels in vegas. But all in all My trip was very good, and I would stay at the Gold Coast again.

Got a great Winter deal on their website, stay 3 nights get the 4th night free with $20 slot or table play and $20 restaurant credit. It was easy to reserve the room online. The deal was $25 a night but we \"upgraded\" to the newer, recently remodeled room for a whopping $32 a night. Honestly, we paid more for airfare from Seattle than we paid for the room. A great deal. LV is hurting for tourists, and they really want to encourage business. When we checked in, we were greeted by the woman who previous reviewers must have been referring to--the very business-like, bordering very closely to rude, barely smiling desk clerk. When I brought up the $20 slot play and restaurant credit, she didn't look up as she typed away at the keyboard and tried to act like she didn't know what I was referring to. She said that that was NOT noted on our reservation and that we were supposed to call the hotel directly and set that up at the time of reservation. We used the hotel online reservation system, and there was nothing that mentioned the need to call directly. That being said, she did give us the credit for both. I asked for the highest floor possible, since that's always the best way to avoid hearing street noise in any hotel. We got a room on the 9th floor and it was very clean except for there was some toilet paper in the toilet when we got there. The room itself was very clean and we tipped the maids accordingly. The towels are super cheap (thin) and the ice bucket is just a plastic bucket, both reminiscent of Motel 6. It's true that there isn't a comforter of any type on the bed, just a thin blanket underneath a sheet. I asked for a blanket at the front desk the next day and a warm, thick blanket was delivered promptly to the room, so don't hesitate to ask for one if you are cold. The shuttle to the Strip was very convenient and easy. For us, the big highlight of the hotel is the $1.25 hot dog stand by the sports betting area and the $1.00 bowling and $1.00 shoes, $1.00 domestic beer after Midnight in the in-casino bowling alley. Fun, cheap entertainment. Definitely geared towards older visitors (not 20-somethings), there's a \"$3.99 breakfast\" advertised on the marquee outside for TGIFridays, but if you go there, you have to mention it, because it's not on their regular menu. The breakfast buffet was ok, but not fabulous. The best part was the huge dessert area with cakes and pastries. Order the \"eggs your way\" and look for 2 different areas for bacon, one side was crispier than the other. There's also a Chinese restaurant that has dim sum and lunch specials, a Seattle's Best coffee place and an ice cream shop. Lost the $20 slot play credit fairly quickly. I can't say that their slots are any \"looser\" than anyplace else. The Star Wars game across the way at The Palms (run across the street for a slightly better lunch buffet) was fun (newer slots) and payed out pretty well. There seems to be a fair amount of advertising for this hotel as \"where the locals come to play\" and it's definitely not as \"blingy\" and huge and new as anything on the strip, but if you need an inexpensive, low-key place to stay in Las Vegas, stay here. We asked the Bell Clerk to reserve a rental car for us, and the company picked us up, the day after the biggest snow storm in LV in 30 years, and brought us back the next day after we returned the car. They also gave us the number of a shuttle that would take us to the airport for $8.00 each, which was a lot cheaper than the $30 taxi ride that we took to the hotel on Monday.

We arrived Friday around 7pm to check in. This is where our excitement turned to disappointment quickly. The lady who checked us in was very unfriendly and just greeted us with a \"CAN I HELP YOU?\" After checking us in she told us to sign the transaction. My bf asked how much was being charged to his account and she was very vague about it. He asked again and she snapped back an answer that didn't help us at all. We had to ask her two more times before being told our room required $100 security deposit plus a resort fee. On their website, they do not clearly state the 100 security. She then handed us an envelope with two hotel keys and said thank you. She did not even tell us how to redeem our free slot play or free food credit and didnt even tell us our room number or how to get to the hotel rooms! Our room was at the VERY end of the hall on the eighth floor...a pretty lengthy walk with no alternative elevators or stairs to use. There was room service dishes outside of our room as we got there and had to push it down the hall when it was STILL in front of our room 8 hours later! The room itself was small but nice. My bf and I enjoyed the window in the shower area that opened to get fresh air. The shower was chalky looking on the floor though so I wore my flip flops every time I showered. The walls are pretty thin, I could hear a drunk man 11 rooms down talking to his friend! I could also hear the people next to us but easily drowned them out with the tv. I really enjoyed the shampoos and conditioners though, and they stocked us generously with them. The bed was VERY comfortable (i wish there was a comforter though...it was only sheets) and the tv was a good size! All in all, it was an OK place to stay for 59 a night with free food credit and free slot play. The slots were pretty loose there though. We ended up profiting from the free slot play. However, if there were none of those incentives, I would have cancelled our stay and gone over to the new Station Hotel, Aliante in N.Las Vegas. Also, my bf and I are in our mid twenties and would definitely NOT recommend this hotel for travelers our age. We would also NOT recommend the buffet, Ports O Call. The food was cold, hard, and old.

They were able to get us into a premium room for the next 3 nights though. The standard rooms definitely need updating, but the premium rooms are awesome. We ate at the breakfast buffet all 4 mornings. It's an incredible bargain at 5.95 (which includes drink). The lunch buffet was a little dissapointing though, while the Friday night Seafood Buffet was very good. Ping Pang Pong was OK (kind of an eclectic menu), but the Noodle Exchange was very good. The shuttle service was outstanding. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a shuttle to the strip. They actually have 2 shuttles, 1 that runs back and from from Gold Coast to Bills on the Strip, and another that makes a loop to their sister property the Orleans, then Bills, then back to Gold Coast. Most black jack table games were $5, and most were double deck. Only 2 shoe 6-deck tables, and just a couple $25 tables. Slots were pretty loose. We ended up making money on the slots, and my brother's spouse won $250 on the Wheel of Fortune slots. Overall, this was a pleasant experience just off the strip.

The Gold Coast isn' t the high end glitz of the strip, but it did offer newly renovated rooms, great gambling and good food. The staff at the Gold Coast is among the most friendly I have experienced. Checking in was quick and painless. I was in a remodeled room. The rooms are modest in size, but tasteful and had large flat panel TV. The only negative was the scarcity of hot water, but this was not a big issue. There was an ice machine and vending machines nearby. The walk to the elevators was a short one. There was very minor construction noise, but only during the day. We ate breakfast at the Ports of Call buffet on more than one occassion. The food is good, albeit the standard fare at many Las Vegas buffets. If you have a players card, the breakfast is only about $9.00. I have to admit I was a little surprised at how inexpensive it was! Ping Pang Pong sounded so hilarious to us that we had to try it. As it turns out, the food at this restaurant is surprisingly good and quite authentic. The place was very busy for some great reasons. The gift shop at the east end of the hotel is a wonderful convenience. They have a great selection of alcohol. Beer, wine and liquor are available and at better prices than I can get at home! This is a great idea for having a drink and relaxing in your room without making a special trip to a liquor store. Gambling at he Gold Coast is much more affordable than the strip. There are the standard table games and a big variety of slots. Low table limits are easily found here. Some blackjack tables are as low as $5.00 per hand and there were two non-smoking tables available during our stay. Access to the strip is simple using the free shuttles that the hotel provides. These run about every 20 minutes and go to the strip or the Orleans. Cabs are easliy had and fares are very low to get to the strip.

I visit Las Vegas at least 3x a year and usually like to stay at the luxury resorts on the Strip or the Red Rock offstrip. But a Vegas resident friend called at the last minute with concert tickets, and she offered to arrange a comped room for me at the Gold Coast to lure me to join her for the concert. I had been to the Gold Coast casino and had eaten at one of their restaurants (now closed) a few times. I wasn't impressed. But I didn't want to pay for both last minute airfare and a pricey weekend rate at any of my usual haunts, so I decided to to suck it up and take the offer. After looking at some pics and reading the reviews here, I did ask if she could try to get me one of the redesigned \"premium\" rooms, which she did. There was a bit of a line at check-in and there were only two agents handling the lobby desk. Both were super-efficient and handled the four groups ahead of me in short order. Wait time was less than 5 minutes. The woman who checked me in was smiling and informative as well as quick. Kudos--this is rare in the Vegas resorts I have recently visited. Those high end hotel employees should take hospitality lessons from the Gold Coast front desk clerks. As promised I was given one of the \"new rooms\" on the 9th floor (odd number room in the x30 numbered wing) facing the Palms looking south down the strip. I did look out over the rooftop equipment, but at night it was a pretty view. The room is smaller than those at the newer Vegas properties. But I give big props to the premium room designer. It is apparent that the decor budget was meager, but he/she did a thoughtful job creating the illusion of space, and giving the room a peaceful, modern, feng shui feel. The carpet, window treatments (yes really), upholstery, wallpaper and furnishings are sleek and cool without being cold. Finishes on furniture and doors are dark wood on white walls with stainless steel accents. The elements of air, earth, fire and water and the balanced placement of furnishings and decoration create a serene feeling. There is a large LCD HDTV, an armoire with deep drawers and a small closet, a desk, sideboard, and two bedtables. While the materials and furniture are obviously economy brands, they are visually appealing. The bathroom that many complained about on this site has been cleverly redesigned to maximize space. A sliding panel serves as a door to the bathroom and sink area. The door that used to separate the sink area from the toilet and shower has been removed. A partially glassed - partially open shower has been installed in place of the old tub/shower combo. You can still open the little window to let out steam and let some fresh air in. There is adequate counter space, although the coffee pot tray takes up some of it. (Nice to have the coffeemaker, although it is one of those one cup deals.) The bed was comfortable. Instead of a bedspread, a blanket is encased between two white patterned sheets. Again an inexpensive practical design choice, but the simplicity worked with the room decor, and more sanitary than those scary hotel bedspreads we've all heard about. I think the mattress was new. The A/C is an old fashioned wall type unit controlled by a digital read thermostat, but it worked well, and I like a room colder than most can handle, so that is saying something in August in Vegas. Being in this room was pleasant and relaxing. I was by myself, and I wonder if I'd have been as comfortable if someone other than a close family member was sharing it with me. I think not. It is a small room even though it doesn't look it. There are some things I'd add or change: There is no full length mirror. There is no in-room safe, which caused me to decline housekeeping services since I had cash, jewelry and electronics. There is no in-room hotel guide showing the property's amenities, restaurants, lounges etc. and no room service. There are no usable electrical outlets by the desk or night tables. Both open outlets were on walls that required you to leave your phone recharging on the floor or the window sill above the AC. This is picky, but as nice as almost everything was in these sleek, modern new rooms, the plastic and styrofoam cups, the ugly old phone and the plastic dimestore wastebasket kind of stood out as Motel 6 cheap and cheesy. I enjoyed playing in the casino but it was disturbingly dead for a weekend. The breakfasts I had at the cafe on Saturday and the Sunday brunch buffet weren't too good, and dinner at the Cortez Room was disappointing--the food and service was substandard although the dining room is a nice atmosphere. The food at the Noodle Exchange was good. TGIFridays will open there soon and they do need something like that. With the exception of the staff at the Cortez, I found every other employee I came in contact with to be warm and friendly as well as efficient, including desk personnel, housekeeping (who gave me stuff even though I didn't have them clean the room), casino staff, cocktail servers, bartenders, restaurant waitstaff and security. I really enjoyed my short stay much to my surprise. While it doesn't pretend to be a luxury vacation destination, at the current rack rate of $100 a night on weekends, the \"premium\" rooms may be the best value I've seen in today's Las Vegas.

The GC is a fun casino for gambling, unlike the cold lifeless monoliths lining Las Vegas Blvd. So far as food, I advise everyone to try the Arriva at the GC which serves Italian fare, also the Cortez room steaks are half the price of those on the strip and just as good. The GC buffet is one of the best values in Vegas, get a players card and get a discount. The Monterey Room (their 24 hr. dinner) serves an early bird breakfast special which is dirt cheap. they also offer a $10.95 Texas T-bone special 24/7. You get a 20 oz.

Downtown hotels and the \"locals\" hotel/casinos in Vegas such as the Coast & Station properties are gaining in popularity among those who realize the strip has become a tourists trap.

What choice do you have if you think the games are \"tight\" and the food prices are too high at a certain strip property? Do you go next door? Hah! More then likely the hotel next door is owned by the same corporation. I can remember when the strip used to have great deals on rooms, gambling, and food, but no more. Unless you're willing to play dollar slots and $25 tables you don't get diddly for comps. The strip is over-priced and filled to capacity with \"20somethings\" who are willing to pay outrageous prices for meals and play at games and machines with terrible payback odds. I couldn't believe the number of suckers playing 6/5 blackjack and video poker with pay tables almost half what they used to be.

Also, as we were paying for our family of 6 adults we were budget concous and opted for the Gold Coast. Again, the reviews on the Gold Coast were fairly mixed, and we tended to have stuck to the Flamingo and Golden Nugget on all previous trips, as we knew what to expect at these hotels. So here is our take on the Gold Coast: Despite having booked and paid 7 months in advance, I did not get a smoking room as requested on arrival. But did get moved to a Strip View smoking room the following day. ROOMS: for the money paid, we had no complaints. Not as flash as the Flamingo, but clean and tidy. Large LCD TVs in every room was great. Room service was fast and cheap, and the food was great. Bathrooms were spotless but are basic and were in need of renovation. Good news - all rooms are being renovated during 2008 as part of a multi-million Dollar programme of refurbishment in the Sam Boyd chain of hotels. RESTAURANTS: we ate in the cafes and the steak house and I must admit the buffet breakfasts and the Sunday Brunch was equal to any other hotels on the Strip. 7 different food areas, covering: American; Chinese; Mexican; Italian; Meat carvery; Dessert/cakes. salad etc. Sunday Brunch is a must and many LV regulars still visit the Gold Coast for the $10 all-you-can-eat-buffet. Great carvery included. The Cortez Room (Steak house) was like stepping back in time to an old Wild West scene. Plush leather and well oiled wood tables. Lets hope they don't change the decor in this restaurant. The steaks were good value appx: $14-$16 for fillets and $10-12 for NY strip or ribeye. One of the best steaks I have had in Vegas.for the money. CASINO: This place is designed around gamblers or sports gamers. Big book hall and great selection of table games including their own versions of Texas Hold Em and Blackjack, both of which took some getting use to, but enjoyable once you cottoned on to the game. Roulette was as low as $3 min (e.g. 3 x \u00a31 dollar chips min.) or there were other higher table stakes e.g. $5 & $10. Cocktail waitresses were really quick and for the first time I can recall, I had never managed to finish a drink before she came back for more orders, even during the busiest periods. Lots of 1, 5 & 25 cent machines, so event the reluctant gambler can have a flutter without worrying too much about spending too much :>) High Stake slots also available at $100 a hit, so something for everyone at their casino. Lots of 'linked up' slots with high jackpot games. I had some fantastic luck with some of the slots, and returned to them time and time again....my highest payout was $224 on a 25 cent machine. WEATHER: we were lucky with the weather and only one day we had to wear tops during the day as the wind chill was quite nippy. You definitely need a fleece at night if you are out and about. Still warm in direct sunlight, but chilly in the shade during the day. TRANSPORT: ever changing in Vegas, the transport system remains hit n' miss. Best bet is to buy a day VEGAS.COM trolly/monorail ticket for $10, which gives you unlimited transportation up and down the strip as well as the malls. But the regularity of the buses/trollies leaves a lot to be desired. We ended up renting a car 2007 NYE PARTY: Based on previous reviews of the strip on NYE, we decided to eat at the Gold Goast and purchased tickets for their 2007 NYE Gala Show. We were a bit desperate to ensure we managed to buy tickets for the Gold Coast, but the tickets did not go on sale until Dec, but Teresa in the back office kindly reserved our tickets ahead of the public offering - so great service from staff. For $99 a head, we got an open bar all night, seafood bar (oysters & giant shrimp, crayfish etc) a continious buffet including carvery, sweets that were out of this world, giant chocolate fountain, free champagne, party favours etc, but best of all was the Rat Pack playing. The Rat Pack cost $135 if you were to buy a ticket to see them at their normal venue, so this package was real value for money. They had set up 2 giant screens in the ballroom, but we opted to go outside to the rooftop area of the Gold Coast car park to watch the firework display and bring in the New Year, and taking all our drinks outside to toast in the NY was not a problem. The fireworks was spectacular, and the only downside was that 2 sets of displays were hidden from view by the Rio Hotel, but we still managed to eyeball all the others on the strip. I wore my full highland kilt outfit and this was well recieved by all Americans (and Scots) during the night, but a number of people did ask 'where are you from?' and my reply after the hundredth time was usually China. Would we stay at the Gold Coast again? The pool is quite small and the deck area restricted, so as we are pool lovers, I wouldn't stay at the Gold Coast during a high summer break, but definitely out of season and definitely at Xmas & NYE. I believe that Vegas gives you what you pay for - therefore, if you want a quality budget holiday then Gold Coast & Orelans or Sam's Town is ideal. If you want more up market, then aim for Flamingo, Golden Nugget or top end, the Bellagio, MGM or NY NY.", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGold Coast Hotel not that Golden\u201d", "Author": "Globetrotter806", "ReviewID": "UR12386584", "Content": "Booking problems at Travelocity: We booked our vacation on-line through Travelocity.

We wanted to file a complaint, but the agent refused to give us a phone number. She provided an email address for us to file the complaint but it turned out to be unregistered. Hotel: Gold Coast hotel was clean and had good facilities for people with diability. The bed was too soft and it felt like the mattress was wrapped in plastic. It was also noisy when you moved at all on the bed. The shuttle that runs between the hotel and the strip requires a wait of about 30 mins. Grayline Airport Shuttle Service: We also booked this on Travelocity ($5 per person each way). This is a highly unreliable service. The shuttle failed to pick us up at the hotel on our last day. We called them and they claimed that they had come by but left after 5 mins because we weren't there. They considered this a \"no-show\" and as such, would not come by again. This was not possible as we were waiting at the pickup location for 40 minutes. We asked to speak to another agent, but during the transfer, they hung up on us. Our impression is that this happens quite frequently. During our wait for the shuttle, we were told several times by taxi drivers that the shuttle would not come. Of course, at first we were sceptical because the taxis were ompeting for business but in the end, their prediction was true.

The front desk supervisor (Jane Willey??) took a look at us and without us asking, upgraded us to a suite for our four night stay! Thanks!!! 2. The Room - Okay...Needless to say -the suite was nice. Lots of room - clean - and a decent view of the city. Two bedrooms and a couple of TV's were also nice too! 3. Gambling was good. This was an off strip property and we noticed lots more people here gambling than at the strip hotels. Low limit table games and after a bit of time we found the low denomination slot games that gave us lots of action 4. The food - Ping Pang Pong - Authentic Chinese. Perhaps a little too authentic for those of us not immersed in the culture and food. Ports of Call Buffet - Decent food - good price - what else do you want? Monterey Room - Good coffee shop withs solid, middle of the road food for good prices. 5. Convenience The Palms and The Rio are adjacent to this hotel and an easy enough walk. There are also free shuttles to the strip and to the Orleans. We found good gaming at The Orleans and it looks like a good property that might be worth staying at. 6.

There was even a small 15\" TV in the kitchenette. I loved that little window in the shower. I could see the Rio and Treasure Island when I opened the window while I showered.

We found it to be exactly what we wanted which was most importantly a clean hotel and for the most part quiet. We arrived late so we didn't get a room with a view but we did get a handicap room so it probably worked out to our advantage because the bathroom had a walk in shower and plenty of room for two to move around in. We only looked out our window once when I heard the employees taking their smoke break outside and a truck backing up early in the morning to deliver supplies. The a/c was very loud for me because it turned on and off several times during the night. So in order to solve that problem we kept the a/c on very high during the daytime when we weren't there so that the room would be plenty cool when we got back in to sleep so we could turn the a/c off. (I hated wasting energy but I had to sleep) The slot games in the casino were fine and we won a few times but in the end we probably broke even. We did make up for it though in comps because it was my husband's birthday and we received extra comps for him so we had a free breakfast one day in the buffet area. I would have like to have seen the buffet area with a little more variety especially since we didn't want to waste time eating somewhere else for breakfast. We had a rental car and found it very easy to get from the airport to the hotel. We did have a GPS system but the self parking was never full and we always were able to get close to the entrance door. The hotel was directly across from The Rio and very close to The Palms. I felt safe enough walking with my husband but I would not walk alone to either of the hotels because there were a few strange men walking around alone. PROS: of the Hotel: Clean, great value, nice to come back to after a long day on the strip. My husband loved the flat screen tv in the bedroom! That really helped to update the room. CONS: There is not a lot of non smoking areas in the casino. The ventilation is not great so if you are surrounded by smokers you will probably be forced to move! At the cash cage they would not take back my change. I thought that was ludicrous since I won most of the change in their casino! I didn't want to go back on the airplane with 5 lbs of change! We wanted to take the shuttle to the strip one day and the valet guys were rude to us when we asked them where do we pick the shuttle up and when does it come by? They shrugged their shoulders and said we could pick it up somewhere around the corner and they didn't know when it left last but that it may come every half hour. I would think that they could have a two way walkie talkie to find out where the shuttle is especially since we ran around the corner and saw it leaving. If the valet or front desk had the correct information they could have asked the shuttle to wait a second since we were trying to flag it down! So we ended up taking our rental car anyway!

If glowing, it's probably written by a person, like me, who thinks that all you really need in Vegas is a comfortable room to serve as a base to go gaming and/or casino-hopping. The GC is quite the value in this regard, offering clean and reasonably spacious rooms with good (plasma) TVs, comfy beds, nice but far from ostentatious baths and good climate control (in our experience). If you're looking, on the other hand, for Glitzorama-to-the-Max dancing fountains and fireworks and neat, clean Wynn/Bellagio-like \"sterilized fantasy Vegas,\" the GC is very clearly NOT for you and I fully recommend you go find a place that has pirates shooting exploding chocolate cannons in the lobby at laser-created dragons and the $250-per-night pricetag to match. We learned about GC on a trip to Vegas a number of years ago, after spending more than our fair share of time (and money) in fancy strip hotels that got just a wee bit old after about the 2nd or 3rd trip. My English wife, addicted to her English bingo (even in her 30s!), wanted a decent casino that ALSO offered bingo games-- and among places on-or-close to the Strip, that meant GC or the New Frontier (further out-- Arizona Charlie's, which wasn't a bad bingo room, just a little hard to get to and admittedly a dingier \"locals\" sort of hangout). Well, we played once at the New Frontier, and all I can say is that there's a reason we didn't go back to either the bingo OR the casino <grin>. The GC, on the other hand, struck us as being a nice place-- far, far from \"Vegas Spectacle\" to be sure, but that's part of the charm of the place.... everyone who wants the glitz stays away, up on the strip, meaning Gold Coast's casino is actually usually navigable even at peak gaming times in the early evening! Anyway, we enjoyed our \"reconnaissance trip\" to GC and its sister property the Orleans so much, we decided to try staying there last year when we wanted to go back to Vegas for a quick holiday. Bottom line: although very clearly you have to enter the place with your expectations of the \"Vegas experience\" very much in reasonable line with what the GC is, it is nevertheless a good, well-managed and reasonably spacious casino with a good selection of games (slots and table), decent dining experiences, respectable but not overwhelming shopping and location and rooms that... well... are just that... they're places to crash in relative comfort that are far from \"Motel 6,\" but very clearly are not the Presidential Suite at the Venetian (actually, by comparison, I can't say our last room at NYNY or Mirage was all that much more impressive, except the Strip views were a little better... but then again, the Strip NOISE was ominpresent as well). Games-- as noted above, good selection and good prices, particularly the $5 minimums on some table games like roulette. Waitress service is good for the most part, and the bingo room is very well run. If you don't want to gamble, go bowling in their bowling lanes just for chuckles... another unique feature of the GC! Food-- we've come to appreciate the 24-hour T-bone special in the Monterey Room, and the Cortez Room isn't bad either. For the money AND the selection, Ports of Call Buffet is probably one of the more underrated hotel buffets in Vegas. Hot dog vendors in the sports book during the daytime are nice; ice cream and coffee shops are perfectly adequate. Shows-- we didn't come for the shows, so no comment. I wasn't going to spend money on \"Forever Plaid,\" though some locals appeared to have liked it when it was running. Nice to be someplace where you're not bombarded with Cirque du Solieil posters, at least. Rooms-- see above. I'm the last person who'd tell you to stay in an absolute armpit just to save money; the really nice thing about the GC is that FOR the money they charge (well, up to about $79/89 per night... anything over that, and I'd think again. For their usual off-season $58ish, they're a steal), you get an awfully nice room with comfy furnishings and a plasma TV. It'd be nice if they ran more specials around major holidays, to be sure. Clientele-- probably a little older and *slightly* more foreign in my experience than the average Strip hotel. If you're desperate to play in the \"pickup scene,\" the GC probably isn't your #1 choice of properties-- the Palms is just across the street for vapid, hip dancing-and-drinking. On the other hand, you also don't USUALLY (with minor exception) have obnoxious 20-somethings who're overly impressed with themselves preening, primping and drinking 'til they puke and then passing out over the tables at the GC, which is definitely a major PLUS in my book. Interesting mix of locals and visitors; traditionally, GC had a good rep as a \"locals\" hangout, though I think under Boyd Gaming the last few years, word has gotten out that it's a value-for-money kind of place for turistas as well. As such, I think it's something of a hybrid these days. Payouts/Comps-- As best I can tell, slots payouts are about average to slightly above-average for major Vegas properties. You just have to find the right machines... and pray. Comps are the one area where I have to take GC to task-- they're pretty stingy for Vegas in my experience, and even stingier when you think about it being an off-strip hotel. I blew a considerable chunk of change there and had trouble negotiating a few freebies in the way of food; at some of the MGM properties, I know for a fact they would have comped a few meals AND a room night or two for what I spent there. We're going back to GC during a major upcoming holiday later in the year, so we'll see if they've done anything to improve in this regard. :) Area-- oh, heck, it's fine. You're next to both the Rio and the Palms, and with a little imagination, you can probably be content in the GC itself. If you're worried, though, rent a car and you can cruise the entire Strip and outlying areas easily from the hotel's access to LV Blvd. and the Interstate. We did both and the car made it easy. You're also a little closer to a grocery store just down the road where you can buy REASONABLY priced soft drinks and treats for the rest of your stay. :D In summary, I would recommend Gold Coast to everyone who just wants a decent, enjoyable, relatively hassle-free gaming experience away from the loud obnoxious turista-babies that make the Strip casinos generally less desirable (and jam-packed). All of your favorite games are there, and the place is in a respectable state of repair, as is the hotel. It'll occasionally show signs of its age and ask you to forgive it, and admittedly the air in places smells less like \"Mandalay Bay Vanilla\" and more like \"real life combination of people's cologne and Marlboro Lights\" (chuckle). If you're willing to do that, however, you'll be rewarded with a good Vegas experience for a cost-effective amount of money at Gold Coast.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place!\u201d", "Author": "bellitasdad", "ReviewID": "UR8822595", "Content": "We stayed here from 9-14-9-16 .

I stayed aug 6-0 and paid 24 a night with 2 nights free and 2 free buffet breakfasts. 12 dollars a night, lol how can that be, but it was. I read reviews so i thought it would be just ok \\, clean and maybe a bit warn with a few gross people here and there. I was surprised. When checking in the girl was not over friendly but was ok. I asked for a quiet room and she did try to help. The hotel i believe is 10 stories better than 30-40 in some of the new ones. I walked into the room and it was just as it looked on trip advisor and the reviews. The room is small like my bedroom back home probably with a small sitting area. The furniture is not real wood but more on the cheap side. The bathroom area small like other have mentioned. But one big thing, it was clean, very very clean. I actually felt i could walk around barefoot it looked that clean. I always spray with lysol when i arrive at a hotel but I didn\u2019t even feel like i had too. So for my trip advisor readers i cheked into cleanliness more. I wet a wash cloth and wiped onto of door ledges, tables, table sides, window ledges, door handles, etc and the rag showed very very little dirt. I ws amazed, never in any hotel is that happened. The bed was very nice, I\u2019m glad they don\u2019t use comforters rather they use sheets to cove blankets. Much cleaner, i think! I got in late each night so the room was quiet, but during day i could hear some noise in other rooms but not really bad. I give up on finding a totally quiet room that\u2019s why I hate staying in hotels, the noise. But this was pretty good. The ac worked perfect, the tv was nice flat screen and had a few more channels than the strip hotels i stayed at. I wish they all would improve on this in Vegas, sometimes its just nice to watch a tv show before going to bed! Overall i liked my room i felt pretty nice and clean in it. Toiletries were nice, shower pressure fantastic and internet lightening fast (11.00 per day) The casino was very clean nice staff and always someone around to help. Lets of regulars but not nasty bad people type. I was disappointed it was packed with mostly penny machines. Very very few dollars, i think they could have improved this. But it seemed many of the casinos have done this. The buffet for breakfast was like Orleans I thought it was good nice waffles and good pancakes. I'm crazing them right now. Something for everyone Dinner was good to it was clean food ok. I like just regular American food so its great for me. If you are looking for more stations, and different things its not for you. I just look for clean basic buffet that tastes good and feels clean (and i do look too!) It was nice for my tastes, I got comped but if I had to pay I would the prices were great. From midnight till 6 am I think they have a breakfast in the coffee shop for 2.25, yes thats right 2.25 -pancakes and bacon or 2 eggs hash browns, bacon and toast. It was very good and the price was like old Vegas. Gambling was ok in casino i won a couple jackpots on pennies playing max. I lost too, lets be honest its always what happens if ya wanna play a long time. Pool was small, not many people looked clean After gambling they comped my cheap room and also got me another room and comped me Friday night also (i was gonna stay with friends in another hotel for last night) Final review Nice very clean room, smaller (not tiny) casino is but spotless.

We stayed for five nights starting on Sunday, June 3rd, 2007 at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino. I originally booked the room at $55 a night, but found a better deal on another web site. I phoned the Gold Coast to see if they would match it, and it was no problem and they dropped the price to $50 a night. I then found an even better deal that included two free breakfast buffets and two free dinner buffets for $50 a night. I used a promo code that I found on the Internet and changed my reservation. No only did they give me the four free buffets upon arrival (I did have to refresh their memory), they gave me four more! What a deal! When I made the reservation, I requested a nice quiet room on a high floor away from the elevator. They respected my wishes and we had Room 857 on the eighth floor (out of ten) quite a distance from the elevator. We were about halfway down the very long hall, so I felt sorry for anyone who was staying even further down! We had a bit of trouble with the keycard trying to get into the room, but when we managed to finally get in, we found a medium-sized non-smoking room with two double beds, a clock radio, two regular chairs with a table, a large LCD (limited channel) television with remote, a coffeemaker, and an iron/ironing board. The bathroom consisted of two separate areas. One part had the closet with hangers and the sink with mirror, while the shower and toilet were located in the smallest bathroom I had ever seen! I\u2019m 5-9 175 lbs, and even I found the bathroom to be claustrophobic and hard to move around in! There were four sets of towels, some shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and a shower cap. The shower did have a handle to hold on to, and in lieu of a bathroom fan, there was a small window that overlooked some new construction at the Palms Hotel and Casino. Both the sleeping area and the bathroom were spotless and were cleaned every day. The cleaning staff was very friendly and helpful, and when we had a problem with the bathroom light, they got it fixed right away! However, despite finding the room very comfortable, we did have a few problems (other than the tiny bathroom). We found that the lighting in the bathroom was very poor, so if you took a shower at night, the shower curtain blocked the light and you were basically washing in the dark (the window is helpful for some light during the day). We also found the beds were a bit too high, as my mother had a very hard time trying to get in and out. We also found that the hotel does not have central air, and each room has it\u2019s own air conditioning unit. The unit in our room was extremely noisy, especially when it started up. I had to set it so that it would run all the time, otherwise we would have been startled each time it turned on. We also found the HDTV to be a bit hard to get used to, as some of the stations were not HDTV compatible, so the shows appeared a bit weird. Also, when the television was turned on, the volume automatically started quite loud. Not too bad during the day, but at three in the morning, it would not have been appreciated by the people in the next room. The room doors also slammed shut, but it was not too bad. During evening hours, you had to show your room key to a security guard in order to get to your room. However, during most other times, anyone could go up to the rooms, which sort of defeated the purpose of having security at all. We found the casino area to be very large, with lots of room to move around in. Quite a cross-section of society gamble at the Gold Coast, both young and old, which made us feel very comfortable. There were lots of slot and video poker machines, as well as an entire section devoted to table games, and another section for sports betting. You can play bingo upstairs, and you can bowl a few games if you want at the bowling alley. We ate breakfast every morning (except the day we left) at the Ports O\u2019Call Buffet, which is a great value at $6.95 plus tax. It has very basic food choices, but it is all fresh and very delicious, with made-to-order omelets, fresh fruit, crepes, blueberry pancakes, breakfast burritos, and even some tasty pastries. We also had the dinner buffet twice, once for steak night and once for seafood night. I really enjoyed steak night, as when I asked for mine well done, that is what I got, and it was fantastic (unlike the steak night at the Fremont). As for Seafood night, there were tons of crab legs (mostly chilled but some cooked), but not much of anything else. We ended up eating lots of popcorn shrimp, which wasn\u2019t too bad. Both nights also had the basic standard buffet items, but all were fresh and definitely very good. We also had the graveyard special at the Monterey Room the morning we left, and that was a complete disaster. While my mother could at least eat her breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausages, hash browns and toast, my scrambled eggs were runny, my hash browns were burned to a crisp, and my huge ham-steak was almost completely black. I never like to waste food as I always think of the starving people in Africa, but in this case I think even they would forgive me\u2026. I did manage to eat the toast and not much else\u2026 We also received two coupon books full of offers. The only two we took advantage of was receiving a free souvenir pack of used casino playing cards at the Gift Shop and a free (large) scoop of delicious ice cream from Katie\u2019s Korner Ice Cream Parlor (yum)! The Gold Coast is located west of The Strip on Flamingo Road, across the street from both the Rio and the Palms. I walked briskly to Las Vegas Boulevard from my hotel room and it took about thirty minutes. It would probably take slower walkers about forty-five minutes to an hour to do the same, so I would recommend taking the free shuttle to The Strip, which stops out front. If you decide to stay at the Gold Coast, I have a few tips for you. Park on the second floor of the parking garage on the Rio side. You will be close to the hotel check-in and your car will stay cool from the summer sun. Also, for some strange reason the hotel rooms start on Floor 1 and not Floor 2. This is very confusing, as you think Floor 1 is the casino floor, but that is Floor L for Lobby. Don\u2019t make the same mistake as I and other guests did, it\u2019s a long wait for the elevator to arrive again! Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Gold Coast. The staff was very friendly, the room was very comfortable and clean, and the food at the buffet was very good. The casino had lots of different slot machines for both my mother and I to play. While we didn\u2019t win, we found the machines would give you quite a bit of play for your money (unlike the casinos on The Strip), so we liked that. I also liked the fact that I could play 9/6 Jacks or Better, which is a scarce commodity anywhere in Las Vegas now. Our stay wasn\u2019t perfect though, with the loud air conditioner, high beds, and absolutely tiny bathroom.

We needed a refrigerator for medication and it was brought very quickly, and when the a/c went out they sent someone up within 20 minutes to check it out. The customer service was exceptional at this hotel. The negatives: The mattress was one of those memory foam ones, and we just couldn't get used to it. We like more support than those give, but again the price of the room made up for that. The bathroom was super tiny, you had to lean against the tub to close the door to do your business. The color in the bathroom (mud brown) was kind of depressing too(but the water pressure was good). The a/c was very very noisy and worked erratically until they sent someone up to check it out. After they changed the absolutely filthy filter, and adjusted the thermostat it kept the room cooler, but it was still super noisy.

The room was kept extremely clean and the housekeeping service was above-average. Yes, the bathrooms are small. No, the rooms are not fancy. Noise from the hall and adjoining rooms was a minor problem at times, but nothing that ruined my stay or would keep me from returning.

The sportsbook is also very impressive and gets very busy by mid-morning. The pool is very small, but pretty quiet mid-day. Not a great atmosphere if you like to lay out by the pool in Las Vegas. As for restaurants, the buffet and the Monterey Room are average; however, the Cortez Room is a great steak place with ridiculously low prices. A must try whether you stay at the Gold Coast or not. For the person who said there was too much white trash at the Gold Coast: As a 30-something male, I think you would probably have more of a chance of having a negative encounter with the 20-something males across the street at the Palms who have something to prove than you would with the slightly older crowd you will see at the Gold Coast. With that said, I would not characterize anyone I saw at the Gold Coast as white trash. You will be hard-pressed to find a better bargain for a place with so much to offer that is within a 5 minute cab or shuttle ride from the mid-Strip and a short walk to the Rio or the Palms. I would not recommend staying here or anywhere off-Strip for your first trip to Las Vegas, nor would I suggest the Gold Coast if you need to feel like you are in the middle of the action. If you want a place with a bit of a slower pace, stay at the Gold Coast!", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hotlando, FL", "Title": "\u201cClean Comfortable Room\u201d", "Author": "vegasvarment", "ReviewID": "UR7769068", "Content": "This is my second stay at the GC.

Nice southern strip view of mountains, Luxor and planes landing at the airport. Room was large, bathroom small as others have said, but it wasn't a big deal. Very clean, maid did a great job every day we were there. Great TV. WIndows opened which was a plus for this nonsmoker married to a smoker. Hotel does cater to an older crowd but us 40-somethings didn't find that to be a problem. We were there to relax and unwind and the big band/wedding singer type bands were great. 5 dollar BJ was always available. 9/6 JoB Video Poker was plentyful. Food was cheap and good. We had the steak buffet on Sunday night and it was the best steak from a buffet that we had ever had. Ice cream was awesome. Coupon book was excellent - free drinks, match play, ice cream, two for one specials. This isn't the place to stay if you want to lounge around the pool. It was very small, but not crowded. Shuttle to the strip was easy to use and left us at Bill's (formerly the Barbary Coast) which is right next to Bally's and across from the Bellagio! Great location mid strip. We also took the shuttle to sister property Orleans. Wish they had a shuttle to Sam's Town or the Boyd properties downtown. Here was the only problem. At checkout, I first went to check and see if I earned any comps and the Gold Coast Club lady said yes and that I could have it applied to my room charges. Then went to the front desk and they said no, I couldn't. I said I had just been to the comps desk and they said yes I could. She phoned to check and 25 minutes later, all of it standing at the front desk, waiting for someone to confirm that I wasn't lying, I ended up back at the comps desk (very upset) so they could give me a voucher for cash. Apparently the \"card reader\" was down at the front desk. Why did it take 25 minutes for the front desk to realize this? Why the phone calls? Why did I have to go back to the comps desk for an explanation? This forced us to miss eating a sit down lunch before we went to the airport. I know this is minor and I had a GREAT stay, but it left me feeling bad. All in all, we will be back because it was a good hotel for a very modest price.

As soon as I walked into the lobby, I wondered what I'd let myself in for. The hotel is dated and could do with a complete refurbishment. Having said that, it was reasonably clean, which is very important to me. We had requested a smoking room via our travel agent but this hadn't been honoured. We asked to be moved but were told this couldn't be done until the next morning at the earliest, when a room might be vacated. Early the next morning, we went back to reception and were given a smoking room straight away. You have to show your room key to security at night to access the lifts but a couple of times I went to my room on my own and felt uneasy because the corridors are long, narrow and intimidating. Our room was a good size with two double beds, table and chairs and a coffee machine. (The coffee was disgusting so I'd recommend using the coffee shop downstairs in the hotel.) There was also a brand new flat screen TV on the wall, which looked completely out of place in the dated room. I don't know about anyone else but I would have preferred a more modern decor over a shiny new TV. Now the bizarre bathroom. This can't have been changed since the hotel opened in 1986. You have an open dressing area with a sink and mirror, and a clothes rail. This area offers no privacy, as there is no door and it's right by the window. Next to this there is a tiny bath/shower room with toilet. I practically had to stand in the bath to close the door. The bath was an odd beige moulded plastic unit from floor to ceiling (in the absence of tiles), with a beige toilet. It was clean but totally unappealing - there's definitely something to be said for a nice white bathroom suite. We had a good view of the Stratosphere, the Wynn and Circus Circus from our room but I know others face a brick wall. We didn't eat at the hotel because a) we chose to eat elsewhere while we were out and b) without going into detail, we'd heard stories from several people in our group which had put us off. Personally, I felt that two days in Las Vegas was long enough - I much preferred my stay in Los Angeles. For that reason, I don't think I'll return to Las Vegas in a hurry and if I did, I would not stay at the Gold Coast.

Although this hotel is not in the same league as Bellagio, Wynn hotel, Venicia, Bally's or all the major hotels it is much better than most of the others. The Gold Coast is situated a short walk away from The Rio and The Palms, it also has a free shuttle-bus to the Strip and drops off outside it's sister hotel The Orlean's. Having been inside all of the above named hotels, which are indeed very grand and luxurious; The Gold Coast has a more homely feel and not all the hustle and bustle of the others which are constantly hectic and busy with all sightseers. Agreed the Gold Coast does not have all the glitz and glamour of some of the big ones but there is plenty to do and caters for every type of gambler. The hotel has 24hr room service and all the restaurants within are very cheap. The Port O' Call buffet in particular was excellent value. The all you can eat breakfast costs just \u00a33.50 and is available from midnight to around midday. There is every choice of food imaginable. The other restaurants are fine also with a 14oz steak costing about \u00a35.00 with a free beer. The rooms are spacious with very cosy beds, our double bed was about 7ft wide. However, the bathrooms were not that great in comparision. The rooms did not have a safe or fridge but along every corridor is an ice machine which is free to guests. The swimming pool area is very nice and the hotel provides free sunbeds and towels. This area does not get busy as most of the guests are inside gambling, so there is always plenty of space around the pool which also has a jacuzzi next to it. All hotels in Vegas are open to the public and as long as your having a flutter, waitresses will supply you with comlimentary drinks. Always tip them at least one Dollar each time they bring the drinks and they will supply you free drinks all night. We went to seeThe Rat Pack show at the Greek Isles hotel and I have to say it was not the best \"Rat Pack\" show I have seen. They try to replicate the original show from \"The Sands\" and although word for word they have it mastered, the singers themselves are not that good. I've seen much better variations in England. If you get a taxi to Freemont (a must see) if only for the laser shows in the sky, this should cost no more than 16 Dollars. Be careful on the return journey and agree fare with driver as some of the hispanic taxi drivers try it on and drive the long way round the freeway or will sit in traffic with the meter ticking away. Visit the Ballagio hotel, you'll be amazed at how vast it is inside, They have a computerised water show at the front of the hotel which is in operation every 30 mins during the day and every 15 mins at night. It would be a shame not to see the Grand Canyon whilst in Vegas, and I can reccommend \"Kings Airlines\" who operate helicopter, aeroplane and bus tours. We paid approx. \u00a3140 each for an 80 minute flight in plane all over the Grand Canyon, which flys over The Hoover Dam and other sights along the way. This tour included a visit to the Hulapai Indian reservation with a meal included 4000 ft above the Colorado River. Brochures for this company can be found at the \"Bell desk\" in the foyer of the hotel. Getting back to the Hotel itself. Once you have been inside some of the other major hotels and seen just how busy they get you'll appreciate The Gold Coast Hotel.

This place doesnt belong in vegas, maybe Gary, IN or the Gaza Strip, dont they have some casino there? The room is similar in quality to a Comfort Inn or Days Inn except that it has a 27 inch LCD tv hanging on the wall. Other than that, the room furniture was totally crappy, the bed not particularly comfortable, the bathroom was split between the sink area and the shower area (hate that), and the closet had those crappy plastic hangars junky hotels use to keep you from stealing them, and one of them was broken. The drain in the bathroom sink was rusted, looked awful. The north facing room had a direct view of the south wall of the casino structure. pathetic. Hotel room had high speed wifi, but it was $11 for a 24 hour period. Hotel also had 24-hour room service, which was pretty good and brought me up a chicken sandwich and a 750 of vodka at about 3 in the morning. Took about 45 mins, not too bad, and the prices were totally reasonable. That was the best part of the place. The casino downstairs was pretty lousy- just one pit of table games, which were mostly single deck blackjack or some \"super-fun\" derivation i couldnt stand. Hotel had a shuttle to Bill's on the strip but it didnt start early enough one morning for me to use it, and other times I had to wait about 10 mins, not terrible. Kind of felt like those short schoolbuss' the special kids use, the rest of the passengers actually seemed like they belonged on there... regular cast members out of that 60s horror pic Night of the Living Dead. Latest check-out they would agree to was 1pm, nothing after, even when I offered to pay some fee, and they readily volunteered they werent sold out the next night, but that they dont give late check out, period. totally sucks.

French toast for $4, fine, I'll take it. half the place looked like it just escaped from a sanitarium, except that roving keno girl, she was a looker, kept giving me the eye too. too bad i dont know how to play these crazy asian numbers games.

We actually would have never considered staying there; however, after all the researches I've done on other hotels for this Cinco de Mayo, Kentucky Derby, and Oscar de la Hoya fight wknd, we had to give up and book Gold Coast instead. All other hotels on the Vegas strip were above $399, which we just could not afford, so we ended up booking Gold Coast for about $100 a night. When we first got to our hotel floor, we were actually quite excited for the fact that they put us in the first room closest to the elevator lobby. Not until the next morning, I found out that we were in the worst room possible. Right across the hallway, there was a Maintenance Staff room. We stayed at this hotel for 4 days 3 nights, and every single morning, starting between 7 - 8am, the housekeeping ladies would start their work. They kept going in and out, in and out of this Maintenance staff room, which had this heavy door banging closed everytime they walked in or out. Another problem was these ladies just would not keep their conversation down for nothing. Let me remind you that it was 7am. Everyone knows that if you're in Vegas, you probably don't go to sleep at night until the wee-hours, and no one will hardly wake up at 7am. These ladies were talking like they are in a very noisy flea market or something, and they didn't talk, they screamed at each other (in Spanish). This happened every single morning, and we couldn't get relocated to another room due to the crazy wknd it was. Nothing in the room was up to any standard, except the nice flat screen TV. The individual A/C unit was loud as hell when it's on. The two supposedly queen beds (feel more like a twin to me) were terrible. It felt like the springs in the mattress were near death. Also, the bathroom was terrible. I've never been in such a tiny bathroom ever in Las Vegas. I thought I went to Europe or something where they're famous for having smaller bathroom. It's America here, and it's Las Vegas... what happened? I guess there's definitely a great reason why all other hotels were charging $400, $500, or $600 a night, while Gold Coast was charging $100...

I can not write a positive review this time, quite the opposite. We were excited to get back to Vegas for our second visit, and to the Gold Coast, since we had such a pleasant experience last time. We booked the hotel a month in advance and requested a higher floor facing the street. Sure, said the booking agent. We got neither, the girl at the desk said it was because of a bowling convention that was staying there. I guess bowlers get preference? What we did get was a room on the 5th floor facing an ugly roof top that had no hot water the entire stay. When I complained the morning after we arrived about the cold water, I was told that it was because we were at the \"end of the hall\" and to \"let the water run.\" That night when getting ready for dinner we let the water run for 20 minutes and it never got beyond tepid. When I called to the office, I wasn't offered anything. We took tepid/ice cold showers the entire stay. Twice I called for the manager; twice I was told she was not in; twice I was told she'd call us promptly upon returning; and twice she did not have the courtesy to contact us as promised. She never did respond to our call. The package we were on, the Spring Getaway came with a 25$ dining credit that we were not able to use because the desk personnel didn't set up our account properly, which caused us embarassment in the restaurant twice when trying unsucessfully to use it. Both times we tried to use this credit, we were left standing in the front of the restaurant for 20 minutes while they were trying to \"verify\" the credit, calling the front desk which was 30 feet away, but who would not answer the phone. The buffet food was so-so, and the restaurant food was just okay. The dealers were mostly rude, the casino stinks terribly of cigarettes because it is old and has terrible ventilation. The pool is small and nothing to mention, really. The coupon book that they promise you may not be worth a million dollars, but it does have a coupon for a nice bottle of wine with dinner, an ice cream cone, free drink, etc. Nothing Earth shattering, but still we counted on getting it as it is on their website, and also because we got one last year and really liked it. This stay, however, we were told they were out of the coupon books but would be gettting new ones at the end of the week. We were leaving on Wednesday, we asked would they still honor the coupons? We were told basically, too bad, the coupon book is \"complimentary\" and is not guaranteed. This irked me. I wanted the free bottle of wine and ice cream cone :-) They could have definitely handled this better, not just to say that they'd have more at the end of the week when they knew we weren't going to be there. They could have given us a free cone and bottle as a gesture, but they chose not to, and that irked me. In the end, we got a 20$ credit off our room because of the cold water. I think I've taken more relaxing showers while camping, and the fact I had ice cold water in my room, was worth more than 20 bucks. But, whatever. I would not ever stay here again, which is a shame, because I've been speaking so highly of them for the past year to others.

My only complaint during my stay in January 2007 was this... they installed flat panel LCD televisions in all the rooms which I thought was pretty cool at first. The problem is that the TVs are early generation LCDs that actually have a pretty poor picture. Its not Hi Def television and the picture is noticibly poor.

Got a decent rate, given how expensive rooms were that week elsewhere. I took the free shuttle to Barbary Coast (very quick and convenient), then walked to CES at the Sands/Venetian. On day 2, I took the shuttle to BC and then went to the Flamingo to get the shuttle to the Convention Center. Some waiting, but the Strip and Convention Center were very congested and crowded. Did not spend any other time on the Strip. I mostly hung out a Gold Coast and walked over to Palms a couple of times. Talk about culture shock -- the Palms is all sleek, chrome, thumping music, etc. and the Gold Coast is about as staid as a casino can get. Palms clientele seems to be rich, or rich wannabe, LA types. Gold Coast mostly locals and older folks. I was much more comfortable at Gold Coast. Casino is kind of smoky. LOTS of video poker -- many more VP than slots, which is OK by me as I am a poker player only (live and video). I did not play any table games, but there was always $5 BJ and craps when I was there. Sports book very straightforward. Poker Room was a bit light on players -- sometimes hard to keep more than 6 people in a game -- but very friendly. Also, good comps for both poker players and VP players. Rooms very basic. I could never get the high speed internet conncetion to work, despite 3 phone calls and promises to \"check it out\". I never saw any evidence that anyone had checked it. That was my only complaint with staff or service. Configuration of rooms kind of odd -- the internet connection (which I could never use anyways so it didn't matter) was on the dresser across the room from the table/chairs. I don't know how they expect you to use your computer -- sitting on the floor, I guess. So I moved the furniture all around to suit me. The mattress was kind of soft but comfy. I also liked that there was a clean sheet on top of the bedclothes instead of a bedspread (you never know long since the bedspread was laundered). I always toss the bedspread on the floor anyway. Good water pressure in shower, and you can open a window in the bathroom for fresh air. I had no problems with noise from other rooms. The walk to your room from the elevator can be quite long. Good exercise, though. Never a long wait for the elevator the entire time. There is a security guard by the hotel elevators in the night-time hours. Buffet was just OK for breakfast. I did not eat there for any other meal. The coffee shop (Monterey ?) had good coffee shop food, good selection, and reasonable prices. It is all no-smoking which is good. The Oyster Bar was pretty good, too. Casino -- busy but not crowded. There was always room to maneuver. There are door with windows all along the front side of the hotel, so it was always easy to get oriented. I sometimes get lost or turned around in the huge casinos. I'm not a bowler, but I checked out the bowling alley and it was pretty impressive. It was too chilly for pool, so did not check that out. They also have a movie theater. Summary -- I have stayed at most of the \"medium priced\" hotels and a couple of higher priced ones over the past 10 years (Flamingo, Monte Carlo, Luxor, Sahara, Harrahs, Riviera, Frontier, MGM, Tropicana, Paris, Ballys, Treasure Island). I would rate the Gold Coast as the best value of all of these, except possibly for Ballys. No glamour, no glitz -- this is just a good, basic, straightforward, hotel and casino with all you need at a good price. Staff was very polite.

Not knowing what to expect, as this was our first stay at the facilty, we were pleasantly surprised and happy with our decision. If you are expecting facilities on par with say Ceasers Palace, or the Bellagio, this is not the place for you. However, our room was clean and recently remodeled, with a large flat screen tv on the wall. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. The only item in the room not remodeled was the bath area (shower and toilet). Although clean, it appears that these were original to the facilty. The pool area was very nice, but again it does not compare with some of the pool's of the hotel's on the strip. One nice amenity is the abilty to take a free shuttle to the other \"Coast\" hotel's. We took advantage of the free shuttle service to the Barbary Coast on a daily basis, total distance to the strip is a mile or two, and took about 5 minutes door to door. The food at the Gold Coast was very good. We had breakfast every morning in the buffet, and they had a wide variety of options. We also had dinner at the buffet on two evenings and again the food was very good. They have a wide variety of offerings, and we were very satisfied. Two evenings we ate in the Cortez Room at the Gold Coast. They advertise that their Prime Rib is the best in town, and I would have to agree. I think the 10 ounce Prime Rib is $12.95 and well worth it. By the way, my \"10 ounce\" Prime Rib was probably easily 1.5 to 2.0 lbs and very good.

Now for 6 bucks, anyone can say that they got the better end of the bargain at any hotel & casino, but in this hotel you get a great rate, you're within walking distance to the Rio and Palms, a short drive over the overpass to the Strip, a good place to sleep away from the bustle of the Strip, and friendly workers as well. The food at the Monterey Room was good. The steak and eggs meal for $2.95 made me day, actually almost every day I was there! The breafast and lunch buffet was decent too for $6.95 and $7.95 respectively. Did I also mention 75 cent hot dogs?! The gift shop had anything you need for a good souvenier. I also got a free coupon for free ice cream, a 2 for 1 at the buffet, and a discount at the bowling center(which I didn't go check out).

Failing that - it doesn't cost much to take a taxi. The hotel was actually a lot nearer to the strip than i was expecting. It takes far shorter time to get from the Gold Coast to the main area of the Strip than does to travel up in all the traffic from cheaper hotels lower down the Strip e.g. Stardust, Riviera, Stratosphere etc. The Price: Gold Coast offers some very reasonable rates. We paid about $55 weekday and $110 weekend for the room. I've seen cheaper too - depends when you're going. Also, they'll match any price! I emailed them a cheaper price i'd found and they matched it. All In All: If you want a reasonable, good quality hotel for your Vegas stay, go for the Gold Coast!

I booked through Allegiant Airlines (an excellent option for travel to Vegas if you live in or near an Allegiant city...better than Southwest). I opted for the Gold Coast because it was, quite simply, the least-expensive of the hotels from which to choose. Being very well-travelled, I knew that I shouldn't expect opulence from the least-expensive hotel/casino on the list. One of the biggest sources of frustration and dissatisfaction when traveling comes when people don't do their research, then have unrealistically high expectations. The Gold Coast Hotel & Casino was pretty much what I had expected. It's about 1 mile off The Strip, and quite cozy, with all the amenities that you could reasonably ask for from such a place. However, due to its off-the-strip location and lower price, you won't see too many Gucci, Prada, and Cartier-draped high rollers (if you aren't familiar with those three brands, then the Gold Coast is perfect for you!); you WILL see an abundance of senior citizens and younger, backpacker types, as well as endless low-end foreign tourists. Both my check in and check out were slightly long. The clerks weren't terribly personable and seemed stressed out and rushed, but I didn't take that personally. The casino is quite adequate, although the carpet betrays its age. There is a buffet and a 24-hour restaurant where the food is good. The rooms are large and pleasant, although the hotel DOES get a big demerit for having completely dark showers. The Gold Coast runs a free shuttle every 15 minutes to its sister property, the Barbary Coast, which is on The Strip. Therefore, for the savvy traveller, it is much smarter to pay the bargain rates at the Gold Coast, then shuttle over to The Strip and enjoy the over-the-top elegance of the landmarks like Caesar's Palace, the MGM Grand, and New York New York. All in all, if you are looking for adequate lodging and plan to spend most of your time in Las Vegas out of your hotel, look into the Gold Coast. One final note: If you choose to use BellTrans airport shuttle when you leave (regardless of the hotel you're using), be VERY wary; specify with them EXACTLY where your pickup should be. Two other travellers and I waited almost one hour for a BellTrans shuttle that never came. Their defense was that it HAD come, and on time.

There were 4 of us in our mid-late 20's. This hotel is about location, location, location. Sandwiched between the Palms and Rio, you are able to party at the hot spots and walk home. For the Rio, just cut through the parking garage. And the Palms is just across the street. The first night we hit the Ghost Bar at the Palms. We only had to wait in line for 30 or so minutes. Figuring out what line your in almost takes longer(Rain/Ghostbar). We all highly recommend the buffet at the Gold Coast. It's awesome!! There's a ton of variety and you can't beat the price. We also ate at Terrible Mike's one night for something different. It's o.k., fries were good. Monterrey was o.k., mixed reviews between us all. The Palms restaurant Geradino(sp?) has $4.99 steak and eggs after midnight which was good. We took the free shuttle to the Barbary Coast on the strip everday. It's a perfect drop off spot. Easy access to the Billagio fountains, Ceasar's, etc. The fountains at the Bellagio are 10x better at night versus the day. Ceasar's has some cool clubs that we enjoyed, The Pussycat Dolls Lounge and Pure. Beware: You'll have to stand at the Pussycat Dolls Lounge, they don't allow you to sit unless you order a bottle of liquor: cheapest bottle is $350. If you get there early(9pm) there's no cover and you'll get free access to PURE when it opens. Each night we went to Palms we saw celebrities, also keep your eyes out in the airport for the celebs. The pool at Gold Coast is great for your self esteem. Remember, the majority of the people at G.C. are much older. You're not at your hotel all that much, and G.C. was clean and friendly. And cheap food. Rio has some cool clubs: Bikini's(you'll get a taste of this club when you walk in the front door), Voodoo Lounge (at the top). We visited the Tilted Kilt which was a nice layed back bar, fun to chill. Bring your walking shoes for the day and your sexy outfits for night. Girls, I'd recommend something low cut to maybe get you on \"the list\" at the nightclubs. Guys and girls: jeans were acceptable at all of the clubs, but look hot.

The rooms are functional rather than anything special but we found the bed comfy. The air con was noisy but not bad enough to stop us sleeping. We tried several of the food outlets and they were all very good indeed. You certainly won't starve here, and judicious use of the funbooks you get given can cut costs, though nothing is expensive. Funnily enough, I think the gambling subsidises the food and the room costs. For those of a gambling nature, the casino is probably at the cheaper and looser end of the scale - more 1 cent machines and lower limits at the tables. Certainly when we wandered on to the strip, our money seemed to disappear more quickly. Lots of people we talked to said they liked to play in this casino over others.

At Bally's we paid more than $125/night for a bathrrom with tiles off the walls and stained carpet. The Gold Coast had a newly renovated modern bathroom with a separate sink area. The beds were comfortable & the room was immaculate. We were in a room at the end of the hallway but that made it that much quieter that rooms by the elevator. I watched my husband play Texas Hold'em for 4 hours before the dealers convinced me to try (I was scared to play). After 6 hours of straight play I walked away a winner.

We then got tired of waiting for the shuttle so walked over to Rio which is quite a jaunt. We for the first time in all the years we have been there, suffered terrible rainy weather. Therefore we had to stand at least 20 minutes each time waiting for the shuttle and for the most part, it was raining and miserable and it was usually packed on the shuttle. The table games were limited...they did not even have 3 card poker which is very popular right now. They also had no Let it Ride card games. They present you with a Gold coast Card which promises many comps, etc. when actually you get nothing. We got nothing for the hours of gambling we did there. When we checked out, we were told that we should have got a black table card. The rooms were okay, we spend little time in our rooms but I have to say the bathroom was dinky. The good thing was the restaurants were good in the hotel. I would definitely not come back to this hotel.

It isn't glamorous, nor close to the action, but it makes up for it in so many ways. The hotel is clean, the casino is expansive and well-lit, the staff is friendly, the beds really may be as comfortable as the other reviews say, the breakfast buffet ($5.95)cannot be beat, and above all else, it doesn't cost much to stay there. ($69/night for friday and saturday) On the down side, the room was nice, yet uninspired-- dated fixtures in a cramped poorly-lit bathroom, and if your room is lower than the fifth floor, very poor views, if any at all. The room was alright. But I am the kind of person that doesn't spend much time in my room. It had the comfy bed and was quiet and dark for sleeping. If I wanted to spend time in my room, I would have spent the extra 100's to stay at Mandalay Bay or the Venetian. And if I was looking for glamour, I would just toddle across the street to the Palms, or hop into my rental car and head off to the strip. (parking at the Gold Coast is a snap, btw) So I guess what I am trying to say here is that I love the Gold Coast for its sense of value. Would I rather stay at Mandalay Bay or the Venetian? Sure!

We chose to stay at the Embassy Suites Phoenix/Biltmore, based on other reviews here on Trip Advisor. We were very pleased with our entire stay. Our daughter picked us up at the airport, as there is not shuttle service to/from the airport. We even chose NOT to rent a vehicle while we were there, as we were within walking distance to the Biltmore Shopping/Dining area. We even walked to our anniversary dinner at Christopher's ( a nice French cuisine restaurant). It was lovely... The room was great...The first part of the room was a little \"living room/dining room\" that had a couch, table and chairs, and little mini fridge and microwave and sink. Beyond a door was the bathroom and the queen bed, and a sink/mirror...Beyond this area was the balcony. We were on the 4th floor, and the balcony accommodated one, maybe two chairs, but would not fit a table...One or two of the lower levels had a \"full\" balcony that allowed for a nice sized round table and chairs; adequate for dining. ***The only downfall of having a level lower than 4, is that the pool hours are until MIDNIGHT. Since we were able to hear people VERY well, in the pool area, late at night, I can only imagine that it would prevent, especially light sleepers and children, from sleeping at a normal hour. I would greatly comment to management to end pool hours by 10 or even 11pm, to have respect for those who would appreciate \"quiet hours\" at a reasonable time. :) The staff/management/housekeeping, were ALL very kind and helpful. The room was very clean and the room temperature was controlled by US. There was an adjustable thermostat in our room The koi pond and greenery inside was beautiful. The pool area, trees/landscape etc. were lovely. We really enjoyed our stay here, and would go back in a moment! We enjoyed the breakfast options, that were more than any \"free\" breakfast we had ever experienced, at ANY hotel! The egg omelets were FABULOUS! We were able to choose from mushrooms, tomatoes, jalapenos, cheese, spinach, onions, ham, or ALL OF THE ABOVE. Potatoes were also available with the omelets. There were many other breakfast options: pancakes, oatmeal, fresh fruit, cereal....There were also a few tables outside to enjoy the morning sun, while eating. We SO enjoyed that, each day! The manager's reception in the early evening provided a free drink: alcoholic or otherwise, and a light snack.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Luis Obispo, California", "Title": "\u201cgood location, expect what you are expecting\u201d", "Author": "isildor", "ReviewID": "UR127269115", "Content": "The best part of the hotel is its location.

At first very annoyed over not getting our pool-view room (booked months before and confirmed 48 hours earlier, by them!), the hotel got it right for our second night and agreed to refund the cost of the first night, spent in a dingy conference-set room. Right decision and good customer relations! The suite was large, well-equipped and had a very small balcony overlooking the pool. Some rooms had a large balcony with table and chairs - not sure how much more than our already high price you have to pay to get one of those! The pool was superb but open far too late too allow noisy people to keep us awake until midnight. Why? The hotel is some 8 miles from the (unexciting) downtown but located a 2-minute walk from the Biltmore Plaza outdoor mall with upmarket shops and expensive restaurants. Also, strangely not promoted at all, across the road (via a safe, well-lit tunnel) is a 14-screen AMC cinema with BRILLIANT dine-while-watching options. A bargain $9 for a superb leather reclining seat and table and a great food and drink menu, served at your seat. We had room service once, which was fast but mediocre. The usual Embassy Suites breakfast and manager's reception drinks/snacks were included, but marred by ridiculous queues as the evening reception bargirl struggled, with a smile, on her own to serve hundreds and the superb and easy breakfast buffet provided at the weekend was repllaced by cook-to-order only on the weekdays.

The rooms are a typical Embassy Suites two-room unit, with ample space (BIG bedroom and decent living area). The bathroom is small and I definitely didn't appreciate the hair that wasn't mine in the tub and shower on check in. Otherwise, toiletries were reasonable, the towels are large and fluffy. The cotton robe was a nice touch, and the dresser space was great. A second sink in the bedroom would be useful for a family staying together, but isn't necessary for solo travelers....definitely gives you an option if there are several of you traveling together. The included buffet breakfast and made-to-order omelet bar every morning was lovely, and in many circumstances, would save a family $50 or more in breakfast costs. A large pond with beautiful Koi is certainly a nice touch that doesn't happen in most large chains.

I stayed here for a conference as the Biltmore Arizona resort rooms were full. Although, the Embassy Suites were not as fancy or nice as the Biltmore - they had a nice property, the suites were very large and well-decorated and clean - relatively quiet. There is a pool and whirlpool. The front desk staff - especially manager Valerie and Amanda at the front desk were fantastic. There was a complimentary shuttle to the Biltmore and anywhere within a 3 mile radius and the staff were incredibly friendly. The customized omelette station and complimentary breakfasts were great. The manager's happy hour with food and drink were also wonderful complimentary perks. The staff bent over backwards to help us and make sure we had a great stay. They even sent a town car complimentarily to get us when we finished hiking Squaw Peak and it was dark and we needed to get back - instead of having us wait for the shuttle - which was really appreciated. The property makes sense and is reasonable in price and well-located. There are a bunch of running trails along the canal, hiking to Squaw Peak or Camelback Mountain are close by and really worth it, it backs the golf course and is about a mile from the Biltmore Resort. Of course - it is right beside the mall where there are tons of great restaurant - including True Food Kitchen which was great. The hotel restaurant was reasonable also but not likely something you would like to eat at every night unless you love steak. All in all would definately stay here again.

We were disappointed that our room was not ready, even though the stated check-in time for this property is 3pm and we arrived a bit after that time. Though the staff was very nice, courteous & apologetic, we were a bit tired after our long drive & had wanted to check in & freshen up prior to going to a local MLB baseball game. We were told it would not be too long until our room was ready & that they would call our cell phone when it was. Our boys amused themselves by feeding the fish in the Koi pond (you can get the food from the front desk to feed them); however, we got a bit tired of waiting around, and decided to go across the street to the outdoor mall to eat (Cheesecake Factory). We were finally called (after 5pm!) to tell us our room was ready, which was a bit of an inconvenience as it made it difficult for us to attend the ballgame (w/a start time of 6:40pm), as once we got settled in to our room, it was a bit late to try to head out for that. This made our boys a bit upset. However, we were able to attend & enjoy the Manager's reception & the bartender that evening was really great (I don't recall her name, but she was wonderful). Our room was nice & typical of Embassy Suites, w/comfy beds, nice bathroom, in room coffee maker & fridge, etc. We all really enjoyed breakfast the following morning, with many choices for breakfast including made-to-order omelets, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hot & cold cereals, breads, etc. A very good selection indeed! We also liked that there was a 'business center' which we could use to print our airline boarding passes :) We did not get a chance to use the pool, but the pool area looked very nice.

After getting to our room (which was the furthest room possible away from the lobby) I saw that it was two double beds. I walked back down to the lobby to ask about our room and was told that they were out of king rooms because we checked in too late. There was a half hearted apology but no solution other than to come back tomorrow to see if there might be a king room available. The next morning (after a good nights sleep) we decided that since we were leaving the following morning we would just make due in the double room rather than move all our stuff. We were going to be in Arizona for eight days and had three more hotels to go to after this one. Breakfast is always the best part of staying at an Embassy and in this area they did not disappoint. The chef was very friendly - she made the BEST french toast!

We checked out immediately and asked the representative to make reservations at the Biltmore since we have stayed several times in the past and love it there.

We were given room #512 and the floors were not vacuumed, shower drain was clogged, bathroom door would not lock (at one point my daughter was locked in the restroom), room smelled like mold and carpet in the bedroom was not tacked down properly which is a safety hazard since there were exposed wires/cables for the television.

I explained the issues and in which she stated \"What do you want me to do?\" I was amazed that she responded in that way and just told her nothing. I notified on duty manager Joy on 7/4/10, who assisted me in this issue and told me she would have a technician check the room and one night would be refunded to us for the inconvenience. Upon our arrival that night (9 pm), I noticed our room had a welcome box with a technician's notes stating all issues were resolved, however that was not the case. I contacted the front desk and spoke to Daisy who assisted me in coming to our room and witnessing nothing was resolved by the technician. I contacted a female duty manager on 7/5/10 and advised her of the situation and also told her Daisy had been a witness to the issue. The on duty manager also refunded our money for the 2nd night, and apologized for the issues.

I tried to talk the desk clerk out of the $6 parkign fee but was not successful. Since the room was only $79, I decided I could afford the $6.

It seems the hotel's entire air-handling system is switched either to cooling or heating (which in itself is not odd), but if the hotel's system is set one way, you cannot achieve the opposite effect in your room no matter how you set the room's thermostat.

The best part was their *fabulous* atrium with the Koi fish. Each morning, my toddler woke saying \"fish, fish!\" and went to bed at night exclaiming the same thing. It was a nice area of Phoenix to stay in and 25 minutes from Mesa and other areas of Phoenix we were visiting. The Biltmore shopping area next door offered some nice meals and it's expanding soon to include a Paradise Bakery. The hotel's Omaha steakhouse is nice, but pricey. However, their late night menu includes some of the lunch options (sandwiches, etc), which are generous servings and reasonable if you would prefer not to go back out. One night I had to wait especially long for a meal I had ordered from the restaurant to pickup downstairs ( it took them 45 minutes - only should have been 15). The bar tender treated me to a drink (alcoholic) of my choice! That, accompanied with the nice waiting area kept my frustrations away. We stayed in a room that was extremely comfortable and spacious (toddler, husband, and myself) - 2 rooms of course. The main bedroom is enormous and great for keeping everything including setting up a play and changing area for our toddler. It did become a bit noisy with traffic the next morning, so I would recommend a room facing the pool if possible - in March, the pool was not crowded or noisy later in the evening so I would not think this would be a problem. Pool area is also nice, and clean. The breakfast was nothing exceptional, but it met our needs. It is a nice area, although I was not keen on the milk being in a metal container. Personal preference. Omlets were watery, fixed too quickly. The staff was extremely nice, although the housekeeping service was slow in getting rooms done throughout the day. This posed a problem when you have a toddler that needs an afternoon nap. There is no business center, and only one working computer available for internet use. However, it was so slow and had issues, so I gave up checking my email that weekend. Yes, I would recommend the hotel to others, especially those with children. A few bumps along the way, but most certainly a much better experience and nicer stay than others I have experienced in Phoenix over the years.

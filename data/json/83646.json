It was one of those times when the hotel was just as good as we hoped! We weren't expecting a five-star luxury resort, but we still thrilled with it. We got a two-room suite (well, a bedroom and a sitting room with a faux kitchen and a good-sized bathroom) and it covered our needs quite well (two parents and two girls so we wanted some separate space). Everything was very clean and comfortable, we had a fabulous balcony/deck looking towards Mission Bay, and the staff responded quickly the couple of times we had minor needs. Bear in mind that the hotel rooms open to the outside, not an enclosed hallway - not a problem, just thought you should know.

The hotel/rooms are \"bungalow\" style.\u00c2\u00a0 Room is kinda small, but still nice. Beds aren't the best, but not bad either. The rooms have nice shutters and windows that open so you get a nice breeze. Basic amenities: fridge, coffee maker, microwave, etc.\u00c2\u00a0They contract with the Wavehouse Gym down by the beach and they offer daily and weekly rates. ($30 a week) My husband loved working out with a view of the beach! Perks of this hotel: shuttle to Seaworld and airport. So close to the beach. Tons of eateries around. Target and Ralph's close by. 5-7 minutes to downtown (Zoo) and there is a walkway along the marina for evening strolls!\u00c2\u00a0 Overall, my family and I were very comfy and happy with our hotel choice. I would definitely stay here again if I got another deal, but not sure if I would pay over $200 a night (for 5 nights).

The facility is in a series of two- and three-story buildings. I believe that the two-story buildings are the \"older\" buildings, while the three-story building (which has marvelous views of Mission Bay) is a newer building. I stayed in one of the older buildings. Good Points: 1. They have a shuttle to/from the airport. The shuttle is $9 pp/each way. When I arrived, I called the hotel and within 10 minutes, the shuttle was there. The shuttle driver, along with all Dana staff, was incredibly friendly and gave me lots of tips on eating, shopping etc. What a great start to my vacation. 2. The room was clean and housekeeping did a great job of keeping it clean. 3. Front desk staff were very friendly. 4. The hotel did a good job of accommodating us birders as they had shuttle buses available at designated times to take us to our meeting facility. Bad Points 1. The rooms are basically standard-fare motel rooms with a tiny wash stand/vanity outside the shower/toilet area. 2. You could not access the ac/heating unit because the writing desk totally hid it. The first night I slept in a relatively warm room as I did not know where/how to use the heat. 3. I had to call the front desk three times to get someone to show me where the heat was and how to use it. The room did not have a remote that you could use to adjust the heat. Even with that, you had to get down on your hands and knees to see what the temperature setting was. UGH! 4. The fire alarm started beeping and that, too, required three phones calls to fix. (Fortunately, the noise started after I woke up one morning.) 5. I asked the front desk for a \"quiet room\". The front desk person said she could accommodate me, but me in close proximity to the pool.

The harbor view is beautiful, the grounds are clean and in excellent condition. There are some trouble spots, the poured cement balcony is angled incorrectly causing water to pool at the sliding glass doors. The rug inside the door shows evidence of water damage. Secondly the internet wireless signal is too weak to use. The cable for a wire connection is hidden behind the couch causing a call to customer service.

Used the guest laundry, and had difficulties there as well. The washing machines took nothing but quarters, $1.50 per load, a few loads of washing and drying used up a $10 roll of quarters. The dollar changer did not work prompting a fairly long walk to the office to get change. The office was apologetic and provided the change but all in all it was an unnecessary hassle and the high price of the machines provided no feeling of quality. The two restaurants on the grounds were very good. The Fire Fly and the Blue Pearl had excellent service and very friendly staff. The Fire Fly is a sort of sports bar / restaurant. It has generous area heaters on the outside seating, good food and a friendly staff. Remember to check your bill total before leaving the restaurant as it appeared to me that their adding machine had a problem and charged twice for one of the drinks.

Also in the bedroom area is a dresser with tv, huge mirror, and a small size window. The beds were very comfortable, however I didn't care for the pillows. Down the hall to the right is a big mini bar area with mini fridge, microwave, sink, coffee pot, silver wear, plates, and the safe. They supplied it with a roll of paper towels and dish soap. It also has lots of cabinet and drawer space which made it perfect for storing extra things. On the left hand side is a nice big bathroom with plenty of counter space and even a few shelves for storage. At the end of the hall is the living room. It has a pocket door to separate the rooms.

What good luck! Besides an incredible view, the staff told me that the bay view rooms were much larger than their regular rooms so keep in mind my review is of a bay room. The room was large and the view amazing. Even though the room's entry door faced the parking lot, the only traffic was from other hotel guests because the parking area had a gate (NOT a fence) preventing casual traffic from cruising through, and thus it was very quiet. The beds were as comfortable as beds can get. The bathroom looked like a sauna because of their choice of stone and wood. I liked it. Besides a HD TV, the room had a microwave, refrigerator, safe, and coffee maker. The sturdy, but small round wooden table intended to be a work surface was much too tall to do computer work on. The two chairs they placed at that table were more like cushioned living room chairs and were too short to comfortably place my arms on the table to read, write, or word process. To remedy this, I brought the patio chairs in from the outside and used them with the lower glass coffee table. When I was travel-weary and tired, the young woman checking me in talked \"a-mile-a-minute\" while circling the hotel's map with locations of restaurants that had closed already, and then gave me two small take-out menus of pizza places that would still deliver to the room. I appreciate that she must go through that a couple hundred times a week, but I wish she would slow down a little and understand the weary traveler who is finding it difficult to assimilate the information at the pace of her delivery. If that is the worst criticism I have of the staff, and it is, then I rate them as outstanding. Every other interaction I had with the staff, whether it was a chambermaid, room delivery, lawn maintenance, waiter, etc. was pleasant and polite. The hotel staff at the Dana really is outstanding. Paying a daily rate of $18 for parking is high in my opinion. The magnetic card reader that lifts the gate was getting tired. It required multiple attempts before getting the green light and having the gate lift. (I saw the same thing happen to others). Paying $18 to park in an open unfenced unguarded lot that does not have a human in a booth watching the cars is steep. I do not know what (or if) the Hotel Coronado charges guests to park, but I noticed they charge the general public $16 to park. For the caliber hotel that the Dana is, it just seems cheap to charge paying guests that much to park there. The Blue Pearl restaurant on premises is excellent. We ate lunch on our last day there and had sandwiches for about $8 that were so big we could hardly finish them. The waiter was as good as they get too. One last consideration is that if you are on a ground floor unit, there is a public sidewalk that winds along the bay, approximately a hundred feet away. There are joggers, walkers, fishermen, and bicycle riders that use that sidewalk. There is public parking a few hundred feet way, near the bridge (you can see the bridge in the photo of \"view left\"). The sliding patio door has a latch and also a bar you can put across that secures it from intruders. As far as I could see, all the rooms in all the hotel units had doors on the outside, not matter what floor you are on. Judge for yourself your comfort level. I had a totally pleasant stay with no concerns, but I know a potential exists. Would I stay at the Dana again? If I got the same deal, yes.

We booked through hotels.com and got a ridiculously good rate. I was not expecting much, to be honest! Boy, were we pleasantly surprised! First, let me comment on the grounds and location. It reminded me of a tropical resort in layout -- similar to properties I have stayed at in Hawaii and the Dominican Republic. The location is perfect, quiet and on the bay, but convenient to everything San Diego has to offer. When we checked in, we were greeted warmly at the desk. We were early, so only one of our rooms was available. The clerk upgraded us to a superior room, in one of the newer buildings. It was a beautiful and exceptionally comfortable room. Tons of fluffy towels, cozy down comforter on the bed, lots of pillows. The small kitchen area was great, especially given that we had a toddler in tow. We had a lovely view of the bay from our nicely sized balcony, and we spent awhile just soaking in the sun and beautiful weather while waiting for the second room to be ready (they told us it should be ready by 4pm). We left the hotel, and came back at 4:15. The other room was not ready, but they upgraded my parents to a suite! Seriously, these people know customer service. The suite was an enlarged version of our room, with a separate living room and large patio. Very nice! Before checking out, we had breakfast at the Blue Pearl restaurant. The food was tasty, and prices were very reasonable, For a $3 fee and 18% gratuity, you can have anything off the menu delivered at regular menu prices. Fantastic room service policy. The real highlight of our trip was the customer service. My daughter left her blankie in our room. We realized our error when we were almost back to Los Angeles. I called and left a message for Ted, the person in charge of lost and found. He called me back in the morning, located the blanket, and had it in the mail to us that day. So easy, so understanding, and so kind and polite. We travel down to San Diego a few times a year, but usually try to avoid the hassle of getting a hotel by driving back the same day.

We chose this hotel because of the favourable reviews that we had read. We decided not to rent a car so we could make a concentrated effort to walk on a daily basis. The hotel is right along the beautiful marina and a launch site. The grounds themselves are immaculate and well designed. I was hard pressed to find a weed or anything out of place. The plants chosen added a tropical feel and made me think of Hawaii. We initially were placed in ground level suite in the 400 block. We found the room to be on the small side and the layout itself felt cramped and poorly designed. We were shocked to find that there was no safe even though in the literature stated that they were in all the rooms. It turns out that they no longer have safes and are not planning on any in the near future. The lady at the front desk was not even sure what was going on with that. She did offer us the use of a tiny locker behind the desk or have our valuables locked in the office. We were not happy with either choice and ended up carrying all our valuables including our passports everywhere. The other problem with the room was the noise factor. These are two story buildings and the floor between is poorly insulated. We could hear everything from the family upstairs, it was like living below a bowling alley. At one point my husband got so frustrated that he banged a couple of times on the ceiling. One minute later there was a phone call from the front desk with a noise complaint about us. We finally asked to be moved to the second floor which they kindly did. What would have happened if the hotel was full? The move made all the difference in the world and we were able to relax and enjoy ourselves. On a more positive note the beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows and the rooms themselves were very clean. The two restaurants were nice. The Blue Pearl had great breakfast food and the staff were warm and friendly. The more upscale Firefly is trying to be trendy with a higher end menu. We found the food to be very hit or miss. Some of the food was very good while other things were just plain bizarre.Overall there were better places to eat that cost less than the Firefly. I don't know if we will be back since we chose this hotel partly because it was within walking distance to SeaWorld. Sorry to say but we hated SeaWorld.

The room was clean, well kept, updated and cozy. The beds were very comfortable .This hotel property is one of the best locations in all of San Diego. The Dana is directly across the street from Sea World, and easily walkable with kids. You are also right near freeway interchanges which makes getting to other areas incredibly easy. Mission beach is located right down the street, and their are plenty of good places to eat nearby.

I want to review the hotel based on my experience trying to pick the hotel for our trip. I think this will help those of you looking at this hotel, but not sure if the rooms are nice or if you should up grade or not. ROOMS The Dana can be broken down into two parts: The older section and the newer section. As you may have noticed, many people love the newer section. I decided to take a chance and stay in the older section (even though many people said it was terrible). We stayed in the Marina Bay rooms, although ALL the standard rooms would be the same (you just would not have the same view). Despite what people have said, these rooms are EXACTLY as pictured. They were small, but very well kept and clean. I would not hesitate to stay in them again. Don't be afraid to get the standard rooms, unless space is an issue. If you want lots of room, then go with the deluxe rooms. Since we were gone all day anyways, the room was not an issue for us. HOTEL The hotel itself was beautiful. It had two good size pools and hot tubs. We found it very enjoyable to walk around the hotel grounds during the evening. It is also a 15 minute walk to Sea World, which was awesome. The entire staff was great to work with. The Blue pearl restaurant was very reasonable and had great food (we ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner, each one time). Overall, the hotel was perfect. Just what we wanted. Some have mentioned that the hotel walls are very thin and you can hear everything. I had not such experience. I heard the other people's door shutting, but that was it. It is a HOTEL, not a single family home. Not sure what some people expect.... Wi-Fi is free and easy to access. It is great to check e-mail and other quick things, but not much else. I assume they keep slower for a reason. Extra Charges / fees Some things to note: -They charge 9 dollars per person to use their shuttle from the airport. If you have a group of 3 or more, it would be cheaper to just take a taxi. Plus, since the taxis are right at the air port, and you don't have to wait for them, you would get their faster. My wife and I had a real problem with this. I think a small charge is reasonable, but 18 to get us to THEIR hotel was pretty ridiculous. Most hotels don't do that (atleast the ones I stayed at) -They also charge 20 dollars a night to park. There are other parking lots/streets around, but I am not sure if I would trust them (especially since we had a rental). Our first two nights we did not have a car. Then we got a car the last two nights we were there. Not sure how, but they did not charge us for parking. Not sure if they just missed it or what. I was kind of glad since I think that is pretty ridiculous. Food If you want to save money on buying food, there is a small bait shop / fishing store right by the hotel. They have sandwiches, chips, cereal, etc. It is a little bit pricey. Your best bet is a target store about 1.5 miles up the road. Easy to get too and can save you some money. Within 3-4 miles you have just about ANY restaurant you would want. Transportation As people have stated, there is a public transportation bus stop right in front of the hotel. We found that very useful to get to old town. It is only a ten minute right straight to the hub and old town is right across the train tracks. I had originally planned using the bus to get to other locations like the LDS temple, USS Midway, and Zoo. However, I found it would have taken 1-2 hours EACH WAY using the bus. That is assuming you get off at the right spot. Since I did not know much about San Diego, I decided not to use the bus to go very far. As stated it will take you anywhere, but I think it takes more time than it is worth. It cost less than 50 dollars for a rental car for 2 days. Well worth, since we drove to Universal Studios our last day their. My overall impressions are good. The hotel itself is fantastic and exactly as pictured on their website. Don't be afraid to stay in the standard rooms, as long as you don't want lots of room. Try and avoid the extra fees of the shuttle and parking if you can. If you are going to sea world, don't rent a car that day. It can save you on parking. You will enjoy your stay at the Dana.

To begin with, we were blessed with an outstanding rate from Jennifer Kietzke for a deluxe room with a beautiful view of Mission Bay. Our room had two queen bed, a pullout couch, small table and 2 chairs, as well as small fridge, micro and sink. The bathroom was very nice, with plenty of counter space as well as a lighted make up mirror. Little details, like two robes and swim towels folded on the bed each day were impressive. The view from our room was spectacular, with a large sliding door leading out onto our own balcony with several chairs, overlooking Mission Bay and the marina. We enjoyed watching the 7 and 9 person kayaks early in the morning out on the bay. The resort has two heated pools, one with a small sand area, complete with sand toys for the kids. Although the weather was cool during our stay, our kids still enjoyedswimming each evening and building sandcastles on the \"beach\". Everyone we encountered at the resort went above and beyond to make our stay one to remember! There are two restaurants onsite, but we only ate at one of them; The Blue Pearl, where we had breakfast twice and ordered carryout pizza once. Everything was absolutely delicious, and the service was incredibly fast! Our first morning there, we informed our waiter we were hoping to catch the resort shuttle to Sea World, so he put a rush on our meal. We couldn't believe it when breakfast for 5 showed up in less than 5 minutes!! NEVER have we had such quick service in a restaurant!! And this waiter was the most cordial man ever! Unfortunately, I didn't get his name. Although we had a little trouble getting to the resort on our first attempt, it truly is right across the road from Sea World's parking lot. We'd stay there again, in a heartbeat, and recommend it to anyone!

I will try to go in details now: The bathroom was small but clean, it had plenty of towels and high quality soaps. However, it was not like a Mariott bathroom. Excellent coffee! Wolgang Puck brand, I loved it. I'd brew the coffee each morning and enjoy it. I would sip my coffee and visit Dana landing, just a small walk, where I'd order an egg/cheese sandwich and watch the gorgeous bay. By the way the sandwich was only 3.99. I also got my beer from the Dana landing . Dana Landing also rents all kinds of sea sports/ fishing goods. It also has a good deli and cold cuts department. Fresh! You could rent a bike and ride it for miles on the beautiful bay, or rent a boat at Paradise point. The room was not grand. It was more like a Days Inn kind but the bed was excellent and the furnishings good . TV was a flat panel. Staff was very friendly. The lawns were manicured. I enjoyed the foliage. The high point was the FireFly cafe. You must at least go there once and try the chowder. I loved the chowder so much that I ate it every day. It is a better chowder than you can get in San Francisco. It was the location. Heaven on earth! Will go there again.

By this I mean that there are Standard rooms and there are Deluxe rooms and the difference between the two is night and day. I know this only because I stayed here three nights recently with several other families. My family was \"upgraded\" to a deluxe room simply because we needed the pullout couch for sleeping. The other families were put in the standard rooms. Note: these rooms were booked through Disney as part of a vacation package. Shame on Disney for putting people in the standard rooms. The pictures on the website are misleading and even the pictures of the standard rooms make them look much nicer than they actually are. Since I stayed in the Deluxe room, I'll base my stay off that, but I'd like to give a brief review of both. Standard Rooms: This part of the complex looks like it was built in the 1970's as the buildings look dated and the rooms do as well. The two standard rooms I went in both had a terrible musty smell and they are much smaller than the deluxe rooms. The carpets were stained and had numerous ripples in them. I was hesitant to even let my kids sit on the floor since they looked so dirty. The only thing that looked updated in the entire room was an LG flatscreen TV. One person demonstrated the large gap under the entry door by pushing a roughly one-quarter inch thick stick under the door! Everything down to the quality of sheets was even different than what is in the deluxe rooms. My only other comment on this area was would have to be the rat trap that was visible under one of the stairwells. Deluxe Rooms: These rooms are obviously in a newer area of the complex. The rooms are large and feature a small kitchenette area with a small sink, microwave and fridge. Everything appears to be updated. Our room featured two queen beds and a small sofa that was a pullout. The room we stayed in backed up to a large park area, which didn't really allow for much privacy for sitting on the patio area. There were large groups of people either picnicking or playing soccer directly outside our back door. Room service was great and they left lots of towels, including towels for the pool. The complex does have two outdoor pools that are nice. There is also a restaurant near the lobby that always appeared busy. I did not eat there, but it looked somewhat upscale. I did read comments about high fees for parking vehicles, but we were not charged to park our two vehicles. We were also given an access code for free internet access. I was unable to access using my wifi, but was able when I hooked up the supplied ethernet cable. Overall, I did enjoy my stay, but if I would have been stuck in a standard room, my rating would have been much lower. I did hear one other family in the lobby complaining about the standard room they were put in. I heard the guy saying the room looked nothing like the pictures on the website and all the lady at the front desk kept telling him was there was nothing she could do because he booked through a third party internet service. I'm guessing this is a common complaint from guests and it's somewhat deceiving by this hotel. For the extra fifty-dollars a night, pony up and get the Deluxe room", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MA", "Title": "\u201cserene yet kid friendly\u201d", "Author": "mytimemama", "ReviewID": "UR118356146", "Content": "We went to the Dana in july 2011.

A young lad Andy( Front Desk, excellent service and very professional) showed us our room on the map and answered all of our questions regarding the facilities. What an awesome experience. The room was beautiful; Flat Screen, Robes, BIg Mirrors, and even a Mini Refrigerator to keep the Coronas chilled. And the view of the bay!!! Perfect! We went out that night had an awesome time in San Diego and woke up the next morning wishing we had more days!

Much cheaper than renting a car and paying parking, or paying for a taxi, and it was fast. It took us South and as far North as we wanted to go. The bus drivers were full of information on where to go and where not to go. The pools were beautifully maintained, and the fellow guests were well behaved.

Pros: our room (premium bay view 2 Queens w/balcony) was much better than expected. We were in AW! upon entry as we couldn't believe how spacious and bright it was.You have use of a robe and 2 towels for your use of there pools. Be far warned... it's not yours to keep. It must be returned to the hotel if not, there's a costly charged to your credit card. The bathroom was spacious but could have been a tad bit cleaner. There was hair on the floor and ceiling. Nothing to complain about though. In the lobby you have free use of the internet as well as printing out your boarding passes etc. Free shuttle service to sea world and early morning coffee/newspaper. You can rent a bike for $8.00 and hour or more etc. Cons:_( Our room (as lovely as it was) was extremely pricey(a room in the water's edge section) They add ridiculous amounts of incidentials once you receive your final bill at check out. Also, there were unsupervised underaged teens having loud parties in which we didn't get a peaceful nights sleep. We noticed food trays left in hallway. Garbage/pizza boxes plus empty soda bottles thrown on the side of the garbage cans. I don't know where the parents/guardians were, but you can bet the teens were left alone to cause major chaos. In conclusion, If you enjoy being near the marina and you're a water/boating person, this is the perfect hotel for you. We didn't realize this as this is our very first time visiting the state of California.

We ate breakfast at the Blue Pearl a few times and it was pretty descent. Lunch was ok. We had 3 meals at the Firefly and they were excellent. We were very happy with the quality of the food and service! The pools are nice(towels provided in the room), with wait service at the pool by the firefly and a cabana-type bar at the tropical pool.

It is set on beautiful Mission Bay and our room overlooked the bay full of jet skiers, kayakers and boaters. We rented bikes and took a short trip to the Boardwalk which is full of fun nightlife and cool restaurants. Also, the hotel property is full of luscious trees and flower beds with two pools. The one pool we went to was rather large and had cabana shade you could sit under for no extra charge. It is a great place to take a nap or read a book. The other pool we never made it but it is located next to a beautiful garden and had a sandbox for kids to play in. It also had a snack bar that serves drinks :) There were two days that we didn't even leave the property. We just hung out at the pool and ate at the hotel. Second, the rooms are beautiful. The beds are comfortable and the decor is relaxing. Water in the shower stays warm and the shower head gives a strong flow. (with curly hair this is a must :) ) The housekeeping staff keeps the room super clean and restocks all towels and robes quickly. The last and rather important aspect is the wonderful restaurants and staff at the Dana. We loved breakfast at the Blue Pearl which has really reasonable prices and AMAZING eggs benedict!

The maintence guy came up to spray but my husband had to actually show him where to look, he didnt even know what he was looking for. Also parking is an extra $18.00 a day...ouch and they do not even offer a lot of it (at least on the water's edge side), the spaces are small and the water from the sprinklers are constantly hitting the car doors.

The Blue Pearl resturant is sooo good and the prices are not bad. The servers are also very nice. The other resturant, the FireFly, not so good and way overpriced for the amount of food they serve.

Perfect location as it was less than a mile from the finish. I vacation frequently and I love springing for a waterfront complex when I'm able to. The bayside location was wonderful! The main pool is large & overlooks the marina, which was an added bonus. Did not seem too crowded but did notice the beach chairs were lacking as they were all full. We stayed in the old section, which was perfectly fine for us. We had a ground floor room with a patio that overlooked the pool, however the foilage was too thick to view the pool. It was a tad dark in the room but provided some great afternoon shade when relaxing on the patio. The room size worked out fine for us, but I definately would not recommend these rooms for families as they could get cramped with 3 or 4 people. I was very impressed by how clean and updated the rooms were & with all of the ammenities, including robes! We ate at both restaurants, and definately preferred Fire Fly. Blue Pearl was \"o.k.\", but more of a upscale Denny's feel. Great for families I suppose, but not really the atmosphere two adult gals were looking for. Food was also just \"o.k.\". The food and the atmosphere of Fire Fly were much better. It is located next to the pool & bay, so we were able to watch the fireworks from our dinner table! I agree with the reviewer who commented on how early they close. Would be nice if they stayed open until at least 11 p.m., especially this time of year. Only two complaints were 1) We were overcharged for drinks once, and they tried to overcharge us two more times, but we caught it. Apparently, they introduced their new Spring 2011 menu but failed to input the new reduced prices in their computer. Once we pointed it out they charged us correctly. 2) The paid shuttle service the hotel provided to get race participants to the start line 6-7 miles away. I was very concerned that the 5:30 a.m. schedule deparure time was not going to allow us enough time to get to the start line before 6:15. I was reassured over & over by the hotel representative that it would. Sure enough, the shuttle never showed up & about 2 dozen runners were still standing around at the hotel 10 minutes before the race start. The manager finally came out & payed all of our cab fares to the start line, but it still created a fiasco. Nothing is worse than getting to the start line as the gun is blowing off with no time to stretch, mentally prepare, etc. Not cool! The hotel did send out an apology and refunded our shuttle fee, but still a pretty stressful situation for us runners. Oh, and yes, the parking charge is ridiculous. This is one of my HUGE pet peeves, when hotels charge you to stay there & then tack on a over inflated parking fee. It's really, really tacky.

Our room was also noisy facing the road and parking lot! My kids woke up several times due to garbage trucks and utility trucks backing up into the property. People could be heard talking loudly in their rooms and outside. You will most definitely be booked in the older rooms if you book through any of the discounted websites like Priceline or Hotels.com.

After reading reviews on the old part, we called the hotel and tried to cancel our reservation. We were unsuccessful. Then we decided to give it a chance. Big mistake. Upon checking in, we were coldly greeted by a very unpersonable front desk worker. We asked to see a room before securing the reservation and our request was ignored. We were told that there were no rooms available in the new part. We were stuck. The room was awful. It was small, dingy, and smelled musty. There was no closet but there was an oversized armoire that when opened, allowed no room to walk. The bathroom was dirty (a stain on the toilet) and had exposed plumbing under the sink and bad patchwork over holes in the door. The door frame missing from the bathroom door and the room carpet was dirty. Many of the advertisements of this \"resort\" are likely of the new part of the hotel. We would not know though, because we were stuck in the old part. The night we arrived, we checked in at 8pm. We checked out two hours later at 10pm and again exchanged very few words with the same front desk worker. We received no common courtesies from her like, \"Sorry for the inconvenience\" or \"Is there something we can do?\" Oh and by the way, this hotel has no amenities like free WiFi, free parking, or free contential breakfast. In fact, the hotel charging $18/night to park there. Rip off! So....now it's 10pm on a Friday night and we have no place to stay.

We had breakfast two times at the hotel restaurant and by all accounts the food was good with generous portions. My only complaint was the layout of the suite. It was awkward and backwards. The front door opened into the bedroom which was attached to the kitchen and bathroom. The 'living area' where my 11 year old son slept on the pull-out couch was in the back attached to the deck and was the only room that had a door for privacy. So if he had to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, he essentially came out into our room to get into the bathroom.

First the positives: the property is in a nice area, very close to Sea World and Mission Bay (although being in meetings all day I didn't get to experience either). The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the meal services, both in the restaurant and for the meeting, were a highlight of my stay. The bedding was decent and the bath area was fine. The 42\" flat screen TV was larger than I would normally expect. The room had a small refrigerator and microwave, which I didn't use but which would have come in handy on a leisure visit. The meeting facility was convenient, except for the fact that there were no restrooms and we had to go over to the reception area on our breaks. The airport shuttle ($9 each way) helped us avoid renting a car, although they only run between 8 am and 8 pm. Whether the negatives are significant depends on your needs. The rooms are a bit cramped, though similar to other San Diego properties I've stayed at. There isn't really a workspace per se, just a small round table at the side of the bed. There aren't any usable power outlets near the nightstand, making charging a laptop or cell phone inconvenient. Although the rooms have been updated, they are clearly older and not very well noise-insulated. I could hear a baby crying from the room above each morning at 5 am, though coming from the East Coast I was already awake. You could also hear anyone walking by the room, along with doors shutting, cars starting, etc. It was hard to darken the room completely, as the shutters don't close completely.

There is a microwave, coffee maker and small fridge. Coffee packages were Wolfgang Puck brand. We decided to order room service for breakfast. Came to $20.00 (including tax, mandatory gratuity and service charge) but for cereal, fruit, orange juice, eggs, toast and hashbrowns I would say it is really not much more than one would pay at a decent restaurant (not talking Denny's or IHOP). We left the car at the hotel and took the shuttle to Seaworld. Stayed the day and then left. Staff at the front desk were very informative about directions.

That night I recieved a phone call from the hotel at 130 am telling me I've been booked in the wrong room but I can stay there on them. The next day I check my bank statements and I had already paid online through Expedia so my room and services were already paid for. I check my statemnts and over $150 was missing. I call the Dana and talk to the accountant and the people they booked me in their room all their charges were charged to my card, after leaving work early to find the solution, we figured it out. I was givin a free room on them. Two days later I go to get gas and my card declines, I check my bank statements on my phone and the $150 was not put on my card yet. So it took them 3 days to refund my money so I was given dinner at their resturant the firefly. Then I stayed this last weekend Sat-Sun. I got the same room [bayside] and had dinner on them. Dinner was wonderful and the service was great. I return to my room and get constant complaints of loud noise, jumping on the bed and banging the door. It was before 12am, and I don't consider walking in the room jumping on the bed. Also, hotel doors slam and I got complaints for my door. Then.. security of the Dana comes to my room at 2 in the morning saying I have these complaints and I have to leave the hotel. Over jumping on the bed??? And my slamming door. YES, the security harrassed me to leave and told me I better sleep in my car and he was calling law enforcement. I was excited to talk to a policemen but that never happened so around 3 I packed my things and left. The next day I get charged over $200 for the people who complaineds' room. I think this is poposterious. Never did I sign consent to pay for someone elses room. They left because they had felt threatened by my spouce. Does anyone think this is as ridiculous and I do.

When it finally was delivered we were out at dinner and I come back to the room and see the most beat up, stained Pack n Play I've ever seen! So I open it up in disgust to see the condition of the inside and there are pincher bugs crawling around in it! I immediately called the front desk to have someone pick it up and deliver another one. I told him about the bugs and he didn't even apologize. It took over an hour to get the crib, meanwhile by 2 year is exhausted and needs to go to bed and I have no crib!! The next pack n play delivered was in better shape but still stained in spots, so I wiped it down with antibacterial wipes and used by crib sheets i brought from home. We also traveled with my parents and my brothers family. The garbage in their rooms didn't get emptied each day or hotel products refilled. I had no kleenex refills or soap. I had to call down to the front desk again the next night to have some delivered. I heard the same front desk agent as the prior night exhale a sigh in disgust when I asked him for the soap and kleenex. The carpet is extremely dirty and not vacuumed each day. The room is cramped and small. There is no closet only a small wardrobe in the corner. The cable came in fuzzy, might as well not have even had a TV in the room. The bed was uncomfortable and the sheets were just sad. I wasn't even warm at night they were so thin. The only thing I was glad about was that it was only $65 a night and that I hadn't made full rack rate for the room.

Got the hotel thru Priceline which said it was a 3.5 star hotel. When I checked in, the front desk person was very pleasant and did not make a big deal out of the fact that I got my room at a cheap rate. I asked if there is a renovated section of the hotel and there is, but it would cost $50 a night upgrade. We decided to just keep our room. Parking is $18 a day with no where else to park. Our room was on the second floor of a motel-style building (outdoor hallways which my wife did not like). The room was small. Two queen beds but could not walk along the side nearest the window. The decor was fine. There was a larger mini-fridge (I mean bigger than the little usual square dorm fridge) and a microwave. Nice large flat-screen TV maybe 46\" or larger. Bathroom was clean. Soft matresses which were not comfortable to me but as we were leaving a huge Serta semi was pulling into the parking lot! The room was obviously renovated at some point but the work looked a bit unprofessional. I didn't mind it too much but I know some reviewers would not like it and share photos of bad tile grout or paint jobs. Overall, we had a decent stay. The only problem I had was that it doesn't seem like a 3.5 upscale hotel. The newer side, however, is probably much nicer and maybe deserves the 3.5 star rating.

While the Dana is within walking distance of Marine World, there is little to no access to any beach, for that you need to cross the causeway and there you will find great beaches. The Dana is, or appears to be, a multi-use hotel resort. Attached to it is a marina with private docks, and apparently the members of the marina have full access to the pool - because this is where I stopped a violent attack by a drunken marina slip owner on a female guest. The man had obtained his alcohol from the poolside bar at The Dana, and was quite intoxicated when he was using loud profanity around the woman's children. When she confronted him on the issue, it turned ugly and he punched her in the face before I could intervene. The man had been warned about his behavior by hotel staff, but the staff members left the area after doing so. I told the man to leave, and he decided to run away when he believed the police had been called after he punched the female guest. It was then that I realized that the hotel had NO security on until 9pm and the police are understaffed, it took six hours for a police officer to respond to take the report. Of course by then the man was unidentifiable. The hotel was reluctant to admit to me that marina slip owners had the right to use the bar and pool. I would not recommend that a family use the main pool because of the poolside bar service and the access granted by drunken locals with little/no supervision by staff. The Dana has an arrangement with a restaurant that is adjacent to the hotel, and the food was acceptable but nothing to rave about. The rooms in the area we stayed were dated and somewhat cramped, there are three buildings that are newer and widely separated from the main hotel, these suites are more expensive, but it would be worth it to stay at those instead as they also have private balcony's. The rooms in my area were adjacent to a major road and the noise level was quite high, although I think that was mostly due to directly facing the roadway, not all rooms face that direction. The air conditioning barely kept up with the heat and internal humidity. There were very very few restaurants within walking distance, and NO beach. The hotel did give me a 20 percent discount for the assault having occurred. What dismayed me the most was the admission by the police officer who eventually showed up that San Diego had lost a sizeable chunk of it's veteran police force to retirement issues, forcing them to put new officers on the street who had not passed their field training. I'm a police officer and this alarmed me to the extent that I do not think I would vacation in the San Diego area again, if you get attacked, there are just no officers who are available to respond to an emergency. With the alcohol and party atmosphere that you usually associate with vacation spots like these, I'm used to a hotel having private security to keep their guests safe. I guess there's a reason they are slightly cheaper.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Allentown, PA", "Title": "\u201cOne of our most positive experiences in ages!\u201d", "Author": "SamLucky", "ReviewID": "UR77891981", "Content": "It is so very difficult to pick a hotel across the country without knowing anything but what you read.

As we walked through the grounds of the hotel we could see into other rooms that were being serviced by housekeeping and they did appear to be pretty dark and dingy so it is definitely worth getting into the new block if you can. Overall the hotel has a feel of a large motel - absolutely fine for us but if you are looking for a romantic getaway, this hotel isn't for you particularly not in July. The hotel pools were small and crowded so we didn't use them. They also charge for parking - $16 / night but only for 2 nights so if you're staying for longer, the other nights are free. The hotel is well placed to use as a base to explore San Diego. They run a shuttle to Seaworld which is very close by. We walked back from Seaworld because we wanted to leave at a non shuttle time and it only took 15-20 minutes. Thy told us at checkin that our room rate included a credit towards breakfast which was great (and a surprise) so we ate at the Blue Pearl restaurant every morning.

They do provide a regular lock plus 2 auxiliary door locks but I was never truly secure. They do have safes in the room, be sure to use it for your smaller valuables (laptop, jewelry, etc). The room was fine as far as that goes. Bed was comfortable. However there were several lights that didn't work or the switches mysteriously either did nothing or did several things. Weird. The light in the shower was burned out as well as one of the lamps. The clock radio is a joke. The batteries in the TV remote were dead (I can't make this up) we used some spare batteries from our camera flash (they are AA in case you need to plan).

Okay, so it has taken a while to write this review, but after staying for a really nice 4 day break on our first visit to the Us from Australia in June 2007, I was absolutely flabbergasted when the hotel had the audacity to charge me for the room again in the Novemeber of 2007.

I argued again that we had only paid for one, but were told the booking was made for two rooms, so after arguing for a good 20 min\u00c3\u00bates in vain, we took the second room with the understanding that this was covered by our booking and pre-paid vouchers. . 6 months later, I spent over two months dealing with my bank here in Australia, ringing San Diego and badgering Qantas, all to no avail. It cost me in the end around $800 for the room extra and $200 for the calls and loss of my time and patience. In defence of Qantas, they were exceptional, supplying me with dockets, booking references and everything they could to ensure that I was getting all the help I could from them. Qantas confimed they had only booked one room and had the documentation to back this up. The facts of the matter are, the staff in this hotel were incompetent, incapable and lied to international guests who had no way to defend themselves at a later date when they were out of the country . Instead of checking up with Qantas, as any good property would do and clearing it up, before the customer arrived the room was booked nearly 6 months in advance), The Dana waited 6 months and then slugged me the bill for almost$800 in a very sneaky and underhand way, as if I would not notice this on my credit card.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cBEST STAY ON THE BAY\u201d", "Author": "Williegeorge84", "ReviewID": "UR74634248", "Content": "The Dana is a terrific find.

The rooms were the Deluxe Bay View Premium guest rooms which were located by the marina and provided magnificent views. The furnishing and decor were exceptional. The rooms contained a small refrigerator, a wet bar and microwave. The small sitting room provided an area that we could all meet for \"happy hour.\" At around 10:00 each night, we could view the fireworks from Sea World right outside our patio. Parking was limited and we were charged $16.00 each for the first two days. I'm not sure why we were charged for only the first two days, but if you don't get back early to the hotel from your day and evening out, you will have to park quite far from your room. The girls at the front desk were adequate, but they certainly could have been a little more friendly and accomodating. We left our cell phone number because one room wasn't ready. Within a few minutes, while we were eating at their Blue Pearl Restaurant, we received a call that the room was available. After thirty minutes, we went to the front desk and were told that we had to wait a few minutes because some guests were removing their luggage from the room. (???) I'm not sure why they made the call to tell us the room \"was ready.\" Of the three rooms, my husband and I had a first floor room. Thank goodness the rest of our family were on the third floor. However, we wanted this room so that we could walk out on the grass to the marina. This was a HUGE MISTAKE! If at all possible, never get a room on the first floor. The noise level from the guests directly above us was completely intolerable. Were they walking and throwing things exceptionally loud and on purpose? Were they doing anything extra, like jumping jacks or other exercises? I don't know...just be aware that you do NOT want a first floor room if you enjoy quiet and solitude when you can be alone. They had arrived quite late at night, after we had gone to bed, so this was truly an annoying situation. We complained two nights into our four-night stay, but were informed that there were no other rooms available. The last night was so horribly loud that I honestly thought I'd go sleep in the car. I would have, too, except the car was parked quite away from our room (see above advisory about getting back to your hotel room early). Upon checking out, we again complained and mentioned our previous complaint and lack of action. The management gave us a fraction of each nights' room off ($50.00) to placate us, but honestly, I don't think that made up for two nights of no sleep. So, to sum it up: EDUCATE yourself Be aware that you will pay $16.00 to park (times 2), and you may have to park quite a ways from your room. Also, you do NOT want a first floor room.

Especially since asking that I would have a renovated room, I did expect more. The carpeted area was stained and the one of the bedcovers somewhat frayed.

Right from the start they were very helpful and polite. Although they had no record of having an adjoining request with our friends, they were quick to change our rooms and accomodate us. We had an average type hotel room in the older, but renovated section. It was clean and decor was fine. The best part was that it was on the bottom level and opened onto our own patio and then onto a lush grassy courtyard close to the tropical pool. This was a great location for the kids. It was on the 400 building. There are other buildings/rooms on the property without such a nice view/location, so be sure to ask for what you want - we just lucked out! We had \"free\" breakfast for two adults included (booked through Alaska Vacations) and this was basically a $20 credit to their restaurant. With careful planning and sharing with kids, we were able to keep our additional cost below $5 (we also had food in the room for kids in AM too like yogurt and fruit). The Dana is a great location, only 5-10 minutes away from most places you want to go, but it feels out of the main city and it is right on the bay.

This is where we were orginally placed(TRUST ME...the online pictures are not what you get and the price is SO NOT WORTH IT). There was NO way I was going to stay here with my kids, and asked the front desk if we could get out of our reservation. This is where this place excels. Their customer service is OUTSTANDING. The woman at the front desk immediatly apologized and asked if she could move us to the newer part of the property at a discounted price(to upgrade it was only $30 a night instead of $60...still...I shouldn't of paid what I did in the first place). The newer part of the property is the Water's Edge. These are actual hotel rooms that are sized the way a room should be sized and even had a patio. MUCH NICER. Bottom line, the outstanding customer service is still not enough for me to ever stay here again. Overall, the property is dumpy and dirty. The location is great, but I would shop around before I booked a room here.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cRead the reviews and find another hotel.\u201d", "Author": "andiebee", "ReviewID": "UR46043950", "Content": "My boyfriend wanted to treat me to a beautiful weekend away in San Diego, so he booked a 'marina view' room at The Dana for Saturday night and Sunday night. What we got was a room with a better view of the parking lot than the marina that smelled very strongly of mildew, with stains on the carpet, a loud wall a/c unit, and very old furnishings and bed linens. We were also told only upon check-in that we would be in a room specially equipped for the handicapped, which wasn't so much of an inconvenience (to us, but would've been to the disadvantage of a handicapped individual who may have needed the room) as a surprise, as we weren't told we'd be given this room beforehand. When we went back to the front desk to complain about all of these things, we were given no alternatives or 'extras' for our discomfort--only a suggestion to come back the next day and ask about switching rooms. We were never notified that this hotel was mostly old but had a newer section, and only found out when it occurred to my boyfriend to ask about a newer section explicitly. So after being reluctant to enjoy the hotel's amenities due to an immature post-wedding crowd smoking and having splash fights in the hot tubs and pools, we decided to retire early in the mildewed room, only to be woken up every half hour by other guests making noise outside until 3:30am. The next day, we again explained our disappointment in our experience at The Dana, including our surprise at being given a room equipped for the handicapped, and were offered a 'bay view' upgrade to one of the newer rooms at a discounted rate of an extra $25--normally $50 for the upgrade. It didn't have the king-sized bed we had in the first room, but two queens, which we were told this new room had, would've been fine. We took it and when we got to our room, lo and behold, another room equipped for the handicapped! Its beds were full-sized, not queens. Regardless, we were more pleased with this second room, which was significantly newer and had a beautiful view and a sliding glass door onto a patio overlooking the bay, but still do not feel it is worth the money The Dana gets for any of their rooms. The next morning before checking out, I found a card in our room notifying guests that if the hotel-supplied bathrobes were not in the room upon check-out, the hotel would assume that we intended to buy them and would charge us. I called the front desk to inform them that we hadn't received any bathrobes to wear during our stay, and was transferred back-and-forth to \"someone else who could help me\" 3 times, without reaching anyone, before giving up and bringing the card in person to check out. We mentioned these things, and the $12/night parking fee (and they have a nerve charging for parking anyway) was waived for us. Its only saving graces are the view, the large hot tub and infinity pool and surrounding seating area/main entrance, and a very friendly concierge who pointed us to a great breakfast spot in the Gaslamp Quarter.

When we booked this hotel we got a great rate through Hotels.com amounting to a 50% discount which we thought was a steal. Having stayed there now we feel that was probably a fair price. Had we paid full price I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have been disappointed. We booked a deluxe bay view suite so were accommodated in the newer section of the resort. We did have a quick look at the rest of the accommodation and would agree with most of the other posts on here that the bay view rooms are the best bet. Our room was on the ground floor (1st floor for all you yanks reading this) so we would also say that if you can request one on the 2 floors above this you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get the best return. The location of the hotel is also very good, not far from the airport, right next to Seaworld and very accessible. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also right on the bay so the surroundings are very pleasant. When we checked in we were told that there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in our room as the carpet has been cleaned but would be removed shortly. As it turned out it was gone when we got to the room but unfortunately the smell of damp wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We stuck it for one night and then asked to be moved, which happened without any problems. It turned out when we got into the new room and turned on the air conditioning it was leaking onto the carpet so I suspect this was the issue in the original room. In the end we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need the aircon so the problem went away. Other than this we could really have no complaints other than the room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have great lighting which was only a problem when we were changing and had to close the blinds to prevent prying eyes on the outside (another drawback of the ground floor). There were 2 queen beds, a fridge, microwave and sink as well as a safe and TV (which was never switched on during our stay). The bathroom was spacious and clean, as you would expect with room enough for 2 people to get ready. As some other reviewers have mentioned there was a $30 a day credit that could be used for breakfast in the Blue Pearl restaurant (not including tips) but we found this to be plenty for 2 adults and the range of breakfast options and quality of the food was very good. Because of this we decided to eat there one evening but found the options were a bit more limited so ate elsewhere for the rest of our stay. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat in the other restaurant on site but we did have drinks in the bar where the staff were friendly (which could be said for all of the staff we encountered while we were there) but it did turn out to be quite pricey. A little bit disappointing was the charge of $12 per night for car parking\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6nowadays you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect that to be free.

Overall we were very happy with this hotel, we booked a large bay view suite that had two queen sized beds (ideal for our family of 4). The hotel is nicely located about 1 mile from the fantastic Mission beach (it isn't \"on\" Mission Beach though) with it's great surfing and sunbathing opportunities - we walked this everyday but it can be hardwork if it's very hot. The location is perfect for Seaworld. There is a little noise from aircraft taking off from the nearby airport as the Dana is under the flightpath but it didn't really bother any of us and didn't affect our sleep;- it was pretty quiet overall. The room we booked was large, comfortable and had a nice en-suite bathroom. There was a fridge in the room which was very useful to store simple things such as milk, fruit and of course a few beers! The beds were comfortable and we had sufficient pillows. The rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day and we had sufficient clean towels provided every day throughout our stay. There are two restaurants at the hotel;- the Blue Pearl and Firefly. We didn't eat at Firefly but had three evening meals at the Blue Pearl. The food there was pretty good quality but the service was patchy to say the least. Our first meal was excellent and at about $90 for the four of us was good value. Our second night proved interesting in that the waitress decided she was going to remove any unnecessary dishes, plates, cutlery etc within two seconds of them being finished with by us (you could argue efficient but I would say annoying). This led us to feel we were being over-watched and scrutinised and I only left a modest tip of about 10% of the bill. On check out on our final day I was horrified to find that my RECEIPT FOR THIS MEAL HAD BEEN ALTERED to add a further 20% to that particular bill. Naturally I queried this with the receptionist at check out but she didn't seem too concerned at something that is probably illegal (in Britain we call this \"theft\") and certainly didn't offer a refund of the money in question (a relatively paltry $18) and has not contacted me by telephone or e-mail as I had requested to clarify what had occurred. Our third (and perhaps thankfully final) dinner at the Blue Pearl also proved interesting in that there was something wrong with one of every course we ordered between the four of us;- my eldest daughter had buffalo wings that had pure tabasco sauce on them (not the bbq that we'd requested) and hence were inedible. My youngest daughter ordered a toasted cheese sandwich that had peanut butter inside it and no cheese! My wife had a chicken and pasta dish that had no chicken in it whatsover (perhaps a chicken had run through it?). After a few complaints the waiter realised that by this time we were getting a bit piss_d off and offered us free desserts (a nice touch) as a result. What a shambles though. These latter two events didn't really spoil our stay though and we would certainly return to the Dana or recommend it to a friend.

However, there are a few things that made me unhappy about this \"resort\" (and I use that term loosely). All in all the hotel was clean, located conveniently next to SeaWorld, and was in a \"quiet\" location, away from the hubbub of the beach. It is in a really pretty setting, right on the bay with it's own docks, 2 heated pools, water activity rental center and more. So what's the problem? Coming from a hospitality work background, a few things were off. The Bad: -They charge you to park in their parking lots. To me, this is outrageous and I'm not really sure if other hotels in the area do the same. You're already staying in their hotel, have paid the room rate for the day and if you drive in, you have to pay an additional $12.00 per day to park AT YOUR HOTEL! -Their rooms are inconsistent. We stayed in the 500 block of rooms. The room was clean, but the case goods were dated and old looking as was the rest of the decor. The television in our room was an older, non-flatscreen television with pretty terrible Lodgenet reception (lots of lines and static). When we went to the pool, we noticed the more prime located rooms near the pool were much more updated looking with newer tv's. Would be nice for them to offer the same comforts to all of their guests. -The Blue Pearl hotel restaurant was overpriced. The food wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything special either. Good if you're hungry and cranky and want to eat immediately. We got to the restaurant around lunchtime, I guess, and I'm not sure if the employees are comp'd meals from the restaurant or if they order them, but the flood of employee lunches was backing up the kitchen, making for a pretty long wait to get our food. My advice would be to extradite the guests orders, not the employees. Did not eat at the Firefly restaurant, but it seemed upscale and probably not really \"family friendly\". -There aren't any real perks. You have to pay to use the wireless internet (free in laundromats nowadays) which will run you a $9.99 per 24 hours. No complimentary coffee/tea or complimentary breakfast in the restaurant in the morning (also pretty common with many middle-range chain hotels these days). There wasn't HBO or any other movie channels in the scant television channel selection. The pools are free to use and there is also a free business center you can use if you need to log in to the internet without paying the fee. The water activities seemed a little bit expensive, but not terrible...and probably very doable for a couple or family with a bigger budget. -The housekeeping staff, although effective and good at their jobs, are quite loud in the morning, shouting to each other from across each side of the building. I was woken up both mornings from this and the sounds of doors bouncing against the latch locks as the housekeepers entered and exited rooms. The Good: -Free shuttle to SeaWorld. Then you don't have to pay to park ANOTHER $12.00 at SeaWorld! Shuttle times are limited and seem to get full, so if you're there when it's busy, probably best to get to the shuttle area a little early. -Pretty and peaceful setting. The garden area and tropical pool areas are very pretty as is the rest of the property...riddled with tons of palms and an array of exotic shrubbery. -Comfortable (but kind of old) beds. The pillows were nice and squishy, just as I like them...not too hard or flat. -Clean (this is a biggie for me with any hotel). I found some dust on a lampshade, but the bathroom was spotless and the carpet didn't have any debris on it. Sheets were clean and room was already made up upon checking in early. -2 heated pools and jacuzzis (really nice if you want a quieter swim as usually one of the two pools is a little less busy than the other). -Nice soap and in-room coffee amenities. To sum it up, we reserved our room through SeaWorld as a package. We paid a little bit for the room plus the SeaWorld tickets. I would suggest if you are truly interested in staying at the Dana to reserve your room directly through the hotel website or through their phone system and request a newer room or spring for the room with a view of the pool or bay. Plan on paying for the parking expense if you are driving in a rental car or your own vehicle. If you do not have a car, ask the concierge or front desk for a bus schedule. The buses looked pretty clean and the routes seemed to run through most major areas of interest. The beach on the bay isn't really swimmable, so if you want lots of beachtime, try heading up the road closer to Mission Beach and check the hotels there. Not a terrible experience, but not a romantic, thrilling or exceptional one either. The word \"resort\" has connotations of luxury, convenience and inclusiveness and The Dana didn't have much of any of those things.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel in good location - no complaints\u201d", "Author": "Galleon", "ReviewID": "UR37978077", "Content": "We stayed at the Dana for 6 nights and it was absolutely fine.

And you can just step outside your front door and watch the fireworks at Seaworld! The pool area is great, plenty beds & towels and a jacuzzi so kids were well pleased with this. We only ate in the Blue Pearl for breakfast which was fine, standard american breakfast. I did get caught out with the breakfast deal in that when I booked through Expedia I thought I was getting breakfast for 4 but the deal was actually an allowance of $30 per day. This could have been a problem if the teenagers had got up out of bed every morning! As it was, the two of us had a lovely peaceful breakfast and got coffee & toast to take back to the room for them, all within our budget. If you are on this deal, also be aware that you pay your gratuities even if within the budget. It terms of the area, you can't really walk to anywhere but Mission beach is only a few minutes drive and its only about 10 minutes to the city centre.

By the time we were finished eating, sure enough our room was ready and within a 1/2 hour of unpacking we got a call from the front desk wanting to ensure that everything was okay. We stayed in the newer part of the hotel which is called Waters Edge and had a large bayview room with two queen beds, a pull out couch (twin) and kitchenette. I would suggest that you book your room in the Waters Edge if you have more than two people to a room as the older part of the hotel appears to have smaller rooms. The bathroom was large enough that a couple of people could get ready in there without bumping into each other. Also quite liked the natural shampoo and soaps that are provided. And the room was very clean. We had booked the bed and breakfast special and received a $30 credit daily - this was enough to feed two adults and two kids (ages 8 and 10) a very good breakfast (menu had everything you could want for breakfast - granola to bacon and eggs) at the hotel's casual restaurant The Blue Pearl. Staff at the Blue Pearl were very kind and friendly and the food was good casual fare. I have to say that the concierge at the hotel made a good vacation great. She was fantastic and offered great suggestions for beaches, restaurants and also helped us rent a car. My husband had mentioned that we were going to the beach and while we were having breakfast I got a call from her offering two boogie boards for my daughters to use for the day. Impressive. Also you can buy discount tickets from the concierge to many of the local attractions. The pools were clean and attended by wonderful friendly staff that were ready to help you with anything. You must try the ceviche at the Firefly which is the formal restaurant at the hotel. While at the pool, you can order food from the Firefly (or the Blue Pearl) and enjoy it poolside. The gardens are beautiful, lush and well maintained. Our toilet got plugged and when I called the front desk , they immediately apologized for the inconvenience (okay, WE plugged the toilet!) and sent someone over right away. Location is pretty good - walking distance to Seaworld and a longer walk to Mission Beach and Belmont Park. But anything else such as the zoo, you will need a car as transit requires a couple of bus transfers and frankly you can rent a car for pretty cheap. Yes, parking is $12/day but we only rented a car for a couple of days so it didn't seem too unreasonable. I have travelled a fair bit on business trips and personal trips and have to say that the Dana was one of the best hotels that I have stayed in.

When we arrived at the airport and called for Dana's shuttle to take us to the hotel (cost about $12), we were told that the shuttles were out of commission , so we had to pay a higher-priced taxi! (we later found out that they were not allowed at the airport because of a situation between Dana and the airport). They allowed us to check in early :), but upon arrival at our room, we discovered two things: we'd been placed in the older (remodeled) section and we'd been assigned to a room on the ground floor with parked cars facing our room (think traffic in and out at night and early in the morning with accompanying headlights). We phoned the front desk to ask for the room we had originally requested. They placed us (still same older section) on the second floor -- yea -- an improvement! Next, based on the pictures on The Dana's website, we had assumed that our room had a small balcony or porch to sit and enjoy the marina view and fireworks. Not so...what appears to be a balcony or porch on the website is actually the walkway right outside the rooms! So much for sitting comfortably to watch the fireworks, which weren't directly visible from our room. Finally, be aware of their rooms if you're disabled -- NO ELEVATORS to second floor in the older section, which is MOST of their hotel! So we had the rather elderly porter help us carry our bags up the stairs after they changed our room. BIG MISTAKE -- we didn't find out until my husband was taking our luggage to the front for taxi pickup (checkout time) that the porter must have broken one of the wheels on the largest piece of our brand new luggage (not cheap) while trying to drag it up the stairs and probably banging it in the process. My husband discovered the damage when he had a hard time rolling the luggage as we were leaving our room to checkout! Of course, we had no way of proving that the damage had been done by the man, but the luggage was fine when we checked in and rolled it into the (first) downstairs room. We liked the proximity to Sea World, but the shuttle doesn't run often in either direction...so we walked (about 15 min.). The concierge was helpful with advice for downtown San Diego, and the swimming pools were not crowded. The desk staff was friendly and gave us a restaurant certificate for the room confusion (although we still didn't get what we'd originally asked Hotels.com for). The room was fairly quiet, but VERY small; comfortably fits 2 adults and definitely not more than 1 child. We were able to get around San Diego without renting a car (used public transit) and used the local train to get to Legoland --so we didn't pay Dana's daily parking charge. IF YOU BOOK THE MARINA VIEW WITH BREAKFAST: the limit on breakfast is $15 each for two people, so if you have kids, you'll have to pay for their breakfasts. EXCEPT FOR THE ROOM WE WERE ASSIGNED and the BROKEN LUGGAGE, our stay was okay. Would I stay there again? Maybe, but I'd carry my own luggage upstairs and book directly through The Dana's reservation # instead of Hotel.com. so I'd be sure to get the room I had pre-paid for.

Overall Biggest Pro: Location. Close to Expressway, beaches, Sea World. 15 mins to really anywhere (Gaslamp, Airport, La Jolla, etc.) Overall Biggest Con: Room. See many reasons below. Check-in Relatively quick, friendly staff. Room Likely my biggest disappointment. We stayed in the 800 bldg. Bottom floor, another mistake. Stay top floor! And be sure to check your bottom floor windows are locked. Ours were not. Recently renovated but VERY cramped if you get a king. Lumpy pillows, heavy nasty bedcover. Barely enough room to walk in front of the amoire. No luggage rack to put a suitcase on. No balcony or area to put your wet suit/towel if you are on the bottom floor. No fan for the bathroom, constantly steamed up all the mirrors. Window A/C unit, BLASTED you with freezing cold air out of the shower. Super annoying. Heavy LOUD doors. Constantly woke us up. As well as the staff starting to empty garbage and clean rooms super early. Big negative. 10$/day internet. A rip, in this day I hate being charged for internet. One of our outlets didn't work. Lampshades were cardboard and all bent/torn up (not a big deal, but so cheap!) Nice fridge and microwave to use for snacks. Amenities Nice pool areas. Neither were too crowded. Only used once though. Pool bar complete rip off though (10$ for a frozen drink), go to the marina deli next to the property and fill up on drinks for your fridge. Grounds nice/clean. Not really a fitness center, don't be fooled. We didn't use and just ran outside along the marina. Don't spend 10$ on breakfast there, go next door again to the marina deli, stock up on cereal/milk or get a great bagel sandwich for 3.99$ Best deal around the bay! We never ate on property, no reason to. Across the street you can get fish/chips too. Rented wave runners on the bay, that was fun, staff was nice there too. Bargain for a better rate :) Walk to Sea World. Only 15 easy minutes, and shuttle times are not really that covenient, unless you need to as you are traveling with little ones. Mission Bay and Mission Beach are so much more dirty, boring, and crowded. La Jolla is a cleaner beach though much smaller. Go there if you can, for sun, etc. Jeff's Burgers is tasty! Finally (sorry its long - but hopefully helpful!) the first couple nights we stayed at Gaslamp Holiday Inn on the Bay or something. Honestly, the beds were cozier, free wi-fi, fitness center, and closer to finer dining and bars. 15 mins to pretty much anywhere there too... might consider staying there again.

In 2008 we traveld with 2 kids and got a room in the older part of the hotel right next to the pool and it was a decent room-clean and comfortable. This year our older 25 yr old daughter also traveled with us so we made resv to stay in the new part of the hotel the bayview rooms with 2 queens and a fold out sleeper sofa, Nicer, newer rooms with more rooms since we had 5 on this trip. After the drive down from Disney that day we checked in at 4:30 pm and the check in desk said their resv showed us in the old part of the hotel not the newer more expensive bayview rooms. He said those rooms were sold out but he could put us in the old part of the hotel and bring in a roll away bed. Then move us the next day to the bayview rooms for an extra $60 per night plus $11 per night parking fee. Since our resv through AAA Disney was prepaid back in April and our voucher we had been given to show when we checked in had clearly printed on it Bayview room 3rd (for the 3rd floor.) I objected to paying more $ when I had already paid this through AAA. He finally went and spoke to his mgr who said they woudl upgrade me to the bayview rooms with no extra charge except for the parking. At this point I just wanted to get the family unpacked, into a room and get the kids in the pool. The first room was right next to the hwy and restaurant was dingy and musty, and hardly any room for a roll away. I went back and asked if they had a room closer to the pool like we stayed in last year. He had one with 1 king size bed. The room was nicer so we moved from the 1st room to that one, slept 3 in the bed, had a roll away and our air mattress, so we made do the first night. The next day we were upgraded to the bayview which is what we had origianlly paid for and had resv for. And it was a very nice room exactly what we had expected in the first place. Things were fine after that. On check out they said they had us down for staying 14 days not 4 days! So we had to straighten that out, then I complained about the parking fee since I am sure that was supposed to be covered in our AAA rsv and the fact I did not get the right room the first night. So they did waive the parking fees and gave me a coupon to get 15% discount on my next visit if we come back. I like the property, location and the newer rooms bayside. The older rooms are ok for 2-4 people but kinda small. The restaurant on the property the blue pearl is very good and reasonable. The 2 pools are nice. Just hated the mix up and their insistance that their records did not match what AAA Disney had booked for us. The problem with paying in advance you have no leverage once you check in they already have your money. So all in all a mixed experience for us this time around and we would consider looking at other options our next trip to San Diego.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cThe only place to stay in the San Diego area!\u201d", "Author": "GWushington", "ReviewID": "UR32981588", "Content": "My wife and I travel to San Diego at least four times each year and the only place we recomend us The Dana.

Our rooms had balconies where we could see the boats leaving the marina and listen to the ocean sounds. We were on the 2nd floor and always heard the sound of the people moving around upstairs. We were at an end of one of the wings, so it was reasonably quiet. The rooms had microwave, fridge, safe, t.v. as advertised and were reasonably clean. There were 'dust-bunnies' in the bathroom under the sink and counter and the first night one of the bed sheets had black marks on it and the dust ruffle on the bed had been tucked under the mattress--inspection revealed there were large stains on the ruffle. This was never changed or cleaned for the entire stay. I had bought the breakfast package which was never credited to my account and at check out time, the entire amount of $15 per adult was not completely credited to my account and the check out clerk seemed to know nothing about the breakfast package. If you actually take two rooms, and eat breakfast at the Blue Pearl, I would recommend that you charge the meals to both of the rooms--i.e. ask for separate invoices for breakfast and check early on in your stay to see that your credits are actually credited against you invoice. Cashing traveller's cheques there is difficult if the concierge does not have cash available--some have cash and others will direct you to the staff supervisor and you will have to wait in a check out line up. The shuttle to Sea World was okay, but was often full and you would either have to wait for a second shuttle 30 minutes later, or walk or drive you own vehicle. Room service was excellent and the gentleman who delivered could not have been nicer and more helpful in the delivery and then the pick up of the dirty dishes. The pool was not heated, so took a bit to get into the water at night. The hot tub was hot and good after a long day of touring the Zoo and Sea World. The price was high for the rooms considering the economy in the U.S. at this time. There is a $12/night parking charge for your vehicle. We could see the fireworks from Sea World from our balcony at night which was nice. I enjoyed an afternoon of reading and resting on my balcony and watching the boats come in and out of the harbour. I found the issue with the bathrobes and beach towels a little offensive. They leave a note saying if the towels and robes are missing they will charge your invoice. When I checked in there there were no robes in my room. When I called about this, the desk clerk said it would be noted on my file. I insisted that was not good enough and that the robes needed to actually show up in my room. I am glad that I insisted that the robes showed up because the check out staff was not well informed.

After going away to see someone in the office the chap on reception told us that we would still have to pay for one extra night for the unused room. Not a great start to the holiday which meant me hanging around in reception for nearly 3 hours as I was not prepared to pay, meanwhile leaving my family back in the room with my young daughter in tears. This was eventually sorted though and I must say the manageress who saw me was very efficient and polite. When we got settled in we realised the safe was not working so had to call reception, the guy who came was quick and again very polite. The room we booked was lovely, a duluxe balcony room with 2 queen beds. The only downside was there wasn't an extractor fan which meant opening the balcony doors each time we took a shower, normally not a problem but it was a bit chilly on our stay. The beds were very comfy and the hotel grounds were well kept. All the staff we met were great from the cleaners to the managers, a nice touch being the helpful concierge at reception. As mentioned the grounds were lovely and both pools were great. We used the marina pool which the kids loved especially the jacuzzi, all with complimentary towels. The package itself was good value and meant us being able to book a better room whilst also getting $25 a day towards food etc. We used the blue pearl for breakfast which was efficient with nice food. We did use the firefly restaurant but only for a nightcap as it was a bit too over priced, the staff in here were lovely and made us feel very welcome. Whilst here we visited Seaworld using the complimentary shuttle bus which was well organised ,again with a friendly face behind the wheel. We also did the zoo and the old town which is a must.

However the main problem we had with this hotel was the noise. We were upstairs at the end of a block and the noise from people walking up and down the stairs was bad - but the noise of the traffic outside was unbelievable.

But, we went in the room with an open mind. The room was tiny, the bed was on wheels, there was a sliding door to the bathroom with duct tape on the handle, and there was a dead bug floating in some leftover water in our shower. In addition, there was a gap of about 3-4 inches from below the door where any sort of critter could get in. We decided to stay the night since we had already paid for it and cancel our reservations for the next 2 nights. It was the worst nights sleep I had.

I booked a deluxe premium bay-view room with a breakfast package via a booking engine which made it quite clear what I was booking and paying for, but I checked Trip Advisor just the same. What I found was alarming, as several people were claiming a \"bait and switch\" done by the hotel upon check-in. My only thought on this is they booked the lowest rate on any given reservation site, but on researching many sites, could not find one that wasn't clear about the room being booked. My advice would be to specifically book a room in the Water's Edge buildings, specifically a premium bay view if you want the best view of the bay. If you're concerned about cost, book the cheaper, older rooms in the old section, but expect to get what you pay for. In our case, we feel we got MORE than what we paid for. We got exactly what we booked upon check-in, experienced GREAT service from everyone from front-desk clerk, to maid service staff, to the bartender at Firefly, the shuttle drivers and EVERYONE at the Blue Pearl. I find that if employees are treated with cheerfulness and respect, you'll generally get the same back. The breakfast package was a total of $60 for our room, which was enough to feed our family of 4, and was very good. We ordered dinner to go, and that was excellent, also. The service was fast and friendly, almost classy, given the fact it's a casual, family-friendly eatery. We only had drinks at Firefly, but as I said before, the bartender was fantastic, the drinks were great, and he even found us some bread and dipping oil. The pool by Firefly is the better pool of the two available because of the view of the bay and the fact that it's lit at night. The Tropical Pool at night was a little creepy and dark, but would be nice during the day.

My husband booked this hotel the morning we left the house so we didn't have a chance to do much of a research. Location.. Next to the Marina. If you're looking into launch your boat or anything that requires boating, this might be your perfect place. Otherwise, it is close to Sea World, it does offer shuttles from hotel to Sea World three times in the morning and three times in the afternoon. Departure times are 9:30, 11:30, and 12:30, returning time 4:30, 5:30 and 6:30 (could be a bit off since I'm working off of memory at the moment). Since we have smaller children we prefer not to take the shuttle for the flexibility, so on top of the parking we're paying at the hotel, we're also paying for the amusement park parking. Walking is 15 mins or so, which also doesn't work well with younger children. There are kayak and bikes for rental, but scenery is much limited. Our kids looked at the boats for about 2 minutes and got bored with it. There aren't any shops to browse. Hotel room: We paid the $40 upgrade to get the Marina view room. Let me describe the buildings first. It reminds you of those motels you have a open walk way and everyone's windows are facing the walk way. If you don't open up the shutter blinds the room would be quite dark, but once you do, you're pretty much open to the entire building guests that walks by.. trust me, everyone walks by just couldn't resist to take a look into your room. Since the walkway is open to the parking right infront of the building, you hear people talking in the parking lot on top of the activities in the hallway. Lucky us happens to have some guests yelling from parking lot to building 1am in the morning. Our room does have marina view... but you have to leave the blinds open to see through the hallway to see it, which was total waste to us. I do noticed a newer building somewhere on premise, but I do not even want to know how much more it would cost us. Room is quite cramped. Two beds fills up the whole room, and they managed to squeezed a tv and seating into it which makes it impossible to move around with the 4 of us. My side of the bed which is close to the window barely allows me to stand up and walk sideways, and I'm a skinny person. Windows shakes when our neighbors slams the doors or stomps in the hallway. Bedding is firm, and pillows are small and fillings aren't fluffy anymore. Room seems pretty clean, our feet stayed clean even though we're walking barefeet. I've stayed around San Diego area numerous times. This is the first place I'm incredibly disappointed with and will not return. It truely made me feel like I'm staying in a motel 6.

When checking out we were asked if there was anything they could do better and we couldn't think of anything! There are definitely two classes of rooms, which we were aware of from trip advisor when we booked. We booked a bay view room for 179US a night which included a breakfast at Blue Pearl restaurant of $15 each. We did get our price on our room by speaking directly to a person at the hotel who offered that price. The next day they offered the same deal but $10 more, so we told them that we had the offer of $179 and they gave it to us for that price. Blue Pearl is not a fancy restaurant, but the food was great, we had fabulous breakfasts for under our $15 allowance. Our room #1301 was on the 3rd floor (highly recommended to be up high) with a small balcony, close to the city park, but had a view of the bay. If I could stay at one of the buildings further to the north, it would be better, as they have a more direct view of the bay. The room was spacious, clean, well kept, tastefully decorated. People we met in the hot tub stayed at the remodeled rooms and said they were like a Motel 6, but clean and convenient. The trip from the airport cost us $12 total (not each as we had thought) The cab is about $22. We just went to information at the airport and they phoned the Dana for us and they came in about 20 minutes. Friendly service in all that we did.The shuttle going to the airport was on the hour, so we caught one at 4pm yesterday. We walked to Seaworld the first day and last day (it's more than 10 minutes, but it's fine) took a shuttle back. The free shuttles are posted 9:45 and 10:45 I think going, and 3:45 and 5:45 coming home. Seaworld has a promotion - pay for one day and have the rest of 2009 included! It was $65 but we got a discount because of AAA membership. So we went twice, enjoyed it immensely. We took the Old Town trolley tour the second day, it was $32 and they had a pick up at the hotel at 8:30 or 9:30. We took a route through Mission Beach area to pick up others, it was nice to see the different hotels. Got off at Old Town, Seaport Village, and the Coronado. It was busy and had to wait for trolleys to pick up, but all in all worth the money. We rented bikes at the Dana, $14 each for two hours but once we got going we didn't want to come back, so we paid $24 each for just over 4 hours. (bike lock and helmets included) We biked to Belmont Park and the Mission Beach area, and biked on the boardwalk for hours. We loved it. People are biking, jogging, walking, sunning (even though it was very foggy this day), surfing, etc. You just have to go up over the bridge when you first start and then after that it's all quite level. Ate at the Firefly pool side restaurant, they had bottles of wine half price that Wednesday, the food flavours were fantastic. Check on the calendar they have in the room for special deals at the restaurant. One of the only disadvantages of the Dana is that it is quite far out from other restaurants. You could bus in to Mission Beach for their restaurants, or take a cab or transit for others. If you had your own car, you of course would have more freedom. We did go to the Hyatt across the street for their pool side lounge, they do have a nice fancy restaurant, but we did not eat there on this trip. If we stayed longer we would go into town on the transit, there is a bus right across the street, and an all day pass costs $5. The concierge gave us instructions on how to bus it to the Zoo, which we did not have time for as the week went so fast! We also could have visited the zoo on our old town trolley tour if we had been better organized and earlier. Hope you enjoy your stay at the Dana. I can see how each experience and vacation would be different for everybody, and we loved our stay at the Dana.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Caorolina", "Title": "\u201cOK Hotel,Staff Leaves Much To Be Desired,Beware of Rooms Adjacent to Park\u201d", "Author": "beefydoc", "ReviewID": "UR26404201", "Content": "The best thing the Dana has going for it is it's location. I arrived after traveling from the east coast with my wife and 3 kids. I had found a good rate about 2 weeks prior to arriving and checked out reviews on tripadvisor and discovered there seem to 2 distinct class of rooms here.Those that have been renovated on the bay, and those that have not. We arrived around lunchtime andI was immediately informed the great rate I got was for an older room and that they would gladly upgrade me to a bay view room for another $50/night. With the reviews fresh in my mind, I upgraded but I really felt as though I was being played, like this goes on all day with peolpe that have gotten good online rates for the inferior rooms. It really felt like a bait and switch. Being early , I was told our room was clean but had not been checked yet. My wife was not feeling well and I asked how long it would be ( realizing we were there about 3 hours before check in. I was told \"about an hour.\" We decided to get some lunch at Ocean Beach hoping that all my wife needed was some food after a long day of travel. We got back about 2 hours later and my wife had a migraine at this point and really needed to lay down. I went to the desk ,told them my wife was ill and asked if I could check in. I was told the room still had not been checked. When I reminded the woman at the desk that she had told me the room would be ready an hour ago., she very sternly told me we were sill about an hour or so away from official check in time. Let me say, I am a stern believer in \"Don't tell me what you can't do, tell me what you can do\". This person seemed unwilling or unable to expedite our check in or to find us another room. Finally after about 30 minutes we were able to get our keys to our room. Imagine my surprise to find our room did not overlook the bay, but instead overlooked a public park. Beware that in the renovated building that has the upgraded rooms, the left one-third of the building does not overlook the bay, but a public park. Our ground floor room had a sliding glass door that opened right into the park. Needless to say we did not feel great as we saw a few homeless people walk by our patio during our stay. That being said, the room was clean and the kids enjoyed the pool. The location is hard to beat.

The check-in and check-out was seamless, and both times we were greeted by very happy people who enjoyed their jobs. The rooms without a bay view seemed a little older, so I recommend the bay view. Two very small problems in our room was one of the water glasses was chipped. I left a note for housekeeping but they did not see it. The other was the coffee pot needed a little scrubing -no problem we did it ourselves. The Mission Bay view we had was wonderful and the patio with chairs gave an initmate setting. The concerige sent me an email when we arrived home. I mentioned that we had a Lovely time and enjoyed the surroundings, the bay, pool, restaurant & bar. I told her that our room was wonderful, but I thought they should check for the chipped glass & coffee pot. The concerige emailed me back and gave us a percentage off of our next stay.

Well the paperwork we were given was very percise and said that we were not to be late. Then when we did not go for that excuse we were told that the shuttle was tied up with airport runs. If you have a shuttle that has specific times you make sure to be there and you don't schedule airport runs at the same time. The manager was barely even apologetic for the error. As for the rooms the hotel was a little run down. The bathroom walls are patched and the windows leak when it rains. The hotel could use some updating but it was a clean and comfortable room for the money. The hotel business center is hardly a business center. It is one computer that you can use in the middle of the lobby. where anyone and everyone can see you type. I would caution you to becareful with the shuttle. It is three minute ride that takes over 30 minutes. It may be worth it to pay for the parking at sea world.

Very helpful front staff. Courteous shuttle bus drivers. The hotel concierge, the very sweet and helpful Suzanne, arranged for the hotel doctor to come in to see us, and she brought us ginger ale and tea.

Easy public walkway in front of the property over to the bridge over to parks, beaches, etc. Our first room was on the first floor with marina view in older building.

We can't wait to return, and hopefully go on that cruise after all. We didn't know San Diego was so beautiful. The hotel is ideally located, but you need a car to get to a grocery store, or farther afield like the Zoo. Highly recommend the zoo and Legoland if you have little ones.

My husband booked it and I must admit to not having read TripAdvisor reviews beforehand, so maybe our disappointment was our own fault..... The hotel website shows lovely rooms, so I was quite surprised when we drove in to what appeared to be a fairly ramshackle site. Our room was in one of the older buildings, admittedly facing the marina, but opening on to a public walkway (which we had assumed would be divided into private balconies). The whole room shook every time anyone walked by and noise was a constant problem, especially at the weekend. You make a choice between privacy and natural light - if you want the latter you must have the wooden shutters open but the world and his wife can look in as they walk past. Also the walls are very thin and we could hear conversations in the next room. The bed was comfortable enough but facing it was a huge cupboard, half TV cabinet and half wardrobe; with the doors open for either function, it was impossible to walk past the bed. Off the bedroom was a space containing a double sink unit but there was no door for privacy - do I want to watch my other half brushing his teeth, or vice versa? Then off this space was the bathroom with toilet and bath, thankfully with a door. The air conditioning was incredibly noisy. It would start up like a rocket motor, clatter away and then stop altogether till the next time - like Chinese water torture if you let it bother you. We asked to move to the new block with private balconies, but they could only offer us one overlooking 'parkland' i.e. a strip of green separating the hotel from the road and for 4 nights only, so we stayed where we were. Our breakfasts were included to the tune of $15 each at the Blue Pearl, and not once could we reach this total. Hearty is the word that comes to mind! On our first night we ate at the more upmarket on-site Firefly restaurant and had a disastrous encounter with a waitress which left us feeling like we'd been part of street theatre or a 'happening' by the end of the meal. This put us off till our last night when we ventured back and to our relief were served by a very nice young man - and the meal was good as well. We were glad we kept our rental car for the duration of our stay, as it would have been hard to get around by public transport. However, we didn't like being presented with the parking charge when we checked out - not mentioned on any previous occasion. There was free computer access in the lobby, which was a bonus, and people were very good about keeping to the requested 10 minute limit if there was a queue.

Although we went to San Diego for the zoo, the location was nice. We got the corner Premium Bay View Suite with king size bed (room 2320). We got there early but they were able to check us in early, which was nice. I guess they weren't that busy since it's no longer summer. Having an active toddler we liked the size of the room. He loved going out on the balcony, opening and closing the sliding door. Having a mini fridge and wet bar was also convenient because I was able to keep all of his snacks in there. On to the complaints: When I made the reservation, I requested a crib. When I checked in (at 1:30pm), I let them know that we requested a crib-they said they'll come set it up. We went to Balboa Park, came back around 5pm and still no crib. Called the guest service and 30 min later, they brought it. It wasn't a crib, it was a small pack and play. (which my son doesn't sleep too well in) The king size bed was really bouncy and uncomfortable. My husband and I were tossing and turning and every time one of us moved, the other will bounce up and down and get woken up. After tossing and turning for 2 hours, I finally went to the couch and slept there. They didn't have any extra blankets or sheets in the room so I slept without anything over me. The air conditioning system was LOUD. I mean LOUD. If you have it on auto, it makes a HUGE clicking noise whenever it turns on. I was so worried that it would wake up our baby, I turned it off but then it got really humid so I turned it back on. Even thought we were in the newer part of the hotel and in the corner, it has no sound proofing system so you can hear the music from the pool/restaurant area and there was some weird noise all night. I think it was the elevator. The sound traveled down the hallway and right at the end of the hallway was our room and when you open the door, that's where the bed is. Bad design to have a bed right in front of the door. Every time someone slams the door, you get woken up. (and you can only close the door by slamming it since the door knob doesn't turn) If you order room service, be ware that they include gratuity already plus a $2 service fee. I wasn't paying attention to it so I totally over tipped them. The restaurants were good but felt a bit pricey for the quality of the food. Had much better dinner across the street at Red Marlin at The Hyatt. So basically, we paid extra to get a nice upgraded room but I ended up sleeping on the couch for 2 nights while my husband tossed and turned on the uncomfortable bed. I only stayed at The Dana because they had the suites at a fairly reasonable price. Should have stayed at Omni instead.

We didn't go to Sea World, but if you want to go there you can take the free shuttle from the hotel. - Pool / spa = neatly kept and perfect for relaxing - Price = we paid $70 per night on priceline which is far below full price and even below a regular Holiday Inn type hotel in the area AVERAGE - Room was pretty small, but you get what you pay for. I've seen reviews in which people were disgusted by the \"older\" section of the hotel and were upset they had to pay $60 to upgrade to an ocean view. If that's the case, then book direct and pay full price. We were willing to have the older section and a \"motel\" type room in order to save money. - Refrigerator in the room was nice NEGATIVE - Weight room = for someone who spends a lot of time working out, the place was almost non-existent. These days hotels seem to feel that putting a treadmill in a small room with mirrors qualifies as a weight room. - Movie access = we always enjoy watching movies on vacation. The room had no DVD player. We brought a portable of our own and had no way to plug it in. When we asked about it at the front desk, they said it wasn't possible, but that we could purchase movies directly on our TV. We looked into it, but the selections were minimal and it was $12 per movie! - Parking was $12 per night. We were told when we called ahead that parking was free, but apparently not for priceline customers. Even with the addition of the parking we paid $82 per night, so we can't complain, but it was an unpleasant surprise.

We call front desk and they tell us nothing can be done about it, that all the rooms in the newer section were booked. Strangely enough, they tell us they could put us in the newer section the next day (Sun. Sept. 7) for an extra $60 a night. We said forget it and wrote an email to the general manager. We put up staying in that old, nasty room for two nights. And since the walls and ceilings were so thin, we could hear every conversation and foot steps all around us. On Sept. 8, we got a call from the supervisor (I believe her name was Vanessa), saying they got our email and would like to put us in the newer room with the king bed for no additional cost. Of course we took it, and we were able to spend our last two remaining nights in the room we had requested. The differences between both rooms were night and day.

Like other guests we also were wondering about the parking fee they charge, which seems to be invented after 2005 (12 Dollars per day!!!). But we still were looking forward to our stay. After our first night the housekeeping forgot to prepare our room, if this would have been happen once, we wouldn't mind, but this happened three times during our five days stay and we had to call the reception every time! Instead of an excuse we just got the info, that this is normal if there is a \"Privacy please\" sign outside or that the housekeeping will take care in the afternoon - unfortunately we removed the signs after 10 am and usually came back in the evening to our room. So for people who very appreciate cleaning on time we can't recommend The Dana. Beside the Housekeeping the reception staff was also less friendly than 3 years before and because of the new invented \"Pool parties\" and \"Cocktail Happy Hours\" the other guests changed enormously, so for example we avoid the tropical Pool thanks to dizzy guests or awakened on our last night when a drunken guy were banging and slamming the door next to our room and screamed on his wife (?) to get excess.

There is a bar at both pools so guests can have a drink or two. The are two restaurants that serve meals all day. The Wildfire is a great restaurant but is pricey. I got the feeling that there are not too keen on kids as the chef refused to serve bowls of icecream for dessert . However that said they make a fantastic creme brulee! The Blue Pearl is very much like Dennys, but it serves good , fast and yummy breakfasts.

The Good: *The standard room was really nice, clean and modern, with a large comfortable bed and large LCD tv. A/C and shower were good - the price wasn't too bad either. *Tried the Blue Pearl restaurant, staff were nice and food was pretty good in quality and price (for a hotel). They also had a more pricey one called Firefly, but didn't try it. *Ordered the free shuttle back to the airport on departure and it was there and ready to go on time. *Walked to Seaworld in about ten minutes, although they also run a shuttle three times a day (ask the concierge for times). *The pools looked really nice but didn't fancy them as the air temp was about 65F. The Bad. *On arrival at SD airport we called the hotel and were told by staff to wait in the wrong place for the complimentary airport shuttle wasting about an hour and a half, although after that were told to get a taxi which they refunded. *One night around 4am heard a gnawing either on the roof or in the ceiling which was really loud. I put up with it maybe an hour and finally called reception told them there was something trying to chew it's way in. Was told that maintenance wouldn't be in until 8am and that they'd take a look - we didn't leave that morning until 11am and nobody came. When we got back there was no real sign of anyone checking our room out. My partner called the front desk to find out what had been done - their reply was \"We don't get animals on OUR roof\" and that was it. Most of their staff seemed fine, so I won't judge them all by this one guys attitude, but to say it stank is an understatement. Other notes of interest: *When booking, pay attention to which rooms you book, the premuim rooms are all in a newer larger building with good views over the marina, the standard rooms are layed out like a motel (external corridors, no balcony, etc) - although inside were of a good standard. *Check in really is at 4pm and wasn't negotiable, unless you pay $60 a night more for a room upgrade. Those are magically available. *The area shuts down after about 6pm, so if you've not got a car you're limited to the hotel restaurants (and the other hotels nearby) or public transport out of there. *If you've not got a car you've a couple of choices because you're not in walking distance of anywhere except Seaworld. 1.

Pacific Terrace is the Ritz and the Dana is Motel 6. When we got there our TV wasn't working, upon investigating we discoverd that it wasn't plugged in. I had placed our little ice chest on the floor next to the mini fridge and soon saw a bug crawling on it. I then decided not to put any suitcases or bags on the floor. When I went to wash my hands and dry them with a \"clean\" towel I found a very long, thick, black hair on my hands (and it wasn't mine, not even close). My boyfriend went to use the bathroom and couldn't get the door to shut and stay shut. In the morning we awoke to screaming kids running up and down the outside walkways and hearing the converstiaons of the room next door to us. We had left the property for about 5 hours and came back to find our room the way we left it. Housekeeping had yet to come and service our room. We decided to go speak with the people at Pacific Terrace and they were WONDERFUL. They allowed us to move over for the remainder of our stay and upgrade our room to an exceutive suite at no additional charge. I would recommend Pacific Terrace in a heart beat. As for the Dana, absolutly NOT! We checked out of The Dana and told them we had an emergency. The emergency being we were moving to the Pacific Terrace at once.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "WorldTravelerArizona", "ReviewID": "UR14577005", "Content": "I wrote a review last week shortly after returning from my cruise and a stay at the Dana; however, I do not see it posted here.

The shuttle service is great but one tip is when you phone a few days before to confirm your room choice is available also get the # to call for their shuttle service from the airport and then you can phone them as soon as you arrive. If you have time the city trolley tour is well worth the money at $30. The Dana shuttle service will get you to old town. We did upgrade to the Bay view rooms and the room lived up to it's name.

We stayed at Dana Mission Bay for 3 nights. I actually looked at the pictures on this site and on their website to see how it looked like. Unfortunately, I did see the good side of the buildings but not the older side. So this is actually more to show you guys how the rest of the building looks like and my amateur review of the hotel. Good: Customer service was great! I actually booked on the wrong dates but Gary, the front desk guy, booked me in without any problems. I have to say that these people are really very good. At the restaurant, their service was excellent too. The manager, ANna, was going around making sure everyone was happy. They really make you feel like it is a four star joint. Food was good too. Location was also good. However, we were too busy to enjoy the bay since we were out all day. By the time we got back, it was dark already. Perhaps, during the summer months with longer day, a guest can have more time to enjoy the sunset. The room: Its renovated with granite counter tops and nice looking tile in the bathroom. Microwave and small fridge are included. The room looks good (see pictures). BAD: Nothing serious! I thought that the price for the hotel was a bit much. The place looks like it should be $75 to $89 per night type of a place. Not that it run down but just comparing it to other 3 star hotel that I've been too. Most of what you will pay for is the location (see pictures). WATER was too hot. If you got kids, watch out. HOWEVER, their bay view rooms are located in the newer building, which looks pretty good (did not go inside / see pictures) Overall, this was a nice place to stay in. Quiet and comfortable bed to sleep on. The hotel is really trying to be a four star hotel. The service is a four star but the place is a 3 star because its an old building looking like an old motel but beautifully remodeled. If you choose pool view, 1st floor is best since it has a patio. If you choose marina view and actually want a view from your room, go to the second floor not first. Careful of the hot water.

Good things about the property are that it is a nice area with plenty of nice walking paths and, as it turned out to be positive given my experience here, there are number of liquor stores nearby. Believe me you'll need that extra drink here. This entire property is set up to up-sell and cross-sell. It starts the second you walk in. They immediately try to pawn off a higher- priced room. I am sure it was a coincidence that they did not have a king bed ready for me, as reserved but I was offered an upgrade to a more expensive room that had one and was immediately available - how much luckier can you get? When I refused I was told check-in was at 4PM. Anyone who travels even once in a while is probably thinking the same thing... 4PM? Particularly since check out is at noon. However, they are happy to point out that the property has two restaurants and a bar and why not just \"wait\" there. I had arrived at 1:30 which made the bar option rather undesirable and the restaurant choice a bit too forced. There is no coffee shop. I was told there was no WiFi access unless checked in, which turned out not to be true. Not being able to do any work or want to drink, I was forced to wonder around, as did some other early arrivals as well. When you finally check in and see the buildings you immediately wonder what possessed you pick this hotel. The buildings are old (at best 1960s) and look it. The rooms are poorly designed - the TV, for example, is not centered in relation to the bed (the only place you can realistically watch TV) so if you are watching with someone else, one of you is going to have neck cramps. There is a HUGE GOD AWFUL replica of Van Gough in my room that covers almost all of the north wall and, being something like 5' by 3' (yes, that is FOOT) it made the king-size bed look and feel like a dormitory bunk. I am sure the painting that huge is covering something but I was too afraid to move the painting to see. WiFi in the room is an adventure. It was off and on and off and on... When I called for help they said I need to call and 866 support number, which is fairly normal in hotels. However, while giving me the number, the attendant stopped at 1-866 to take another call and kept me waiting for around 3 minutes before giving me the rest of the number. Quite amazing, actually...And, yes, I could hear him talk to another person on the phone about what they needed. My guess is that the other call was from a more expensive room so I got summarily bumped without so much as \"I need to look that number up\" excuse. I finally got the WiFi working after talking to another guest who had managed to get through the support number but the service was lost every few minutes. Finally got tired of the WiFi problem and went looking for the \"business center\"..Well, its a single computer, placed about 3 feet from the men's room door which is the closest one to the pool. I would live with the constant door slamming and in-and-out of the bathroom if the computer actually worked. It did not. Giving up hope on the computer, I tried to solicit help from concierge. She was very helpful in getting me the restaurant information I was looking for but not before reviewing the entire menu for the hotel's two restaurants, offering to make a reservation at the hotel restaurant, and basically making me work to get the number for the restaurant I really wanted to try. Another exciting discovery when its time to shower...another first...I had to stretch to reach the shower head to adjust it and I am almost 6 feet tall. You'll probably have to do a couple of jumping jacks if you are shorter! The next surprise is when you are out of the shower and pick up a towel and your immediate reaction is confusion. I had never before seen dollar store towels in a \"resort\"...They also charged me extra for room with a view...if you are on the first floor your \"view\" is going to be the car that is parked in front of your window. Don't bother paying extra for it. I wasn't really here for the view so I didn't care but, in my opinion, charging more money for a view for first floor units is absolutely an outrageous deception and nothing short of larceny. My favorite \"Oh Myyy God\" here was when I saw their flyer for $4.00 Bloody Merrys between 8 AM and 11 AM (yes that is AM - no typo) and that, right there, should give you a pretty good idea about this hotel's clientale. O-M-G!! And, finally, for the piece de resistanc... there is no vent in the bath room and you have to rely on a window to freshen up the bathroom after use. Well, being right on the marina, the wind direction is generally on-shore which pushes all the bathroom smells right into the room. Very pleasant if you want to have a conversation or do almost anything else, except leave. There are too many other really nice properties in this area to be putting up with this nonsense. Dana is again proof that pre-paying for hotels is really REALLY a bad idea.

The room was so small that one had to climb over the bed if another person was putting clothes in the closet to get past them.

The manager did upgrade our room to the newer section, but gave us a room overlooking a public bathroom in Mission Bay Park.

The hotel is located in a public park, Mission Bay Park, which the homeless use for shelter, and there apparently was no on site hotel security. We didn't encounter any security personnel during our long trek over the entire property one night searching for a bottled water vending machine. The grounds and walk ways are very poorly lighted. Finally, unlike the nearby Bahia and Catamaran Hotels, which offer a Manager's Reception to guests once a week with complimentary wine, cheese and fruit platters, this property does not offer such a reception.

The Firefly at Dana has MUCH better food and the staff there is friendly and efficient. Its a bit pricey, but hit them up during happy hour for drink specials. Also, the Dana is great if SeaWorld is in your plan. We walked and it took about 15 minutes to get there. And after visiting the Brewmaster Club there for 'beer tasting', we were glad we walked!

The Carnival Spirit was the only ship in town and debarked at 4pm, for security reasons they wanted passengers on board no later than 3pm. Well, the Manager of the Dana tried to tell me debarkation time was 5pm not 4pm and he said: you go on the Norwegian ship. Well, I dont know what planet he is on, but he was wrong on both counts. Strike Two. The only shuttle from the hotel to the pier was going at 2:30pm, which takes 15 minutes and if there is a traffic problem you can wave your ship goodbye. Strike Three. While I waited for my taxi at 1pm I talked to a couple from B.C. and they had the same argument with the manager, but he did not care, maybe he runs a taxi service on the side?

The Dana is a very scenic hotel at a very decent price. My first impression of the hotel, even before I reached, was that it was very customer friendly. When I called saying that I was stuck in Old Town Station with no transportation, the staff offered to send their driver to pick me and my friends up. When we reached the Dana, we agreed that it was one of the nicer looking hotels for the price range we're paying. The rooms are located in different buildings, giving it a tropical terrace feeling. The landscape design is very nice and I enjoyed walking around the Dana. Check in was quick. I took a standard room with 2 queen sized beds for four of us. We slept soundly. Room was spacious and clean. The only complaint I have about the room is that the air conditioning and heater is a tad bit too loud. But once it gets to the temperature you set and shuts down, it's a peaceful night's sleep. It's in a very convenient location - about 10 - 15 minutes walk to SeaWorld. The hotel also provides a shuttle service to SeaWorld. One down side is that the restaurant there, Blue Pearl, is quite pricey. Definitely not for students trying to save money. However, it's located near Pacific Beach (PB) with lots of shops and restaurants. For those without cars, the public transport system in SD is very decent and will definitely get you where you're headed without much hassle. The Dana is a 10 minute bus ride from PB center and buses are pretty frequent. Had dinner at Great Moon Buffet - wonderful American, Japanese and Chinese cuisine for decent price (12 bucks for dinner buffet). There are also boat and bicycle rentals in the Dana itself. For those who are more adventurous, the prices aren't too bad. Check out was quick. However, we left our luggage with concierge for half the day. It took them at least 20 minutes to recover our luggage. They stored it in a different building and I was glad that they came back as a whole. This part spoiled the whole Dana experience for me. Overall, very nice hotel. The staff is friendly, just a bad experience with waiting on the last day.

The rooms are equipped with microwave, small fridge and a small bar sink. We stayed in the new section and I would highly recommend the new section as the old section does not look good. Try to get a room in the new section on the third floor to get the best views but if you have little ones it's nice to have the bottom floor as they have a nice grass area to play some ball or just sit on the lawn and capture the view. It's very close to Seaworld but not walking distance but easy access to everything. The only down side is that you are unable to hook up your own XBOX 360 or anything that would use the video inputs. They do it on purpose so you have to buy their games and/or movies. So when you have kids and you want to bring their XBOX, Wii or Playstation or a DVD Player you will be unable to hook it up and they do not rent out DVD players (again they want you to buy their movies) which is really petty and ridiculous in my opinion. Use the concierge they were very helpful in recommending places to eat. Overall the experience was great and I read many of these reviews complaining about the staff and honestly I think people demand a certain service but this isn't a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons. For the price in comparison to Paradise Point it was good value. Paradise point feels more private and secluded and if you stay at their bay front rooms it's phenomenal but then you are paying over $600 a night it's pricey and the rooms are not that large and not renovated. Even just their bay view rooms are cramped and cost $400 - $500 a night.

I-5 and I-8 are both very close, so you can easily access anywhere else in the city quickly, including the zoo, airport, old town, Gaslamp, etc, etc. The only reason I did not give the property a \"5\" rating is because the parlor part of the suite did not have its own A/C vent, so it heated up substantially more than the bedroom during the day.

From the moment we arrived at your property for or anniversary trip on Monday 8/13, our stay did not bode well. Since there was no valet, we parked where we could and walked to the lobby for check in. At check in, after waiting 25 minutes in line, discovered that our reservation for a 2nd floor marine/harbor view was non existant. Reservations had us in a first level view of the parking lot. When I had them correct the problem, and we went through the paperwork procedure for check in, we were told that a second floor room was not yet available but \"give me your phone number and I'll call you.\" Good thing I had my cell! Then we were told to get a bite to eat or \"something\" until we were called. This from a man who was obviously afraid his face would crack if he attempted a smile. We went to your \"Firefly\" restaurant. Sat outside but I finally went inside to get someone to help us; couldn't understand why there was no wait staff available since the indoor dining room was totally vacant. Ordered drinks and lunch. Food was quite good but service was very slow. Noticed that none of the staff even bothered to walk the pool area to determine the needs of any other guest. A lot of revenue lost there, you people. So, where were they??? Also discovered that the only lavatory facilities were back in the lobby area!! Received THE phone call at 3:45 PM announcing that our room was \"ready.\" I indicated to the clerk that called that we hoped we would not have to stand in that long line again to get our keys; yes, he said, indeed we would. We reported back to the gestappo, got back in line and, after another 25 minutes, received our keys to the kingdom. Our request (yes, we had to request!) for a bellman to deliver our luggage to our room was met with a blank \"you must be kidding\" stare. Another clerk finally called someone and assured us that our luggage would be taken care of. After waiting outside for 15 minutes, we asked a young man if he was the bellman; no, he was the shuttle driver but would be happy to handle our luggage. He did; didn't know what to do with the bags in the room but that was okay since it wasn't his job anyway. At least he got a good tip! We drove ourselves to Building 600 and entered our \"spacious\" room #615. This room is so small that two pygmies could only pass one at a time to the bath area. Peeling paint and buckled wallpaper seemed to be our clerk's pick of the day. I turn our bed down every evening, but in a hotel, I expect it to be done. Your abode is nothing more than a glorified Motel 6. Our friends picked us up at your marina for a wonderful harbor cruise - not of your doing by any means. That evening, with pillows over our heads to drown out the sounds of children from the pool, stairs, all areas, we slept. The following morning we were ready for breakfast. Unfortunately, your misleading signs indicated by arrows that the restaurant was \"thataway\" without knowing how far. It was very upsetting to watch my husband (87 years old and one of the first to land at Normandy on D-Day) force himself to walk from the lobby area (where we thought the restaurant would be) all the way to that coffee shop you have at the end of the property. With proper signage we would have known and driven from our self parked car! On Wednesday, we had an excellent breakfast at another property. At 4:00 PM we went to the Concierge desk with some questions/requests. Since there was an empty chair, we inquired at the front desk after 10 minutes; were told that he was \"on a break.\" At 4:30 PM we left and made our own arrangements. That evening we were again serenaded by the screams and pratfalls of those pool children as we tried to sleep. I agree with one of the complaints through TripAdvisor - this was an \"unforgettable experience\" - because we will never go near nor ever forget, your Dana Hotel. So many of our friends,family and clients wanted to know of our experience at your property. I am sending them a copy of this e-mail so they will know of our experience.

Some basics first. The hotel is next door to SeaWorld, which means it's packed with families of screaming kids. Actually, The Dana is really two completely separate hotels--an old one and a new one--on the same property. So there are two restaurants (one Denny's-like and one fancy schmancy--both very good), two pools (both crowded, with loud music starting at 9am), and most importantly, two entirely different hotel experiences. The old part of the hotel is pretty much the worst decrepid motel you can imagine, where you can hear screaming kids in adjacent rooms at all hours, see light under your doorway all night, with the bed right up against the door. We switched to a newer room (the more expensive ones) after one very miserable night. The new rooms are large, quiet, and gorgeous, with balconies overlooking the bay. But here's the catch. Everything that doesn't work (the air conditioning, the light that won't turn off, etc.) requires day after day after day of calls to guest services, waiting on hold, waiting at the front desk, talking with an endless stream of downright nasty and incompetent hotel manager-types, waiting around for hours in the room for repairs that never happen, when all you want to do is get out and enjoy San Diego and to come back to a room where the basic necessities you're paying so much for actually work. It is for this reason that a stay at The Dana is a very unpleasant experience, and one that will leave you still needing a vacation.

There was a kitchenette with a small fridge and microwave (which was a necessity with an 18 mo. old). We were located on the 1st floor and had a large patio with a great view of the bay. A previous review stated that their review would have been negative had they been on the 1st floor, however, for a family with small children, we enjoyed the fact that our kids could go in and out from the patio without worrying about balcony heights. The patio was enclosed with a gate that led out to a grassy area. Yes, occasionally people passed by our room, but it really was not a big deal. The bayside pool was great, water temperature was perfect, and the poolside food from Firefly was fantastic. It was a great way to relax between 11 hour days at Legoland and Sea World. By the way, as other reviewers have stated, even though the hotel is very close to Sea World, I would recommend driving to the park as the last thing you feel like doing after a full day there is walking back to the hotel. Now, all of this does come at a price..we paid $309/nt for our room (which included breakfast for 2 at the Blue Pearl). That being said, San Diego is an expensive destination in the Summer, and I found this rate to be comparable, if not less than other hotels on the same level. I absolutely agree that the Waters Edge rooms are worth the extra money, especially with a family! We will return to The Dana in the future for its central location, great rooms (Waters Edge), and overall family friendliness!!", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cA Beautiful Setting For Culture Clash\u201d", "Author": "NeighborBGood", "ReviewID": "UR8235296", "Content": "We chose the Dana because of the favorable TripAdvisor reviews, but only after paying great attention to the warnings by many users to pay the extra for a room in the new buildings. Now I confirm for you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c BOOK THE NEW ROOMS. Our room was fabulous, and the view was wonderful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the story with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153original rooms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With the older buildings, you do still have the convenient location by Sea World, and access to both pools (old and new) but the experience cannot be the same. The Dana is essentially a Hyatt and a Motel 6 side by side, under one banner. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing wrong with a Motel 6 patron, and a Hyatt customer is no better than anyone else. However\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the two hotels have inherently different clientele, and this can lead to problems, or at least a specific one that happened to us. This dichotomy in the two hotels contained in one came to a head for us on our last night. We decided to enjoy the view from our room for one last sunset while our kids ate a delivered pizza. After dusk, we let our kids swim while we were going to enjoy dinner at the nicer hotel restaurant, The Firefly. We settled down to have an elegant dinner, enhanced by the marina ambience. Before our salads came, a group of people stumbled over from the older section (already drunk), sat next to us and proceeded to order nothing but Tequila shots and Miller Lite. Naturally, you only order shots and chasers if you have no other objective than to get wasted. Other people joined them, pulling up extra chair after extra chair, until there were 8 or 10 of them crowded around their table, ordering more shots and beers. Then the smoking began. We immediately took our salads and moved to a table as far from them as possible, leaving two other families stuck by the drinkers, too far into their meals to move. Those families had a highly uncomfortable time as they hurried their meals to be able to leave. The waitress and the manager eventually said something to the partiers to inspire some of them to stumble back to their rooms, and later after another word from the manager, the group moved inside to the bar, where they hooted and hollered for some time. By the time we finished, they were back outside, drinking and smoking away, and one thing was for sure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they had definitely marred what should have been a very enjoyable restaurant experience for us. And they did nothing to make the Dana look good, since it was explained to us that the hotel policy is generally not to cut off drinking if guests are staying there and aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t driving. Well, be that as it may\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they had two different types of clients with different evening agendas thrown together. One group has to lose something, and it was the higher-end customers that night. You can argue that drunk partiers can show up at any upscale establishment anywhere. The problem with the Dana is that the scenario we experienced must happen frequently since they have a constant flow of two price levels of clientele, and with discount travel sites selling the older rooms at even lower prices. The Dana management needs to decide which clientele they would rather have, all the time. If they leveled the old buildings, built all new buildings and appealed to the higher price range of customers, primarily families, the hotel would be just about perfect. Until that happens, the Dana will truly be a mixed bag. We loved the Dana, but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it could be made worlds better by going upscale all the way. The tips I read about requesting the buildings (new) nearest to the marina were right. We were in the one closest to the new pool (1000?), and we were glad. The views seemed better than back toward the bridge to the west; in addition, we could see the Sea World fireworks from our balcony. But more importantly if you value privacy, ask for the 2nd or 3rd floors (3rd is one king rooms only, as I understood it). We were on 2, where you have a private balcony. The first floor rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 patios opened onto a common grass area, which turned out to be virtually public grounds, with constant people traffic in your view. And apparently, the Dana allows dogs because there were several going in and out of ground floor rooms. I would not be giving a good review if we had been on the first floor. Lastly, take this advice: don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk to Sea World from the Dana. Reviews say you can, the staff will say you can (technically, I guess), but it is a LONG, LONG WALK. The path serpentines, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll regret it after it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late to turn back. If the hotel shuttle times work for you, fine; however, we took it back once and it was crammed. The best choice is to drive and park at Sea World.

Please note something very strange - there aren't any bathrooms in the conference center or in The Firefly restaurant. You have to walk across the patio to the Lobby and use the restrooms there -- very strange and inconvenient. We stayed in the 600 building (old section) and were very disappointed. Our room reeked of Lysol spray when we first checked in. We had to air it out before we could even go inside. The room was on the first floor and we felt if you opened the shutters, everyone walking by could just look right in and see what you're doing. Absolutely no privacy if you want to enjoy the parking lot view or get some light into your room. The room was very cramped with way too much furniture crowded everywhere. The desk clerk said we had a kitchenette which I had to laugh at when we discovered that was a small refrigerator sitting on the floor with a microwave on top of it. There was no closet, instead a separate armoire took up valuable floor space and had a broken door. The TV stand was huge and tall as the clothes armoire with drawers under it. The bottom drawer was broken and had to be lifted each time you wanted to close it. The wall unit air conditioner was located in the dressing area next to one of the double sinks. So you froze while getting dressed. The room was so crowded (2 queen beds, table, 2 chairs, bench, 2 armoires, nightstand, refrigerator, microwave) that two people couldn't walk next to each other when going from the bed to the bathroom. I can't imagine staying there with more than 2 in a room. One really annoying event happened each day. Our maid would change the radio station on the clock radio and turn up the volume to some Mexican mariachi music. If we didn't remember to turn it down and put it back on smooth jazz EACH DAY, we were jolted out of bed in the morning. She also failed to leave coffee cups (paper) each day. The new section looked nice with very large patios. If we return next year for the same meeting, I hope we can stay there rather than in the \"slums.\" We ate at The Firefly several times and liked the size of the dinners. They offered small, medium and large plates. We found the flatbread pizzas offered under \"small\" plates to be more than adequate for dinner ($12). They had several very good toppings ranging from steak to shrimp. They also offered macaroni and cheese at $9. We had a dish of this one night and thought the flavor was good, but it was extremely dry, maybe due to our eating at almost 9:00PM. The second time someone in our group had it, it was creamy and flavorful and also earlier in the evening. Service was slow. We do not recommend trying to walk to Sea World. It isn't just across the street as someone said. We tried to buy our tickets in the Lobby as we were told we could do. The consigierge was in training that day and no one else was able to help us. We decided to drive over and pay $10 to park. The hotel offers a shuttle, and it only runs in the morning and the evening but it's easy to spend the whole day at the park. Lots to do. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful most of the time. It's a shame they just don't get rid of these old buildings and replace them with some wonderful new rooms. Instead, they remodeled the rooms and filled them with oversized inexpensive furniture that isn't holding up very well. The location is good, but do stay in the new section if you go.

We were in town for a conference for my work downtown, but I could not get the conference rate from the Westin for three nights prior to the conference. We were there over Easter weekend. We chose the Dana mainly because it advertised itself as the closest hotel to Sea World and that it had shuttles to Sea World. We are from New Mexico and my last trip to Sea World was over 15 years before, so I didn't really know that closest hotel still really meant a 15 minute walk across a mini-highway and going through lots of parking lots. We did it, but it's kinda long for a child. Also the shuttles only left in the am and only came back in the pm, so if you have a Sea Wold pass and wish to make a mini jaunt over to see something later, like we did, you have to walk or pay to park. We felt a little misled on that because my husband went to a ball game one night and my son and I braved the trek to get over to Sea World for dinner with Shamu. We stayed in the dreaded old part of the hotel. We had a first floor room and have a lovely view of the parking lot. I know it was expensive at $200 a night, but given the prices elsewhere in San Diego, we did not feel ripped off. We walked to breakfast every morning at the Blue Pearl, where you must go early or the wait can be bad with everyone else in the hotel trying to eat there. My son loved the pools and walking along the marina. The grounds were well-kept. We had no problems with the hotel at all and they worked with us to reserve a handicap room.

We did a lot during our stay. The dates of travel were Dec 26, 2005 through January 1, 2006. I know this trip was awhile ago, but I thought the details might still benefit some people. Day 1 -- we flew out of O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare in Chicago. We flew Southwest Airlines which really stunk. We had to be up at 6am to catch our flight. We landed and took off at least 4 times during our flight there. It was a real pain in the butt. It was almost like riding a bus because we kept stopping to let people on and off in different cities. Also Southwest Airlines doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reserve you a seat, they have a first come first serve type of thing. I highly recommend going online 24hours before your flight to get your boarding pass. If you get pass A you have first choice. Then pass B and then pass C. If you are traveling with a large group of people (We had 4) you want to have pass A so you can all get seats together. That was really a pain to have to try to find internet access at our hotel to print boarding passes so we could get pass A so we could all sit together. But luckily our hotel in Cali had internet with printer. After arriving in San Diego at 2:20pm (cali time) we has to take a bus to the car rental place. I believe we used Alamo. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have our car until after an hour because they had such poor planning going on there. The line was out the door, and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough cars for people who had already reserved them. We reserved ours at least 6months in advance and there was still a problem. After the rental car mess, we finally made it to the hotel we decided to use. Dana Inn on Mission Bay. This was excellent! We LOVED the tropical cabana look of this hotel. After a long day we decided to head out to find food. We ate at Guava Beach. Everything tasted like fish, even the French fries. Day 2---San Diego Zoo---a major let down. Ever since I was a little kid, my mom and I wanted to go to the San Diego Zoo. It was nothing like I had seen on all the Travel Channels and such. I would probably never go back. Personally I think the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago is much better. I even think that our tiny zoo in Kalamazoo is pretty close to the same. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything spectacular as far as zoos go. We ate breakfast at a place called Jimmy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s before going to the zoo, which their food was good. The zoo had good food too, considering it was zoo food. Then we went to Baker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square for dinner, also very good. Day 3---For breakfast we ate at an interesting place called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hide Away Caf\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and it was wonderful food! We went to Legoland in Carlsbad. We had called before we left to ask if we had to purchase a ticket or if we could do a shopping pass. They let us in on a shopping pass which was between 1-2 hours (I cant remember). They held our charge card incase we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it back to the gate before our 2 hours ran out. Mom and I went shopping while Dad and my Husband went around exploring the park. This pass was awesome because we were able to roam the park and go shopping, we just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ride rides or see any attractions. When it got close to our 2 hours time limit we went back up and told them we had more shopping to do so they extended it 1 hour. This was perfect. We were able to take pictures of all the cool Lego things and finish our shopping. It was free, and definitely worth the time since my Dad loves Legos as do my nephews. We also visited Carlsbad Premium Outlets. We ate at Ruby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Diner, but the food was horrible and I actually think it is what contributed to me feeling sick for the rest of the day. We also went shopping at another place later that day and then everyone ordered Pizza, which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat because of feeling sick from Ruby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Diner. Day 4--- Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for breakfast! Then to the Wild Animal Park. This was WAY better than the Zoo. They had an awesome safari ride through the open savannah where the animals roamed. It was really cold in December though, so bring a jacket. We also got to go at Sunset and it was really pretty. Also, we waited in a line that took about 2 hours to get through to do this, but it was the best thing at the whole park. We also ate lunch there which cost $55 for 4 people to eat hamburgers! Very expensive, but the food did taste good. For dinner we ate at Sizzler, which is always good. Day 5--- Probably the worst day of the whole entire trip. We ate breakfast at Cocoa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caf\u00c3\u00a9, which was good. We went on the Hornblower Whale Watching Tour\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6please see my review on this. It was horrible. Everyone was sick on the boat, including my mom and I. We only saw 1 whale, which took forever to find and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even easy to see. We did see sea lions which was cool. But not worth the amount of people being sick and the amount of money paid. When we returned back to our hotel we had to spend most of the day lying around recouping from the trip. Hubby & I walked around the Bay and hotel taking pictures while Mom laid in the bed sick. Later after everyone was feeling better, we went to Horton Plaza, which was awesome. We ate dinner at the Panda Inn there and it was very good. This mall was great. Day 6--- Old Town. Breakfast at IHOP. We went through all the shops at Old Town. It was very neat and worth the time. We ate lunch at a place called Cyote Caf\u00c3\u00a9, because we wanted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Authentic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mexican food\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and it was not good at all. Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat there again. For dinner we went to Tony Romas and the food was good there. We went to a Peir 1 outlet store, which was really awesome and had a lot of good deals. I would def. return there. We packed our bags to go home. Day 7---Went back to Jimmy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for breakfast. Then later that afternoon went back to the Gaslamp District (Horton Plaza) and had lunch. We had to leave today, so we just walked around for a short time and then returned the rental car.

Our room was in the \"older\" updated part of the property, with a patio off the room next to the pool.

The conceirge helped us find something to do when the forecast called for rain all day. The hotel's bistro was well-prepared to deal with kids and very accomodating. The food wasn't great (don't bother with cocktails--stick to beer and wine), but the portions were generous and who cares as long as no one looks twice at your screaming three-year-old? We also had food delivered to our room two nights, which was very convenient. I've become suspicious of people on this site that complain that hotels are trying to be upscale but fall short. Anyone who is expecting luxury for less than $400 a night is just cheap or delusional. The Dana isn't trying to be something it's not.

We stayed at the newer section. I have read here that the experiences of people who stayed at the older section are not necessarily the same. Having said that, our stay at The Dana was a good one. There were virtually no problems with the room. My wife was attending a conference at a nearby hotel and I mostly stayed in the room during the day, working on my laptop. When we got to our room I was dismayed to find there was no desk in the room. Yes, there is a round table with a couple of chairs but the table was too high for me to use it to type on the laptop, so I had to use my lap. This was disappointing but ultimately, I worked around it. The other thing that we didn't like was that the bathroom was as dark as a cave. One of the lights was out, but I could see that even if the bulb had been replaced, it still would have been pretty dark. If you are a woman and you want to put on makeup, you're going to miss not having a bright bathroom, although there is an enlarging mirror. Okay, other than these two relatively minor things, the we enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and nice. The staff was friendly and when we needed things sent to our room, they arrived quickly. There are two restaurants and they are both excellent, and reasonably priced, especially when compared to some other hotels named Catamaran whose restaurant prices are really high. The Dana is the closest hotel to Sea World and it was nice being able to drive back from there and only having it take about 5 minutes. You could even walk to Sea World from the hotel; the walk takes about 15 minutes.

I was able to book the Dana for Presidents Day weekend through their website. We booked a King room in the new section with a sofa bed. We drove down to San Diego and spent the day at Sea World the went to check into the room after dinner that evening. THE ROOM: We were given a room in the new section (as requested) overlooking the Marina. It was nice and large. I called the front desk and requested a crib (had forgotten to do that when reserving a room) and they delivered on within 15 minutes (which is much faster than other hotels have been). The \"double\" sofa bed was actually only a twin, but that was fine with us as we had brought a blow up air mattress for my son. There was plenty of room for everyone we could still move around. We had a nice balcony with a table and two chairs. The bathroom was spotless and really nice with a natural skylight and wall lights (no florescent lights). The toilet had a quiet flush on it and my son loved that there were q-tips and cotton balls in the bathroom along with the shampoo, mouthwash & conditioner (little things impress 9 year old boys). There were also two robes and slippers for use. There was a nice sink in the bathroom with a fridge and microwave (they even had a recycling bin under the sink). It was very comfortable and quiet (although you could hear the airplanes from time to time). THE POOL The kids loved in. It was heated with nice views, good size jacuzzi. The pool on the old section was also nice, although no views, but they had ping-pong and other games as well. The bar would put any drinks in plastic cups for you so you could take them to the pool area. THE CONS Not many, and we were there over presidents day weekend, and the were fully booked. No rooms available at all. Our room was not cleaned until 3:30 in the afternoon - which was a bit late for us as we left in the morning before 8:00 and were back to relax and clean up for dinner at 3:00. THE RESTAURANT: BLUE OYSTER Breakfast is available at the Blue Oyster in the old section, and definitely has a dated feel to it. The food was okay. Nothing great, but average hotel breakfast food. The service was slow (had to ask for things several times, including coffee refills). Would not go out of my way to eat there, but it worked for breakfast.

My kids loved the whole experience Our check in was delayed and a bit slow but the staff was very courteous the entire time. We traveled with several other family members so I was able to see all types of the rooms. If you can afford it you are WAY BETTER OFF staying at the new section. The view is great and we booked a bottom floor room with 2 beds and a sofa bed. We have 3 small boys under the age of 5 so the newer section was a lot nicer due to the larger room and each has its own balcony. I selected the bottom floor because the patio had a small gate around it with its own private gate to exit your room onto the marina side. This afforded me extra peace of mind that my 3 year old would not push a chair to the rail and jump over the private balcony. My husband also had a bungee cord in the car and we just tied that around the latch of the patio gate which kept my little ones safe inside our room area. The service at the Dana is excellent...I felt like royalty because any time I called the front desk or room service ...they addressed me as Ms. Hunt before I even identified myself. The only problem I did encounter was when the crib I requested came the man set it up in a flash and once he left I saw a jagged broken wood spoke that would have surely caused loss of an eye or worse...when I called they rushed over a playpen instead...which wasnt as good as a crib...but my baby seemed fine once I used our own bedding. ALSO THE ROOMS NEED MORE LIGHTING...VERY DARK. But newer nonetheless. THE DANA NEEDS TO CHECK UP ON THEIR MAID SERVICE...SHE COULD HAVE DONE A WAY BETTER JOB AT TIDYING UP. The restaraunt food was very good at the Blue Pearl....perfect for families trekking off to Sea World...they even have an aquarium with all the Nemo fish inside it that my boys flipped out over.

The portions were HUGE and we just spit it with our younger kids with plenty to spare. WE spent $199 a night with 2 breakfast passes each morning thru the hotel...it was a great stay! If you need another hotel choice to consider...I was looking into the Bahia...I saw it across the bay from our patio room and it looked really nice on the beach room side. Also they have a fun looking old fasioned ferry boat that cruises the bay every night thru that hotel...we enjoyed watching it from our room and could hear all the disco music and lights going as it paddled by..we wished we were on that dancing and having a cocktail but had too many kids with us :)", "Date": "January 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cNothing to complain about this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Nelleke", "ReviewID": "UR6634651", "Content": "I loved this hotel.

I was booked there because it was the overflow hotel for a conference at the Hyatt Islandia across the street. At the conference rate, we were only able to get rooms in the older part of the hotel. The newer building may be nicer, but as for the older part, it's basically a fifties-style motel trying to pass itself off as an upscale small hotel. The service was very uneven, at best. My shuttle driver from the airport was delightful, but the front desk staff were hopelessly incompetent (did not know whether my state tax waiver form was needed; did not tell me that the room was on the 2d floor, or how to work the key; did not know how to retrieve voicemail messages on the room phone). When my room was made up the morning after my first night, the maid left only one bath towel and one face towel in the room. She was very nice when I asked for more towels, and brought them right away, but I can't imagine what she could have been thinking. I had dinner the first night at the Blue Pearl; it has a basic middle-American menu, with nothing to interest anyone with a sophisticated palate, and the BBQ chicken salad I ordered was awful - way too much cloying BBQ sauce. (I didn't eat any other meals at the Dana, because the rest of my meals were through the conference.) The room itself was worn and unattractive, and although it was reasonably clean, there was a very large area on the carpet near the sink that was soaked through (with water, I hope). The air conditioner had a very insensitive thermostat, so it alternately blasted cold air (effective, but noisy) and did nothing. I would not recommend this place unless you have kids and want to be close to Sea World, or have a boat and need to use the marina.

I don't think staying on the third floor would be much help considering, it wasn't just the people above us, we could also hear the people in both of the rooms on either side.

One tip I can offer for Sea World: the hotel offers shuttle service a few times a day but walking back is not that far. The aerial tram ride at Sea World is $3 for a great view of the grounds and bay and you can ask the ride operators to let you off across the bay instead of going round trip.

The staff there were extremely friendly and the menu had a surprisingly widespread appeal. The hotel is superbly located for access to SeaWorld, with a shuttle bus being run a couple of times a day. They also have a good deal of a 2-day pass at the price of the normal entrance - see the concierge. Would also recommend the $150 per head close encounter with dolphins. My wife and I came out of the dolphin pool on an incredible high and couldn't stop babbling for the next hour. I would recommend it most strongly to anyone who can afford it. The zoo is also well worth a visit and an easy way to see the sights is via the hop-on, hop-off bus. All tickets available from the concierge.

We were told the newer part of the Dana was unavailable our first day, but would be available for us on the second day.

I told her this was unacceptable, that we were told before even arriving, and reiterated at check-in, that a room in the newer part of the hotel would be there for us at a never mentioned additional cost. The clerk then changes the price to $40. I told her to make up her mind and just forget it. The only problem in the room itself was the dresser cabinets. They sit next to each other. The lower part were the dresser drawers, and upper part was to hang up your clothes. The TV was located in the cabinet closest to the bathroom and directly in front of one of the beds. Those sleeping in the other bed had to strain to see the TV. Not sure why they didn't position one of these cabinets more centrally to make it easier for everyone. With all of that said, even though the exterior of the older part of the hotel isn't pretty, the rooms are still very clean and the wooden window shutters were a very nice touch.

Two queen size beds (not the most comfortable, but nothing horrible), and a twin size pull out sofabed. A table and two chairs, nice armoir with tv & drawers for storage. The room has plenty of lamps/lights but none of them get really bright. They had sliding plantation shutter doors, which were really nice! I want some for my house. We were very comfortable in the room! The tv had a movie channel and a Nintendo you could use (I think there was a charge). They had wired and wireless internet in the room, which was nice. We ate at one of the restaurants at the hotel, called the Firefly. Its right by the pool area. The food was good, a little expensive, but good. They had burgers and fried shrimp, salads, etc and its also a bar so you can get a drink and sit by the pool. The rooms on the other side of the lobby are the older, motel style rooms. The families in our group who stayed on that side enjoyed the hotel just as much as we did. They had harbor views and pool views. Some faced the parking lot, but no one in our group had one of those rooms. I did not personally see the insides of those rooms, but they said they looked like they were recently remodeled. The location of this hotel is ideal if you are going to Sea World. You can walk (takes about 15 min) or its a 2 min. drive. They also have a shuttle, but it has only a couple of scheduled drop off/pick up times. There isnt any fast food nearby, you'd have to drive to that. Dana Harbor is right there, for boating/fishing/etc. Not much else within walking distance, but everything else is short drive. Downtown San Diego (Gaslamp area, etc) is about 15 min away. Hotel Circle area is about 5 minutes away. Its right off the 8 freeway and right off the 5 freeway. Negatives: For us the ONLY negative thing was parking. If you leave and come back after 8pm there is no parking near the Bayview rooms. Its a good walk from the other parking areas, so keep that in mind. Check out the website for more info & to see the photos of this beautiful hotel. (--). It doesnt come up on the search engines so I thought I would include it for anyone who wants more info. Oh, and NO I am not affiliated with them in any way, I just really wanted to give an honest, information-filled review of this wonderful hotel.

This was our first holiday as a married couple so we booked based on the fact that it was on the water, touted a nice pool in all the travel books and was the relaxing setting we wanted after 4 days at Disneyland. We got in too early to check in and so we decided to head to the mall, the front desk staff was helpful with keeping luggage and calling the cab. The cab ride there and back was a little over $30 to Fashion Valley, the hotel is on the water but very isolated from everything else if you do not have a rental car. When we arrived back to the \"motel\" our room was ready and we tried to settle in. We sat in the room for a bit with the patio door open to maybe pull out some of the smell. It had a very damp, bleachy smell. We called the front deck to complain about the smell they moved us immediately two doors down in the same building we went to smell the room first and it smelled good but was not clean- we proceeded to the front desk again and they moved us one more time. This time the room did not stink and it was made up. The room was clean. The bathroom left something to be desired and was definatey not renovate just had another coat of paint thrown onto it, but having only the toilet and shower in there was nice with the sink and hairblower outside the door. Other than a few minor things with the bathroom the room was adequate. The bed was comfortable for a double- they could not accommodate our request for a queen as they were full for most of our stay and we had been moved enough. We booked through a travel agent and some requests seemed to have missed the booking. The distance from everything also made the dining an easy choice as we didn't want to call a cab all the time. We ate once at the Blue Pearl and it was adequate, but not spectacular- fine for a cafeteria feeling supper. We primarily ate at the Firefly- it was great. Nice intimate lounge and the sports channel was always on for my husband which helped! The menu had a fair variety, and the \"fireworks drink\" comes very highly recommended. The motel/ hotel side we stayed on was the old side. It was adequate for the time we spent there. The pools was beautiful our room backed onto the garden pool. The location was great for the view but not the shopping and the eating out- unless you have a car. The price was right under $90 Cdn per night. I would probably not stay there again only for the fact that I'd like to be closer to downtown & Old Town for more dining and activities choices within walking distance.", "Date": "February 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "lancing uk", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel Just dont use long distance telephone\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4350421", "Content": "Nice hotel .We stayed in the marina view .

I booked a marina view room based on the pictures and descriptions on their web site. Upon arrival at the room, I was extremely disappointed by the motel atmosphere. While the room was neat and updated, it was impossible to get away from the cheap claustrophobic roadside feel. In fact, 'marina view' is misleading since the only way to see the harbor is while outside of the room or standing up bedside from within. Luckily, when I expressed my displeasure at the front desk they were overly generous by upgrading us to a bay view room. Simply put, it was night and day. The 'new' section is logistically isolated from the motel section with what technically amounts to its own pool and common area. The rooms are newly furnished, with perfect views of the adjacent bay. We were situated in a ground floor room and therefore I was able to sit on the patio and watch my daughter as she played in the grassy area between the room and the waters edge. The complimentary robes, slippers, and turn down service seemed to fit nicely in this environment, while perhaps be laughable at the older portion of the property. The Firefly restaurant offered a limited but well produced number of entrees for dinner and an adequate breakfast buffet. The outdoor seating had a real resort feel to it overlooking the pool and marina. To sum up, I would highly recommend the Dana for even an extended stay at the NEW SIDE ONLY.

Be sure you know which you are getting, we did and got a good $$ deal. It had everything we needed, 2 queen beds, and looked fine. We came to see San Diego and the beach so for all the time we were in the room-it was fine. We stayed in the average hotel part- which is like a motel, doors on the outside, but our room on garden level (2 levels) had a little courtyard garden to sit and enjoy a drink in the evening or read a book like my son did. Absolutley beautiful. sitting by the pool and hot tube were fun, and our room was the last one (last Patio) by the Maria side so we didnt have adirect walkout to the pool which was good noise was. It the pool is your thing, it might be nice to be closer- kids are fenced in or out. The location of this hotel is ideal- close to everything and even me, from Minnesota, could drive around the city ( we did rent a car) since were off the train routes, but wanted to be the water. Cabs can be pricey too- we had to take one into town when we went for a day to LA via AmTrak. The Dana, has 2 pools - one for each hotel, This one was small and in May the air can be foggy and cool early were used the hot tub. The hotter part of the day when the sun was out- well so were we so we didnt use the pool like we do in MN- They are onside pools. We ate on site twice which was conveient. (Didnt want to drive in the dark, we werent that brave, but so learned the roads) Food of burgers were good. The hotel has a shuttle but didnt use it-, Loved the luch tropical plants.

That night the revelry continued to very late. If you are looking for a quiet hotel , I would strongly recommend checking if there are any weddings booked! The hotel is quite small and really this took over every available space as their facilities are all very near to each other. The service by the pool was non existent ( noone there), the service in Firefly was very poor - our meals came up wrong & we told them 3 times but they did nothing to change them.

My first floor room allowed us to walk right onto Mission Bay to eat our lunches and take walks. But I will say, if you go there, you must stay in the newer section. The older section looks bad. It does seems like two different hotels at one location. You pay more for the newer section, but it is well worth it. It is only a ten minute walk to Pacific beach which is very nice. The resturants at The Dana are nothing special , but they will do fine for a lunch. One minor item, there seems to be a wedding there every week-end. So the parking fills up over the week-end.

Food was great and so was the service, nice atmosphere at both. The Dana Inn, however, is another story. First things first - the Dana website is simply inaccurate, it is a LIE. The photos are very decieving and HIDE the half of the hotel they don't want you to see with computerized images of trees (I kid you not). The lobby and NEW half of the hotel are pretty and modern. The other half is not very nice. Many have noted that the upgrade to the rooms made them better on the inside - it didn't. My friend's room was considered an upgrade from mine - their bathroom sink was in the foyer and they did not have an armoire - they had NO PLACE to hang their clothes, just a few drawers. It seems that they just slapped together whatever leftovers they had from the newer side to spruce up the older ones. The rooms felt like a motel off a highway. The price difference between the new side and old side is huge (and neither are very reasonable). Several rooms on BOTH sides face the highway which you will hear at night if you don't turn on the air conditioner. Also - PLEASE BE WARNED their \"fitness center\" consists of one treadmill, one stairmaster and one stationary bike, period. No weights, no nothing else. It is located off the pool in a room the size of my bathroom. All of this would not bother me so much if it weren't for the horrible service, which both sides have to deal with. The Dana is run by high school and college-aged kids who have not been trained on much of anything. Just one of many examples - my friend's room key stopped operating properly (this happened to all three couples in my group as well as one family I noticed complaining when I was checking in). Rather than fixing the problem, the concierge made him stand on line behind about 10 people who were checking in. This is just insane in the world of customer service. I stayed at the Dana to run the San Diego Marathon, a six night stay. I was given a room on the highway side (my friends, who were spectators and checked-in at the exact same time as me, were given upgrades). I had to fight for a move - the staff stated that they would not accomodate me for at least 2 more days. Eventually I gave up because I simply wanted to unpack already. The hotel staff knew that I was a runner as they gave me a packet upon check-in, but no upgrade for me. It gets better. The ONLY reason why I picked this hotel was for their shuttle service to the race. Rather than dealing with confirmation and payment upon check-in, they had me & 60 others stand on a line at 5am the morning of our marathon (6:30 start) to do this. Then there was not enough room for me in their shuttle. Please keep in mind, they had called me at work in NY THREE times to confirm my 5am shuttle reservation. Yet after standing on line and paying for my ride, I got bumped. I had to take a cab at 5:30am. Then, at check-out, they STILL wanted to charge me the extra fee for the shuttle. I am at a loss for words at what the staff at this hotel did to me. The really sad part is that the location of this hotel is prime and the grounds are beautiful. It has a nice resort feel, whereas most hotels in San Diego feel like just hotels. The pools are nice, although having to use a room key to unlock the pool was a bit obnoxious - I believe that they have a problem with homeless people (I saw many sleeping on their lawns during an early morning run). The Dana has so much potential, but the service was just so poor. In my case, they knew that they had faltered and gave me some $ off on my stay. But this just does not make up for their actions or lack thereof. I have never in my life had such a bad experience.

We asked for an upgrade (which we were willing to pay for) as the old section looks like a dump from the outside and were told there were none available, maybe tomorrow. To which we responded not to worry about it. We left our bags in their storage as advised by the front desk and when we went to collect them despite having the tickets, they had trouble finding them. We then had to lug all of of our bags to the room the front desk had allocated us only to find that the room key did not work. Housekeeping checked the room and it was not even cleaned, so this meant another long walk to the front desk. They allocated us another room and we had to lug all of our luggage up a flight of stairs. The room once inside was nothing special, but clean and much better looking than the outside of the buildings. We had been allocated a room near the pool which my son thought was great. The next day the nightmare began.... we arrived back at the Dana at 6pm after a day at Seaworld to find that our room was completely empty with no note or message. We rang the front desk to be told that they had moved us to a room in the new section (and we would be paying an upgrade fee) to which we responded that we had not requested this as we were satisfied with the room we had and were not prepared to pay extra. We were then told that our things would be brought back to us straight away. WRONG.... Our next suprise was that they allocated our old room (which were still inside as the room key had worked) to another family. So now our room key did not work and we had to do the long walk to the front desk again. When we arrived there the family who they had rebooked our old room were complaining that there was luggage inside the new room (that they got for the price of the 'old room') that they had been allocated (it was our luggage of course). 4 hours later, with hungry complaining children we finally got our luggage back however we were missing items (sunglasses, shampoo, Coke, part of the outfit of my Daughter's build-a-bear that we had paid a fortune for in Downtown Disney etc) and contacted the frontdesk. We were made to make a list of the missing items and the manager on duty replaced the miscelaneous items and assured us that they would check with housekeeping to locate the other items the next morning. For our inconvenience they sent us a fruit basket (which was a nice gesture). My husband checked the next morning and was assured that they had located items and they would be in our room by the time we got back that evening. When we got back from a day at the zoo etc, nothing had been returned. We contacted the front desk and were told that they had located my shampoo (not the other expensive personal items which we were more concerned about). By this stage I was rather upset and put them on the spot requesting they advise me what they were going to do about our missing items and finally they offered to reimburse us for the value of the missing items.

Once we got into the room it was decent. I am not complaining. The walls and ceilings are a bit thin as far as hearing your neighbors but that only happened a couple of times. The vanity had granite counter tops and was nice. The bathroom was small, only a shower. The remodelers that were used didn't exactly do the best job painting. There were a few missed places. The ceiling over the shower appeared to have or had some mildew on it. The room was clean for the most part. Nice decorations (mirrors/armoire/chairs) There were a few spots on the carpet. The housekeeping service seemed to come later in the day than preferred. One night we did receive an unwanted wake-up call at 3am but when this was brought to their attention they did offer to buy us breakfast so they did want to make up for it.

There is nothing in writing that these fees would be refunded (as the clerk stated) posted in their office or on the charge slip. The clerk offered to hand write on the charge slip that I would be refunded if I filled up the gas tank upon return of the car. I challenged both fees and made them take them off - which I'm happy to say he did. Bad start to my trip though. Now onto the Dana. Absolute difference in level of service upon arrival. The best part of the stay at the Dana was the personnel. Everyone I encountered was marvelous, starting with the crew at check in. The level of professionalism, mixed with a personal touch was much appreciated at all venues - both restuarants, gift shop, concierge and several desk clerks. That said, the rooms unfortunately did not live up to my expectations. The carpets were well worn with \"huge\" spots. The bathroom just okay. Beds also just ok. The grounds were \"cute\" - birds of paradise plants everywhere making the facility look a bit tropical. Location to seaworld obviously a positive, but my trip did not involve visiting the park.

Mission Bay drive, you will hit a Mission Beach area (2 minute drive) with a old wooden roller coaster and a small beach community. You can walk, jog or rollerblade down the beach sidewalk. There are small shops and places to eat there also. If you turn north up Mission Blvd, there is a more contemporary beach community area in the Pacific Beach area (5 - 7 minute drive). If you head north further to La Jolla, there is the Children's Beach area (12-15 minutes drive) where the seals hang out on the beach! Ask for directions. If you want a shopping center, Fashion Valley Shopping Center is only 7 minutes away by taking the 8 east. If you want a nice room, get a room in the new section, it you want a standard room, expect a Motel room and make sure you get a renovated room (kind of a sloppy renovation work). PLEASE don't expect more than, I cannot speak for the rooms that have not been renovated! The website info is for the NEW SECTION only! Expedia has a good photo of the standard rooms. Shop around, I got a great deal with the 4th night free! The front desk people were very pleasant and helpful. That's all, hope this helps!

After an early evening bumper-to-bumper drive from LA, we pulled into the Dana's reception area and were, at first, pleasantly surprised. It was new, well lit and very clean. We all (wife and two kids) were looking forward to a quiet evening by the pool. The front desk was very helpful and checked us in quickly. We went to our room, which was above the old reception area on the second floor. There was no close parking, so I had to lug our luggage 20 yards from the only available parking spot which was dark apparently due to a light being out. As we came up the steps, one of our backs got snagged on the nails that were sticking out of the wooden railing, ripping the zipper open! Then we opened the door to the room and we knew we were in trouble - the carpets were stained and black with dirt, and the bedspreads were dirty a well with yellow stains! The room was warm, so I turned on the AC and my wife went in to shut the window in the bathroom. As she did, the shutter on the window (for privacy?) fell off, smashing the lamp and bruising my wife! I went to clean up the broken plastic with a hand towel, and the towel turned black from the dirt on the bathroom floor. We used another damp towel on the carpet, which also turned black! We called the front desk concerning the window, carpets, etc., and were told this was the only room available unless we wanted to upgrade for $100 a night! They requested that we stay in the room and they would find us another room the next day (by now it was 10:30 -11:00pm).We reluctantly stayed in the room. The next morning, the front desk, as promised, found us another room, which was a little bit larger, but not any cleaner. The carpets were so dirty, that we had to wear sandals once we got out of the shower otherwise our feet needed to be cleaned again before we could put our socks on! Because we had pre-paid, we had little choice but to endure the grime! By far, this was the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in for the money.

I reserved a room from the \"Entertainment book,\" which gives 50% off selected hotels. I checked the facility online, and it seemed extremely nice. The person making the reservation told me of the great rooms and amenities. After checking in the room (with my husband and my 3 y/o), my husband and I were horrified. The bathroom was dirty, and it seems that nobody cleaned it properly for months, including, but not limited to, the bathtub, shutters, windows, floor (I wiped the floor with a piece of tissue, which turned grey), and the mirror was completely stained. The carpet wasn't vacuumed, and after removing the bed cover, we noticed crumbs and a lot of dirt all across the wall (accumulation of a period of time). I called to complain and was told that somebody will be there to clean. While waiting, I started to clean the bathroom. It felt like a not so clean public bathroom without the paper covers. A maid showed up with a bottle of spray and a cloth. After seeing the room, she went to bring a vacuum and more cleaning stuff. We left the room and let her clean. The place was cleaned very superficially. The bathtub still had hair. I cleaned it with soap and a washcloth, around down and up which turned the wash cloth black. I didn't dare put any clothes in the closet. The smell was unbearable. The air conditioner was so old and loud, I had to use ear plugs. The sheets were not changed the next day. If I knew the real condition of the rooms, I wouldn't have reserved a room. If I knew they had different rooms, I would have paid a little more. Although we were very disappointed from the room, the exterior was very beautiful. There is a nice bar by the pool, and we enjoyed the \"Blue Pearl\" restaurant. If you decide to use this facility, I strongly suggest that you request and receive a room in the new wing. After checking out, while at Sea World (which is two minutes away), I remembered that I dropped my expensive sunglasses in the room behind the bench, just before checking out, but I attended to my daughter and forgot to pick them up. We came back before heading home and were told that they weren't found. I showed the front desk girl a similar pair belonging to my husband.

You could see the Sea World fireworks nightly from the pool area and grass areas. We traveled w/another family and requested adjacent rooms. We lucked out and were also on the ground floor which was convenient since the kids liked running around on the grassy area right outside the patio and bay is just beyond the grass.

I told the girl I would really appreciate a room away from the pool and somewhat more quiet since we did not children and didn't really want the noise.

While I was waiting, the couple next to me asked for a room with two queens, which is what we got, and she was given a king. She was told she had been upgraded since they closed some of the other rooms. Lucky her! Get to the room, no tub, moldy shower only. It's very noise from the pool and the carpet was absolutely disgusting. Went to dinner at the hotel restaurant, not that impressive and rather pricey. When we tried to go to bed, the noise was so loud until 11:00 p.m. when the pool closed; but the people in the room below, who had a balcony, decided to drink and talk until about 1:00.

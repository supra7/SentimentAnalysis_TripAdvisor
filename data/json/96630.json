Although, they did have a Best Western in this area, I wanted to try something different. I had thought about staying at a bed and breakfast type place and upon reading reviews on Trip Advisors found the All American Inn & Suites. From reading the reviews and looking at the on line pictures, I thought I would give it a try. At first I was skeptical, because it was only priced at $78.00 a night, yet everyone that stays here says it's clean. Well, I'm glad I tried this place, because I'd come here again. I have paid more for other places and this place was comparable at a lower rate. The beds were comfortable, room and bathroom clean. The picture of the outside of the building on line doesn't look as good as it does in real life. Although, the pictures of the rooms are what you see (decorated tastefully and clean).

We loved it so much, that we are going back there this weekend ( June 19-21), even though we have a free nights stay at a another hotel! Thsi hotel is very clean, the service is excellant and the rooms are well appointed. My son loved the chaise lounge and insisted on sleeping there the whole night! We vist Branson frequently and have stayed at the five start resorts, but none of them can compare to the All American!! WHo would think you would get a flat screen TV and a wonderful comfy bed for the price they offer!!! I only wish they were open in the winter, as we now have to book at a subpar hotel for the winter season.

Our room featured a flat screen t.v. and a couch. Perfect for relaxing in the afternoon while taking a break from the Branson rush. It also had a refrigerator and microwave that we used to stock with sodas and snacks. There is a free continental breakfast in the morning with biscuits and gravy and other yummies.

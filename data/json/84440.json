However, because of unforseen circumstances, the train and public transportion schedule had me arriving at 1am on my first night. I was beyond nervous about arriving to the location so late because I had never been this area or hotel before, nor had I ever taken the train or public transportaton in the L.A. area before. So, to ease my my conscience, I called ahead and spoke to the daytime staff to make sure my reservation and check-in would be stress free upon arrival. To my dismay, there was a hang up with my credit card used for the reservation. The staff member on duty took down my phone number to see what he could do to help out and call me back. I have to admit I was somewhat surprised when he did exactly what he promised he would do. He assured me that they could work with me at check-in to make sure my room would be ready for me upon arrival, even though he would be off two hours prior to my arrival. And he did just that. I arrived at 1 am via the city bus (which was quite clean and secure btw) and checked right in without a hitch! As far as my two days stay: The continental breakfast was neatly presented in the lobby with seating indoors and out for a pleasureable experience. They didnt have any qualms about bringing a plate to your own room for enjoyment either. The site felt very safe and secure, which was key, as I was a single female traveling alone for my first time to LA. They also had complimentary fresh baked cookies in the afternoon/early evening, which I thought was fantastic. Overall, the property was in excellent condition, thefront desk and maids were exceptionally friendly and accommadating, and the location was very convenient.

The hotel was easlily accessible from the \"major freeways\", but you definitely need a car to get around. Reseda is not an upmarket area but neither are many places in LA itself.The hotel is surrounded by auto repair shops, but that was not a big deal as beyond them are the lovely mountains. We were given a room on the ground floor which was next to the pool. As there was a bit of a noise from the pool filter we reported this to Michelle at the reception. She called her manager and immediately got us an upgrade to a bigger room on the first floor. Although there was no lift that was not a problem at all. The room was nice and clean, had a fridge, coffee maker and toiletries. The heating and cooling though it worked well was a bit noisy. On the w/e we could hear the people and the tv in the next room but it was fine for the rest of our stay. There was secure parking at the back of the hotel which was great. The wifi access in the room was one of the best we have experienced till date. There was no room safe, and that would have been a bonus. There was a free continental breakfast served between 0630 and 0930 everyday. This consisted of danish pastries, muffins,bagels,toast,cereal, juices,coffee and tea, which was a good start to the day. The fruits esp the oranges could have been of better quality.There was a microwave which you could use as well day or night. There are several shops/restaurants in the vicinity and a coin laundry nearby.

I just got back from Japan and was amused to find I could literally fit three of the hotel rooms I stayed in in Tokyo inside this single hotel room in Reseda. It's a big room even by US standards for the $70 to $80 range in which I usually find the rooms here through HOJO's website. The room is very clean and new-looking for a hotel in this price range too. A big downside is the hotel attracts a diverse crowd including people who walk the hallways without shirts on and people who throw all-night loud parties with what sounds like dozens of carousing people crammed into a single room and often opening the door letting the sound of the party travel through the area. There were constant streams of people from this party making tons of noise in the hallway all night. The walls or doors are very thin here so it seems like people making noise in the hallway or in a nearby room are in the room with me. Despite complaints, this party went on for quite some time before it got quiet in the hotel. When I checked in this time, the front desk clerk was on the phone with a guest having trouble with the internet and was giving the person the phone number of the hotel's internet service provider. I didn't think much of it at the time, but then I had huge problems with the internet for the entire 2 night stay here. Email and internet were dog slow. They have 7 different wifi signals you can join in the hotel, and I tried all of them many times for hours and nothing worked. When I called the front desk to ask for the internet service provider's number too, they wouldn't give it to me and said the connection was a little slow today but was otherwise working fine for them. It was unusable for me as most pages wouldn't load more than 1/10 of the content and emails wouldn't send. They basically just said there was nothing they could do about it and I should keep trying all the different wifi signals in the hotel until I found a solution to what they said was \"my signal problem.\" I don't know if they realize people will actually not repeat their stay at a hotel if the internet is bad when they need to get work done. They acted like they didn't need to do anything about it. I wouldn't stay here again unless I don't need to have internet or am willing to go out of the hotel everytime I need to use it.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sulphur, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cNice clean hotel with very pleasant and accommodating staff.\u201d", "Author": "ettawebb", "ReviewID": "UR81382806", "Content": "I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel.

LA hotels are very expensive, and those on a budget should consider this place, which is fairly priced. The location is a bit out of the way, but you're less than 10 minutes from the freeway (either 101 or 405). The LA freeways are worse than ever, but if you avoid rush hour and accidents, you can be downtown or in West LA within a half an hour. (Get traffic reports on 1070AM). LAX was also about 35 minutes, and that was at rush hour (but traffic was moving then). The neighborhood is NOT dangerous; there is gated parking, but frankly, it isn't necessary. We mostly just parked out front and had no problem. I would walk around this neighorhood at night without any hesitation. By the way, another review said the apartment complex behind the hotel was run down. I disagree. Perhaps the reviewer was some sort of a millionaire and is used to mansions next door. The hotel is simply in one of the many parts of LA that aren't very charming (strip malls, etc.). Next to the hotel is a CVS, an auto repair shop, etc. There are some great ethnic restaurants in the neighborhood, including a great Mexican place on Vanowen, called Las Fuentes. The rooms in the front of the hotel get some street noise, and there's a fire station across the street, though we only heard a siren once in four days. We were close to the front, and the noise didn't bother us very much, but if you're sensitive, ask for a room back from the street. The hotel is very quiet inside, and we heard no noise at all from other guests. The breakfast is pretty minimal: two kinds of cold cereal, muffins, bread, juice, coffee. Many rooms have no microwave oven, but you can use the microwave in the lobby. We had a small refrigerator in our room. There is a small pool and jacuzzi, but they could be cleaned a bit more frequently. They're not heated. The rooms were spotless and recently renovated (granite counters in the bath, etc.). We had two Sharp Aquos flat-screen TVs in our suite. The hotel overall is in excellent shape. Our suite was a true one-bedroom, with a door you can close between the bedroom and the living room (unlike some \"suites\" we have seen). The housekeepers were very nice and responded instantly to requests for extra towels. The management and front desk people were very friendly and seemed to care a lot about our satisfaction. We definitely recommend this place, as long as you aren't hoping for a charming setting or a central location. Unless you're willing to spend a lot more, you can't expect everything, and frankly, this place is a very good deal for LA.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "PHOENIX", "Title": "\u201cExcelent\u201d", "Author": "NR1Charlie", "ReviewID": "UR64741422", "Content": "Hi, thanks for the great stay we had. and we are looking forward to spend our last night again at your hotel.

There are some closed storefronts, and it's certainly not upscale, but it just looked like an average LA neighborhood without any suspicous characters evident. Groups of schoolkids were walking home from school on the street the hotel is on and I didn't see anybody get shot or knifed. Whew!

The desk staff was reasonably friendly. The parking was plentiful and seemed fairly secure in that it's gated all around, though not impenetrably so. The room was the biggest surprise. It was large, with all fixtures and furnishings looking new and clean. It looked good enough that I could actually see bringing a partner for a stay here if we were in the area and on a budget. Large flat-screen tv, working internet, fairly large fridge, desk, dresser, armchair, nighstands, fairly spacious bathroom, everything looked good. My room was away from the front of the building, and I wasn't bothered by the minor level of noise from the busy street out front. The infrequent noise of a helicopter overhead was a bit unnerving, and there was a little waiting in traffic to get up and down the street, but that's just LA.

Hubby said, \"I've never been in a hotel that felt like a dungeon\". LOL Even though I was tired, that was funny. Pool: Tiny/ if people are hanging out there, noisy Room: we were placed near the pool, I remember other reviews about loud noise and sure enough it was super noisy. Hubby went to ge us another room and the attendant graciously allowed it. After touring the city, we very tiredly went back to the room. It sounded like a large family was next door. They definitely had lots of children there. Again, it was very noisy. Hubby had to go over and ask them to quiet down. Better him than me! He's much nicer. That morning, the children/family was noisy, but we were on our way out. No microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker, iron. Breakfast: Your regular dry fare-milk, juice, toast, cereal, fruit, pastry-it was ok. I would not go back. I hate hearing noises through the wall that loud. No privacy.

Like many, I booked this location because of reviews here and that Reseda was a family stop over before our next stop, (Yosemite). The jury is out on this one. Unlike other reviews, you judge for yourself. We had a late check-in, (like 3 am) because of flight delays\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Even though I called five hours earlier to notify them of my status, they no longer held my credit card reserved NON-smoking 2Q room. Instead my family received a 2Q \u00e2\u20ac\u0153must have just had smokers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing how easy you can tell the different between a non-smoking and a smoking room. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just nothing that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to take the smell out. Lucky, this was just a two night stay. Quiet place; so quiet that when my family checked-in at 3am and just started to settle down a 3 and 6 year old on jetlag, it was enough to spawn a call from the front desk within 5 minutes of us being in our room for making to much noise. I think it was the toilet flushing that did us in. I have never been call on before for noise. So assume very thin walls. Continue and you'll see. Room had up to date furnishings including a HDTV. Channel selection is all over the spectrum. Some channels worked and others didn't. (Not sure to blame hotel or Cable company). The location has a courtyard style pool / lounge area. Small but nice design since it keeps the views of the surrounding auto body shops out of range. Location has wireless except it was not accessible from our room. Probably out of range or the signal was overwhelmed by all the other local auto body shop businesses wireless connections. Location: Reseda is big, so all locations in Reseda are NOT the same. We witness that coming down Reseda Blvd. from the 405, (approx 2mi). Went from a upper class nice looking shops to a blue-collar mix class, mechanist industry location. Your parking and entrance ways are both gated by access cards. The jury here comes back deadlocked. If the reservation was kept as a non-smoking room and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t warrant a call from the front desk, (who obviously knew we just checked in), I would better rate the place. However, things like this just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go well, especially after a long travel day. Also, consider the location if your traveling with families. Not much within the surrounding area.

Upon arrival, I notice that the room was clean, which was very important to me as I am the \"Monk\" of all \"Monks\" (For those who don't know, Monk is a tv character who has an OCD and a clean freak) and spacious. I like the granite countertop and bath wall, So I have to give them 5 stars on that area. The complimentary breakfast is really filling, not just the regular sweet pastries. Although they offer that but that's just one of the many they have. From cereal, fruits but no banana, my favorite fruit which I think they should add, to bagels, toast, juices, milk and coffee. Just an advice, I think they should offer a fat free milk in addition to the regular milk they have and maybe decaf too to those who are coffee drinkers. Here I'll give them 4 maybe next time I'll give them a 5 if they heed to my suggestion of offering fat free milk, decaf, and some banana which I think echoed the sentiment of others who had stayed here. About the service, they are very friendly and helpful especially the guy who checked us in, I don't remember the name, but I'll have to edit this later once I found out from my spouse. But there was one guy named Bobby who was not sympathetic at all to our problem. He is one of the problems we have encountered. The other problem which Bobby wasn't sympathetic at all was our daily visit to the Reception area to have our cards magnetized. Every night when we came back to enter the hotel parking area, the machine slot wouldn't take our card that the hotel provided, it wouldn't open the gate. That was a nuisance as we have to climb down the car to have it magnetized so we can enter. Also, whenever we leave our hotel room to take a dip in the pool or eat breakfast, we couldn't enter anymore even how many times we slippe the card into the door slot, it just wouldn't open. So when we told Bobby about the problem during our second night, he didn't show any reaction at all, he seemed to be stoic about it. He was also the same guy who had it magnetized our card on our first night there. Another problem we had was we came to our room unmade, we were expecting the room made up. Outside the door of the room, I knew something was not right as I saw a \"Don't Disturb\" sign hanging on the knob. When I left that morning there was nothing there as I even made sure that the door was locked by moving the knob. I don't know how it got there but I expected a clean room upon my return.

Location: If you don't drive, you really don't want to stay here - and I am good at taking LA's public buses, no grocery store or fast food restaurant within walking distance - unless you don't mind walking 30 minutes or longer. (There are two Vietnamese restaurants a few minutes walk from the hotel, I tried one of them, their cooking was mediocre at best. 2, Cigarette Smoke: Although I stayed in a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor, I could smell cigarette smoke very often, even putting a thick towel under the door did not help. *WARNING! Although I booked a 3.5-star hotel at hotwire (May 24-28), they gave me a 3-star Holiday Inn and hotwire won't offer any refund or compensation, instead, to rub salt to injury, they sent me a link to their website that clearly shows Holiday Inn is a 3-star hotel...

We also planned to stay again after San Diego prior to going back to N. Cal. I ended up cancelling the other reservation the night after our first stay. Instead moved to the Hampton Inn in Van Nuys (where we enjoyed our stay). Would not recommend for families with young children. The hotel/motel itself is average but in a noisy/scary area, offers so-so breakfast. Customer service is not as welcoming as I'm accustomed to. Better people-skills needed and they need to re-stock their first-aid kit. My husband wanted an advil/tylenol and the front-desk told us to buy from the nearby CVS pharm. Our Room: When we arrived at the non-smoking room, it smelled strongly of cleaning solution. Other than that, the room was clean. We were in the \"Presidential 2-room 2 Queen suite\" and it was a big disappointment since I expected 2 bedrooms and 2 Queen beds. The other Queen was a pull-out sofa bed in the receiving area. There is only 1 bedroom with a Queen bed in it. I think the way they advertised the room is deceptive. The sofa bed also had sheets on but folded-in so I don't know whether the cleaning person didn't change the sheets. This is the first time I encountered this since most hotel sofa-beds don't have the sheets on - you have to get the fresh sheets from the closet and put it on yourself. Parking : Gated parking where you use your guest room card to open (one of our cards did not work though), I noted the scary signs posted regarding \"No drugs (etc) allowed on the premises\" mentioned by another reviewer. Our car was fine, though and I didn't notice anyone loitering. Food : There's a couple of restaurants in short driving distance - but didn't try them. You can also get menu of restaurants that deliver to the hotel from the hotel lobby, we tried the Chinese place and the food was OK for the price. However, the delivery person knocked on our door - which surprised me - I expected the front-desk to call me first when the food delivery arrived. I do not think this was safe. Noise : Sirens blaring all the time (I counted 7 from 8pm to 12 midnight) - don't know if it was the police or the ambulance. The rooms were not sufficiently insulated. However, our room was close to the parking lot gate on the right-hand side.

The secured parking (your hotel key grants you access to a gated lot in the rear of the property) was an added bonus and certainly gave us piece of mind. The staff was every bit as friendly and informative as noted in the other reviews. Location: Reseda isn't the worst area, but it's not the best either. (SUV driving suburbanites probably wouldn't feel safe walking the neighborhood after dark.) All the same, it's conveniently located between the Ventura/101 freeway to the south and 405 to the east, about four miles or so from each. Hollywood, beaches, Universal Studios, all within a half-hour drive or so (depending upon traffic). Food and sundries: The complimentary continental breakfast was simple yet satisfying: oatmeal, muffins, danishes, bagels, cereal, juice and coffee. If you're seeking fast food, you'll find Carl's Jr., McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King southwest on Sherman (the first major intersection to the south). As somebody else noted, there's a CVS pharmacy conveniently located right next door. Entertainment: There's an Albertson's on Saticoy (the first major intersection to the north), where you can rent Redbox DVDs, or, if you're not up for the drive, there's a small mom and pop shop across the street that will also let you rent DVDs, even if you're from out of state and just visiting (credit card or cash deposit required).

I think the new owner is doing a great job with the hotel and the staff.", "Date": "November 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york city", "Title": "\u201cAwful!\u201d", "Author": "jsanNYC", "ReviewID": "UR8127672", "Content": "We booked a block of 20 rooms for guests attending a wedding nearby.

After 7 nights in this hotel we travelled up to Niagara falls for one night & then returned to NY & stayed for one night at a more expensive & higher rated hotel & this room size would have been less that quarter of the size of The Lombardy. All staff at The Lombardy were incredibly friendly & helpful. Breakfast was sparse but adequate, rooms incredibly clean and tidy. Location of hotel was incredibly central for upper east side. You do have to realize if you are a tourist in NYC to get to theatre and Time Square area is possible by long walk or cab ride away (if you are lucky enough to get a cab), I definitely will be back to NYC - seeing as this trip was a \"shop till you drop\" holiday with my daughter, need to come back with my husband and I would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel in NYC\u201d", "Author": "CoriSB", "ReviewID": "UR82877255", "Content": "My fianc\u00c3\u00a9e and I visited NYC for a short city break during the beginning of December.

It was conveniently located at East 56th Street (between Park and Lexington Avenue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) and a close walk to 5th Avenue and Central Park. I believe most of the rooms in the hotel are apartments owned privately as additional residences to people who live out of town/overseas and are rented out throughout the year so many are decorated differently according to the taste of the owners. We had a beautiful, comfortable and clean room with a small kitchen but took in the local restaurants for our meals. The hotel staffs were friendly, professional and helpful. I recall the shower pressure was a bit crazy but nothing to complain about. The only con of the experience was waiting a half hour to get our car back from the valet parking after check out; however, I would advise against driving your car to NYC and take the train / plane as we didn't use it the entire time we were there and parking can be pricey.

I'll start with the pros since there were so few: the rooms were clean, the location was good/quiet, and the bellhops were friendly. For $700/night, you would expect to be treated well, but we were treated like trash by desk staff at check-in and check-out. Desk staff had quoted a room rate, including tax, when a friend called to confirm our reservation and the morning of check-in when we dropped off our luggage. When we went to check-in later that afternoon, they told us their desk staff was wrong and we owed $100 more for the room. Upon check-out we were incorrectly charged a $70 fee by the desk staff (unlike the room rate, this issue was eventually resolved). Both the check-in and check-out experience were degrading and took more than an hour out of our 30 hour trip to NYC. We had reserved a room with 2 queen beds, which was reiterated to us at check-out by desk staff - but no luck! The room only had 2 full sized beds. Housekeeping was a problem too. At 6:30 at night we called down and asked for extra towels that never arrived so we had to share hair towels with each other. When we came back from dinner at 11:00 we had to ask for towels again, but when they arrived there were no washcloths so we had to remove our makeup with hand towels. On the morning of check-out we had stepped out for less than a half hour; when we returned to the room the housekeeper was there. We explained that we would be checking out within a half hour and she could continue later but it took a while to get her out of the room and she seemed confused about whether or not to strip the beds. Since we were checking out it seems like stripping the beds would be an obvious choice. They offered a continental breakfast with the room, but it was pretty low quality. Worse, just minutes after we sat down to eat our muffins we were being rushed out of the breakfast room because they had to \"close it.\" I would recommend spending your money elsewhere.

The room is confortable and clean.. But in the second night, september 2,my air conditioning stopped working during the night and NY was reaaly hot during those days..In the morning when i went down for breakfast I asked for repairing it at 10 AM. After some shopping I came back at 12 PM and asked the same guy if anyone took a look at the AC..I went up to leave the bags and the air conditioning was broken yet. Leaving the bags and going out again i just remembered THE SAME GUY about the airconditioning.............. At 10-30 PM after the theater, i came into my room and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SURPRISE...nothing happened wit airconditioning and i was going to have the second night with out the AC with a very hot season...and after 3 times asking for repairing... I took the telephone and after a quick talking with the front desk the engineer was in my door...He took a look and decided thta it had to be changed, all the machine. I said for giving up cause it was 11 PM and I was really tired and I could sleep with the window a little bit opened to have fresh air... In the next morning, another staff in the front desk and when i was leaving i said that the AC could be changed. Arriving at 1PM a a noisy and portable AC was installed in my apartment. And i had this AC until the end of my stay. September 9,at 11 Am, closing bags to check out the hotel I got into the shower box to have my last refreshing moment in NY... WATER??? NO WATER in the bathroom! After a quick talking on the telephone I said that ALL the hotel was without water and there was no prediction about it. Very angry I tried to have some more time in the room until the water be repaired but the guy from front desk said he was not able to allowe me. With all my luggage in the front desk, paying the stay the water engineer said that tha water was repaired and the guy from fromtdesk permitted me to come back and have a shower.

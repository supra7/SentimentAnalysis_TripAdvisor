The reviews of this hotel were mixed with many complaining about issues which, quite frankly, appeared to be either ridiculous or petty. The room I have here is spotlessly clean, with modern amenities, a much larger refrigerator than your typical dorm room sized unit, lightning quick free internet access, a large work desk and a comfortable firm bed with fluffy pillows and more towels than I could use even on a longer trip. Am I saying that the other reviewers of this hotel were being picky or wrong? Not necessarily but perhaps people feel it necessary or important to show how what made their visit less than perfect....for $82.00 a night including tax I had a free breakfast, comfortable safe room and a kind friendly and attentive staff to make my visit enjoyable. Is it the Fairmont or the Ritz? Not by any means but it is far superior, in my humble opinion and personal experience, than the reviews I read of this hotel.

The room looked updated for the most part with a nice granite counter outside the bathroom, counter height refrigerator and microwave. Horrible outdated tv though and ours had a loud screeching sound until it got warmed up. Bathroom was unbearably small. You had to step in and go behind the toilet to close the door. Outlets were lacking too. My husband and I both use our cell phones as alarms and want to plug in our phones next to the bed but there were not outlets anywhere near it.

For those who don't live in California remember that the sales tax and other convenience charges will be in the 13% range. We ended up paying $129 for a $113 bill.

We usually grab something to munch on for breakfast, but slept in on Saturday and by 9 am the breakfast room was packed. We grabbed a muffin and found our way to Little Italy's farmers market where we got a pretty good panini sandwich for breakfast. I think some people are having trouble with bookings mainly because of Expedia and Hotwire. If anyone takes the time to read the other reviewers, most had trouble with their reservations because they made them though a secondary company. The hotel didn't get a \"5\" mainly because the breakfast room was a bit small for the complex, and the ice machine close to our room was broken. We had to go to the 3rd floor for the ice we needed. I also think that San Diego in general is a bit expensive. The hotel was full and as good business people they charge what they can. A previous reviewer mentioned that he did not want to use his Hilton points. Folks... this is not a Hilton hotel. I'm sure the \"Del Coronado\" is a better hotel.

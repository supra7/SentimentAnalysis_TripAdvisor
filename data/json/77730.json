We had reservations to see \"Hairspray\" at Toby's Dinner Theater (which is right inside the hotel) and didn't want to make the 2-hour drive home after the show, so we elected to stay overnight. Check-in went smoothly, and our room was fine. We almost took the free hotel shuttle to the Inner Harbor, but decided to stay in the room and relax before the show. Parking at the Inner Harbor can be expensive, so the shuttle is great to have available. I'll keep it in mind for the future. If I could split up my rating, I would give their breakfast only 1 star. They have free breakfast and I must say, it was one of the worst I've ever had. The scrambled eggs were terrible. They were yellow, which was the only thing about them that resembled eggs. I took one bite and almost spit it out. They were just awful. They have one waffle maker, and the line of people to use it was very long. Since each waffle takes about 3 minutes, you can do the math to figure out how long you'd have to wait if you are 6th or 7th (or even more) in line. I wound up with just a bowl of cereal and a cup of orange juice. They have an indoor pool and fitness center which we didn't use, so I can't comment on them. I do like that they're there and may plan to stay longer in the future. The dinner theater is very nice. We've seen several shows there, and they are professional quality. Dinner is typical buffet dinner. One fun thing is that the actors are the servers, so you get to know them before the show goes on, which gives a personal feel to watching the show. Overall, the experience was good and I would go back. We would use breakfast for just something light like toast, juice and coffee. If we were there for more than just overnight we'd definitely use the pool and fitness center.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClean & Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "joynpain829", "ReviewID": "UR126753576", "Content": "I am skeptical of any hotel in the Baltimore area, but this one was clean and very comfortable.

The toilet didn't always flush easily and the shower filled with water. It wasn't a TERRIBLE experience, but it was far from luxurious. From reading other reviews, it sounds like some rooms are better than others, however. The shuttle service, however, was excellent. It was so convenient to just keep our car parked in the parking lot and take the shuttle to the Inner Harbor every day. No traffic woes, no parking fees, no getting lost, etc. Coming back to the hotel on the shuttle one evening, my 7-year old son asked the driver for a tour.

There is a bus stop and a truck plaza nearby, but the property is not surrounded by 'barbed wire' as mentioned by another reviewer. The hotel is somewhat dated in its decoration, but I found the public areas and our 6th floor room to be clean throughout our 4-day stay. Because we were there for medical treatment, we were given a room on the 6th floor---the 'Johns Hopkins Floor'---which also included a guest laundry, and a lounge area for patients and families. I believe the hotel also tries to provide a quiet atmosphere on this floor, something they did quite successfully. Although there is a shuttle available, that service doesn't begin until 7:00 a.m. We had to be at the hospital earlier, so we drove ourselves. It's a fairly easy drive to the hospital which is less than 10 minutes away. We relied on the Tradewinds restaurant each night for room service dinners during our stay. The speed of the service varied with the day, but the servers were invariably kind and pleasant. The quality of the food was OK, probably better than the McDonald's across the parking lot. I was grateful for the microwave and refrigerator in our room, and we used them both.

Upon arrival, the front desk had no record of their reservations, so none of our rooms were together as stated in the contract. Second, dinner for 11 travel weary people took over an hour to be served in the Tradewinds restaurant, and the food was frozen food you would buy in any grocery store freezer. When my brother arrived as a guaranteed late arrival at 8:00pm, the room he was given was filthy and hadn't been cleaned. After 20 minutes, he was finally upgraded. As a surprise for my parents, we booked a professional photographer to take familt portraits. My sister called the hotel and spoke to Janet Campbell, who was supposed to handle the event. She said since Harbor Room A was booked for the dinner, we could have pictures taken in there. The hotel, who had a copy of the contract, refused to let us have the room and we had to have pictures taken outsidein high humidity with mosquitoes biting our legs. Then, we had to have my parents Golden Anniversary dinner in the Tradewinds restaurant with no privacy. Our dinners took over an hour to arrive, and then they arrived piece meal. 5 came out first, then 15 minutes later another 5, then 20 minutes later another five and so on until the last dinner came out a full two houes after our order was taken. We had to argue to see a manager, and finally Therea Ash spoke to us. She was rude, unsympathetic, and offerd us 10% off. When we said it wasn't acceptable, she tried to intimidate us by saying we had to pay wether we took the discount or not. Afterwards, my brother went to his room with his family only to find a mouse in his room. The hotel joked it was th hotel mouse named Chester, but noone was amused. He was offered another upgrade, but in the end house keeping shoved steel wool under the air conditioner. When my parents checked out, they complained to yet another manager, Chadi, who said he would comp them my brother's room, which he did but never took off the $200.00 deposit my parents paid, so they basically received no compensation. I should also mention housekeeping doesn't make the rooms up until 3:30pm, so the day we were trying to get ready for our photo shoot at 4:00pm, our rooms were never made since we were in them when the maids wanted to clean them, and they never returned.This was one of the WORST experiences we had, what should have been a wonderful weekend was hampered by this hotel and it's incompetant staff.

There was an issue with the shower overflowing onto the bathroom floor so they cut a piece of white plastic pipe in half and glued it to the floor. The caulking (all over the bathroom) was either missing entirely or appeared to be installed by someone who has never seen a tube of caulk before! lol Toilet only flushed if you held the handle for the duration of the flush. The shower was for physically challenged people and was stuck at waist height. You had to hold the shower piece in your hand, you could not leave it on the wall.

The AC was very loud, it didn't bother me but anyone who likes it very quiet would not be able to sleep with it on. (I assume not all AC units were this loud) The restaurant was a comedy show. All of the ladies that work there seem very sweet and appear to be doing their best but with 2 waitresses and 1 water pourer with 30-40 people in the dining room they are stretched far too thin. I tipped them because I realized they were trying but understaffed. We waited over 30 minutes the 2 times we ate there besides breakfast.

Pool and fitness area have nice thick towels right in the area. Full breakfast buffet was good and there was a lot of seating. We had a room with 2 beds. Our room also had a fridge and micro. Room was clean but there was a very stong musty/chemical smell. Having the air conditioning on helped a little but as soon as the air conditioner was shut off, the smell was back with a vengance. Because we had unpacked and the hotel was full we did not complain. If we stayed again, I would ask for another room if we encountered the same smell. The shuttle to and from the cruise port was contracted out to an outside company who did an OK job. Cruise port was only 5-10 min door to door. There was a 10-15 min wait for the shuttle (9 person van) to pick us up after the cruise. Overall we would recommed this hotel for a quick overnight stay especially as a park and cruise option.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hopkins recommendation\u201d", "Author": "Shery1234", "ReviewID": "UR115451928", "Content": "I am so glad the Johns Hopkins people recommended this Hotel.

It takes a while to get there, but then again, we have to compromise too if you want to do this within a budget. It took i think a good 30 minutes to get into the harbor, because it has to go to the hospital. In the inner harbor, you will be dropped off at the Pier 5 hotel, its a very decent place, so you can actually hand around there while waiting for the van to pick you up again. The only thing is, some reviewers here got to take some responsibility to ask questions anywhere they go, since it is a free shuttle, chances are it will be filled. so ask the time and make reservations going to and back, why complain when you are not acting responsibly to ask the what is and what not. By the way, the shuttle only sits approximately 10 to 12 people. As for the hotel itself, on the first floor, it has the look and feel of a very cheap hotel in the mid-80s feeling, which is not really a good thing, first impression always lasts. the gift shop is sad, its like teller booth with some racks of goodies behind it. I wonder, they got so much space, but it was not really utilize. and basically this floor needs updating pretty soon. no matter how good the food is, eating off a dirty plate is not how you would enjoy it. As for the room, well, be aware that there is a handicap room, because i was sent into that room, although i didn't picked this room (i booked online), so it was weird to see the bathroom. lets leave it at that. I asked politely the next day to move me into another room, which they kindly did. I was moved to room 1104, it was nice actually. but nothing like the one you will see in the pictures found in the hotel's website. But mainly, the room has NO bad weird stinky smell, clean, no bedbugs. It has ample lightings, bathroom was clean and adequate, bed is comfortable, no spring sticking on your back, tons of soft pillows, got microwave, ref but no toothpaste, no shaver in this room, unlike the handicap room, has both of them. perhaps the cleaning crew forget to put them in. Not an issue anyway, just noticed it. For the breakfast in Tradewind inside the hotel. it was nice. of course do not think this is embassy suites where there is a cook to do your sunny side up. But it is decent, hot sausages, potatoes or eggs, some waffle you do your own, coffee, different pastries and juices. one thing i guess i would recommend what this hotel do with the breakfast is, is to invest on a good coffee. it will go along way. and its not gonna cost more than what you have right now. Overall, i will come back, hopefully management will see this review and make some changes. As for other reviewers who wrote nasty things, ask the front desk politely, they will help, if the one you talk to didn't help, go for the next person. Chances are they will help you out. As for other travellers who want to try this, Go ahead and use this. The only downside i guess is actually not the hotel, but area. there is no real nice restaurant to eat within a walking distance, there are some like within a few miles which requires to drive.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ellicott City, Maryland, USA", "Title": "\u201cSurprising service, will use it on the way back\u201d", "Author": "SaraRamada", "ReviewID": "UR113866086", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay at the Best Western.

There were rooms available and they let us check in!! They explained all of the amenities and answered numerous questions for me. Jennifer was one of the girls and I didn't catch the other girl's name, but both were extremely friendly and gave us a lot of information and recommendations. We arranged for the free shuttle to take us into the city at 11:00 and went to our room. The room was very clean, roomy and had many nice features. The shuttle dropped us off and we spent a great day in the city visiting Lexington Market, the inner harbor, the aquarium, Federal Hill, Fels Point and having a delicious dinner in Little Italy. We called and arranged for the shuttle to pick us up. We had to wait about 40 minutes, which was fine because we stopped at a great bakery and had some pastries while we were waiting. We came back to the hotel and then went to visit Charm City Cakes where they film Ace of Cakes on the Food Network and we drove to 34th street to see the crazy street with all of the lights, blow up figures, hubcap trees and craziness. It was fun. We came back and relaxed at the hotel and watched TV. There seemed to be a nice restaurant at the hotel with some reasonably priced specials. We did not eat at the hotel. We had a good night's sleep and had breakfast on Sunday morning. The breakfast was very good. Seneca, who was the hostess could not have been nicer. She was really friendly and attentive. All of the food was good. Scrambled eggs, home fries, sausage, make your own belguim waffles, muffins, danish, cereals, lots of bread, bagels and english muffins for toasting. They had coffee, tea, oatmeal, juices and hot chocolate. There is defintely something for everyone and the dishes were cleared as soon as you were done. Overall, this was an excellent Best Western and we have stayed in many Best Western motels. The staff was very accomodating and friendly. The hotel was clean, the rooms were spacious and the breakfast was very good. The only thing I would say that was disappointing is that the pool was out of service. Although, this was no big deal for us, since we weren't planning on swimming, but someone who was expecting to swim might be disappointed. The fact that the hotel is near a bus staion was really no big deal.

This Best Western has an agreement with the hospital to accommodate the families of admitted patients. The hotel is about a twenty minute drive from the hospital entrance, but the complimentary shuttle service runs every hour and gives door to door service. That sure beats driving and having to pay to park blocks from the hospital, especially when you consider that this world class hospital is located in a very dangerous part of the city. The Baltimore police refer to this area as \u201cthe War Zone.\u201d The hospital (or the city police) have actually placed elevated glass guard towers at each intersection for a two block radius where 24 hour armed police officers can protect the hospital visitors. A murder in broad daylight took place two blocks from the hospital entrance while we were there. The guard on that corner told us that it was the 22nd murder in the neighborhood in just two weeks. I only mention all this to emphasize how much we appreciated staying away from that area at the Best Western but with all the safety and convenience of the shuttle. The staff at the Best Western couldn\u2019t have been more accommodating. We arrived at the hotel around eleven PM on a Sunday and the desk staff was still able to direct us to a nearby seafood restaurant for a midnight meal.

It had the usually found processed scrambled eggs, sausage and hash browns, with waffles, bagels, fruit, cereal, coffee and juice. It was certainly enough to get your day started. The hotel is a large complex that also contains a dinner theatre and bus station. Neither of these was a distraction during our stay. Parking was free and right outside the entrance.

One employee had on gloves and had to literally bag up my parents night clothes and put them in a garbage bag, and all the clothes they had laid out on the bed.

You don't like the room?\" I said \"Actually, no. We would prefer to have a king bed.\" He said \"Yeah - but I already booked you in.\" I said \"I know. But our reservation is for a king room.\" He said \"OK. But I already booked you in. You don't like the room?\" I couldn't believe it. He was purposely talking in circles to avoid the conversation. My husband & I looked at each other with shear disbelief. we had traveled almost 7 hours to get there & neither of us were in the mood for wordplay, so his stupid little stall tactic worked on us. We dragged our bags back up to our room and settled in. Trust me - these were not queen-sized beds. The AC in our room had 2 settings: raging inferno or arctic tundra. I had a really scary moment in the bathroom when I fell HARD on my backside because the flooring was so slippery. The beds were old, saggy and lumpy. They never cleaned our room during our 3-day stay. There were some drops of some kind of sticky brown liquid that remained on the bathroom floor throughout our stay. Yuck. Just so gross. Forget the free shuttle - it's a 14-passenger van that makes only one trip at the top of each hour to the hospital and the Inner Harbor. You can make a \"reservation\" one day in advance, but good luck getting a seat. This hotel houses hundreds of travelers a day and only 14 people get a ride at the top of each hour??? That is absurd! The van driver takes 2 one hour breaks each day so you can't get a ride between 12-1 & 6-7 either. That was just so frustrating. The food was absolutely horrible. We went to Toby's Dinner Theater and the food was cold and disgusting and those poor kids on stage could barely sing or dance. We went to breakfast the next morning and the food was even more disgusting - synthetic eggs & sausage patties were the only options in the warmers. It was just so gross. Later that morning, we took a $20 cab ride to the Inner Harbor because the guy took us all over creation to get there. Come to find out you can just take O\"Donnell Street basically straight back over to the Inner Harbor. We discovered this when we took our $10 cab ride back later that evening. This Best Western isn't on any of the tourist maps, so it's was tough to know if the cabbie was taking us for a ride or not. Later that night, we went into the hotel bar for a nightcap and to watch some of the Olympics, but that bartender was ridiculous. There were about 6 people at the bar and it took her, no joke, 25 minutes to take our drink order! The guy next to us told us to order 2 drinks at a time if we ever did get her attention. I ordered a vodka/tonic and my husband got a bottle of beer. This poor woman had absolutely no idea what she was doing back there and she kept leaving to go into the kitchen for several minutes at a time. We got our drinks approx. 5 minutes after we ordered them. Later that evening, she left the bar altogether for quite a long period of time. It felt like we waited forever to pay our tab. The next morning I called the front desk to get some advice about signing up for a local trolley tour. The front desk lady said \"We have nothing to do with that.\" She couldn't recommend any attractions, tours or restaurants. She couldn't suggest any activities, museums or entertainment. When I asked her if I could speak to someone who could help me, she told me \"We're all busy down here.\" I couldn't believe it. This kind of service is not indicative of the kind of service we have received from other Best Western hotels in the past. We are just so disappointed in this Best Western.

My son and I were in Baltimore for one night to see two Red Sox/Orioles games, we had flown into Washington and drove a rental up to Baltimore. Originally the Saturday game was scheduled for 7pm but due to national TV was moved to 3:55. Checkin at the hotel was 4pm. Due to the new gametime we went directly to the hotel to check in and give our credit card information. We did this at 1pm. The hotel took our credit card, gave us a parking pass, booked us on their shuttle to the Inner Harbor and booked us on a return shuttle at 11:30 pm after the game. They told us that rooms were presently not ready and that our key would be waiting when we got back. After the game most of the restraunts in the inner harbor had two hour waits so we decided at 9pm to take a cab back to the hotel, shower, eat somewhere close and take a cab back to go to the ESPNZone. When we got back to the hotel there was commotion at the reservation desk and the manager on duty wanted to speak to me off to the side. He told me that there was a problem with the pipes in four of the rooms and that as the hotel was full that these four rooms needed to be moved to another hotel. One of these people was us. The only available hotel was a Days Inn which was 20 miles north on rte 95. Needless to say I was not happy and could not understand why we were chosen as we were there at 1pm. I still dont understand. The people at the hotel said it was because we had a car. When I booked the hotel I had an AAA discount with a price of $118 per night, most of the hotels in the inner harbor were going for over $300 per night. My son noticed that behind the desk that there was a sign stating not to honor discounts for weekends when the Orioles play either the Red Sox or the Yankees. Were we part of this policy? Did they find someone to rent for $300 for the night and stick us in a fleebag with a rate of $72? This ruined our night which we had been looking forward to for more than half a year. We ended up driving an additional 5 or 10 miles out of the way to find the only open restraunt, a TGI Fridays and eating dinner at 10pm. We were not compensated for gas. Had to get up earlier on Sunday morning than we wanted to in order to backtrack the 20 miles. Never had time for breakfast.

The N word was used quite often by staff members... I also was told \"Oh, you guys are nit-pickers\" when I first complained about the room.

The hotel's best feature is the free shuttle service to the Inner Harbor, Camden Yards, etc. However, space on the hourly shuttle is limited, so you need to reserve your spot as early as possible.

There are only so many people that can get on. So we left. The people who were not there on time had a cow because they booked the shuttle the night before so they turned around to get them. We were not that far away so it was not a big deal. We used the shuttle the next day and had no problems. The breakfast had a nice varreity the staff was nice.

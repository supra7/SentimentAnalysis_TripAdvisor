{"Reviews": [{"Content": "One of the best! I stayed at the Terra Cotta Inn for six weeks while working in Dallas. I cannot begin to say enough positive things about my experience. I read a favorable article in Southern Living about this hotel and decided to try it. The hotel is quaint, with an unbeatable flare. The rooms are extremely clean and nice. The staff is also excellent, especially Fred. I highly recommend this place!", "Date": "Aug 12, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR607897065", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d109075-r1224419-Terra_Cotta_Inn-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "109075", "Price": "$58"}}

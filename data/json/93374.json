The good: If you love the LES and Soho (I do), this is a great location. My wife and I stayed in a studio suite (which can accommodate up to 4), so with the kitchen and separate bedroom the stay was more like apartment than hotel living. Whole Foods is two short blocks away, making it very convenient to stock up for use of the kitchen. We booked far enough in advance to obtain a reasonable rate for this time of year. The not-so-good: You'll have to order out for service and hospitality. They were friendly enough whenever we went in and out, but whenever we had a request, we were reminded that they keep their costs down by not investing in hospitality training. We arrived shortly after 8 a.m. to check in and were immediately informed that check-in was at 3 p.m., but they could hold our bags. I asked them to please check the reservation: we had anticipated this, and had reserved an extra night, so we could have our room upon arriving after our overnight flight. They quickly recanted, but this was just the beginning of an attitude that begins with \"the customer doesn't know what he/she is doing,\" After day one, we returned to find that neither my wife, nor my card key worked. We were admonished to keep the room keys away from our credit cards. Once again, the customer is suspect; they couldn't possibly have keyed two cards incorrectly, but both my wife and I carelessly demagnetized the room cards. We were further reprimanded for leaving the privacy sign on our door all day, which prevented us from receiving towel service that day. (I was under the impression that there were no automatic services, so I didn't think to remove the sign when we left for the day. Finally, when we requested a 1 p.m. check out, we received the automatic response that they were fully booked, and that check out time is noon - and that we should be happy with that, because 11 a.m. is the customary check out time. I reminded the attendant that we paid a full extra night, in order to check in at 8 a.m., and questioned whether asking for an extra hour on a four night stay was unreasonable - but he was not impressed. However, he graciously gave us the extra hour. The bottom line: If you get a good rate and want to indulge in the fantasy of living in an apartment on the border of LES/Soho with a grumpy landlord, then this is the place to book your experience. If you expect service with a smile, then this should not be on your list of alternative abodes.

There are very few suite options in New York within our budget, and Off Soho Suites is one of them. I was particularly excited about the location in a neighborhood near Chinatown and Canal Street. This provided for a more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153local\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd New York experience in an area with lots of character and not a ton of tourists. The Grand Street and Bowery subway stations are just a short walk from the hotel. Upon arrival at Off Soho, our reservation was readily available and there was no problem checking in. The room we reserved for the weekend was a deluxe suite for four, with an extra person (we were provided with a roll-away cot). The room included a small kitchen equipped with pots, pans, cups, coffee mugs, and silverware, a bedroom with two twin beds, and a living area with a table, coffee table, and pull-out sofa. The room itself was a tight squeeze for our group and it was difficult at times to move around. However, I found it adequate for our needs. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t visit New York to spend our time in the hotel room. The building was obviously older, but the room and waiting areas seemed to have been recently remodeled. The paint on the walls was clean, the floors were shiny and clean, and the bathroom was in decent shape. Overall, the condition of the room was acceptable and nothing was broken or falling apart, including in the bathroom. Sleeping in the room was a little uncomfortable. This was due in part because we had a group of people and also because the beds and the fold-out couch were somewhat uncomfortable. However, I do not consider this a negative given the price and purpose of the hotel in general. I did not find the room particularly noisy, especially for a busy city. We rarely encountered other guests and never heard any noise or commotion from other rooms or from the hallway.

I was in NYC for one night and needed somewhere to lay my head during the terrible winter storm that was approaching. I checked into a single room which actually contained two single beds (forgot to take pictures). The room I received was a room within a suite I had to share with another occupant, who I never met while there...a little weird, but I got over it...I'm a college student. The suite was big and reminiscent of a small NYC apartment also with many of the amenities of most hotels (iron, iron board, towels..). The bathroom, although shared with the other occupant, was big. The kitchen within the suite was equipped with: a large refrigerator, a toaster, a microwave, sink and drain board, plenty of cupboards, and a full use stove. The room had a small flat screen TV attached to the wall with basic cable channels. The rooms were clean and the hotel staff were friendly. So far so good, right? My only complaints were that the rooms were kind of brisk during the winter day and the blankets they provided weren't doing the trick. When I mentioned it to the front desk, I was informed the hotel used central air and the heat would come on automatically. It didn't. Secondly, it seemed like I could hear everyone's footsteps in the entire hotel against the hardwood floors while I tried to sleep. It was almost unbearable. But this is NYC, I expected a little noise. Other than that, this is a cute little place to stay when visiting the city. It's close to Chinatown, Little Italy, and subway lines. The amount I paid considering the location and service was nice as well.

I called just to confirm instead of just booking on the site. The employee who answered swore it must have been a mistake but brought up the website to double check to see if what I saw was right. He saw the price I saw and honoured it on the 4 person suite. Automatically that swayed me into thinking this hotel had great customer service. We showed up early for check-in due to a tough drive/train ride into town and not being able to use up enough time after arriving due to really windy weather, cold, tired, and carrying a backpack. The staff didn't have a problem with us showing up 2 hours before check-in (not that I'd always suggest this though) and our room was ready. The hotel itself is compact and understandably so. I wasn't expecting wide open corridors with mile high ceilings. It was clean, fashionable, bright, and, comfortable. Upon arrival into the room it was a bit worn but large, very large actually, and well put together. One complaint is the couch/extra bed. It looks good but it is not practical or all that comfortable. Each of us had a hard time finding a comfortable position while relaxing between ventures out into the city. The bathroom, like the rest of the room was large too. The toilet warning sign means what it says. It is very low flow and don't try to flush too much TP in a sitting, give a lil and flush, and then go for another flush which kinda defeats the point of a low flow if you gotta flush a few times. The shower had great pressure and heat but both were a tad difficult to control at first. The room we had was easy to control some fresh air rather than use the AC. Overall, I think this hotel has a great location as it is close to several subway stops, many delicious restaurants, bars, and music venues. It's very close to Chinatown and Little Italy as well. I'd book here again even at a regular rate but was glad the staff gave me the rate listed on the website. That went a long way for me.

The hotel was really more like an apartment building. We rented a room with 2 double beds in the bedroom and a futon (at least a queen, if not a king size!) in the living room. Althought it was small, it was perfect for a reasonable price. Reservations and check in were easy - I normally stick to chain hotels, so I was a bit nervous, but everything went smooth. Some things someone considering this hotel should know: 1. There are 3 subway stops located close by that are very convenient, and from there you can get almost anywhere. 2. There is a restaurant/bar right next door that has an outdoor seating area in the back that you may hear through your windows. In our suite, only the bedroom had an air conditioner, so those sleeping in the living room may need to open the windows, and thus will hear the bar noise. I am a very light sleeper, but I was sufficiently exhausted every night after touring Manhattan, and it didn't bother me. In the bedroom, with the air on, you can't hear it at all. I'm not sure, but I would guess those with windows facing to the front of the buiding will hear the smoker's crowd out front. 3. There are laundry facilities in the basement - $2 per load, per machine. The dryers don't work well, and there is no change machine, so bring your own quarters as the front desk staff doesn't have change either. There are 3 washers (one was out of order) and two dryers. 4.

The kitchen comes equipped with a microwave, 4 burner stove/oven, fridge, dishes (plates, bowls, small glasses, coffee cups, and silverware) for 4, one pot, one pan, a tea pot, a strainer, a bottle opener/corkscrew, a large serving spoon, and a pancake turner. No towels, paper or otherwise are supplied for the kitchen. No sponge or soap for the kitchen is supplied. No coffee maker. There is only one ice tray, so we started putting the ice in the strainer to keep up with our needs - 5 people need ore than 12 pieces of ice! 6. There are a number of small stores in the area for food supplies - but many of them close before 6pm. 7. Maid service is available for an extra $15 (not sure if that's per day or total, since we didn't use it). The only service you will receive is fresh (very very thin and small) bath towels (no hand or face) daily, trash removal, toilet paper, and soap. The suite itself was very clean. 8. There is a very nice gym, with nice equipment, but it is in the basement, so therefore not very well ventilated. 9. There is also a lounge that is spacious and faces the street on the ground floor - good for people watching! 10. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. They will greet you each and every time they see you, and will answer your questions. When I checked out, I mentioned that I had a great stay, except the last night there was a group of probably 8 young men who checked in and had several rooms on several floors. They were running back and forth between rooms, up and down the stairs, slamming doors and shouting. I finally went out at 3:30am after 2 hours of this and asked them to be quiet, which they did except for the door slamming thing. The guy at the front desk said all I had to do was call him and he would have taken care of it, and I believe that. So, all in all, not a Hyatt or a Sheraton, just a small apartment style hotel on the edge of SOHO, Chinatown, and Little Italy that is clean and safe, and reasonable. I am very pleased. Whoops! I forgot the most important thing - the beds! Our double beds in the the bedroom were brand new - still had the IKEA tags hanging off the frames. They were comfortable - but be aware that the AC is right next to the foot of one of them. We just directed the vent up and it wasn't a problem, and was nice white noise. The futon bed in the living room is very large, and quite firm. It was new, a leather covered two piece foam thing. One side is slightly softer than the other, and the hotel didn't seem to have a fitted sheet large enough for it, so we ended up using a flat sheet for the bottom and just pinning the sheet under the legs to hold it on. I like hard mattresses, and this one has very little give - perfect! The pillows were okay - they had some kind of covering on them that didn't let the air out of them very easily so they were overly poofy for my tastes and took a long time to smoosh down.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wiesloch, Germany", "Title": "\u201cclean and good location.\u201d", "Author": "OlafR", "ReviewID": "UR7350412", "Content": "We read many reviews on NY hotels before we made a reservation at Off Soho. We needed a suite style room for four with a seperate bedroom for two (the kids) in a good manhattan location with multiple subway connections at a reasonable price. What was left after this search was more or less this hotel. The reservation process and checkin procedere was problem-free, staff was friendly and helpful with luggage storage and limo service after checkout. The room didn't have the latest furniture, but - hey - at this price in that location, our expectations were not that high. Despite the age of the interior and furniture, everything was perfectly clean and worked properly (we didnt use the aircon). The hotel has 3 or four different subway lines in walking distance and a very good food mart. Our expectations were fully met, we have nothing to complain and can recommend this hotel to other tourists.", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Off Soho Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93374-Reviews-Off_Soho_Suites-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$259 - $367*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">11 Rivington Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10002</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "93374", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f6/be/f6beabefb596eabc2be52c2ca130a2a86large.jpg"}}

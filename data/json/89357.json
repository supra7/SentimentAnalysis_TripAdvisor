When we arrived, we almost did not stay, but we thought it would work for one night. We had asked for a room with an interior location and they did accommodate us. However, although quite pleasant, the people at the front desk were unable to offer restaurant recommendations or much other area advice. The only place to eat in the area was in a strip mall nearby. There was a Walmart up the road, so we were able to pick up a few last minute items for our trip. It was quite cold outside when we stayed and we found, to our dismay, that the bathroom was not heated at all. Also, I let the water run for a considerable amount of time, but it was stone cold. On the bright side, the bed was comfortable and the WiFi worked well. They did have one computer in the tiny lobby as well. However, it was out in the open with absolutely no privacy. The room includes breakfast which was allegedly served from 7:30 to 9:30AM. When we went down at 9:10, they were out of everything from milk to coffee to sweetner to waffles. Someone brought down some milk, but my husband drank cold coffee and I couldn't have tea because I cannot use sugar and there was nothing else. We have stayed in many \"budget\" hotels that serve breakfast and this was, by far, the absolute worst. Our rolls, coffee and croissants at a 2 star Paris hotel were better than what this hotel offered. We would have gone elsewhere to eat, but we were headed to a cruise ship and knew we would have a large lunch. Included in our rate was parking for the cruise duration as well as transportation to and from the airport. They were very accommodating regarding the time we wanted to leave and we were driven in a private mini-van. The driver said he had taken others to the port and knew the way. He took the route on city streets rather than the highway in order to save his boss the tolls which was fine because there was absolutely no traffic that day. However, he took us to the Inner Harbor, not the cruise terminal and did not know how to get to the terminal. He stopped at a grocery store to ask directions, but they did not know where to go. Finally, we asked him to stop at a hotel which he did. There was a taxi driver there and she drew him a map and we made our way to the terminal. A 15-20 minute trip took over an hour. Fortunately we had plenty of time, but if we were running late, it would have been nerve-wracking! When it came time for pick-up, I gave the driver the exact address of the terminal so he could put it into his GPS and he arrived in short order. He took the highway back to hotel so it was a quick trip. Hopefully he will now know where to go if other cruisers stay at this hotel. He said they just started offering the stay and cruise package so that was why he was unfamiliar with the port area. Our car was well-watched and just as we left it directly behind the hotel office out of view of the highway. I was a little concerned because fellow passengers told us the hotel was not in the best of neighborhoods. We were not familiar with Baltimore so we did not know this in advance. Bottom line, this is a basic hotel that can work for a single night, but for a few dollars more, there are probably nicer places to stay.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore", "Title": "\u201cFast and Convenient\u201d", "Author": "Sung L", "ReviewID": "UR122421684", "Content": "Wow!

When i explained that i knew the correct rate was $59.99 he tried his hardest to convince me that the website was wrong and that $80 is their \"weekend rate\". Once i told him i was a former corporate employee he gave a slick grin and reduced his quoted rate to the correct rate. BUT he tried to charge me $20 in tax and again asking for $80 EVEN. I quickly calculated and told him that with tax the total should be $67.09. Then he told me that they round it up to $80 and use the remaining $12.91 as a deposit... REALLY??? Are you serious? Oh but it gets better. I gave in and handed the clerk $80 and asked for a receipt. Wouldn't you know he had one more crazy story for me. He said that the do not give receipts until the next day at check out, even for cash paying customers... Of course i know this to be a lie as again, im in the business but i didn't feel like battling this rude person anymore, i kindly took my money back from his hands and told him I would go somewhere else. I immediately went to my car, sat in the parking lot and called choice hotels to complain. Customer service apologized for his rude behavior and repeated lies and emailed me a statement to receive a free night at a choice hotel property of my choice.

We were shown to our room. It was clean but very small. When we opened the door the door hit the bed so tells you how tiny it is. It had a very odd smell to the room. My kids went to turn on the bedside lamp and desk lamps and they didn't turn on. The overhead light was an annoying fluorescent light. Then my son decided to watch some tv while I was trying to figure out how to get to where we were going. The tv didn't work...why?? Because they unplug every thing in the room. We had to crawl under the desk to plug all cords in. The desk chair felt wet and slimy and the cords were greasy as well. My son sat in chair to watch tv ( not desk chair) and said it felt wet and weird as well. I have a special needs child and he didn't feel comfortable here at all. He was paranoid that smoke detector was sitting on the floor with NO battery. Went we went to bed the traffic from the busy highway was so loud I sat and looked at the wall all night. Had less than 3 hrs. I will say the beds were comfortable. Took shower the next morning in the huge bathroom and whatever they clean the floors with is some seriously heavy duty wax. I warned my boys about it because even with standing on towels they slid out from under you. My poor 12 yr old lost balance and came within inches of busting his head off sink. Breakfast was decent I liked the fact you could make your own belgian waffles. I got excited when I saw fresh fruit till I realized it was dusty wax decoration.

During the holiday, December 2007, we booked a week. A couple days after we went home, my friend and I began developing lesions beginning with our feet and progressing throughout our bodies. We went to the hospital where they diagnosed the parasites as scabies (contagious itch or mange especially with exudative crusts that is caused by parasitic mites), together with tinnea pedius (athletes foot). We returned to the manager of the motel to notify her that the room had parasites, and to request a refund to defray medical costs. She refused, saying that we had no proof that the documented parasites were contracted there. (Coincidentally, however, staff at the motel did acknowledge that the room we had was now closed for \u201crepairs\u201d). The parasites are extremely annoying, not to mention embarrassing. I wonder how many others were infected before they closed the room. If denial was not management\u2019s first response, I wonder if my friend and I might have been spared this pain and embarrassment. Management must have received other complaints before ours to prompt the room closure. Fortunately my friend and I have no spouses to have to explain this to. I wonder how many others who have been infected have been as fortunate.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "baltimore md", "Title": "\u201cJust 4 Fun\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3350441", "Content": "The Regal Hotel is a low budget motel that is in itself, beautiful.

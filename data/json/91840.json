I admit that since my birthday lands right smack in the middle of spring break that the environment might not have been what I was looking for, but boy was I wrong! When I arrived with my friends, our room was automatically upgraded to a suite in the new HRH tower. The room was beautiful! Everything was automated and there were even 2 built in ipod docs to play our own music through the room speakers with! The beds were luxe and comfy. The comforters were UNBELIEVABLY soft and warm. Even the couches were extremely comfortable while still looking extremely chic. I fell asleep there by accident on more than one occasion. I am not the biggest gambler, but I did actually win more than100% profit! That was so cool for me since I barely gamble to get that kind of payout. Beginners luck I guess. The cocktail waitresses were all so sweet and accommodating. They were just friendly enough to make you feel comfortable without doing too much. The hotel is not on the strip, but just the perfect distance away to miss the heavy traffic but be able to drive/ride there in less than 5 minutes. However, there really was no need to leave the hotel. You could get the whole Las Vegas experience there. The restaurants were great (OMG you simply MUST have the guacamole at Pink's Taco's)! The casino is great, the service is great and most everyone seems happy to help you. My party did have trouble with one very rude HRH employee who refused to serve us at the bar (a group of 30+ year old women with appropriate identification). When I brought the issue to the attention of the front desk, a manager was standing in front of me within 5 minutes, getting details about what happened and seeming genuinely concerned, as if how I felt really mattered. I appreciated that, especially since it was my birthday. Not only was the issue swiftly resolved, but I was also given a $50 room credit for my inconvenience. The food and beverage manager and registration manager saw to it. They were amazing and so kind. I expected less from such a busy place with so many other guests to see to. I was so surprised at the personal attention I was given. That sold me. I am a HRH customer from now on whenever I come to Vegas. My girlfriend and I both turned 30 this week. We and our friends all had an amazing time courtesy of HRH. I highly recommend the stay!", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery Diappointed\u201d", "Author": "allizzonn", "ReviewID": "UR126996249", "Content": "Booked online at hotels.com stated if you stayed 3 nights you got a bottle of alcohol free, upon checking in I was told not only am I charged 18.00 extra per night which I knew I also need a credit card so they could bill me 50.00 a night for a securrity deposit which I didn't get back till I checked out then it takes 72 hrs to credit to you acct. I was not told this, the girl informed me No bottle of alcohol was reserved for me. I stay at the Hrock in Boloxi and the rooms are beautiful, walking into the room I thought I was in a Days Inn. It was terrible. No coffee maker and when going into the room someone had ordered room service and the cart with the left over food sat outside our room on a cart for 24 hrs until I complained and then it was removed. We never saw a housekeeper, the beds were made but in 4 days never changed the bathroom floor was never mopped and all they did was wipe the sink out add new towels and left new soap. Hardly no one was in the casino and you have to take a cab to the strip, we went to the same drop off spot every time and coming and going we paid a different fare every time. Upon check out I complained to Mike he was the only nice part of Hard Rock. He gave me 40.00 off and a coupon for a free bottle of Vodke which I can't use cause I was flying home that day. But when I go back I will stop there on my way to my next hotel get my free bottle and stay somewhere else. Make sure you stay on the strip not at the Hard Rock. Oh also I have a Hard Rock card from Biloxi but they don't honor it and the points for the hotel don't go on that card. I do not recommend this hotel unless you are staying there for Rehab that's what the HH tower is for Shanks and alcoholics :(", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Schaumburg, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGood Place - Good Value - Recommended For Party Goers\u201d", "Author": "JLeoG21", "ReviewID": "UR126981385", "Content": "Haven't been to a ton of Vegas hotels but my experience at the HRH was positive. From a price standpoint, it was one of the best values I could find and you get a lot for what you spend. There were 4 of us so we stayed in the Queen Suite room (no extra person fee). It had 2 beds in one room (which were very comfy) and a separate living room with a huuuggee bathroom. Definitely plenty of space for 2 couples. Negatives: The view which was of a parking garage. However if you are on the pool side, be aware that music starts pumping early in the morning which can affect you if you want to sleep in. We couldn't hear anything since we were not on that side. There is also a fee to use the steam and sauna which I wasn't expecting (but fitness center is free). We also had trouble checking in. We arrived real late (1am) and they didn't have a rooms for us, even though we specified we were getting in late on reservation. You may want to call prior to arrival to make sure they have your room. After waiting a bit they found one which was actually out of order (it was missing a door in bathroom) but we took it and they provided us with a food/beverage credit. Dining: Ate at 3 restaurants and was real happy with the food and service. I would suggest getting Resaturant.com coupons to use which are offered for most on their property. My favorite part of the property were the pools. Plenty of areas from party spots to private spots. Has sand areas and 2nd level pools, palm trees, hot tubs, gambling tables and more. I would definitely stay at this hotel again as long as it stays within this price range and would recommend it to other younger, party goers.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Myers, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat service in the Casino.\u201d", "Author": "LeilaJean", "ReviewID": "UR126875633", "Content": "We love the music and the atmosphere.

It's convenient. The rooms are nicer and newer. Check in is less hectic.

They are quick. Get the highest floor you can. Enjoy the view looking down at the pool. There\u2019s always something interesting going on. Just save up for these things and you will be appreciated. Be prepared to party among scantily clad people to loud music day and night. That\u2019s just the way it is. If you have kids, just mellow out about what they are seeing. Why are you bringing them here, anyway? If you are old like me, just mellow out about the constant pulsing beat that starts in the morning, emanates from the pool and works its way right into the center of your brain. It will stop at sunset. Just enjoy it and feel young again. Remember, you were annoying once too. Have a cocktail. Enjoy the rock memorabilia. Take some time to relax at the spa. The d\u00e9cor with tons of white tile reminds me of an old hospital from the 1940\u2019s. In a cool, retro way. I\u2019ve been to this one several times and it has always been very clean.

I can put you in another tower.\" Since we were getting downgraded we asked if there was any type of compensation she could offer and she ROLLED HER EYES before offering us a $50 food and bev credit and a room switch for the next night. Fine. The room itself was OK. Nothing outstanding, nothing disturbing. The next day we woke up late, decided to eat something at Mr. Lucky's the 24 hour \"diner\" downstairs. DON'T ORDER THE BREAKFAST BAGEL. YUCK! After eating we tried to change our room only to find out that they only do that up to noon and it was past noon. Since no one told us that the night before we spoke to the manager who was very nice and apoligized for the misunderstanding. She offered us additional credit which was better than nothing so we used the credit at Pink Taco. Yummy! Although the name is a bit crass, the food is pretty good. I'd recommend the appetizer platter and the nachos. The pool was very crowded so we decided to do some gambling. Save your money if you're into slots though, it seemed other hotels had the newer - more interactive slot machines which I enjoyed playing more.

Take a taxi from the airport as it is cheaper than the shuttle and you won't have to stop at other hotels.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cThe Hard Rock. ROCKS!\u201d", "Author": "thecool272", "ReviewID": "UR126078810", "Content": "Ive read alot of mixed reviews on this hotel with alot being fairly negative, but i have to say this place will definitely be one of my Go-TO spots in Vegas. I had an AMAZING stay. This is going to be long one so bear with me. :-) First off, the property is one of the best looking in Vegas. From inside and out. Its clean, dark, sexy, new, has everything you need, and is filled with cool Rock n Roll memorabilia to check out. (artist instruments, photography, clothing, press releases, etc, etc, feels like a smaller version of the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame.) And the music in the hotel is jamming rock hits 24/7! It's located a little behind the main strip on Las Veags Blvd so you wont be in the middle of all the madness. I liked staying off the strip so it doesnt attract a TON of tourists and crazy party people. The hotel felt a little more private and exclusive since it was mostly hotel guests actually staying there and not people just walking thru crowding up the areas. I supposed it helps keep riff raff away as well. (thefts, violence, etc) There is also FREE PARKING in huge parking garages, so if you have a car its really easy to get in and out of the hotel. The walk to the strip is probably a little under a mile but the strip is so long and with some other hotels located on the opposite side of the main highway (The Palms, Rio, etc) its sometimes better to have a vehicle while your there. If your not staying in the middle of the strip, id advise to rent a car or be ready to take cabs. All that walking can really tear you down by the end of the nights. The entire property consists of 3 towers and is the perfect size. its definitely not as big as many of the properties on the strip but i found its smaller size to be better so it didnt take you forever to walk thru your hotel to your room or wherever your going. it takes FOREVER to walk thru most of the hotels on the strip so by the time you get to your room your beat. (see: Planet Hollywood, The Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Bally's, Ceasar's, MGM, etc, etc) I'll mention \"walking alot\" during this review because trust me, you'll pound the pavement while your there and its 24/7 GO-GO-GO! its Vegas baby. There's alot to do at the hotel so you can spend alot of time there then pick certain nights to go hit the strip hard.There are some really good dining choices along with the famous Hard Rock Cafe. there's convienient type stores, a starbucks, a john varvatos store, Hart & Huntington Tattoo shop, Vanity Nightclub, The Joint - Live Music Venue, Sports Bar/Betting Rooms, excellent gym, spa, pools, etc, etc. Like i said, its got everything you need. If your into the club/live music scene, this is a great place to stay. Vanity Nightclub always has special guest dj's and huge events and The Joint always does live concerts from all sorts of rock n rollers. The pool at the Hard Rock is composed of 4 or 5 areas and has to be the biggest and best one in Vegas. It clean, with lots of room to hang poolside on chairs, lounge beds, cabana's or bars. The service was EXCELLENT, QUICK, and FUN. If your looking for a party with party people and slamming music, this is the one. There is a resident dj and usually special guest dj's 24/7 so the pool is always jumping. The music starts in the afternoon and stops around 4 or 5 when the pool closes so its plenty of time to party and it wont keep you up at night. if you sleep. :-) Rehab at the Hard Rock pools starts in the summer on Sunday's and is insanity, which you know if you've ever been there or have seen it on tv. IF you dont want to be subject to the biggest pool party in the world over the summer during a trip to Vegas, then dont stay here... Its crazy insane. If your on a family vacay and are looking for a nice relaxing time at the pool with the kids, then dont stay here... if you are looking for all that, then by all means STAY HERE. The rooms are amazing as to be expected. I stayed in the Paradise Tower on the 16th floor and got a room that overlooked the entire pool area and bit of the strip so the view was awesome. The rooms are super comfortable and are a really good size. Nice bathrooms, huge showers, double sinks with seating area, 40\" flatscreen tv with cable and pay per view, wi-fi, mp3 stereos, king or queen size super comfortable beds, desk area, table and chair sitting area, closet and drawer area with iron and ironing board, in room safe, mini refridgerator (be careful tho, if you eat or drink anything, you have to pay for it. and its usually expensive. i took what they had in there, out of mine and used mine for a fridge to stock my drinks and leftovers) My room was VERY quiet too. The hotel seemed packed and really busy but it wasnt loud in the rooms from outside hall noise or noisy neighbors. My room package came with free WiFi access so im not sure at what people are talking about them charging for WiFi. I thought it was free since they do charge a \"resort-fee\" at something like $18-$20 per night but it may not be free. Its SUPER quick high speeds and I was able to run my laptop on it playing online graphic intensive console games, music, and hd movies. i also connected my phone and tablet without an issue. The room service was great too. Fairly quick and really nice and knowledgeable. They will drop off and pick up everything you order so you dont have to take your dishes and uneaten items anywhere. The food was good and you get a really good amount of everything. I seemed to have leftovers constantly. Only thing is, the room service is expensive. Althought, sometimes it's better then having to walk to a restaurant and sit somewhere while you eat or having to drive to a fast food spot nearby. If you want to lay in your comfortable bed, rest, eat, and chill, then use the room service. Sometimes, if you get a good deal on Groupon or something like that, they will throw in free room service credits. i got $100 free on mine so that was perfect. Housekeeping is prompt and fast and they kept my room really clean. I left all my stuff laying all over the floor one night and left early in the morning for a gambling session then came back to everything picked up and laid on the bed in a neat stack. (shirts, magazines, stuff, etc) Always had clean towels, toilet paper, and toiletries, The casino is nice and has lots of tables, machines and bars to play at. It's not that big so you can stick to what you like without having to search for it. id say its about the size of The Palms casino floor. At nights on the weekends the place gets jumping with dancers on platform stripper poles and rock music. The bartenders are all great and fast. Drinks are pricey but their is a 2 for 1 happy hour on sun-thur from 12am to 8pm so if your starting late thats a pretty good deal. There is smoking inside of course, but the ceilings are decently high so its not too smokey inside like some other casinos. The staff and service at the HRH is great and some of the best ive ever experienced. From check in to check out, i was impressed. Efficiency, knowledge, and professionalism is all key and every staff member i encounted, had that. From front desk to pool boy. All in all, the Hard Rock Hotel was an incredible experience and i'll definitely stay there again. i dont understand all the negative reviews. Unless i just stayed during a good time of year and missed all the drama. 2 Thumbs up for the HRH.

First of all, I reserved a \"City View\" Suitewith one King Bed which looked great on the website. I checked in and was assigned my room. When I got to my room, first it had two queen beds..not a huge deal. I open up my curtains to look at my \"city view\" and I discover that I am looking into the parking garage directly and two gentlmen are urinating in front of me. So that was great. I go back to desk and ask if there is a possibility to change rooms and the agent says \"what exactly don't you like about your room\" I say first it has two queen beds which I can deal with, but I reserved a city room and I look literally into the garage and there are two men there relieving themself outside my window. She tells me ok you are lucky as I park in that garage for work and I usually look into the rooms at naked people. I told her that is fascinating news, but I am not really into it. She then tells me the room is what I paid for as \"City View\" at the Hard rock means it is not a pool view and you look at the garage in most of the rooms. City like. WOW. So for an upgrade charge of $30 per night she can switch me to the other side of the building which looks at the pool. So now I am up to 180 per night at a hotel that normally charges not more than $100 and I am looking into another building and a pool. The upgraded room was very much like the orignal room, smelled like baby oil which was not ok. The service was not great. Upon checkouot after having just a really horrible few days, the agent asks me \"how was your stay?\" I reply it was actually really bad, probably one of the worst ever.

The hotel manager was apologetic and polite and explained that he would be moving us to another property at his expense. He would be refunding our reservation, and inviting us back for free accommodations at the HRH at a later date. It was late, we were tired from traveling, and I was not in the mood to argue. I made the mistake of trusting that the accomodations would be comparable to what we had expected when making a reservation with the HRH. We were transported to a renovated motel complex near the HRH. It was not what we were expecting and certainly not consistent with the accomodations at the HRH or any other Las Vegas property we are use to staying at. The small motel lobby was crowded with people who, let's just say, made us feel uncomfortable... When we got into our ground level motel room, my wife cried. She felt unsafe and did not sleep. In the morning we moved to a hotel on the strip. What makes this situation so bad is that the HRH never refunded our payment as they had promised.

I called down to the front desk and informed them of our situation. They brought towels and said they would let the manager know. All the kids slept in the other room, but when the boys woke up they were complaining of their bed and bad rest. We could tell that the bed looked \"broken\" in the middle and had a large V shape slant. This made the boys \"slide\" out of bed. I lifted up the sheets to see if maybe it was the feather bed only to find a large stain on the mattress what looked like kool-aid or wine. I thought that hotels got rid of soiled and broken beds????

We have been treating it with benadryl, creams etc with no luck until I finally took my son to the doctor. Because BOTH boys had the rash, it is assumed that they caught it on that trip since that is the only time they have shared sleeping arrangements in the same bed (TWO doctors confirmed) I finally took my son to the doctor and he was diagnosed with SCABIES... He had to go through two treatments. According to the prescription it can take up to four weeks for the MITES to quit itching in the skin and for the rash to disappear.

We found that Pink Taco has the most mouthwatering taquitos that are filled with potatoes and even better - deliciousness. My 17 yr old. daughter has literally been \"dreaming\" about them for over a year now since the last time we visited. Be sure and get a side of Guacamole for their fresh cooked corn chips. Just the perfect amount of garlic. The Margarita's are just the tip of the iceberg...loved the Peach ones the best.

It was a decent hotel with a definite \"rock\" vibe. Motley Crue were in residency at the time, so it may have seemed more like that than normal, but all the staff and dealers seemed relatively young with a more laid-back rocker style. We ate at Pink Taco - was decent, nothing overly special, but good food & drinks, the best food we ate at the hotel was probably at the 24 hour place, just above the 'centre bar', in fact that's where all the hotel's room service comes from as well. It's bigger than you think and they get you in and out in decent time and with a friendly attitude...no b.s. Once we finally got to our room, which was in Paradise Tower w/pool view, it was pretty big with a nice bathroom with separate shower/toilet. The only downside to the bathroom is the lighting and I find a lot of hotels screw this up - better lighting, please!! The black floor, black sinks and dark everything makes it cool, but at least give people (particularly women, who need decent lighting for make-up) the choice of brighter lighting!!! I beg you. Otherwise great room, NO BED BUGS, super-comfy beds you really sink into...which is usually the case after a night in Vegas;) Oh, btw, DO NOT even think about touching any of the 'mini-bar' items or anything in the fridge. The moment you pick it up, you're room is charged!! We knew this, so didn't get screwed, but I could see it happening! Overall the hotel was good enough. I likely wouldn't choose to stay here again, mainly on the basis that it's off the strip and about a 30 minute walk or $15 cab ride either way.

The front desk (including the manager on duty) gave us the old run around and the nonsense explanation that our room had gone to the Motley Crue fans who were overrunning the property.

It is a ways from the strip, although within walking distance. (Albeit a long trek) I would advise taking a cab at night, as Harmon ave. is dark, and has sections of construction where you walk on gravel. Being off the strip isn't a bad thing though, as it's much less busy than the ever cram-jammed strip sidewalks. If you want GREAT views, go to the top level of the HRH tower self park. (8th floor) To avoid high prices of the supplied goody bar on the dresser, walk across the street to the CVS pharmacy. A bottle of smart water is $7.50 on the goody bar, and if you so much as rattle something there, you're charged for it. (Everything sits on sensors) Same with the minibar, look but don't touch unless you want to pay premium price. The room is dark colors with dim lighting, so pack a flashlight. :-) The bed is comfy and has fluffy pillows and down comforter. I stayed in the off season, but still got sun on a lounge chair in 70 degree weather. A nice sunning place is on the 3rd floor of the center island building. Take the elevator to the top. The pool up there is heated, and has windows in the floor looking down into the dance floor below. The pool area was under construction, but was still amazing. There are hot tubs and pools everywhere. You literally need a pool map. I'd come back to the Hard Rock again in summer just for the pools here. The shower has a rain head, and is all slate tiled with thick glass doors. Those doors have big gaps though, and you end up with a flooded floor by the toilet. I just swabbed after every shower with a towel. The supplied shampoo and conditioner is nice. The casino is noisy, but show me one in Vegas that isn't. The room was quiet, although you hear people in the hallway to the point you wonder if the door isn't open a crack. A nice touch is your own HVAC. I like a cold room to sleep in, and it took it down to 60 degrees with no problem. There is a clock/radio with an iPOD jack. Forget the radio though, as about any FM station has static. The WiFi is only a couple of bars and is extra if you want to surf the 'net. (Despite the extra \"resort fee\" including it) Opening a browser only redirects to the sign up screen. The room has a safe in a cabinet which is nice for leaving stuff behind for the day. You set your own combo. To save time when returning after a day in Vegas, have your cabbie take you to the tower you're staying in. The HRH has a cab stand in the self park. The Paradise has a back casino entrance which is marked \"self park\" inside, and can be reached by driving around past the main entrance and down past the CVS pharmacy. I had breakfast in Lucky 7, but it was only so-so. The service was okay, but the food wasn't that good.

ROOM: You have your own entrance with concierge and bell service. This cuts down the time at the check in line. The lobby is dark leather and very sedate. There is a side entrance to the nightclub Vanity so you don't have to stand in line for that either. The rooms are large and luxurious. Great bedding, towels, and amenities. I wish they gave you body gel, though, not just soap. There is a flat panel TV in the bedroom and in the sitting area. Great view of the pools and the strip. You can't use the HDMI input on the TV though. Lame! There is an iPod dock in the wall so you can play tunes in the sitting area. The room was surprisingly quiet for a party hotel. Bathroom has two sinks, large soaking tub, and HUGE three person shower with rain shower head or regular. The JOINT: This is a great venue for seeing a show. Every seat is a good seat and the General Admissions floor is right up close and personal. There is a large bar area where you can stand with a drink and still enjoy the show. The bathrooms are maintained by an attendant so they stay pretty clean. CASINO: Very friendly casino staff, helped me to learn Craps and made the evening entertaining. The players card is easy to use and even I got a nice comp for not much play. The circle bar is fun and the bartenders are cute. Most of the hotel guests + staff appear to be <25 years old. ETC: Mr Lucky's is a nice diner style restaurant. Ask for the $7.77 steak and shrimp special. Pancakes are awesome. You can spend your $$$ at the gift shop, upscale lingerie, convenience store, and Starbucks.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pearland, TX", "Title": "\u201cFirst stay...

I bought the Motley Crue package for the last concert and upgraded to the HRH all suite hotel. First impression: Lobby, really nice; leads directly into casino. Easy to get around... However, the suite was in need of some cleaning... In fact, the carpet looked so dirty that even though the beds and bathroom looked \"clean\" it made me suspect the entire cleaning process. Therefore, I called down to request another room... Was on hold for a long time tot he point I went down and made the request in person. Got another room and that room had a funny smell... again, the carpet looked like it needed to be clean bad even though the bed and bathroom appeared to be clean... my wife wanted to rest so I let it stand. Anyway, the package I bought was for one night... Really Hard Rock?!?! Why only 1 night? I ended up purchasing a Groupon deal for an additional night stay. Anyway, I thought I had confirmed prior to arrival about the two stay package and I even inquired upon check in if I had to do anything to make sure the stay was smooth. I was told both times that everything was in order and that I wouldn't have check out and check in for both stays. With the Groupon deal, I was given some vouchers for free drinks and credit. However, I was told that I would have to wait till the day the Groupon deal was active to receive the promotion... So the next morning just prior to the check out time I went to the front desk and asked for my vouchers. I was told that I had to go the main Hard Rock reservation desk to get them... Why? What if I wanted to just stay at the HRH for the entire stay and not venture out into the casino or other hotels? So, I finally went to retrieve my vouchers and then we went sightseeing/shopping. Upon our return to the room, our keys would not work. I had to go to the front desk to get my keys reactivated. At this point, I asked to speak to a manager. When approached by a manager I explained my frustration with the service that I had received... I told them my first impression of the hotel customer service and room was not very nice... I was asked what did I want and I said nothing other than to express my opinion and to make it known that something like this would not make me feel like coming back... I was offered a $50.00 food and beverage credit for my trouble, which I accepted. However, even that ended up having a caveat. We ate at Mr. Lucky's and thought it would be comped because of the credit. It was except for the tip... Really...??? A $6.00 would have to be paid in cash at check out? What..? The waiter would not get his tip from the hotel credit??? Pretty bad if you ask me... Anyway, I will say that the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is a nice place... Mr. Lucky's was good for meals... The wait staff there was great!! Food was pretty good, too! Try the Strip steak and shrimp deal for $7.77 and the All You Can Eat Prime Rib dinner for $9.99. Both were pretty good. Won money at the casino and enjoyed the concert... but I am not sure I would come back unless I have a good deal (another Groupon, perhaps) with all of the other casino hotels in town.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "walnut creek, ca", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel but could use a deep cleaning\u201d", "Author": "islandfix", "ReviewID": "UR125038601", "Content": "We stayed at the Hard Rock for the Motley Crue show last Sunday.

We've stayed here before, and since it's Vegas we rarely stay in our room. We gamble, love to dine, and I love to shop... awe the perfect trifecta. The hotel was busy, I mean really busy, we had twenty people waiting to either check-in or check out while we were waiting, which was a drag. But, we had a really nice representative who checked us in. Fast forward a couple of hours, and we find our questionable housekeeping episode. I decided to take a shower, and I as I stepped out of the tub my eyes transfixed on the 6x6 huge glass bathroom mirror. This is what the previous visitor of room 611 wrote in the foggy mirror \" We will be waiting at Pink Taco(this is a taco bar located in the lobby area of the hotel )...\"explicative\", along with a drawing of a women's legs open with an anatomically correct depiction of a women's nether region. It wasn't the drawing or the writing that eerked me, but rather that housekeeping OBVIOUSLY did not wipe down the mirror. On the second night, and after another housekeeping \"attempt\", the mirror was still left unclean. Since housekeeping was lacking, I started to get grossed out at all the possible other areas that were left uncleaned i.e. bed sheets, toilet, and desks. Other than the gross housekeeping, the hotel area was nice. Here are the pros and cons in a nutshell: Pros: Great price contemporary room Free shuttle to the strip Cons: $10 cab far to the strip $20 resort fee, for what exactly I don't know??? housekeeping??? high minimum for table gambling ~$20 P.S. The concierge was a joke, the blonde woman who claimed to be concierge was rude and unhelpful. Example: There were two people waiting in the concierge line, myself and this other guy. After this lady helped the guy, she got on the phone and then \"signaled\" to me to wait while she chatted. I'm not in the customer service game, but I think the guest standing in front of you is more important that a guest that's on the phone.

I have been to Vegas over 8-10 times in the past few years and this is by far the best room/hotel i have stayed in. The room itself was spacious and spotless and very rock n roll the highlight(s) were the bed it was soooooooo comfy and big we were both impressed never experienced another bed like it before or since, the other major highlight was the view we were in thr tower block and thought with the great price we paid we would get a crappy view boy were we surprised we were very high up with a panoramic vista of the pool and the Vegas skyline a brilliant spectacle to just chill out and watch. A word of warning if you want a quiet time by the pool do not arrive at the weekend when the Rehab event is on as it can get loud and raucous but it is a site to behold and if you like watching loads of Yanks getting loaded then you won't be dissapointed. The pool however is very good and large with loads of different areas and they do have a pool area set aside for non Rehab guests but it does get a bit crowded at times. The casino is great and as you can imagine they have a very good sound track to listen to whilst you play your favourite game, and when i got bored i wondered around taking in all the great Hard Rock memorabilia which was just awsome. One down side to this stay and i must point out it is not the fault of HRH is the adjacent Hard Rock Cafe. Went there one night for a meal which was fine but our waiter sold us a Hard Club membership card which we were told would get us subtsantial discount on all HR merchandice anywhere in the world I specifically asked if this included the hotel and casino (i wanted a HRH tee shirt) was told yes. So the next day just before departing i went to purchase one from the hotel and was told HR Cafe was a separate business and no discounts were given, so i left feeling rather dissapointed and ripped off.

For that reason, I avoided it for a while. Until I got a deal that was just too good to pass up. Worth giving it another try...? A resounding YES. This hotel is like night and day week-days vs. week-ends. During week-days it's kinda quiet and laid-back on week-ends it's wall-to-wall pandemonium! Don't come here to relax: no way that's gonna happen. But you probably will have a good time. The location is good: off the strip, but not too far off the strip. It's handy to have a car. Still the best pool scene in Vegas. The 24-hr. restaurant is tasty and the \"special\" is a good deal. The front desk staff is friendly and you even get smiles... And they're more likely to upgrade your room (at least during the week) than one of the bigger, fancier casinos that have a steadier stream of high-rollahs... My room was beautiful, clean, big, comfortable. Points off only for a few things: 1) Although they've improved their sports book incredibly by making it a Cantor concession, the odds on table games here are bad. They pretty much uniformly are paying 6-5 on a blackjack, whereas most casinos still pay 3-2. They were also one of the first hotels to have dealers hit on a soft 17 (now most do.) Both give advantages to the house. So while the dealers are great, friendly, sassy sometimes, from an odds perspective it does not pay to play blackjack here at all. Also, MANY of the players here do not know how to play blackjack and do all kinds of stupid and infuriating things. If you can't roll with that, also not a good place to play. 2) The soaps in the rooms are TINY. I know, everyone's cutting back but this is almost ridiculous. 3) The bell staff is uniformly glum and rude. Maybe they're trying to look cool, but the actual impression they give is they hate their jobs and the hotel is a sucky place to work...I'm sure HR does not intend to put this across. Still, in a week, whenever I passed bell staff in the hallway, never a smile or greeting of any kind; not even any eye contact... 4) They (like almost everyone else in Vegas these days, charges a ridiculous 'resort fee' that covers things you'd never use (wireless Internet...completely unnecessary if you've got an iPhone or tablet) and they'd never be able to make money charging for anymore...Just figure that extra $20 into the room cost when you're trying to figure out whether it's worth it.

Once we got to our room, it was very nice. When you enter the room, you are in the kitchen type area, and closets. There is no room in the refrigerator for anything other than the Hotels High Priced Items. The next room is the living room, separated by a small wall type partition then the bedroom. The bathroom area is as large at the bedroom, with a stand-up shower stall, and separate area for the towelette, two sinks, and a large tub. The only downside to the bathroom is that the tub doesn't have the jacuzzi feature. The only thing I was unhappy with in the bedroom was that all the pillows were made of the same material, which as soon as your head hits it, it compresses to nothing. I ended up using one of the sofa pillows to sleep on. The staff on that tower (maids, bell men, and desk people) we very nice. We didn't hear anything going on in the hall, and we were the first room off the elevator. The HRH tower has a separate parking garage, which is nice and convenient. The biggest minus to the HRH tower is that there is no gym, and you have to walk over to the old section of the hotel to get to it. The gym closed at 7pm, which sucks because you are automatically charged for it, with the resort fees, so it should be open till Midnight or later. Since we visited in January, we never checked out the pool because it was mid-40's each day. Lucky's restaurant has a diner type feel, and the food is decent. Because Lucky's is in the main area, there is a line waiting most of the time. The Pink Taco on the other hand is terrible. We have eaten there twice and both times the food is not worth the money.

A friend had already made our reservations because we were attending a concert at the Joint (the Hard Rock's on site concert venue). Everything I experienced was the opposite of what I expected. The doorman was friendly and welcoming, the check-in process was efficient. The resort fee and $50 per night room deposit were explained to me. My room was upgraded to a higher floor with a view. I received a complimentary bottle of alcohol and a voucher for $200 credit for the casino. The room was extremely fresh and clean, towels were thick, the bed and linens were comfy. I became ill during my stay and needed assistance from housekeeping. They arrived within 30 minutes and refreshed my room. The shuttle driver was also friendly and helpful. Checkout was efficient. The $50 deposit was credited back to my account within 24 hours. The resort fee does now include in-room wireless internet access (this was an extra charge when I stayed here 2 years ago). There are a few caveats. On Friday & Saturday nights, the hotel is crowded with a young party crowd. (I'm a 50 year old woman, but young at heart). You can't walk to the Strip, so taxi fees added up ($15 per trip). The shuttle will take you directly to Fashion Square Mall and back with the last return leaving the mall at 5:15 pm. Don't touch items in the honor bar or you will be charged. I didn't find this a big deal, just stay away from it. The store \"Fuel\" in the lobby has some basic items, but you can walk across the street to CVS pharmacy for better selection and less money. I was never hassled about bringing food or beverages into the hotel. I just received an e-mail survey from the Hard Rock.

The pools were closed (good thing we payed the \"resort fee\" to use them) but they looked great. Lots of great authentic rock memorabilia and music all around. The walls were thin so the hotel was quite noisy throughout the night. We could clearly hear people talking next door. One of the families in our group had to switch rooms because the noise from one of the night clubs was so loud. some things should be a given in a hotel, like some sort of noise control. They did not have to pay for that nights stay so I give the hotel credit for at least trying to make it right. Rooms did not include a mini fridge or a coffee maker which would have been nice and the bathrooms need to be updated. There were snacks, drinks and \"other\" toys available on the room dresser. Problem is if you even move one of them, they charge your room. That's ridiculous. Forget about the fact that kids might do it, my wife accidentally bumped it twice and we were charged twice. We called the front desk and they removed the charges. Just make sure you check to see if there are any charges before you check out. It's a few blocks off the strip (not walking distance) so be aware of that. The gaming area was ok and did not appear to be overcrowded. I didn't get a chance to try them but EVERYBODY had boxes from Pink Taco and said the food there was great. It's not the best place in Vegas to stay with kids. (the only reason we stayed here with kids is because it looked like one of the nicest hotels available with a discount for our sports event). If you're in Vegas just to party, and you drink enough, you may not mind the problems with Hard Rock. But if you're in town for business, sports tournaments, conferences, or for any other reason that might need a guaranteed good night's sleep, I would recommend staying some place else. I'm sure this Hotel is great for over-aged rock groupies, but if you're in Vegas for any other reason, including just to enjoy the strip, the are much better places to stay that are even less expensive. Overall I think this hotel is living off its name and pool parties more so than anything else... we won't stay here again. Suggestion for Hard Rock Hotel Staff: I understand that half the customers in this place may be drunk rockers who won't remember the tattoo they got in your parlor, let alone being treated poorly, but for those sober customers attending for other reasons, you should make a better attempt to satisfy them.

For a convention, this space is better, more intimate than the cavernous Sands though it offers way less choice of restaurants and bars than the Venetian does. There's only so many times you can eat at Pink Taco. Staying in the HRH Tower was the best move, just be sure to have the cab drop you at the HRH entrance or you'll find yourself dragging your luggage all through the casino to the private check-in counter in the HRH. Though the room was very nice, the service wasn't truly up to par for a suite. For a non-smoking room, it did smell of smoke. And the light switches were just odd. Apparently there are two kill switches that shut all the lights. I ended up in the bathroom in the dark more times than I would have liked. Still, the beds were EXTREMELY comfortable and the room was clean and tidy. The private check in was fast and there was a quiet lounge area outside the elevators. Little things like not getting new toiletries, there was only one bar of soap in our room for 5 days and we got 3 more the day before we were checking out, were annoying, but as I travel with my own supplies, not a deal breaker. We had to wait a day to get a humidifier delivered, which at the Venetian we got minutes after our request. The food at the Hard Rock ranged from fab to awful. Fab is 35 Steak and Martinis. Tuesday is $5 martini night, sponsored by Skyy. Great drinks, amazing steaks. Pink Taco is good. The Mr. Lucky's 777 deal, steak, shrimp, salad, mashed potatoes, is only $7.77 but not worth more, with dull steak and flavorless shrimp. Johnny Smalls was awful. These things are not tapas. They are merely small, mainly dry, little bites served by a snooty waiter. The Reliquary Spa is the place to go for a great massage. The pool, hot tub and showers were splendid and the attendants were very helpful.

In the end they changed it to the orginal amount, but it's quite annoying going through such incomplete information and vague rules.

I had purchased a Groupon for a 2 night stay with a 3rd night free in their new all-suite tower (HRH Towers) staying in a \"King Luxury Suite\". We arrived and the main entrance walks right into the casino area and the reception. Turns out the HRH has it's OWN reception so we had to walk a bit further. The HRH tower lobby is very dark but posh lobby. We checked in easily, with a very pleasant woman helping us. We were on the 8th floor and were facing the pool, as well as strip. It was kind of neat to be able to see almost the entire strip from our hotel room! (The hotel is located about a mile off the strip) The room itself is very lovely. Very spacious, the decor was simple and modern. Has a living room area and a bedroom area (divided by a partition that houses a flat screen TV on BOTH sides so you can watch TV in both areas. Large floor to ceiling windows to really take in the view. The bathroom is also very very large! WIth two sinks, a large \"rain\" shower with a bench to sit down, and a VERY deep tub - one of the deepest I Have experienced (awesome). The best part was the bed!! It was SUPER DUPER comfy!! You just sink into it! It was hard to get out of it! The room also has an ipod dock as well as a built in juke box that has a ton of songs that it will pump into the room. Nice touch. SInce the tower is fairly new, everything was in good condition. I can't speak of the casino as my boyfriend and I don't gamble. We ate at the Pink Taco our first night. It was very good! I recommend you give it a go. We also tried Mr. Lucky for an early morning breakfast...the food is quite expensive for breakfast. We only grabbed cold food, so I can't attest to the warm meals served. But it was over-priced I thought. A note, across the street from the hotel is a little shopping centre with a 24 hours CVS (i.e. a pharmacy plus for the non-Americans) as well as restaurants. We ate a Johnny Rockets there the next night - very yummy burgers. There is a TON of rock memorabilia around the hotel (of course) so if you are into that, you will appreciate it. ANd of course, rock music is pumped throughout the hotel, including elevators. We experienced good service overall. But nothing is perfect. Here are some less than ideal things: The shuttle to the strip. When we asked the reception desk, they told us the shuttle ran every 10 minutes. So we wandered out to where we were supposed to catch it and asked the valet about it. HE said it only ran every hour (and we had just missed it). He said it only seats 7 and so you had to get out there quite early to be able to get a seat. Surely, they can do better than that!!! If they want to encourage people to stay at their hotel as oppose to right on the strip, they need to improve that service. My boyfriend and I are pretty young and fit and the weather wasn't too hot or cold so we just walked it. Took us 10-15 minutes, so no big deal. However, we have been to Vegas in the middle of summer when it is blazing hot and there is no WAY we would have walked it then. Apparently it costs over 11 dollars to take a cab to the strip, FYI. The other thing to be aware of...the bathroom wall and door is see-through glass. Now there is a curtain (on the OUTSIDE of the bathroom) that you can pull across for privacy. And there is no lock on the bathroom door..so when you are in the bathroom, you kind of have to trust the other person to not pull the curtain back or wander in. And, when the curtain is drawn all the way and you walk OUT of the bathroom, you get whacked in the face with the metal curtain rod (that you use to pull open and close the curtain). So, perhaps not the best design....Admittedly this is nitpicky, but I thought I would share for those who are very sensitive about their privacy...and getting wacked in the face multiple times. The room seemed quite clean. Overall, we had a nice stay.

I decided to take a chance on a great 2 night \"Mystery Suite\" deal and was happy to discover that the hotel was the new HRH Tower at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino! Not only was it a terrific value, the staff was professional, friendly and customer service driven. We had a King Suite at the HRH Tower.The room was phenomenal! The luxurious decor trendy and hip with a separate sitting room, 2 huge flat screen TV's, Stereo, I Pod dock and the room is equipped with a great selection of music to listen to. The bed was one of the most luxurious and comfortable hotel beds I have ever experienced, firm yet soft with luxury linens.The bathroom was huge with a sunken tub and large shower. I highly recommend the HRH, even though it's a few long blocks from the strip, it is a great place to stay in Vegas, especially if you are a rock in roll music fan.(And we are both die hard old school rockers!) The Vanity nightclub is a happening place on weekends. The restaurants are good and affordable when you take advantage of the specials. Try the Pink Taco happy hour (The house Margaritas are 2-4-1 and delicious and the happy hour appetizer menu is filling enough for dinner. We had the sampler plate are were not disappointed. The Lucky 7 is open 24-7 and has some unadvertised specials (thanks Yelp!) Try the $7.77 special (Steak, potatoesa and salad, a basic comfort meal at a good value) and the $6.99 breakfast special of steak and eggs. These specials are NOT on the menu so you have to ask for them! As far as being customer service driven, for example, I was surprised upon check in that we were being charged an extra $20 per night \"Resort Fee.\" which was not stated in the Bookit information. (Btw, that should be mentioned during the booking process and I have contacted bookit.com to disclose this information.) When we inquired about what the fee included, we were told that it includes internet access in the rooms, use of the fitness center, pools and a shuttle to the shopping mall. Gee, since when do you have to pay a extra \"fee\" for the right to use the pool and fitness center? \"Resort Fees\" are just another annoying industry trend to get more money out of guests. It wouldn't have bothered me if the pool and hot tubs were open but due to the winter weather, the pools and hot tubs were closed.The only indoor pool and hot tub would be in the spa, which charges $25.00 to use unless you book a spa treatment. I casually mentioned my disappointment to the front desk clerk and she cheerfully upgraded our room! Since we got such an amazing deal I can't complain but if I was paying full price, the \"resort fee\" would have rubbed me the wrong way.

The TV in the room was large, but set so that if you were listening to the music channels it could be pretty loud, but if you were watching TV, it was too soft to hear plus the remote only worked from the center of the room and neither bed were in the center so you had to reach way out to point at the center of the TV with the remote.

It is off the strip so you have to drive everywhere - not close enough to walk to any other casinos, etc. The bathrooms could use some updating and the entire room could use better lighting.

Overall, it was another great trip, however, I DO NOT recommend the rooms in the HRH Tower. I booked the HRH Tower this time, under the assumption that these were the best rooms in the hotel. This was a mistake. I looked at two rooms in the HRH Tower. Both smelled awful, had beat up furniture and looked like they had been partied in hard. The once white couches are now a soiled grey/beige. The carpet was stained, and the rooms not up to 4-star standards. With that said, I called the front desk, complained and was moved to a Deluxe Suite in the Casino Tower. The Casino Tower is the oldest and closest to main casino. However it was been renovated, and is still very nice. The suite was huge and has windows that open for an amazing strip, mountain and pool view. This is rare for Vegas these days - most hotels don't have windows/balconies. I've also stayed in the Paradise Tower before. The rooms are very nice, but a bit more of a walk to the main casino. So, in summary, if you can get a deal ($50 to $100 per night) the Casino Tower and Paradise Tower rooms are great. Avoid the HRH Tower, and don't pay more than $100 per night to stay here. Overall, I give the place 4-starts. Once the initial room issue was resolved, I was very happy with my stay.

So finally we move into a new room - excellent you'd think. At 1.30am after we'd just got to sleep there's heavy knocking on the door. After travelling for 30 hours, followed by an awful first night in this hotel, followed with spending most of our first day's holiday waiting to change rooms this is not what we wanted. On answering the door, it's 2 ladies from house keeping looking at me puzzled then apologising and backing away. Very angry, we eventually get back off to sleep. At 3.30am there's a hammering on the door with a male voice shouting ' security - open the door'. What the hell is going on??? I open the door ajar ( it has a security latch on it) and security is demanding to see photo ID. Seriously - at 3.30am in the morning. I refused and asked him what on earth he thought he was doing and told him to stop shouting as just maybe, other guests in the room opposite, were still asleep. When he explained that our room was supposed to be empty and we explained that we'd been moved into it because of a room change he apologised and couldn't explain how it had happened, but the strange thing is, he knew my first name. I tried to sleep again but ended up going down to reception ( no one answers the room phones) . Now the lad at the desk knew nothing, and said the manager on duty was 'unavailable' to me. After demanding he get her on the phone, turns out she's on the other desk due to staff shortages. I go to see her and she couldn't explain how it had happened and apparently she'd asked him to go to the room after housekeeping had reported they couldn't get in. Nothing makes sense here - why were they trying to get into a freshly cleaned room? Why does it take 2 hours for security to come bang on the door. How did he know my name when he was expecting the room to be empty?? Why didn't i believe the other reviews on this place?? Why oh why?? This place sucks big time. We were offered $50 to spend in the hotel food places for 'compensation'. So bearing in mind they make a profit on the food, that $50 probably costs the hotel about $18. So our room was $300 bucks for the night (new year period was pricey) and you offer us $50. Where's the effort?? At least a box of chocolates or even some flowers would have shown thought. The rooms are tired. Bedding is worn, quilts and mattress smell of smoke, bathrooms dirty, wardrobe falling apart, sinks don't drain, showers are a joke - use the shower and flood the bathroom, no facilities in the room ( no coffee, not even a shower cap!) Hair on the floor.Toenails !! Eew! Phone cover missing so you don't know which button is front desk etc. Dust everywhere. Lights not working in the room. Air con surprisingly good. Ipod dock doesn't work on new ipods. Cigarette burns in the furniture. Big chunks out the tables - repaired by colouring them in with black marker pens. What?? Internet reallllllllly slow. Shuttle service less than useless ( although the driver is really nice) Staff couldn't care less. Resort fee a con - $25 a day for what? The swimming pool area shuts down out of season. We stayed in december/january and it was beautiful sunshine. They pipe pool music in the outside pool area which makes you think that you can use the loungers, just not swim in the pool. Why else would they pump music here which is different to the hotel music. Wrong!! Security actually came and moved us and others on - we demanded to speak to management who eventually relented and let us lounge on the loungers as long as we didn't make a mess - are you serious ?? have you even seen the state of the place?? A mess?? They have one pool area that is available to use during out of season subject to weather. It was open the one day, closed the next ( no staff apparently) open the next but no loungers and the kids in the pool complaining the water was freezing. Lifeguard was really nice and good with people's kids but couldn't do anything about the pool temp except apologize. We had the unpleasant experience of dealing with the assistant hotel manager called Liz. If you wander why some hotels respond to comments on trip advisor and either apologize or explain how things had gone wrong or even thank people for positive comments and you wander why some don't? Well the answer is - this hotel couldn't give a monkey's about you. They just don't care. The hotels that respond to trip advisor at least show they care what there clients think. I'm pretty easy to please, have realistic expectations, know things go wrong and I accept this. This hotel works on the basis, there will be another punter tomorrow so who cares about the one today. Bad news guys, word spreads!! trip advisor works !! you'll find out soon enough. Apparently you were pretty good a few years ago - but not know. The casino tables are too dark to use properly so we'd go up to the strip. Tip - just get a cab to the rear entrance of Planet Hollywood and walk up through the Casino onto the strip. With a tip for the cab driver, it will be no more than $10 each way ( actual fare usually was $6.70-$7.10 )Planet Hollywood is much nicer, the Wynn is awesome, the Bellagio is looking a tiny bit tired inside but the staff are great. The Hard Rock - avoid!! Stay somewhere else.

Granted, things don't always go as smoothly as you'd like but the difference is made by how the problems are dealt with. We spent Christmas in New York and New Year in Vegas. The New York hotel had a water leak in our room above our heads and the dripping kept us awake all night. Suffice to say that at 4am the hotel was doing all it could to help find another room and indeed sorted the problem. They comp'ed the room for that night which one would expect and we were happy with that. The Hard Rock however are a different storey. Forget customer service, in fact, forget every expectation and you at least won't be disappointed. This place is great for the music - it's piped throughout the hotel and is the only good thing i have to say about it. Decoration is shabby, fittings worn, bed linen stinks of cigarette smoke in the non-smoking rooms - not good when you put your head on the pillow and can't escape the smell. Curtains with holes in, bed linen torn. There's no staff to answer the phone at night and i've read this from other reviewers and it's hard to believe, but when you book a room, even if you pay for it, you are only making a 'request'. BE WARNED!!!!!! if you are travelling with a friend and book 2 queen beds in a room you may end up with 1 king - even if you've paid for it - with absolutely no apologies except 'come back in the morning at 8am and if we can we'll move you' except, they don't, you have to move yourself so forget about going out, you have to wait around for the room to become free to move your stuff. They won't move you as it's a security risk!!!! What!!!!!!!!! Remember this hotel is off the strip so it's a cab ride every time you go up and down to the strip. They have a hourly shuttle which seats a small number of guests so don't expect to fit on it and it goes to the mall opposite the Wynn Hotel - not really ideal. REMEMBER THE RESORT FEE! The hotel will charge you an additional $20 per day! for use of the resort ( internet, swimming pool etc ) on top of the price you've paid, plus tax of course irrespective of use - internet is extremely slow and the pools ( which are stunning and in the summer must be a awesome place to be ) are shut in the down season irrespective of the weather. Don't expect to get a decent coffee after 10pm - the starbucks in the hotel shuts at 10pm and there's no facilities in the rooms. Trying to think of something nice to say - but can't. Didn't appreciate the toe nail clippings on the bathroom floor, the burnt face of the iron in the room, the smell when we opened the door, the couldn't careless attitude of the assistant manager Liz Hernadez. A bottle of cheap wine would have been at least a token.

It was beautiful! huge living room, wet bar, plush leather couch, double doors that opened to the view of the pool and, a state of the art Bose sounds system. The bedroom had a plush king size bed, double doors to over looking the pool and, LCD Tv.

Obviously, being December, the pools were not really open(although there was nothing to stop you taking a dip and in fact many did while we were there) there was just no lifeguard on duty and pool bars were closed. They still played music around the rehab pool( which our room overlooked) which started at 9 and stopped at 5:30. It didn't disturb us really and I think if you stay at the Hard Rock, you should expect music to be playing all the time.

They do offer a free shuttle bus to strip and a cab was always waiting outside to take you anywhere for under $10.

Also spent a lot of time here 3 years ago. Come back 2 years later and what a change. Talk about gone down hill !!! Arrived to check in at 10pm into our PRE-PAID ( in full !!) Paradise Tower room with King Size bed and Non Smoking Room. I'd asked for a quiet room away from the elevators. I confirmed this at check in and after checking a floor plan chart she said no probs. Took the 10 minute walk through the casino dragging the cases to the room only to find the room directly opposite the lifts ( and there's 6 of them so the entire floor's population walk's past your room and not all the guests are particularly quiet - well it is Vegas). Not only are we directly opposite the lift but no King bed just 2 doubles. No big deal you'd think, but the doubles are tiny doubles. Thought there had been a mistake so took the 10 min walk back to reception as no one answered the phone down to the front desk. Got there only to be told sorry, fully booked, King Beds go on a first come first serve basis ( WHAT !!! We'd booked it !! and paid for it !!!! in full !!!!!). She couldn't have cared less and said to go back in the morning an they'd try and move us for the rest of our stay ( 6 nights ). Well the night was horrendous !! Party in the room below, moving house above pretty much all night for some reason, argument in the next door room ( and ALL rooms have adjoining doors for families so noise is a problem ) Girl in the hall at 4am decides to start kicking her door in because her boyfriend had locked her out after a row - she slept in the hall!! And do you think i could raise the front desk to come and sort it !!!!! No !! APPARENTLY they don't have anyone manning the front desk phone at the moment because they don't have the staff. WHAT !!!!!!! Thought we'd put the ipod into the dock in the room to disguise the noise - but the docks aren't compatible with new ipods! Tried to lock passport in the safe - safe had a fault code. Pillows smelt of smoke ! Basin drains don't open properly. Spoke to a manager in the morning who basically did everything right - i didn't want an upgrade, just sleep. He suggested we have a top floor corner room to minimise risk of noisy neighbours and said it would be ready by midday. The girl on the desk had said we'd need to move our stuff over by 6pm. So at 5pm we left Wynns on a $15 taxi ride to move our stuff, needing to go back to Wynns for a show ( Le Reve which is absolutely fantastic). Stopped at front desk to collect the key to our new room which we were looking forward to only to be told that the people who were due to leave hadn't. The hotel has a policy that once a guest is in, they can stay as long as they like as long as they pay for the room - EVEN IF IT IS SOLD OUT AND THIS MEANS TURNING PEOPLE AWAY THAT HAVE BOOKED AND PAID FOR THEIR ROOM. I've never heard anything quite like this before! BE WARNED! So they gave us a room on the 9th. Despite g'tees, when we get back to our room to move our gear our room key won't work ( we suspected this may have been the case but was assured it would be fine). There's no phone in the lobbies so we go to our new room to call front desk - guess what - NO ANSWER !! Hike back to the front desk, a little upset and it goes on and on......... we turned down free accommodation to stay here because it was so enjoyable last time. Wish we hadn't. Bytheway, it's only been a couple of years but the bathrooms are feeling really tired already, decor is suffering - its a real shame because this place was the business. Oh, and the awesome club Wasted Space has gone now, to be replaced with sports betting - nice move!! All we can do is make sure we don't spend a penny in their casino in protest. Really disappointed. One member of staff has been great ( guy called Ryan but he's now away for 2 weeks ) - good luck if you have problems and remember its a fair way off the strip.

We booked a room at the HRH All-Suite Tower, which had a separate entrance and separate check-in from the rest of the hotel. The front desk staff were great - very professional. The room was nice too, except the bathroom layout was a little funky because it was separated from the bedroom by a huge wall of glass. So, if you wanted any privacy, you had to pull some curtains across the glass wall. That meant access to the bathroom door was blocked by the curtains. Weird, but not a disaster. When we were in a taxi on the way to a show, the driver warned us about the Hard Rock and told us it was known as a college-kid party hotel. The irony was that it was totally quiet at night and we all got great sleep. The biggest drawback for us was the proximity (or lack thereof) to the Strip. It's not walkable and taking taxis everywhere gets expensive. We ended up taking our truck out of the garage and driving at one point, but it was a pain to find parking when going from place to place. The hotel offers a shuttle that takes you to Fashion Show mall (right on the Strip), but we were told it left every hour, on the hour, until 5:00 p.m. We never used it because it didn't run very often and stopped running too early. It wasn't a bad stay, but it wasn't a great stay either. If you want to hang out at the hotel and the pool (which was really cool-looking) and don't mind being off the Strip, this would be a good place to choose.

I called again to let them no we still hadn't seen anyone & the girl very rudely said \"this is a big hotel & they have other rooms to see, they'll be up there soon okay?\" I was so taken aback we just decided to leave & hope things would get taken care of. The TV was but the shower wasn't. Pretty disappointing to leave with that impression when everything else was so great. Overall it was a great hotel & we would probably go back if there was another deal but they need to train all of their employees to be on the same level.

The decor in the rooms sets the perfect vibe for arriving in Vegas - modern, sleek, & trendy while also shockingly comfortable! The bed was by far the best hotel bed I have ever slept in! We liked the bedding and decor so much that we are now planning to redecorate our apartment to match the same vibe. We also got plenty of use out of the built-in wall-mounted ipod docking station that also had preloaded HRH favorite hits. The bathroom was equally well done with soaking tubs that are perfect for a rose petal bubble bath with plenty of champagne. As far as comfort goes, I really don't think you can exceed the HRH all-suite tower! The view, while not of the Strip, was also surprisingly cool thanks to the massive wall of windows in the suite. We took plenty of photos of the mountains and the clouds from the windows in our room. Customer service in the hotel is also phenomenal. We visited all of the major casinos while we were in Vegas, and the cocktail servers, bartenders, front desk staff, & bellmen were far friendly & more genuine at HRH. We stuck to the HRH all-suite tower side of the whole Hard Rock property & gaming areas because it just had more of a chill vibe than the main guest registration for the other accommodations. We also went to Vanity on Saturday night and had a great time dancing though drinks cost an arm and a leg (to be expected though). We ordered delicious coffee & mimosas to the room every morning while we were there, and room service was reasonably priced & prompt. Ultimately, if you are traveling to Las Vegas with a group of twenty-somethings & looking for a really cool, trendy, and unique place to stay, don't miss out on the HRH all-suite tower. You will love it. Even though it's a few blocks from the strip, it is 100 percent worth it. I am definitely going back for my bachelorette party next year and sending my fiance there for his bachelor party as well!

We arrived on a Friday evening and checked into our room. When we arrived at our room, we found that although we were in the tower that we reserved, we had the wrong room type and view. I attempted to contact the hotel manager with the room phone. After being disconnected twice, I had to unplug the phone to get it to re-boot. That, however, didn't work. Cell service was spotty in the room so in order to speak to the manager, I nearly had to flatten myself against our window. At this point, I was quite tired, upset, & frustrated. I unfortunately used an expletive and the manager told me that I needed to refrain from using such language. I apologized and began again. It was then that she explained to be that a room reservation is nothing more than a room request. That logically does not make sense. When you reserve a room online, it only shows you the types/views/towers that they have available, if it's not available you can't book it. At any rate, I was offered a DOWNgrade to be able to have a king bed but in a smaller, crappier room. I was told that they did have a room available to upgrade but that we would need to pay the difference. What in the world? You gave away my room and want ME to pay for the upgrade? Not a chance. I tried to explain that to the manager who told me it was against hotel policy to offer free upgrades. Apparently not - based on previous reviews, some people are offered upgrades without even requesting them. At any rate, I further explained that if this were the case that we would expect a full refund of our deposit; she agreed to do that but I had to stand in line for 20 minutes to sign paperwork. I also tried to explain that if we moved hotels, we surely wouldn't be back to spend our money in their casino, restaurants, or bars. It made no difference. I was so disappointed; this is the ONE hotel in Vegas that I had not stayed in that I really wanted to and I was really looking forward to it. After the way we were treated, we will never be back. FWIW, I didn't even bother looking at the bathroom but the room itself was pretty standard - really, nothing special at all. During all of this, I called the Venetian to see if they had a king suite available (what we had requested at HR); I was told they did and as I moved away from the window, I was disconnected; I called back but there was no record of my reservation yet so I had to start over. When I explained that this was the 2nd call, the gentleman offered to discount our second night's stay. We booked it over there and WOW; what a difference. Now THIS was a king suite. A huge marble bathroom with a glass shower, sunken tub, double sinks, separate vanity, separate toilet room, a sunken living room with a second flat screen TV, comfy sofa, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. We will be staying at the Venetian on our future trips to Vegas. On previous trips, I've stayed at the Bellagio, Caesar's, the Rio, & Excalibur; Venetian is far superior to any of those.

The laundry for some reason added a rush charge to our bill - we never asked for it to be rushed, and after some calling around, it was finally waived. The rooms aren't cleaned very well - the sinks weren't wiped down (obvious when you have glossy black sinks), our ice bucket wasn't emptied and we weren't given a new plastic bag (self-serve ice machine next door), our drinking glasses weren't cleaned nor did we get new ones.

PROS: Nice, clean hotel. It was never too busy -stayed at the MGM last year and it was sooo busy and so large that it took forever to get anywhere. Hard Rock was a good size. Pools were awesome! Definitely geared towards the younger crowd.. some days you have to be 18+ to get in so bring your ID's if you want to drink alcohol. No outside food/beverage allowed in the pool area. The cabanas and chairs are usually all booked up/taken, but we didn't mind just sitting on the edge of the pool. Mr Lucky's 24-7 Restaurant was very good, however, at 3am it can take over an hour to get food.. lines were huge. Went to the club in the hotel (Vanity) and it was so much fun. Way smaller than most of the clubs in Vegas but still great. Booths, tables, bottle service, dance floor, everything you need. Didn't gamble much, casino is pretty small but that's not why we went there. Rooms were gorgeous! We were in the Paradise Tower. Two sinks in the bathroom, and a seperaet shower/toilet area. I had requested a higher floor via email, and we were on the top floor with the penthouses! One of the only standard rooms on that floor. CONS: Not on the strip. Gets kind of annoying to take a cab onto the strip everyday, and it can really add up. We walked one day, took 20 minutes, way too long in my opinion! There is a \"shuttle\" (holds 7 people) that takes you to Fashion Show Mall, but it only runs till 4pm and if it's full then you're out of luck. Don't touch anything in/near the fridge, because there are sensors and if something is removed for 30+ seconds then you can be charged.

This basically set the tone for the whole stay, terrible customer service, they charge for everything.. even asking for glasses (there were none at all in the room) they charge $4/glass to be brought up.. i stay in hotels at least 30 times a year and having a glass to put your tooth brush in is pretty standard? just beware that customer service is not great and class this as a hotel without a pool as it's sole use is an outside night club (at weekends at least).. even to the point that if you want to sit in a sun bed that is in the sun on a sunday, you are charged $50 (on top of the $20 resort fee you pay to stay there/day) minimum spend on beverages, or your only other choice is to sit in sun beds that are, i presume purposefully are located in the shade.

The bed was THE most comfortable bed I'd slept in in recent memory and I stay at a lot of 5 star hotels. There was excellent lighting, dual zone climate control, a beautiful wet bar. Nice bath products and the dental kit that the hotel provided upon request was very nice and promptly delivered. The hotel does not seem particularly busy so checkin was a breeze, unlike the long lines I've experienced at other casino hotels. The complex retains its small casino charm even after the expansion. They've kept all the good things: Nobu, Mr. Lucky's, the Pink Taco, and the Starbucks (great place for a cheap breakfast).

Yes, they start playing music at the pool around 9:00 a.m. but with the windows closed it wasn't that loud. Being older we were in bed by 11:00 and the music had stopped playing at this point.

We ate at the Pink Taco and Mr. Lucky's and the food at both places was wonderful. Yes, the hotel is off the strip but anyone who books this hotel HAS to know this...I mean, really?

One day we took a cab to the Venetian and it was so crowded and overwhelming in the casino, we couldn't wait to get back to the Hard Rock.

There is a daily $20/day charge for internet, fitness center/spa and pool area which wasn't a problem for us because we used all of these services every day.

I'm always surprised when people have a bad experience and feel it's because they don't know what type of hotel they're staying in. If you want a calm, relaxing quiet hotel to stay in, go to the Bellagio, The Hotel or Ceasar's or one of the really upscale resorts on the strip. HRH is exactly what the name implies-a rock n roll hotel. This means the customers will be young, edgy, obnoxious, loud, tatted up, drinkers, gamblers, scant clothing and flamboyant-rock and roll life stylers! If you can hang with that, than this is a fun place to stay. If not, don't complain about the noise level late at night or the drunk people in the taxi line. (You'll find that anywhere in Vegas, btw, not just at HRH.) Also, when you book your hotel( any), always ask if there are special events going on when you're going to be staying there. This past weekend was the Dew Tour-if you were there when skateboarders, BMX, and moto riders were around and were offended, it's your own fault. 50 and the Dropkick Murphys played at the Joint-what does that tell you about the crowd? I've learned that even though I like the atmosphere and all that goes with it, I want good sleep too, so I always carry earplugs. I couldn't hear anything when I slept and I was next to a suite that was non stop partying. This isn't a romantic getaway place unless this is your lifestyle. This is a hard core RnR hotel and has the people to match. It also is NOT on the strip, something any info about Vegas will tell you. If you want to be on the strip, stay at any of the 60 or so hotels there. It's a cab ride away or a long walk. This isn't news to anyone.

The restaurants were also great, my favorite was this diner-like place called Mr. Lucky's. The food was good and well priced, not to mention it was open 24hrs. The Pink Taco was also a fun spot for food and music. The Starbucks in the hotel was a perfect haven in the AM for my caffeine fix.

Casino is small and very basic Why am I getting carded to go to the pool? Why am I being charged $75 to go to the pool on Sunday? The bathrooms in HRH suites...have a glass door that takes up 90% of the wall, I'm sure it's awesome for sexy times with your significant other but if you are travelling with friends it seems kind of dumb. My suggestion? Regular door for rooms with two beds. Glass door for rooms with one bed.

The Hard Rock is 'fun'. It lives up to its name. \"Sex, drugs and Rock n' Roll\" If you are looking for a quiet, laid-back experience in Las Vegas then this is NOT the hotel for you. I've stayed in a suite in the newer Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego and it was FAR superior but I'm not sure if that's because it was a suite or not. That said, I used a promotional code for our standard room which was nice and I had no problems with that. The people at the front desk were pleasant, fast and helpful. The room was clean and pretty much looked like it does on the website photos. The bed was comfortable and there were FOUR feather pillows which I loved because I love lots of pillows. It was not overly loud where we were but we did hear the occasional partiers as they walked down the halls to their own rooms. A few doors down there was a party ala \"The Hangover\" going on in some sort of suite but we couldn't hear them from our room - we only heard them we when walked by their door. The bathroom was typical hotel faire. Not spectacular but not bad at all. The bathtub was comfy enough to soak in for a while. We were there on a Friday night. The center bar downstairs was too packed to get a seat but there were a few other bars in the casino to visit. Waitresses were NOT fast to bring you drinks at the slots. It was really busy and there were tons of people but casinos should probably account for that when staffing on a Friday or Saturday night. We ate at the cafe in the main part of the hotel at about midnight. It was packed and they told us it would be 25 minutes for our food but it was much faster than that. The waiter was super great and even showed us pictures of dishes on his phone before we ordered to help us decide. Food was inexpensive and good 'drunk food'. I usually take pictures where ever I go but I guess I was too caught up and in \"concert mode\" to bother. Or... that the room and hotel were nice enough but didn't \"WOW\" me. Side note: I don't like the new Joint. The last time I was at the Joint was in 2005 and it was smaller and much more intimate then. The new location and layout is much bigger which is probably great for the Hard Rock but it's much less fun, in my opinion.

My experience was the worst experience I have ever had on vacation. I expected a lot more from a Hard Rock Hotel. The room was very dull and smelled of old, musty cigarettes. The bathroom was dark and very small (like something you would find in a cheap motel). On our first morning there we decided to go to the pool that we had heard so much about. We went downstairs, were searched, and wristbanded before we were allowed outside in the pool area. It turns out we had accidentally entered the VIP pool section (there were no signs indicating this was the wrong entrance) when we tried to put our towels on a beach chair we were told that it would be a $250 MINIMUM to reserve these chair!!! Are you kidding me!!!! They informed us that anything you spent in food or drink at the pool would come off this fee, but there is no way I am going to drink $250 worth while I am at the pool for a couple hours!!!!! We were then told that we needed to go to the \"commoners\" pool on the other side of the pool area to find free chairs. As we were walking past the cabanas to find our way to this other pool we stopped a gentleman to ask for directions. When we told him what had happened and that we were trying to find our way to the other pool he replied \"We usually don't let GA's walk through here but since it is early I guess I can let you through\". Was he serious??? I couldn't believe he had just said that to us (and yes, he was serious). It was like 10:30 in the morning and there was no one in the cabana's yet anyways. That made me feel like I was cheap and worthless. These people were being rude and outcasting my husband and I because we were not going to pay $250 to have a pool chair to loung in?!?!?!?!? HRH is also know for their \"rehab\" pool party on Sundays. This is a bunch of rowdy people (mainly college students) that get drunk at the pool all day. I am 26, so I'm not too far from the average at at the party, but even this was too much for me! While my husband and I were in the taxi line to go to a show and a nice dinner for our last night in town, we had to wait in line with all of the drunk, rowdy kids. I got bumped into more than once by drunk girls that could not stand up straight. This, ontop of the yelling and cussing was extremely frustrating and not how I wanted to spend an elegant date night with my husband. Finally, the worst part... Our last morning there, my husband decided to use the TV check out from our room to save us the time of waiting in line downstairs. We still had a little packing to do after he checked out so we were going to be about another 45 minutes to an hour. Before we were finished, a girl from housekeeping knocks on the door and asks why we are in there because the room was marked as \"vacant\". We explained to her that we checked out on the TV and would be finished packing in a few minutes. 5 minutes later she knocks on the door again and starts getting a nasty attitude with us. THEN SHE CUSSES AT MY HUSBAND!!! She tells us how her manager is on her to get the \"f''ing\" room clean. Pretty much yelling at us as she says this!!! I could not believe that housekeeping just yelled and cussed at us because we were still packing our belongings. Under NO circumstances should this EVER happen. My husband called from the airport that afternoon to complain and all we got was, \"I'm sorry, let me credit you a day of resort fees\" which was a whopping $18!!!! Are you serious??? That's all the corrective action that you can afford to do after all that???? I don't think we ever saw that credit either.

I went to Vegas to see Duran Duran, and chose to stay at the Hard Rock since they were playing at The Joint. A friend had given me a promotional code, and we got a really good rate on our room. Problems started the minute we got to check-in. I had called the previous day to be sure of the \"grand total\" of our stay, as my friend and I would be splitting the cost of the room, and were budgeting accordingly. Of course, the total that was given to me on the phone and the total given to me upon arrival were completely different. The person at the front desk had no idea why there was a discrepancy, and kept having to consult with her co-workers to try and work it out. We were offered an upgrade to a pool view room, but said that we preferred the mountain view room because we didn't want to pay the additional $35 for the upgrade. When we got to our room, we realized that they gave us the pool view anyway, even though they took it off our bill. A nice treat, right? WRONG! Oh my GOD...this was like sleeping in the hallway of a night club. The music at the pool was SO LOUD I could hear every word of it in our bathroom, which was across the room! ALL DAY. The tables in our room, as well as the dresser and mini bar items all looked like they hadn't been cleaned in about a month. Dust on the canisters of candies, and smears and smudges on the tables and dresser. The lighting in the room was awful (dim), and the bulb in the floor lamp was burned out. The curtains on the window in our room were broken, and it made it hard to pull them closed all the way so the sun didn't come in in the morning. We had the same problem with the shower curtain. Which leads me to the bathroom....first of all, the lighting in the bathroom made it REALLY difficult to do make-up because it wasn't \"even\". Lighting was primarily at the sides of the mirror going about half way up, and then one (dim) light in the ceiling. We had 1 ROLL OF TOILET PAPER (whatever was left on the roll from whoever was there before us), an almost empty box of Kleenex, and 1 towel, 1 hand towel, and 1 washcloth for each of us. EVERY hotel I've EVER stayed in has always has 4 towels, regardless of the number of guests in our room (there were only 2 of us). My friend preferred to not have housekeeping services on Friday morning, so she called down to the desk late in the day to ask for towels, toilet paper, and Kleenex; she told them that housekeeping was welcome to just pop into the room if we were out. 3 HOURS LATER we STILL didn't have these items. RIDICULOUS! Once we got back to the room, my friend called the desk AGAIN and asked why we still didn't have our stuff. About 10 minutes later, someone from housekeeping came to our room...FINALLY! She told us that her key wasn't working in our door when she came up earlier in the evening, and that's why we didn't have our stuff. How about going the extra mile and asking a supervisor for some help getting into the room? No...that would have made too much sense and would have required some actual EFFORT on the part of housekeeping. Thursday night we ate at the Pink Taco because we saw on one of the monitors that they had a happy hour special...$2 tacos and some sort of deal on margs. So, when we went in, we told them we wanted to take advantage of the happy hour special. The \"hostess\" told my friend that we could only get that deal if we were actually sitting at the bar, but if the bar was full, to come back and she would seat us at a table and make sure we still got the happy hour pricing anyway. Well, the bar was full, so we went back to the hostess stand. She made us get in line behind about 10 other people to be seated, even though we were there before those 10 other people. Once we were seated and our waitress came, we told her that we wanted to have the happy hour deal. She said that was only for people who sat at the bar. We told her what the hostess said, and she insisted that they don't do that, and our hostess didn't know what she was talking about. We thought she was going to get a manager to talk with us about it. About 10 minutes later she came back asking us if we were ready to order. My roommate said, \"We thought you were having a manager come by...?\" The waitress said she already talked to a manager, we couldn't have the happy hour pricing and were we ready to order? Apparently, she also talked to the hostess, because she (the hostess) actually had the nerve to come back to our table and tell us we didn't know what we were talking about. Seriously. Her words were \"I don't know if you misheard me or what, but that is NOT what I said. You can't have the happy hour deal if you're sitting at a regular table. That is NOT what I said.\" And the she turned around and walked away. Call me crazy, but I call that rude, disrespectful, and BAD customer service. Maybe my friend DID misunderstand what she said, but there are many ways to handle a situation like this (professionally), and this was NOT it. We were all stunned that this snotty little b**ch would actually have the NERVE to come to a table of paying customers and be so unprofessional and rude. After that, the manager actually DID come to our table, and I told her about the treatment we received from the hostess. She could have cost that casino A LOT of money...what if we would have been high rollers?? She apologized, said she would talk with the hostess, and offered to buy us a round of drinks. That was fine. We took our drinks and had our dinner. The food was really good, but because of the attitude we received at the Pink Taco, we'll never eat there again. I can get that kind of \"service\" at McDonalds. Later that night/early Friday morning, we ate at Mr. Lucky's. I had only ever eaten there one other time and I thought it sucked. It still does. I had pot stickers and my friend had the burger basket deal. The pot stickers tasted like they had come from a frozen package and were heated up in the microwave. They were served with a sauce that tasted like straight vinegar. Nasty! Our waiter took about 20 minutes to bring our drinks to us (nothing alcoholic, just a Coke and a tea) once we ordered them. I asked for extra napkins, and he didn't bring those until AFTER I was done eating! Needless to say, this guy didn't get a tip. We went BACK to Mr. Lucky's Friday night after the show, and were told by the hostess that there was a 30 MINUTE WAIT to get food. Not to be seated, TO GET FOOD. I have NEVER been told this at a restaurant in my life. I had chicken strips and fries, and my friend had the steak and eggs deal. Luckily, the hostess must have been wrong, because we got our food after a reasonable wait. The chicken strips were fresh, hot, and good, and our waiter was fast and friendly. My roommates steak was delish. I was pleasantly surprised, but the food was WAY overpriced. The guy checking me in for the show (I was VIP) was rude to me...I could go on and on. Bottom line, if you want a dim,noisy room, no toilet paper, rude treatment, lousy food, and bad customer service, stay at the Hard Rock. Otherwise, I recommend Planet Hollywood.

We walked it 3 times (a good 20 minute walk), took the free shuttle once (it only holds 8 people so you gotta get there early if you want a spot), and cabbed the rest of the time.

The hotel and casino are both beautiful. Everything is up to date and looked awesome. The room was clean and very modern. House keeping would knock and instantly open the door to come in and keep. They surprised me twice and one of those times I was just coming out of the shower. The pool area is huge. They have two large pools and a swim up gambling area. The pool is surround with chairs, beds and cabanas. Here is the problem. I understand having to pay extra for the cabanas but even the lawn chairs require you to buy at least $100 worth of alcohol to sit there. We signed up for two chairs and were drinking beer. I did the math. If we bought 5 buckets of beer at $40 each then we would have to 30 beers to meet that minimum bar tab. The chairs have no supervision so I constantly had to keep kicking people off my chair telling them they were reserved. Went in the water and beers were getting stolen from my bucket. Security could be better. Hard Rock holds a pool party on Sundays called \"Rehab\". It is extremely popular. Tickets to get in are $50 for men and $25 for women. You get 2 free passes if you are staying at the hotel which is a nice perk. Here is the problem. The Hard Rock has so much disconnect between it's different departments. We tried to get our free passes and go in at 4:30 and waited in line only to be told that I could only have 1 pass instead of 2. I asked why since it was promised to me upon booking and I was told it was because I was in the wrong line. I asked where the correct line was and I was told it was somewhere else but they shut that line down at 4. ???? I was confused. They want me to stand in a line does not exist. When I voice my problem to the girl that is giving the wristbands she offered no concern or help. I asked for her manager and she first said that he was not here but later admitted that it was the guy behind her. We I tried to resolve the problem he at first ignored me and when I finally got to speak with him he told me that the pool doesn't have the same system in place as the hotel and I would have to go to front desk and try to resolve the problem. The front desk is at least a 10 minute walk from the line at the pool. Lots of hastle and nobody seems to want to help fix the issues. The rehab party was great and very wild. More security issues as people were stealing our beers and jumping all over the bed we reserved. Drinks are expensive but the party is worth it. The free shuttle is a joke. It isn't an actually shuttle but rather a guy driving a purple Escalade that seats only 8. Never could get a seat on the shuttle. The worst part of the hotel is it stinks like cigarettes everywhere. The halls are filled with smoke. The cocktail waitresses and dealers were very nice. To sum it up the hotel and casino are great. The pool is nice and worth seeing. The security sucks and you are treated like cattle. The front desk and especially the pool staff have no desire to help you. I would go again but will try to stay away from the staff.

Then the next morning we tried to relax by the pool and lay out only to be told by some rude employee that each chair came with a 100 dollar minimum because paying to stay there just isnt enough. We didnt mind the constant noise or random half clothed people in the hallway...because well its Vegas. I do mind however being treated like crap when I pay to stay some place.

Personally, I hate smoke, but it is allowed in Vegas casinos - so the croupiers shouldn't be unpleasant about it. That was the first time I ever had a mean dealer in Vegas - usually they want tips and are very nice! Also, there was supposed to be entertainment on the casino floor - dancers - like at Planet Hollywood. This is sometimes a lot of fun - but it just didn't happen for some reason. Food: Nobu is a great sushi place that everyone with a padded meal budget should experience. Mr. Lucky is good for basics like breakfast. There's also a mexican place called Pink Taco that looked nice, but I didn't eat there.

They did say however they could rent you a mini fridge for $20 a day. We opted to keep ice in our small bar sink, worked good enough.

The hotels on the strip seem busier because they have all kinds of people walking through the casinos etc even if they aren't staying at that particular hotel. Being situated off the strip the Hardrock doesn't seem to have that many outsiders milling around except for the nightclub Vanity and Rahab Pool Party on Sundays. If you want a hotel that is going to be constantly busy try one on the strip... but then you have to deal w families and kids all the time etc. It was a $9 cab ride to the strip, ($20-25 roundtrip w tip) which we did once or twice a day. It is a walkable distance from the strip but it was very hot out and we were lazy.! Also Hardrock does have the $20 Resort fee per day to cover wireless etc. I believe some hotels on the strip do not charge this. So make sure to factor these costs in when making your hotel decision.

A nice feature of the older Casino Tower (remodeled in 2010) is that you can open the large sliding windows - not so safe if you have little kids though! It's not really a hotel for kids though. Bathrooms pretty standard and no separate shower, so nothing special there. Actually the sink was VERY slow to drain and the lighting pretty dim for shaving. So, \"null points\" on the bathroom. Pools are really nice, lots of palm trees and sandy beaches with loungers half in the \"surf\". Bars right there. I've read that it's insanely busy and boisterous at the weekends but on a Wednesday it was really mellow. All the staff I encountered were really nice.

I've only stayed in the Paradise Tower, high floor, nice and quiet other than the occasional plane flying by (which is an inconvenient noise in most Vegas hotels). I wouldn't bother with the plain ol' Casino Tower based on other reviews. In Vegas, you want the newest options available, because visitors wear this city out til the wheels fall off. Pros: Great beds, most comfortable I can remember in any hotel. Clean rooms and nice decor. Laid back, casual casino atmosphere and friendly casino staff. The Australian dealer at the roulette table was classy and friendly. I won $350 in 3 spins by the way, and understand that you can actually observe certain things if you pay enough attention, which actually gives you a real chance of winning. Note: For people who complain about negative results at the casino games, look within your own betting decisions for the reason why you didn't win. It's no fault of the casino that you fall into the 95% or more of gamblers who give the casinos their profits. Cons: Didn't eat a single good meal at any of the restaurants, although I didn't try the fancier one.

I asked him which pool we should use. He jabbed a finger in the direction of my mild-mannered teenage son and said \"That's the only pool he'll be allowed in\". It was as though my son was a member of the untouchable class rather than a customer. The pool itself is ok. Has a sandy beach on one side. Not terribly big. Loud music which I expected. Not enough sunbeds. A lot of adults doing adult things which is fine but it's a shame they don't go to the adults only pools for that. My son was so uncomfortable we had to leave. So I'm stuck here for another two days with no pool we can use and away from the strip. It's put a downer on the end of a fantastic holiday. As for the hotel - in the HRH all suites. Very spacious and nicely decorated, fantastically well-equipped. The touchscreen music thing on the wall is excellent. When we got here yesterday it really wasn't clean - and I'm not particularly fussy - but to be fair we checked in a bit early and it does look a lot better today.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cPerfect.\u201d", "Author": "kisstanza", "ReviewID": "UR116671698", "Content": "My first time in Vegas with my boyfriend.

Local maps are quite deceiving as they make it appear as though the hotel is one or two blocks off the strip. In actual terms, it is a few kilometres away - in the middle of nowhere. Having said that - the hotel itself is quite impressive. Very modern, with all the mod cons - we were staying in the tower - so I do not know how the lower level hotel rates. The cost of this hotel is so very cheap (one assumes based on the distance from the strip) so we opted for two rooms. My friend was disappointed to find out that they were on a low level - whilst I was up near the top. This meant that our rooms - which were identical (and credit to the hotel: very fancy schmancy) had two different views. My friend's of a building across the way, mine of the International Airport. Perhaps someone who travels too much - I quite enjoy the view of planes coming and going, with the mountains in the distance, so I was pleased. The casino is absolutely tiny - so we did not use it at all. We used the hotel as a base and taxied to the strip and other sights. The complimentary valet parking was a bonus too. The biggest problem (IMHO) of this hotel was the clientele. Perhaps due to price, or perhaps due to the name, it was a very (and I do mean very) young crowd - I would have carded everyone of them. People walked about the hotel and casino (including late evening) in swim shorts, and thongs (read flip flops), which is not what one wants to see on vacation (at least when not at the beach) in the middle of winter. When I drove in, a famous musician (stuffed if I know who they were) was also staying so that caused a bit of a stir and some check in delays - so security was somewhat increased - though that didn't bother me at all. Basically the issue here is the tyranny of distance. I could honestly say that if this hotel was on the strip amidst the other big names - I would have no problem staying there at all. Big plus was leaving Vegas to drive back to LA, the trip was made much easier not having to traverse the entirety of the Las Vegas Boulevarde.

Also i did not get any help with taking my bags to the room. (Only complaints i have about HRH) When i finally got to the room it was very big, modern and clean. I had an amazing view of the pool area and you can see other hotels on the strip. Music starts being played at 9am in the morning so if you have a room facing the pool you will be woken up at 9am also you can hear the pool cleaners i didn\u2019t hear them every day but that woke me up at 7am when i did hear them. The light shades are symbols around the floors of the hotel, which do get hit and it is funny when you do it but not so funny when other people hit them (that was over the weekend) Music is also played into the night but it is Vegas wouldn\u2019t expect any think less. The hotel is set back off the strip, while the sun is out it is too hot to walk from the hotel to the strip but once the sun starts to set it will take you about 15mins but depending on were on the strip you want to go you might need to take a taxi. (Taxi was $11 from the airport to HRH). I used the shuttle bus once it was good but i wish it went up and down the strip not just to the fashion show mall. I ordered room service while i stayed here it was really good, service was quick and the way the food was set out was lovely, it comes on a table which opens out. In the hotel there is a Starbucks. I ate at the lucky strike (i think it was called that) chicken salad was not nice but the pizzas are amazing also ate at the hard rock cafe it is outside but on the grounds of the hotel. Service in there was amazing as was the food. There is a lot to do around the hotel from looking at the rock memorabilia, gambling and going to the pool. The concierge called Estaban was brilliant; he was so helpful and got me and my friend a cheap deal on a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon and on show tickets.

Tips: if you can, check in on any day other than Friday - Sunday night. I know that's impossible for some. We checked in on Thursday and had keys in under 15 mins. The rockstar card gets you discounts and it's free to sign up. The Beds and the blackout curtains were JUST what the doctor ordered for a Vegas Weekend. The rooms were pretty clean. The Mountain View room was nice and quiet (Pool side, you can hear the parties and Rehab). The pool parties were great but since it's open to non-hotel guest, you shouldn't bring anything down that you can't stand to lose. In fact, I appreciate the security was as thorough as they were. The restrictions to get into the pool area are a bit extreme (no oversized bags, no mirrors or glass, no pills - I saw some girl have to throw away her allergy and birth control because she had it in her bag) but once you see the type of party you're walking into, you understand why. Cons: Price: everything from drinks to shop items are dumb expensive. be prepared to spend here. The shuttle: I made a joke while waiting at the \"shuttle line\" that it's probably going to be some tricked out Escalade. Well I was only off by the Tricked Out part. It was an Escalade that they crammed AS MANY people in though it was only really designed for about 7 people. It was the first and LAST time we used the shuttle during our stay. Housekeeping: They came to clean out room ONCE during our stay (thur-sun). And it was a pain to get clean towels. Hotel Size: It felt like a maze. A big, unnecessarily long maze. Hotel staff: for the most part they were nice. My biggest complaint is that no one seems to communicate with each other and JUST because someone has a staff shirt on doesn't mean they have a clue what's going on. Overall, I had a great time.

The front desk was quick to move me to another room, but didn't offer me anything for the incovenience of having to put my plans on hold and change rooms (i.e. meal voucher, etc). The new room was just like the other one, with the beds being decent as well a nice flat screen tv and Bose alarm clock. Only problem was the next morning I was woken up by construction promptly at 7:30am after a late night in Vegas. They were updating one of their restaurants and the drilling vibrated the whole room. I guess the only consolation was knowing that the entire wing of the hotel was going through the same thing, since I could hear it as I walked the entire lenght of the hotel. Spent 2 fun days at the pool. Great atmosphere and music with a cool layout. Some swimup tables if pool blackjack is your thing, and a water slide. Not the best atmosphere for kids, since it can easily turn into a dance party with lots of alcohol being served. The casino is so-so. The new extension keeps the crowds low, but that it part of the draw, in my opinion, especially on a Friday and Saturday night. Instead of a lively atmosphere it is more low key with the additional tables. On the flip side, you should never have a problem finding an open spot at your favorite game. If you have the option, go with Pink Taco over Mr. Lucky's...better food at about the same price. Really enjoyed the complimentary chips and 3 kinds of salsa.

As a result I have seen the worst of the worst and the best of the best and can honestly say if you are going to Vegas for the true definition of Vegas; adult playground, I would absolutely recommend the Hard Rock Hotel. Though I have no control of where my company books our hotel reservations I love to read reviews and do some research on the hotels I plan to stay in and have to admit I was a bit skeptical after reading some of these reviews. Since my job consists of planning events, especially within the nightlife scene I have been able to compare and feel that many people that stayed at the Hard Rock and didn\u2019t have an awesome time there really can\u2019t handle Vegas and should have opted for a cruise. The Hard Rock is about a 5 minute cab ride from the strip which in my opinion makes it safer to not blow your money all in one night; as opposed to sporadically throughout your stay. The pool party at Rehab was one of the best I have been too. Great music and surrounded by people that just want to have a good time. Vanity also seems to be high up on my list of go tos. Not to small but not to overbearing either. I have been there a few times and love the fact that I actually have room to walk around. I must admit that I am a food snob and really judge my stays by the restaurants that are available. I am from LA and have an addiction to sushi and tacos of course and felt right at home when I was able to eat at my favorite LA taco place right in my hotel\u2026Pink Taco!! You can never go wrong by ordering fine Japanese cuisine at Nobu as well. Lastly, I need my relaxation time as much as my party time which is why I can speak extremely highly of the Hard Rock\u2019s Fitness Center. Very low key and comfortable with all the workout equipment necessary for a great work out to start the day off right! I don\u2019t have anything good or bad to say about the Hard Rock staff which in my opinion is a great opinion because I was able to enjoy my stay in result of my own expectations and not because of a staff member swaying my opinions.

Check in was amazing and Diana and Nikki were awesome. Jenny in Housekeeping was always available, and greeted us daily with big smiles. Brittany,our server at the pool was the best ever. She looked after us the entire day, and made sure we were comfortable and relaxed in our cabana. The service couldn't have been better. The casino was fun, and the bar staff and even the casino staff made sure we were there to enjoy ourselves. There is something for everyone at this hotel. We saw a few shows on the strip, and the location is great to taxi it up to the entertainment venues. Management looks after its guests, and it shows.

We had read plenty of less-than-positive reviews here and were worried that we may have chosen the wrong place. After our stay, I am convinced that people who have a good time don't usually write reviews, whereas people who don't have a good time and have an ax to grind, will... So here is my review... We arrived at the HRH towers (about a $7.00 cab ride w/o tip from the Airport) at about 12:00 in the afternoon. The place was beautiful and the rock-n-roll memorabilia was very cool. The look and feel of the HRH lobby was a little like a \"hip\" funeral parlor with dark furnishings and monuments to musicians and performers who are playing in that venue beyond this life nowadays. The smell of lilies was prevalent and I found out later on that this pleasant smell was the result of the industrial air-cleaners they use for the facility. When checking in , the line was short and the clerk pleasant. He was ready to check us in early even though check in wasn't supposed to be available for several hours. When asked if we would have a \"high-floor\", the clerk responded that the only rooms ready for check in were on the third floor. We declined and asked for a higher floor, away from the elevator and ice machines. He informed us that he would try his best and that if we would provide our cell phone numbers we could explore or have lunch and he would have someone call us when a room that suited our wishes was ready. I joked with him that I had read reviews from folks where this did not happen. He said that although, it propbably wouldn't be him calling, someone would call. About 1/2 hour later, as my wife and I enjoyed a wonderful lunch at the adjacent Hard Rock Cafe, he called to tell us the room was ready. The suite was exactly what we had specified. It was on the 11th floor, overlooking the pool, with a wonderful view of downtown, and a partial view of the strip, about 1/2 mile away. It was away from the elevator and ice machines and was immaculate. There were floor to ceiling windows overlooking the infamous rehab pool. A convenient \"shelf\" ran about midway on the windows and provided a nice place to stand and rest a drink as the surroundings were taken in. I was prepared for the master light switches in the bathroom and at the door which controlled whole groups of lights within the room. If you stay here, don't miss these switches and think your lights are broken, they aren't. As for the decor and furnishings of the room, they were outstanding. We were greeted by some incredible framed photos of popular performers and musicians as well as Las Vegas area scenes. (A HUGE photo of ZZ Top front man Billy Gibbons next to his 1950's era Cadillac outside of a Texas duster radio station was AWESOME) A wet bar with a sink and some storage space was available along with the mini-bar fridge and tray. BEWARE: This is one of those setups that will bill instantly if you if you pick an item up off the tray, or take an item from the minibar. And don't think you can use the minibar as a makeshift fridge, they are quite clear that you will be billed for cleaning if you do this. This was a bit aggravating as I am a diabetic and need refrigeration to keep my meds cool. Room fridges were available for a daily fee of $20. -A little unreasonable in my opinion for someplace so nice to (A) not have a fridge in the room available for guests, and (B) charge such a high rate for the use of one. The 5-day stay would have cost $100 for this. We checked online and the local Wal-Mart had mini-fridges available for about $80. Instead of going this route, we opted to buy a cheap $30 cooler from the 24-hour CVS located across the street from the Hotel. As for entertainment in the room. there were (2)-42-inch LCD televisions, one on each side of the room divider that separated the bed area from the living room area. One of the TV's had a sound bar underneath that was connected to an iPod dock built into the wall of the suite with a touch screen that was apparently supposed to control the iPod, but did not seem to work fully. Now this is not to say the docking station didn't work, it did and the sound was great. It was the touch screen that was less than fully functional. The iPod could still be controlled and operated using its onboard screen. The one thing I would say is that it would have been nice to have an input jack for something other than an iPod branded player or device. There was also a DVD player in the living area. Plenty of storage space for clothing and other items if you want to unpack. (No signs of any bugs, bed or otherwise) The bed itself was VERY comfortable. My wife and I are particular about this sort of thing and were not disappointed. It would have been great to have pillows that were not goose down though. My wife is allergic and this was a little problematic. The bathroom was enormous with a walk-in shower and a large 2-person tub. One wall of the bathroom was tinted glass with a curtain that could be pulled for additional privacy. There were his and hers vanities with sinks for each person. One complaint was that the light in the water closet took a bit of time to heat up and provide light. Trips to the head could be a little dim at times. Also, be careful if you are testing the water temperature with your hand as the water head on the tub will immediately redirect all of the water into a channel around the tub and onto the bathroom floor if you are not. As for the casino and restaurants, we only tried Lucky\u2019s 24/7 and The Pink Taco. Luckys 24/7 was reasonably priced, had great diner-style fare and quick friendly service. I would definitely choose this as a daily breakfast or late-night stop for food. The Pink Tack on the other hand was the low-point of this review of the Hotel. My wife and I showed up for lunch around 1:30 in the afternoon and were greeted by loud bumping rap music. I don\u2019t have a problem with this, but it was a little odd in a restaurant that is decorated in the style of and serves fare that is traditional at a Mexican restaurant. Although there were many empty tables near the windows which overlooked the pool area, the hostess attempted to seat us in a crowded row of tables at the back of the establishment, under hot decorative lights, within inches of other patrons, and sharing a common bench that ran along the back wall. When we asked to be seated near the windows, we were informed that there were no tables available there and that we would have to wait about 10-minutes for one to be cleaned. I was surprised as there were plenty of clean, empty tables, although they appeared to be for about 4-6 people. My suspicion is they wanted to save those tables for larger parties and preferred to keep couples in the back under the hot lights where a single waitress could hit many tables without much legwork. After about 15 minutes of waiting, our hostess seated us at a small table near the windows next to a building column that was literally the width of our table and THAT COMPLETELY BLOCKED our view of the patio and pool area. (THANKS! \u2013NOT!!!!) The food itself was not great and the service from our waitress, was pitiful. She took our order and checked back once BEFORE we were served by someone else and then, we didn\u2019t see her again until we flagged one of the other waitresses, and asked here to find our lady so we could get our check and leave. We never got refills for our drinks, even though there were about 9 wait persons that I saw standing around and conversing with each other most of the time. Please keep in mind there were only about 20-tables in the whole place. I usually tip at least 20%. She got 0%, nothing\u2026.Nada\u2026\u2026 This place evidently survives on the racy name and merchandise sales, because the food, ambiance, and service SUCKED. The casino was fun although I wish they had more $5.00 blackjack table to keep the pain level of losing down a bit. The Joint was great and we had fun at the shows as well. In spite of the bad experience at the Pink Taco, I would stay again and would definitely put in a good recommendation for the place. IF we go back to Vegas soon, HRH Suite towers will be high on our list.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNot the best hotel...\u201d", "Author": "Megnolia07", "ReviewID": "UR115654135", "Content": "I've stayed at a Hard Rock location in Florida before, so I figured this place would be just as good.

Booking the room for 2 is cheaper than for 4 even though we got no hassles having 4 in the room we paid for 2. The downside is they only give you 2 keys and keys get you free stuff like the Rehab party. Room: Poor, especially for the price. Big room with two queen beds. Supposedly was a \"pool view\" room but being on the second floor we had a view of a roof and just a bit of the pool. Nice modern decor but they don't clean very well...dusty on the desk, bathroom was clean but not spotless. There were no amenities (no soap/shampoo/etc.). We called for some but they never showed. Light bulb in the bathroom was burnt out. They did replace that while we were out. One day they didn't clean the room even by 5pm. We called for them to clean it which they did but left a bunch of cleaning supplies in the room. The room was always too warm. Even wit the AC fully cranked it was never cool. This is Vegas. Not a good show for such a hotel. Bed: Awesome. Very comfortable. Nice linens. Pool: Awesome. Great scene. There are two. The Rehab pool was mostly full of meatheads. To get in you had to get patted down and go through security. Even on a Saturday they charged for chair....completely ridiculous. The West Beach pool had free chairs and was a better scene in my opinion. Lots of bachelorette and bacherlor party groups having a good time without being obnoxious. Also some families with kids which may be why things didn't get too crazy. Service was Ok but not great. Drinks were expensive but you could get a bucket of six 16oz beers for $25 which isn't too bad and perfect for sitting out in the sun enjoying the \"view\". The pool itself was great temperature and nice sandy bottom but that led it to getting murky at times. The parts without sand seemed clean. Casino: Great. Small by Vegas standards but always plenty of room at the tables. Good younger crowd with few of the overweight, smoking tourists in motorized Rascals like on the strip. The music in the casino was great; good selection at a good volume. Seemed to be sufficient $5 blackjack tables even on a Saturday night. Restaurants: Ate at Pink Taco for dinner one night. Good food. Decent prices. Good service. Also ate at Mr. Lucky's for breakfast. A bit overpriced but good size portions. Service was hit or miss there. Vanity Night Club: Night Clubs are not my scene so take my review with a grain of salt. It was a bit difficult to get in. Even though there weren't too many people in the club they made us wait in line with the velvet ropes while tough guys in cheap suits and ear pieces hassled us. Then a nice lady let us pass. Then more hassles by more tough guys and velvet ropes. We had some passes and used the room key that got us all in for free. DJ was good. Music at a good volume. Lots of people having a good time. I don't know the cost of drinks because I was not buying. Wasn't too crowded although we left before midnight so maybe it picks up. Location: Far off the strip. Walkable, but it's a long way. About $10 by cab. Not much else around there. A few restaurants in strip malls, CVS across the street (you can get booze and cigs there), otherwise nothing much around. Overall, too expensive for what you get. There is a good feel to it in the casino and the pool. I suppose the club wasn't too bad if you're into that thing. But the expense for the room and the distance from anything else makes it not worth it. The room was pitiful...dirty, no amenities, fake \"pool view\", no temperature control.

Their rooms are consistently below the strip average while providing just as much as any strip hotel, many times even more. Both room towers are excellent, but it\u2019s recommended that you always pick for a pool view room. The first reason is obvious, so you can wake up and see all the reasons people come to Vegas, the amazing women. Second reason, if you don\u2019t pick a pool view, you can end up facing the airport and unless you like watching and hearing jets all day and night, it\u2019s not recommended. For me the pool at Hard Rock is still the best in Vegas, even surpassing all the new entries into the market. I guess old habits die hard because I have been to every pool this year, multiple times, and Hard Rock is still the best place to people watch. The rooms remain top notch. The rooms are all done in a very contemporary meets hard rock type of look. Whoever designed the look did well. The beds are as good as everyone claims they are; you will have trouble getting out of it in the morning. The bathroom and shower are very hip. Women love the bathroom and sink area for getting ready while the shower is one of the largest stand-up showers I have seen in Vegas. The showers with their large stone walls and glass wall makes you feel like you\u2019re in a spa. The only down side is the resort fee at $18 per night. You don\u2019t learn about that until you check in or out and is usually not shown correctly on travel agent sites. Even though I hate these stupid fees, HR has made it worthwhile, something many other hotels in Vegas seem to miss. For the $18 per night, you get access to the hotel gym and most impressive, wireless high-speed internet. I have yet to find another resort casino in Vegas that offers both for that price, usually its only one or the other or neither.

You go to the Palms if you want to party. You go to Circus Circus if you have kids. You go to Caesars Palace if you want to try and emulate The Hangover. You go to Hooters if you have no other choice. You go to the Hard Rock, for the sprawling pool and beach complex that stretches nearly the entire length of the property. Most of the hotel's rooms overlook one of the pool areas, so they know what the deal is. There's a lazy river, artificial beach, swim-up blackjack, and seemingly countless cabanas. Go during a weekday and tip the right person $20 and you can get wrangled into one of them, but there's plenty of places to sit. Drink service is great, too. The rest of the hotel is OK. There are three towers, with the Casino tower being the oldest. The HRH Suite tower is, as you might expect, a tower of suites. I stayed in the Paradise Tower, which is relatively new and felt like an above-average Vegas room. The only problem was that it's a pretty lengthy walk from the main entrance to the Paradise Tower -- about 5-7 minutes any time you want to go to your room. Beyond the pool, this really isn't a very big casino -- the main pit is one of the tiniest you'll see in Vegas, and even the secondary slots area by the HRH tower isn't all that big. The casino itself has just one cashier cage, totally not visible from the main pit, and they stick a dumb name on it (\"The Bank\", also the name of a Bellagio club) to make it even more obnoxious to deal with. Service wasn't all that great. Girl at registration began processing my checkin before looking at the clock and realizing that she \"had to leave\", sending me back into line. I came up to my room while housekeeping was cleaning it and the woman was happy to let me into the room to grab things without asking for any proof that I was actually the person who was staying in the room. Room service at 2 AM answered the phone by saying it was in excess of an hour wait and that I should probably just go to the (admittedly very good) coffee shop. The other problem here is that this hotel is not on the strip. It has some advantages as a result -- you're a block away from a big 24-hour CVS, and the cab to the airport is among the cheapest in the city -- but you've just about gotta take a cab if you want to go anywhere on the strip, and you're not going to want to take multiple cabs to and from this place a day. If you're looking for a place with a great pool, this (or Mandalay) is where you want to be.

We stayed in the Paradise tower on the side facing the strip. Our room was clean and I like the decorations. However, when I opened the window I saw we had a terrible view. We looked out onto the top and side of another building and and dirt lot. (see picture below). When laying in bed all that could be seen out the window was the side of another building. Later that night I noticed that there was water on the floor in the bathroom. At first I thought maybe someone had recently cleaned the shower and it was left over from that. But then the puddle kept getting bigger and bigger. The toilet was leaking pretty bad from the bottom. We had to meet friends for dinner so I tried to speak with staff at the front desk but there was a long line and we were in a hurry. The next morning my husband called the front desk to tell them about the toilet and ask if we could switch rooms to one with a better view. The person answering was rude and put the blame on us for not calling right away when we checked in. He explained that we were in a hurry and didn't notice that the wet floor was from the toilet. They said the rooms on the other side of the hotel were more expensive and that we'd have to pay to upgrade. 2 of the 4 rooms our group booked had great views of the pool and we all paid the same. We declined to switch but asked that someone fix our toilet. Soon after a man came to fix our toilet and we left for a little while to hang by the pool. I came back at 1 PM and there was a pile of dirty toilet water soaked towels on the floor with the old toilet gasket and numerous rubber gloves. I thought he was still working on it so I left. Meanwhile, my friend who had booked our room, went to the front desk to ask why we couldn\u2019t switch rooms. They told her we could switch to a room on the same side of the hotel higher in the tower. They said they needed to clean the new room and they would call my cell phone as soon as it was ready. I waited another couple hours and nobody called. I went back up to my room at 4 PM and the dirty towels were still on my floor along with all the garbage that was used to fix the toilet. I put the \u201cPlease tidy up\u201d sign on my door and left again. When I came back at 5:30 my room was cleaned up. I never did get a call from the desk telling me a new room was ready. I felt like everyone had a different story and nobody quite knew what was going on. In the end, I did get credited the resort fee for both days, so I was happy with that. The pool was also very nice.

We got in late Friday and relaxed in our room. It was quite and the beds are awesome and inviting. Saturday morning we went to the gym and found it accomodating. We were also told that the gym has a spa (complete with steam room in it) free to use but didn't take advantage of it because we had appts at Relinquary spa later that day. It is something we will keep in mind for next time. We went to the pool sat and found it had the perfect mix of a relaxing/fun atmosphere. Met some nice people. I will say this, we found the HR has a lot of different kinds of people and everyone is friendly! Never did we feel intimidated. That's an added bonus when traveling! Saturday afternoon we went to the Relinquary Spa. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The steam room was the best steam room I have been to, in my opinion. It is darker and has little light that shine up from the floor, creating a relaxing environment that makes you feel like yoou are drifting among stars. The steam was a perfect amount and perfect temp. The dry sauna and jaccuzi were smaller but still nice. The co-ed jaccuzi was gorgeous but could be warmer. Our services were not remarkeable though. We had the pear scrub/wrap and neither of us felt the scrubs were substantial. I think some of it had to do with the limitations of product the masseuses were allowed to use. As an individual with an MBA, I understand cutting costs, but for 130 for the service, we expected more. One valuable tip is that if you get a players card (its free) then you get 10% off your service. We went to Rehab on Sunday. It was awesome! If you are a guest and go in through the smaller beach pool, it is free. We we're there from about 1 to 6 pm and never had a dull minute. Beware, though, people do pee in that pool. I didn't think anyone would do that, but we found out yes they do! Might want to grab a place on the side of the pool instead of in it. Our whole stay never had a problem with noise and were able to relax in our rooms. Checking out was awesome too! We did not know that the front desk can check you in at the airport and print out boarding tickets! But the nice lady at the front desk walked us through it and I would highly recomend it. As 30 somethhing women we will definately go back because we found the rooms awesome, the staff nice, and had a great time.

But this was my first time since the reno, and new buildings aside, the vibe was decidedly different. - We arrived on Sunday (at 10am) and received our Rehab wrist bands that were included in our room rate. - We walked out to the pool, put our bag (that was a bit lighter since our gum and Altoids had been confiscated by security) on a lounge and were promptly told that there was a $150 F/B minimum for each lounge chair. This was my 3rd Rehab visit and I have NEVER had to pay for a lounge chair. So we perched at the side of the pool for 4 hours, and then discovered the next day that there were FREE lounges at the new pool. And this speaks to the complete LACK of commuincation at the pool. If someone expresses their disinterest in paying for a lounge, they should be told about the free lounges at the other pool. It's just common courtesy! - Rehab \"guests\"- A lot of fist-pumping....which was entertaining at first, but started to get old after the 2nd hour. Everyone seemed well-behaved, but they were starting to get very sloppy by the time we left at 2:00pm. - Up ALL NIGHT listening to the night club that our beautiful corner suite overlooked. So glad I paid extra for the nicest room! - Resort fee: this didn't really bother me, because I've paid fees in Florida and Hawaii. But don't promise a shuttle as part of the fee, when it only runs on the hour and once it fills up (only holds 8) you're out of luck. - Thankfully, our stay did improve after Sunday....but I was disappointed that the pool music was hip hop/dance/R&B all week.

There needs to be a specific pool for guests rather then letting in anyone that walks inn off the street. Getting to the strip was easy, maybe a ten buck taxi to the back of the MGM or we had no probs jumping in the shuttle though it could run a little more frequently. I know they don't want you to leave bt happy guests are going to spend more on gambling later on. Johnny smalls was great though should be opened all the time rather then just on the weekend. The pink taco was good value for money, food was really tasty and service was great. Gaming floor was nice bt found the service and variety of games better at the bigger casinos.

All I have to say to myself about that is: Why the hell did I wait so long to do so? From the moment I arrived to the Reservations counter to the time I checked out, I've never had such a smooth and comfortable stay. The desk clerk (who's name I've forgotten so I hope she forgives me) was very friendly and courteous. She gave me a corner room in the Paradise Tower on the 16th floor and was greeted with the best view I've ever had in Vegas. The left hand floor to ceiling window showed the 3 HRH pools while the right hand side window showed the LV Strip in all its glory. Another plus is that there were fewer drunken idiots there than I thought there would be! I saw people of all ages there, including this cute couple in their 60's hanging out at Center Bar Thursday night watching the NBA game. I've read previous posts about how comfortable the beds are here and have to agree 100% with them. It's not the best I've ever slept in but it ranks up in my top 5. While there I ate at Mr Lucky's, which is a personal fav of mine in Vegas. For players club members, the $4.99 steak & egg Graveyard special and the $7.77 Steak & Shrimp Gambler's special cannot be beat. (NOTE: They recently changed the hours for the Graveyard special from Midnight to Noon to Midnight to 8am). I also ate at Pink Taco which was pretty good but not spectacular. They have a pretty good happy hour special for 99 cents tacos and margaritas between 1-3pm and 9-11pm Monday through Thursday, I didn't get around to Johnny' Smalls for their AYCE Tapas but that is on my to do list for next time (NOTE: it's in the HRH Tower casino portion of the complex; I saw more than a few people walking down the corridor where the shops and some restaurants are looking for it). This brings me to the only \"complaint\" I have about this place. Anywhere you go inside a LV Casino, you see signs after signs directing you to restaurants, hotel towers, etc but none at the HRH. In the past, it was a pretty easy place to navigate since it was all in the round, so to speak but since the 2 expansions and renovations have doubled the size of it all, it would be a good idea to have better directions to give customers and guests on where to go (the property map they give you upon check in is good but really, how often is it looked at after you first get to your room and head out?).

The hotel is located off the strip but having stayed in vegas before we was aware of the location. If you are driving it is only a few minutes drive from the strip and valet or self parking is available at the hotel and is included in the resort fee ($18 a day plus tax). Check in was easy and there was no queue when we arrive which was around 3 pm on a friday. Our room was on the 10th floor and was immaculate. It was a nice size with a king size bed which was really comfy. There was a double wardrobe which contained a safe and iron/ironing board . There was a mini bar in the room but is charged on a weight basis so if you do not want to be charged for anything don't touch it. The bathroom was smaller that other hotel bathrooms we have had in Vegas in the past and looked a little more worn that the bedroom but again was clean. It was quieter in the room that I expected although we were woken up a few times in the night by shouting/singing/banging. We were not aware when booking this hotel that there was a resort fee of $18 a day plus tax so calculate this in if you are planning on staying here. The fee did include valet parking/wifi internet/pool/gym and a shuttle bus which ran to the strip but only ran until 6pm so no good if you wanted to visit at night. We have stayed at other hotels in Vegas on the strip before (Planet Hollywood and Luxor) and have never been charged a resort fee. Our visit to the hotel included a weekend . If you want a quiet relaxing stay do not stay at this hotel. There are 3 pools at the hotel, two which were very boisterous and one which was classed as a quiet pool. Being in our 30's we felt a little past rehab so opted to visit the quieter pool. We were at the pool early so were able to get a sunbed but if you got to the pool after 10.30 it was impossible to get a bed. People were sitting on the floor around the edge of the pool and up against walls. You had to be id before entering the pool area and also patted down. A little over the top to sit around a pool and a little intimidating. Security were also walking around the pool area all day and had a real attitude towards us but seemed to turn a blind eye to others drinking and dropping beer in the pool. It seemed if you were willing to pay you could act however you wanted. Drinks around the pool area were also very expensive. From what we understand if you wanted to go to rehab you had to pay to get in and also pay for a bed. Our last day at the hotel was a Monday and was a lot quieter. There was no id on the door to the pool etc. although as we sat around the pool the security came round and wanted to give us wrist band to prove we were old enough to drink but never even check our id to confirm this!!! We also explained to him that we had been at the hotel for four day and had not yet been given a wrist band before. When returning to our room one day with a box of 12 beers we were stopped at the lift by security to check we were staying at the hotel. After showing our room card the security guy asked us if we were aware of the alchol limit in the room of no more than 12 bottles of beer. Again the security seemed to have a real attitude and again turing a blind eye to how drunk everyone at the hotel was and how they were acting as long as it was purchased at the hotel. One day when walking to a restaurant just down from the hotel we saw two guys come from the hotel that were so drunk they stopped 3 lanes of traffic and was lying in the middle of the road!! If we visit Las Vegas again we will not be staying at the Hard Rock Hotel, the hotel seem to charge more that strip prices (accomodation, drinks, food etc) for a hotel that is not on the strip.

If you like the do the pool thing everyday and only go to the strip at night, just consider it an addition to the rate. The cabs are very convenient, and they are always lined up waiting for people. Also, this is so close to the airport it is only an 8 dollar cab ride, so don't waste your time and money on those shuttles. The walk to the strip is under a mile, so sometimes we just walked.

It was the Supercross weekend, and all the racers stayed there so that was cool seeing them all over the hotel. The gym was really good, and we shopped there a bit too. I really have a hard time comprehending all the bad reviews from some people. They obviously had a bad experience somewhere on their trip and try blaming it on the hotel. We had no bad issues. Well, the only complaint would be that the slots seemed a little tight, and the waitresses were non existent when it was busy. But that seems to be Vegas in general. Thats it, EVERYTHING else was AWESOME. Would stay here again FOR SURE. Maybe it is a few blocks from the strip, but we always rent a car and it was super easy to get to everything we wanted from the HR location.

This was my 3rd trip to Vegas in the last 9 months - twice for business and once for a family vacation. I actually liked the HRH more than I thought I would and I am in no way in my 20s. Got early check in on a Saturday with a room in the Paradise Tower. Room was clean and decorated in blacks and grays. Went down to the Rehab pool and have to say it is easier to get on a plane than to get into the pool. Security is very tight. The party was going on and the staff at the Beach club are great. But on Sunday, the Rehab pool is very, very wild. If you are in your 20s and want to party, this is the place. I relaxed at one of the other pools and their pools are nice but not as big or good as those found at Mandalay Bay. Also, they should call this place the Hard Rap Hotel on the weekends because that's all the music they play. During the week, the hotel was more to my liking. The rock n roll memorabilia is interesting, the hotel staff is very helpful, room service is prompt, maid service is excellent and the eating places are good and they actually play rock and roll music all the time throughout the hotel. But the main drawback of this place is the location -- it is simply too far away from The Strip. You have to cab it to The Strip which adds up but if that is not a problem, then the HRH should be considered. And this is not a family hotel where I would bring kids. Out of the 3 places that I have stayed at before - TheHotel and Mandalay Bay is great for families, The Venetian is a very adult oriented place if you are not in your 20s anymore but not that old.

I've been staying almost exclusively at the Hard Rock for a couple of years. I've liked the off-strip setting, lack of kids, & the lack of tourist crowds looking to take pictures of everything. My wife and I shot over for the weekend to get away and hang out at the pool. Everything this time was just mediocre. The room was in paradise tower and they charged me for a corner room (not a suite) even though the check-in agent said she'd waive that fee. On the first afternoon I called and asked for more towels, because the shower door leaks. They never showed up. For some reason on the 2nd day the water stopped getting hot, it would just get luke warm. I actually mentioned that happened to me a few weeks ago here when I checked in, and now the same thing in a different room? The Rehab pool party was a mess. First security told us to go use a different entrance as hotel guests. We walked across the hotel and at that door more security told us it was closed and to go back, and they did it with more attitude than the TSA. We get back to door one and 8 staff members are all standing around arguing about \"where they've sent hotel guests\" and if they have admission. I like Rehab, but seriously how long have you been doing this? It was like this was the first time in history they've tried this. Then the worst part is the male security they have patting down women in SWIM SUITS! I told the guy no way, that he needs to get a lady if he's feeling up my wife. So we had to wait 5 minutes. Meanwhile he actually runs his hand in the top of my boardshorts to the point that he was almost touching my crotch! Absolutely ridiculous. I can walk into Vanity (their club) wearing a jacket with enough room to hide twin .45's if I want to, but I have to almost get fingered wearing board shorts? Why are they more scared of people bringing weapons, etc. into Rehab than any other place in the hotel? I was pretty upset. My wife calmed me down and we had an OK time. The next morning I slip on the leaked water outside the shower and slam my forearm into the door frame. Got a nice tennis ball sized bruise. We were planning to check out on Monday but wanted to stay an extra day. Instead of staying at the Hard Rock we did a Hotwire and got a room for about $90 at Aria and left. I will say that this is the first time I've had a really bad experience here. The last time the water thing was a mess, but this is the first time I was actually upset. So I might give them another shot, it's just that so much was wrong. Even the bartenders and dealers don't seem upbeat or cool anymore.

I spent part of my stay just with my girlfriend, and part with her and my 3 kids. On the positive side, the pools are excellent, great for both adults who want lots of eye candy as well as for kids who want to play in the water. I was surprised to see other people there with kids, but in many ways it is actually a kid-friendly place, without the kids ruining the coolness factor of the place. However, half of the pools including all of the hot tubs became 21 and over on Friday through the weekend, which is good for adults but not so good for the kids. Another negative is that it was impossible to get a pool chair whether we arrived at 10am or 2pm. So in my experience, if you actually want to stay at the pool, you need to pay a minimum of $150 for a poolside bed. That $150 is applied towards food and drinks. The food is reasonably priced and surprisingly good, the drinks are less reasonably priced ($42 for a bucket of 6 beers, $14 for a cocktail) but not outrageous for someone from NYC. The pool waitstaff was extremely attentive and friendly, although I had the feeling that they were under pressure to bring in as much revenue as possible. I spent about $400 over 2 days of lounging and using these couches. Apart from the cost of hanging out at the pool, all of these positives were negated by the unprecedented rudeness of one of the security staff. I don't want to exaggerate and criticize all of the security staff, because most of them seemed pleasant enough. But because my child was swimming in a pool that supposedly is not for children, although he had been swimming there for 2 days together with dozens of other kids and there was no sign saying \"no children in this pool\", I had to listen to one of the security staff insult me, criticize me, call me a liar, and in general communicate with me in all the worst ways that people in the hospitality business are not supposed to do. Even while he was regaling me, several kids were in the pool, and many more kids went into the pool while we were talking. I ended up speaking with his boss, who to his credit did all the right things in treating me like a guest rather than a criminal, and who also said that the other security guy was new and in training. But the experience definitely made me question whether I'd recommend the Hard Rock or return. Inconsistent service standards are really the same as no standards in my opinion. My advice to the Hard Rock is to either hire fewer moonlighting cops whose natural instinct is to confront rulebreakers as if they are crimiinals, or to train them better (or both). In summary: I'd suggest that parents with kids think twice about staying here, which is a shame since the pool really is great for kids. But perhaps parents with kids are not one of the desired customer groups for the Hard Rock anyway. Given the financial troubles of the hotel, I'd think they'd welcome people with money to spend, but ultimately I did not feel welcome due to the behavior of the security personnel.

We have always stayed in the regular rooms and have found it to be a slightly above average hotel. For our anniversary this year, we decided to splurge and book a suite for four nights. We were sorely disappointed and would have been far better off in a regular room. Not only was the room nothing like the one pictured on the internet, it was just a regular sized room with a couch thrown in so they could call it a suite. I found the staff at check in to be a little rude, but they were very busy in the hotel, so I can kind of understand that attitude after dealing with drunks all day. The room had scuff marks all over the walls, dents and chips in the wood bed frame, and big stains all over the couch and ottoman. There is an in room music system that you can plug your I-pod into, which would be a great feature if it had worked. The lights in the bathroom were all controlled by a master switch that is located in the entry of the room. We were not told about this master switch at check-in so it took us a couple of days to discover it. We called for towels and glasses twice and both times we waited about two hours before we finally got tired of waiting and left. The shower has a regular head and a rain head, which again would have been great if they had worked. As it was, the rain shower head was completely broken and the regular shower head was so loose that it was about to pull off of the wall entirely.

Were yold that the hotel had shuttle service that ran from 8a.m-9p.m. everyday to the MGM. Well the fact is it runs from 10-5 and goes to the Fashion Mall on the other end of the strip and the shuttle was a chevrolet Suburban that only would hold 7 at max, whichwas always full. It sucked!!! If you couldn't get the last shuttle back to the hotel then you had to get a cab and that wasn't cheap. The buses were a great deal at $7 a day but once again only go up and down the strip mostly and the ones that get you to the hotel are hard to figure out. We walked our butts off which took alot of fun out of the trip as we refused to pay the outrageous cab fare. I don't know if we can say who we booked through but book-it steered us very wrong and we will pass that on to everyone!. The shows especially any of the Cirque are amazing!!!!. Also the resort fee that would have been waved on the strip was a joke at $16 dollars a day for them having a pool and spa which we never used once in fact we didn't even go near them. All in all we had a great time being the first time there once we spent 3 days figuring out where to go and how to get there. we will go back but will stay on the strip for sure next time!!!!

The living area was large enough for our party of 6 to gather for cocktails before heading out or at the end of the night. Beds are super comfy. there are separate controls for heat and ac for bedroom and living area.Plenty of storage with 2 closets and large dresser. Bathroom is huge and has all you need. Found the digital jukebox a great addition. No coffee maker so what most in vegas don't have one. Mini bar expensive as it is in all hotels. We found the restaurants to be exceptional. We dined at Johnny Smalls(20 bucks all you can eat) Rare120(1/2 off mondays), Ago very good some in our party did the price fixe pasta @12.99 with salad,entree and glass of wine and loved it. Luckys whats better then 5.99 steak and eggs. There is a coffee shop by paradise tower that we enjoyed over starbucks (had egg sandwich ,crepes,bagels etc.)Pink taco we did 99 cent lunch special which for 99 cents how can you complain.

The pool area was beautiful but got limited use due to weather ,cool and windy.the prices at the pool are crazy but having stayed at mirage,encore,mandalay bay they are right in line with these resorts We found service at the bars to be awesome only having encountering one less then friendly tender(NCAA championship monday) Cocktail service was spotty at best The casino is small and could use a better variety and more slots. The most recent table game area only open on the weekend but the main area was never crowded and you could always find a seat. The staff at front desk,bell and valet were just great (Jay@bell and Gunz@velet really stood out(hooked us with limo driver for the week who did a great job at a fair price PM me if you need info) Great Great music always playing at the pool and in the casino Overall we would stay here again doing 3 nights strip or downtown and 2 nights here.

This alone is a major accomplishment in Las Vegas, The pics on their web site actually don't do it justice. I would stay here again. And again. And again.

Also, I am well past my REHAB POOL PARTY days, so I was expecting a scene between Jersey Shore and Animal House, but the hotel was surpisingly quiet and serene. (I was there during the week, so maybe it's really rowdy on weekends) HOWEVER - This is my big rant...Sunday night, one of the night clubs was open late and the music could be heard all the way up on my 15th floor suite until 2:30. And I mean it was freakin loud. This is TOTALLY disrespectful to guests staying in the hotel. To me, it says that the nightclub guests are much more valuable to them than their hotel guests. (For this reason alone I will NEVER stay at this place on a weekend with a room facing the pool) I cannot believe they could not find a way to muffle that music from the hotel. The odd thing is that I could not even hear the maid service outside the room, the room was otherwise perfect. To be fair they did move me to the other side of the hotel when I mentioned this. Had an omelette in Lucky's 24/7 and it was really good and reasonably priced. Service was perfect. Had the same omelette through room service and the price tripled!

The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino was an AMAZING experience. Very clean at all times, really friendly and sexy staff, all welcoming with smiles. Helpful as they come, on every level, from advice for dinners, schedules and helping with any questions or concerns you may have. This staff, all around, is exceptional to say the least. I felt pampered and very happy with every aspect of service. If you've stayed at other hotels, you've definitely noticed the run down, dirty feeling of the casino floor and the plain rooms, that feel like a motel. The Hard Rock experience is the complete opposite, clean as a whistle at all times, no matter how busy the crowd, and the rooms are pristine. I am very picky about my choices of service and in my line of work, I deal with a lot of traveling and have many friends, co-workers and clients, and I can say with full confidence that every penny I spent was earned by the Hard Rock's full service and staff. It was an experience like no other and will continue to stand by my word and spend my hard earned money in a place that I know is worth it. There isn't many reason to leave the hotel, as much of what Vegas has to offer is right there within the hotel. The room I stayed in was not a suite, but it was amazing! Very comfortable beds, room set up and design is \"rock star esq\" to say the least, and the service is unmatched.

The hotel has a dirty feel to it, even though its been renovated - I stayed in the casino tower. The staff is not friendly or helpful, two examples, after check-in I was given a hap hazzard the elevators are over there on the otherside and I must have walked by the elevator hall 3x before finding, and called on a question on my bill and they acted like I was dumb and couldn't understand their deposit system, and I would have to come see them for an explanation (vs over the phone). It felt as though they were doing me a favor. I booked this hotel via hotwire (4-star in East Las Vegas), and got a decent rate for the time period I was here. Beware of Hotwire 4* in East Las Vegas. The bed was comfortable, and I slept okay. The hotel is filled with a smokey smell (the halls) and the smell does seep into the room a bit, but you get used to it. The internet for 24 hours is 14.00.

Each season we return, the question arises, \"where do we want to stay?\" We've tried other big name hotels and usually end up regretting it and coming back to the Hard Rock because... well, it just suits us better. The other hotels offer the glitz and glam that is the \"marketed\" Vegas, but their energy just seems to be tame. Sure there's that new Aria right down the street, but I want to be energized be Zeplin, Deftones, Beastie Boys, and other members of the Rock and Roll hall of fame while I'm gaming. I'd kill myself if I was on a table, loosing my money while \"We've Only Just Begun\" by the Carpenters came on. Tell me listening to that isn't draining. We've found that the regular rooms are nice, clean, and can be quite loud during the weekends when something big is going down in Vegas, but since the new HRH Suites Tower has opened up, we throw down just a little more extra to upgrade to get one of these awesome suites. The bathroom is huge, tub separate from the walk in shower that can fit 4 people at the same time (if your'e into showering that way.) There's a TV in the bed room and another TV on the other side of the wall facing the living room/lobby/foyer. Yes you read right, your room has 2 TV's and a wall separates your bed from the foyer! On top of it all, the bed sheets and pillows are so fluffy and soft! Perfect for getting the much needed rest after a whole night of partying until 5 AM at Vanity! I know that this may be a nit-picky, but I love their Irons/commercial strength steamers. It definitely helps when you're crunched on time, can't decide what to wear, and all your clothes are embarrasingly wrinkled out of the luggage. The gaming experience is even better! On the weekend nights, there's a blackjack pit surrounding two platforms with two hot go-go dancers working the poles. If that's not distracting enough, your dealer is an attractive voluptous female wearing a great smile and a corset. If that's not enough to draw you to the tables, they've got staff offering massages while you play. Since the Hard Rock usually attacts a younger crowd, you'll come across those that may frustrate you because they don't play by the book. Uncle-up to them and make conversation to show them the way the books play or just go over towards one of the other tables that require a slightly higher dollar amount. Rookies usually stay away from those tables. On a Thursday night, the waitress never lets me see the bottom of my hot cocoa mug, they are THAT attentive. Dining here is great. It's no Cut or Craftsteak, but Rare 120 definitely leaves you satisfied for the money you pay. AGO is an awesome Tuscan Italian establishment that does ok on the meats, but does outstanding on the seafood. Listen to the waiter's wine recomendations for your dish and you won't regret it. They have never steered us wrong! And if you're looking for a midnight snack, Mr Lucky's is open 24/7. Ask for a gambler's special. It entails a 12oz steak, mashed potatoes, shrimp, and a side salad for $7.77. Can't go wrong with that. The staff is what creates the atmosphere for me. Most are friendly, alot are beautiful, and everyone is ready to have a small conversation about what ever with you, especially the gentleman that waves the cabs down for you, he's quite a talkative fellow. I've even had some of the staff invite us out to hang with them after their shift ends. But then again, I'll talk to and hang out with just about anybody. Just be open! The Joint is their concert hall. It's not the Mandalay Bay, but they have some Rock'n names that come through. We saw Godsmack last Halloween. Also, make sure to check out their Fantasy-Fetish Ball around that time. You can thank me later ; ) If you're looking to come to Vegas to relax with your family Circus Circus or the Wynn is a couple blocks down. But if you're looking for a place that will keep you young and rock'n, the Hard Rock is your home away from home! It's a little off the strip, but Vegas has alot more to offer than just the strip and here's a tip: Vegas is much more enjoyable and cheaper with a rental car.

Last year, I stayed at The Hard Rock. The hotel itself, I would say, was average for a Las Vegas Strip hotel; not as nice as, say, Mandalay Bay or Caesars, but nicer than the likes of the Imperial Palace or Riviera. For a fair comparison, think along the lines of Bally's or Treasure Island. I had no problems with the staff, nor did they give me any reason to brag on them. My overall experience at The Hard Rock was, however, below average. Keep in mind, I'm a middle aged white guy who goes to Vegas to gamble, I'm not interested in any of the other entertainment options. They seem to cater to the twenty-something crowd; which is fine, if you're twenty something. But they never seemed to have enough table games open (unless you're willing to play at a $25+ table), and there weren't enough video poker machines available. As far as the location, it's several blocks away from The Strip. I'd recommend renting a car if you're going to stay here; even a short cab ride will cost you at least $10 (each way) and there's nothing really within walking distance. If you've been to Vegas before and visited The Hard Rock and you think it's a place you'd like to stay, I wouldn't try to steer you away from it.

I wanted a party atmosphere, a great casino floor, a sleek and sexy room, a great staff, and a great pool. I found everything I needed in the Hard Rock. I'm becoming a veteran of the Vegas strip, having previously stayed in Caesar's, the Palms, Venetian, and the Golden Nugget (don't ever do that unless swimming in an aquarium and old people are things you value on vacations) and let me just say that the Hard Rock is by far my favorite. Every staff member I met on my trip was great; from the front desk to the dealers and cocktail waitresses. Everybody I talked to had an interesting story and was friendly. The staff seriously helps ramp up the atmosphere because if they aren't promoting the party, then they are buzz-kills and all the staff members helped me rock out. I actually felt depressed going into some of the other casinos and ordering drinks or gambling. Kudos to the personnel manager. As for my room, the paradise tower rooms are very sexy and surprisingly inexpensive. If you are young and want to look impressive on a budget, then boom. You are welcome. As for the nightlife, Vanity is one of the most phenomenal clubs in Vegas. Bottle service prices compare well with the other high-end clubs but Vanity is truly something that has to be experienced. If I go clubbing in Vegas, I want excellent bottle service at my table and beautiful people in the club. Vanity will continue to be a place I will visit when I come back. The only downside to the trip was that Rehab hadn't started yet but as a guest at the hard rock, free admission would have been provided. Rehab is the wildest, sexiest, must-visit pool party in Vegas so you might as well just book a room in the hard rock and save the cover money for bottle service at vanity.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNever had a noisier room\u201d", "Author": "Waeswww", "ReviewID": "UR99690005", "Content": "The rooms at the casino tower have interconnecting doors which allow any sound from the neighbours to come through!

If you're lower than +/- the 10th floor and if you do not have a corner or pool view, you'll look at a parking garage aso make sure you get either a higher floor or pay extra for the pool view. The room is lovely, spacious saloon, nicely decorated, 2 flatscreen tv's for you tv addicts, bed is nearly perfect (but too hot), room safe did not work, asked twice for a repair at the reception, but nothing was done to fix it. Bathtub is DEEP, shower is large (but could do with some more pressure), nice mirror, real hairdryer, nice music station. The mini-bar is pressure sensitive so if you take something better drink, eat or use it. No bathrobes which is a pity!! The casino is fun, especially in the weekends, weekdays are calm. The \"hells belles\" girls are pretty and fun to watch if you're not playing. We had breakfast in Lucky's (not worth the money), dinner at Nobu (marvelous but $$$), steaks at Rare 120 (great but not cheap either), and some Mexican food at Pink Taco (not that special). Used the standard gym , which is OK, did not visit the (paying) reliquary spa. On Sunday we went to Vanity, and had a great night out. What I did not like: internet is payable (14$/24hr), resort fee does not give access to Reliquary Spa (charge 10$ more then), some \"European\" breakfast choices would be nice for those who don't eat 5 eggs, 2 pounds of bacon and a stack of pancakes at 7 AM. What I like about this hotel is that it is not a \"fake\" theme such as Paris, Venice, Rome - If I want to have a gondola trip I'd fly to Venice Italy and not to Vegas!

It's a venue that living and breathing the Hard Rock brand: huge guitar rises from the ground in the resort entrance, rock memrobilia is on display nearly everywhere, and music playing 24x7 throughout the hotel. The casino is surprisingly small (not tiny, but for Vegas, it's rather compact)... it's also very dark, as is the majority of the hotel... everywhere looks like a nightclub on a friday night. The rooms are very well sized and beautifully decorated and appointed. Again, however, as with the rest of the hotel, it is painfully dark. With all the lamps on, of which there are only 3 (one on a desk and one each either side of the bed), you can barely see around the room (don't try reading a book in there!). As with most Vegas hotels, you pay for the room and that's all you get - everything is extra (including using the gym or pool). The room doesn't even have tea or coffee making facilities; they want you in the starbucks downstairs and then in the casino ;) the crowd are very odd - either young trndy kids away for a mega-party or aging rockers/hippys; it's very much a party resort. It also has, probably, the busiest tattoo parlour on the planet - everytime I went past, they had a queue of people waiting for their 'ink'. The service, so unlike Chicago, was great; it was friendly, relaxed, but at the same time efficient - a tough balance to maintain.

Perhaps it's because I'm getting awfully close to my restless 40's (38 this month!) but for whatever reason I was looking for something a little more upbeat and whilst knew about the Hard Rock, had previously only thought of it as it being one of those places that is likely overflowing with pretentiousness.. boy was I wrong and happy to admit it ...(my only out on this is that come on Rehab did paint you guys a little off colour, right?!)... anyway... ... I humbly offer a HUGE SORRY to all those that work and play at the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas because it's fantastic, the hotel staff are super friendly and were always smiling (check in, valet, room service etc.) and the casino staff were all fantastic (I dealt mainly with slots and cage staff). Those that say there Suites are not luxurious don't know luxurious in Vegas because these are I asure you every bit as luxurious as the other top end hotels in Vegas (I have stayed at most at some point in time) and very price competitive if your price concious. This is NOT a \"locals\" hotel and casino, it's a genuine Resort so yes your going to pay a resort fee (reasonable) and yes they are going to put a deposit hold on your Credit/Debit card because unlike \"local\" hotels you actualy get a very well stocked mini bar and great food and bar choices throughout the HRH to charge up to the sweet suite your staying in! I will list just two of my many personal reasons why I'll be going back and staying at HRH again; * Location - if your like me and always hire a car, it's the perfect location off strip and with the valet parking garage being right at the hotel entrence (literaly steps away from the elevators) its unbeatable. The Wynn has a great side Valet for there suites but this even beats that - when I needed to get out, I was out my room and in my car in under 5 minutes every time! This alone is worth the price of a room if your the mobile type. *Ambience - as I said above, HRH is the complete opposite of what I thought (seen on Rehab days) - staff were all fantastic, and the people in the place either playing or at the bars were all genuinely friendly and having a good time. I also got what I was looking for with far more of an upbeat musical feel be it when gambling or drinking at the bars. So in summary, I have nothing against my previous places of stay/play in Vegas but the HRH is now where I'll be calling \"home\" for the time being. I posted this because I believe they got a bad rap not only from me previously (having not even stayed there) but also I'm sure others that have seen \"Rehab\" and feel the same - forget what you have heard or read (even this review!) and go try a visit for youself.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "mdgirllp", "ReviewID": "UR94774551", "Content": "First time in Vegas and got a fantastic deal at the Hard Rock Hotel.

Since I was traveling with two of my best girlfriends we decided to splurge and rent a suite for our two night stay. The HRH was definitely a wonderful choice. The first thing I loved about HRH was the separate parking for their guests. The lobby is full of music memorabilia which we all loved. Even the elevator's were cool. At first we were given a non smoking room so we got in the room, noticed there were no ashtrays, called the front desk, and had to trek back down to get a smoking room. It was fine since we ended up getting a better view of the pool area (which was closed) and the north side of the strip. The room had two queen beds and sleek modern furniture. A wrap around couch, two flat screens, privacy doors separating living room & bedroom (which we all loved since I wake up at the crack of dawn and they don't). There was also an Ipod dock in the wall with speakers beneath the TV in living room, which we liked since we're more music types than TV types. The bathroom was amazing with a huge shower with rainfall shower head and separate soaking tub also big enough for two. My friends loved the make-up mirrors and we all decided we had to have one in every room we get from now on. Even though we were there to see Roger Waters and enjoy the hustle and bustle of Vegas during Thanksgiving Day weekend we barely left our room :). We even had a pass to get into Vanity for free (they give this to you at check in), but we skipped it. The only thing I didn't like about the Hard Rock was the lack of restaurant selection in and around it, but I lived. I have stayed on the Strip and can't stand the traffic that it comes with even though it's right in the middle of everything. I liked the HRH since it a. wasn't on the Strip b. was close proximity to the airport (I did have to go pick up a friend once I got to the Hard Rock) and c. has a CVS across the street so we could buy our own alcohol and not have to worry about going to the bars and paying a ton of money.

We checked in with Angel at the Front Desk and I found her quite friendly and more than willing to answer my questions. She gave us an upgrade to the Paradise Tower with a pool/strip view without even being asked (something that we definitely appreciated which made my daughter ecstatic!) We had arranged to have a gift delivered to our room my daughter's Sweet 16th birthday and Angel made sure it was delivered promptly. It was really cool and made her feel like a rock star to go into our room and see her own gift with her name on it waiting for her! Our room was luxurious and very very clean. The beds were like sleeping in paradise (maybe that's why they named the tower such.) My daughter loved the make up mirror on the wall by double vanity and now wants one for home. We loved the flat panel tv, cordless phone, and Ipod plug in radio too. My favorite thing about the room My one suggestion would be to have more than just two bath towels in a QQ rooms, since they usually involve more than two guests. We ate at the Pink Taco prior to the show. While waiting to be seated, we lucked out and got to meet Xavier and Stevie from Buckcherry. They were down to earth and more than willing to take a few minutes out of their day to take a picture, hug my daughter, and wish her a happy birthday. The food was spectacular and the staff was very friendly. We ate after the show at Mr. Lucky's 24/7 and the food was outstanding. My wife got the BLTA and was totally psyched at the amount of bacon that was on the sandwich (reminded her of home.) I ordered the Steak, Shrimp, and salad combo for $7.77--not on menu must ask for it--and the steak was cooked to perfection. The shrimp was very fresh and the salad was huge. Our waiter Paul was very friendly and our food came out almost immediately. Vinnie Paul (the drummer for Pantera) from the HellYeah act that opened for Buckcherry was sitting only one table away from us. Needless to say, it was an incredible night for my daughter.

The Joint is a decent venue, but Tiesto transforms it into something special. If you want to rock hard at Tiesto, get a room at the Hard Rock.

It is about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the strip which isn't bad if the weather permits. We walked to the strip but took a taxi from Caesars Palace after midnight which cost $11 (without tipping). The traffic was very heavy at midnight on Christmas evening. The strip was busy Christmas evening, many Asian and Hindu tourists (I assume since many didn't recognize Christmas) but everyone seemed civilized. The HRH was very clean. We asked for an upgrade and they granted. We had 2 very comfy queen beds with down comforters, pillows and mattress pad. I could sleep on a bed like that every night. The mini bar has sensors so I would recommend that no one touches the items or you will be charged. The bathroom was nice, large shower, no tub. We had to ask for more towels since our room only had 2 bath size towels. Within 5 minutes of our request, a staff member delivered 5 more towels. The casino is much smaller but I consider it a plus. It didn't seem as busy as the other casinos. And the rock and roll playing was great throughout the casino. I didn't hear loud music in my room after midnight. I understand the music is loud when there is taping going on for a TV show at pool area but on Christmas night, the pool area was dead! The staff was very helpful. The waitresses delivering drinks were all very friendly and of course they were all beauties in their tight fitting clothing. I didn't eat at any of the restaurants b/c we decided to eat at the HR Cafe which is closeby but not part of the Hard Rock Hotel (different affiliation) according to the front desk staff. The concierge was very helpful in giving us information concerning the sightseeing. It was a short stay for us as we were just passing through. If I were to visit Las Vegas again, I would probably stay on the strip BUT I wouldn't mind staying at the HRH again as I think it met my standards for a hotel.

What's even worse is that our booking was at the new HRH Tower. Hard Rock management, in case you wondered, NO you do not even come close to competing with Mandarin or Wynn with your HRH Tower. We had booked a room with a pool view and when we checked in, were downgraded to a city view, aka a view of the parking lot. When I asked the check-in agent if there was a difference in rate, she said \"Sometimes, it depends on the weekend.\" She never offered to adjust our rate for the downgrade even though if one looks at Hard Rock's website it's obvious that pool view rooms always have a rate premium. It was late and we were tired, so we went to the room and decided we'd live with it. In the room, there were no ice tongs or a wine opener, and when we moved one of the ottomans for our room service meal, it was littered with trash underneath. One of the two TVs faded in and out and effectively didn't work. We had to return our entire room service meal other than the wine and cheese plate. The chicken was as hard as a rock and seemed as old, while the pizza was like soggy toast with ketchup on it. The next morning we let the front desk know about our disappointment with the room, and the agent (a different one from the night before), said sorry and also had the manager on duty notified. To date, those are the only two people at Hard Rock who seem to care or said sorry. He promised us a suite and also made a $50 rate adjustment to our room from the night before. We were to be notified on my cell phone when the room was ready. We spent the day doing other things and in mid-afternoon returned to the room. No cell phone call, no message in the room. We were going to a concert at the Joint (btw, the VIP access folks at Hard Rock are very nice - I highly recommend the Joint and its staff), so thought we'd relax a bit and wait for our room to be ready. We decided something must be wrong by 6 pm, so we went downstairs to check. We should have known we were in trouble when the same check-in person from the night before was there. She let us know the suite had been ready for several hours, never said sorry, wonder what happened, we should have called you. We let her know that we know longer needed the suite, we didn't want to move our stuff and were leaving in the morning. We also indicated that we would like a rate adjustment for our downgraded room for both nights. She called the manager on duty and let us know we would get a $50 adjustment on our bill. What we didn't know was that we already had a $50 credit for the day before, so the manager actually gave us NOTHING. We proceeded to go to dinner at AGO - a great restaurant, we highly recommend it as well as Pink Taco. Oh, and also my girlfriend got her nails done at the HRH spa and said the service was great. She also spent some time at the pool - actually with several other people in an area that was closed. Management may want to consider not having their only open pool area being the one that is in shade the entire day. If you're noting a pattern here, you're right - despite the shoddy and impolite (actually incompetent) service, we still spent (gladly) plenty of money in other areas of the hotel, and were fine with it because of the service we received. In the morning, the same morning staff were working and we gave them more detail of our miserable stay. They let us know how sorry they were, that something must have happened with the room notification people or process, and that they would pass on my name and number to one of their general managers, who would call me the following week.

There is a shuttle from the hotel to the Fashion Show Mall but we had needed to be on the other end of the strip at Mandalay Bay so we never used the shuttle (I believe part of the resort fee goes towards that free shuttle service). We checked in that afternoon, had lunch/dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe located right in the front of the hotel and it was what was expected in terms of food and price. Funny enough, the Hard Rock Cafe is actually not listed on any of the hotel brochures that are located inside the rooms. We stayed at the Casino Tower rooms of the hotel. The hotel rooms were prettily decorated and clean which made a good impression upon walking into them. The beds were decent, not as comfortable as I would have liked but definitely good enough to sleep on. There was a minibar located in our room and everything was placed on sensors so just make sure you do not touch anything if you did not actually want to pay for it. There is also wireless and wired internet offered in the rooms for a price of $13.99 a day. I did not use it but it was nice to know that I could have if I needed to although I considered it too expensive for one day. There is a gym there and I walked by it but I believe there is a fee to use the gym also. We had also placed our names down on the guest list for the nightclub Vanity at the nightclub concierge and we were able to get in for free (we are both female). A note about the wristbands they give you for Vanity - we were entitled to free rum drinks and champagne until midnight. I don't know if that was common but it was nice to get free drinks! Vanity itself was not as nice inside as we expected but the DJ played good music and the people in attendance were friendly and of sorts of ages (over 21 of course). We dined at Mr. Lucky's 24/7 the next morning and the food was typical diner food. The prices of the food there were not too expensive and pretty much expected. The casino itself is actually very small in terms of Vegas casinos though they do have table games and plenty of slot machines. There is also rock memorabilia scattered throughout the casino and hotel which was nice because it was like walking though a museum. The decor is very stylish and dark although the hotel did not seem dark to me.

The Hard Rock is maybe a 10-15 min drive from the strip depending on traffic so I would recommend renting a car or waking up early to use the free shuttle that the hotel provides. However, if you want to go out to the clubs you will need to take a taxi becuase the shuttle only runs till 6PM. Also, if there is a concert taking place during your stay in the hotel I recommend attending it. The venue is great, no matter where you are in The Joint you are no more than 150 ft. away from the stage.

The room had a nice view of the pools and was tastefully decorated, but was too dark and made me feel like I might have been blind.

The faucet in the room leaked non-stop in the desert. And I was displeased that the refrigerator was for payment only; I could not put anything in it without paying to do so. By far my biggest points of aggravation were the incapacity to use the pools- in spite of having to pay the resort fee- because of the time of the year (why keep the pools lit up at night? why advertise the pools? why charge a resort fee if the pools are off limits?), and the snottiness I encountered from three of the four front desk staff.

Everyone was, in fact, very personable from the front desk staff, to the lifeguards to the cocktail waitresses to the valets. We arrived rather late due to some issues with a connection (don't get me started on Delta!) and our check in went off without a hitch. We were even upgraded to a suite. We were on the 10th floor of the Casino Tower. I had visions of sleepless nights and no housekeeping. Again, not true! Sure, there was great music in the lobby and casino, but in our room, the noise level was almost non-existant. Sure, you could hear music if you stood by your window, but it was in no way overwhelming. The room was lovely and the bed was like a giant marshmallow that we didn't want to get out of. Housekeeping was very inobtrusive and left the room spotless each day. Again, I'm picky. If the Casino Tower room met with my standards, I would imagine that the newer towers are even better. I have to think that some of the negative reviews here are from people who have little travel experience, or the Hard Rock has really whipped things into shape. The one and only disadvantage is the cab fares to and from the strip. There is a shuttle, but it doesn't run quite often enough and there are always more passengers than seats, so we gave up on that quite quickly.

I've been to Vegas many times and stayed at the best of the best hotels, so we decided to give the Hard Rock a try mainly because we love their pool party Rehab. We stayed in the Paradise Towers. Room was stunning, very clean, and the beds were so comfortable. I enjoyed the decor, it was very different from the typical rooms you see in Vegas. I'm in my mid-20's and I felt very comfortable here, it's sort of a \"no-frills\" kind of place. There were lots of people our age, and people of all ages. The casino is not too big to be overwhelming. There are plenty of great restaurants of all price ranges to eat at. We loved Pink Taco and Ago. One heads up, if you are checking into this hotel on a Sunday morning, be prepared to wait a while for your room. We flew in from LA and got there around 10am for the Rehab pool party, and our room was not ready so we had to change in the bathroom and check our bags. Our room wasn't ready until about 4pm.

All the guys wanted to be him and all the girls wanted to date him. He focused so hard on being cool that he ultimately failed and was held back a year because his priorities were out of whack. The Hard Rock is that kid. The place is really sweet and I love the overall vibe but they seem to be cutting corners and really cheapening the whole experience. Google \"Hard Rock Foreclosure\" and read the recent articles that come up. The HRH is in dire financial straights and after staying here it's easy to see why. Sure, the economy is hurting but it seems like in this ultra-competitive world the HRH is doing even less to impress. I travel to Vegas from SoCal between once and twice a month for work and recently have been staying at the Palms. However, they pissed me off on my last trip so I decided to give the Hard Rock a try since they have a similar vibe and were offering a great rate. I even noted on my reservation \"Please be better than the Palms\" - they weren't. Here are a few random notes: - I booked a room in the Casino Tower for two nights. It's the oldest room block but they were renovated recently so I figured they must be decent. When checking in I gave the receptionist a $50 sandwich to see what she could do for me but the best she could find was a room on the 18th (top) floor in the newer Paradise Tower. I was expecting a little more (after all, she got $50 for less than 5 mins work) but I took what she offered and was on my way. However, when I looked at the rates online that night, the difference between the room I booked and the upgrade I received was $20/night (so x2 nights would have been $40 more). Long story short, if you are going to grease the Front Desk, stick with $20. Better yet, book the cheapest room and stick with it since even their old rooms have been renovated recently. I don't mind throwing a few bucks to get an upgrade but give me a break - fool me once and you'll never see me again. The room itself was pretty decent and the beds were GREAT. However, there were a few things that really bugged me about it: - First off, the room was very dusty and it was even more noticeable when the sun was shining in. The mini-bar was the worst - it looked like housekeeping was afraid to get within a foot of it in case they moved an item. It worked out in my favor though since the layer of dirt kept me from being tempted to eat anything. - Next gripe - there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom so I had to remember to swap it between the shower and sink. Come on guys - even the Holiday Inn gives you one bar for the shower and another one for the sink. I left a note for housekeeping the next day and they gave me extras (props to them) but I shouldn't have to do that in a nice hotel. I've noticed other reviews mention this as well so I know it wasn't just a fluke. - Strike three - the shower. It's big, which was great, but the water pressure sucked and was very inconsistent. There were times when it almost shut right off before coming on again on its own. And the shower door leaked, big time. There was a gap between the door and wall that let out a lot of water onto the bathroom floor. If a contractor performed such poor quality work in my home I would make him redo it and then fire him - why does the HRH put up with shoddy work? After work on my second day I went to get some ice to chill some drinks. I walked down to the machine on the 18th floor and....NOTHING. Not really a huge deal so I went down to the 17th floor ice machine and......NOTHING! Seriously? WTF? I went down to the 16th floor and was surprised that the machine actually worked. Overall the staff was great and very friendly. I never got an attitude from anyone at all and was treated like a loyal customer so I have no complaints there. Yes, there is a resort fee but I must have read about it ten times before making my reservation so I wasn't surprised. Do I think it's a load of BS? Absolutely, especially since it covers crap that nobody uses or other hotels include for free but I knew ahead of time that it was going to be added on so whatever. How the other reviewers didn't know about it is beyond me (pay attention people!). The Palazzo and Venetian include Internet access in their resort fee (for $17.99) which is a much better deal and they are among the nicest hotels in town. I also noticed some people complaining that they had to walk a long way from their cars to the hotel - that's pretty standard for all the big Vegas hotel so suck it up, Fatty and walk off that buffet you are returning from. I'm a pretty easy going and laid back guy but I'm just really annoyed that the HRH is slacking and with just a little effort could improve the guest experience a ton. Come on Mark Carlson, you guys are SOOO close! Just work on the details and I could be a lifer at the Hard Rock.

Getting food at the pool is quite a chore in itself as well.Tried to make a reservation at the Rare 120 restaurant within the building and was surprised the girl on her cell phone, obviously a personal call, at the reservation booth, told us she did not know the restuarnat hours?!?!

I am not one of the 'beatiful people' (40's, out of shape). This hotel is FULL of young 'beatiful people' but that said, I didn't feel like a second rate guest. I found the staff to be quite freindly, from check-in to the bars to the floorstaff. Maybe the attitude does exist here but it never hit me in the face and for that I am glad. Ok, room....When I booked I requested king bed, non-smoking (casino tower-cheap package, remember). When I checked in I requested an upper floor. I was told that the only upper floor kings available were smoking and my room was on a lower floor but if I could handle 2 queens they would give me a non-smoking pool/strip view on the 7th floor right in the middle of the casino tower. I figure that I would rather look at the pool than the street any day and I was not dissapointed by the view...the Paradise tower and the HRH tower book-ended an awsome view of the strip...from the MGM right up to the Paris (I have a picture somewhere, really nice) and the pool area looked great. More on the pool in a minute. The room was as clean as I expect when I travel...i don't carry white gloves for the top of the bathroom mirror inspection but I do like to feel like the last group didn't leave 15 minutes before I got there. The beds are very comfortable to me and the down pillows are great. After check-in (late-9:30pm...no line:))...got put away and went downstairs...Halloween night , PACKED, SKIN EVERYWHERE! DO NOT take kids to this property!!!!!! while there was no 'full-on' nudity it was pretty close. Not only would a family have a bad time here....I would have a bad time with a bunch of kids hanging around. The Swedish House Mafia was playing at the Joint and the security dude at the elevator told me that they were moving into the nightclub Vanity after the show.....alright, not a club person so I thought I would find a spot for a drink and play a couple hands of video poker....sat at a bar in between the 2 main rooms and watched the parade of 'less than nothing' costumes on those aforementioned 'beautiful people' WOW. Drinks were offered as soon as I sat down...good start, I hate getting ignored, remeber I am not one of the 'B.P.' as they will now be known. Sat for a while and made my way to a blackjack table...$15 minimums this night ....oh well. Played for an hour or so...several drinks later and down a whole $40 I decide to pack it in. Here is where the first of only a couple issues came up. the nightclub Vanity has a balcony on the pool side of the HRH tower...The party was unbelievably loud and it made sleep almost impossible...until 7 am the noise was booming. The street view room was starting to look better. Deprived of sleep only on this night, the other 3 nights iI had a great sleep. When I dragged myself up at 9am after a couple hours sleep, I opened the french doors....yes, french doors to take in the morning. I never realized how nice this little feature about the old casino tower is. Anyhow, getting long winded, sorry. Never awakened by housekeeping...always left a couple dollars for them and the room was always well kept. a couple staffers in the halls always said hello when I walked by...not what I would consider unfriendly at all. Only ate in the hotel once...Pink Taco...good stuff, been there about 9 years ago...same, same...good staying power in this city. Another downer coming...this is not a great hotel for gambling...machines are few and are very tight...didn't see anyone celebrating the whole time I was there and you will not find a low table limit....were talking Wynn and Bellagio style limits but this hotel is neither. Pool. CLOSED, but....this was a good thing (for me) as I was to find out quickly. no staff, no service, no towels, no crowd, and NO CHARGE. the place was not jam packed with B.P.s but it wasn't empty either....brought a bag of my own beer that I picked up at Walgreens, a cigar, a magazine and my i-pod and relaxed...no hassles, no problem...cabanas were empty, beds were available...good stuff from a potential bad-news sign 'pool closed for the season'. Anyhow...just a couple of thoughts 1- no kids! take them somewhere else . 2- if you don't like it loud, stay away. 3- don't be intimidated, it's not a B.P. only hotel...most of them were very nice. 4- don't go out of your way to find problems...yes they are there but have fun, it's supposed to be fun in Vegas, isn't it? 5- hardcore slot junkies will be dissapointed. 6- rent a car...parking is much closer to the hotel than the big strip resorts and there isn't much to see nearby. 7- earplugs on the bedside table, just in case. Just one man's experience....considering for the same money I could have been at the Circus Circus or the Fiesta Rancho...I am not in anyway dissapointed with this resort.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cBooom Chigga Booom!\u201d", "Author": "lapislazula1", "ReviewID": "UR85988606", "Content": "I actully loved it!

It was my favorite Vegas hotel, but due to the changes over the past year, I will not stay there again. Without detailing specific incidents here is why: Once a boutique casino that nurtured relationships with regular guests, the HRH has become like most of the other casinos in Vegas. They do not care about returning guests, just taking your money . This change coincided with the opening of the new hotel wings and the doubling of the pool and casino areas. The head of security thinks he is a cop and treats everyone as a problem. The attitude of too many of the upper level employees is \"That's the way it is, I can't do anything about it\", and when they say \"I'm sorry\" it seems they are only sorry they have to deal with a guest. Many of the hotel's staff are nice and guest-oriented, but the people to whom they report are the problem. I had the same experience when I stayed in May 2010, but was assured by HRH management that my next stay would meet my expectations. It did not. This past visit I spoke with a hotel manager, and while at the time she expressed concern and promised to get my complaints addressed, I have yet to hear back from her. I don't mind the noise and I like the party atmosphere of the hotel, but I draw the line at harassment by security and hostile attitudes.

Nice rooms in the Paradise tower! One of the biggest pool complexes I have ever seen. I have to start out by saying that after reading some of the reviews here I went in to this experience with my eyes open. Yes the place is noisy, moreso then other casinos I've visited. You'd better like Rock music because it's everywhere all the time, except for your room - unless the pool is hoppin' Check in was swift, we waited 5 minutes - I think the trick is to check in early, since later in the afternoon there were lineups. If you do check in early you can leave your bags at the bell desk and hit the town. The beds are soft and comfy, the bathrooms are nice - maybe the shower door could leak less. The room was quiet. We were on the pool side but high enough to avoid direct exposure. If the late night noise bothers you get a mountain view room. The food choices were great, Pink Taco was a hit with us. So was Johnny Smalls. Mr Lucky has decent food, but the service is spotty getting drinks takes forever. It can also get very loud. They need some soft surfaces to soak up the sound. Never tried Nobu or Ago. Shopping is limited but the John Varvatos store has some great menswear - but make sure you have a good relationship with your banker. The casino was up to normal standards nothing to write home about. Although I did notice that it didn't seem to matter if I was playing penny or dollar slots I was still getting comp drinks. Other places I've been to aren't as generous if you roll low. The place is off the Strip, but there is a shuttle and cabs are cheap enough. Even when I've stayed on the Strip cabs are a part of getting around. If you get tired of the grub at the hotel there's a PF Changs just a bock away, and other restaurants nearby too.

I check in at 4pm at the HRH tower on Saturday, which they tout as exclusive check-in. It's not! I walk up to a random desk and ask if it's the front desk because none of the areas are marked or labeled. Just a walkway in the middle and the front desk on the other side. It was the weirdest layout ever. If there was a line these people would be waiting in the middle of a walkway. There was only one agent on duty for Halloween weekend which I thought was silly. I try to check in and she tells me the most dreaded news: your room isn't ready! It makes no sense to tell people check in is at 3pm and check out is at 11am. You can't enforce one, but not the other. They will charge you $100 for a late check out, but when it comes to having your desired room ready \"there is nothing we can do, we are short staffed in this tower and we have no idea when the room will be ready, but I can offer you a late check out\". Being short of housekeepers is not my problem! I did the research, found the room, PAID for the room and now you tell me it's not ready. I tell her to drop the resort fee, which is another story, and she states they can't \"you agreed to it when you paid for the room\". I say \"I also agreed to having the room I selected ready at 3pm\". It's the HRH tower which are only suites- either a King bed or 2 queens. She eventually upgrades me, but puts me in another tower, stating \"we usually charge more for the room, but we will keep you at the current rate\". As if she's doing me a favor, she should have offered that from the beginning, instead of arguing with me. I waiting so long to stay at this resort and then they ruin it the moment I check-in. These people don't care about the guests whatsoever. Which brings me to valet and bell. I pull into valet (which the resort fee covers, free of charge, like it is in all resorts) but the sign is not clearly marked , it's the far far left lane, but I pull into the left lane and I wait and wait and then the attendant sees me and tells me to come back through the correct lane. Most resorts have two or three valet lanes, apparently this hotel has only one! I state to the surly guy i need a bellman to help me take some bags to my room. \"Oh that's going to be a minute to find someone.\" (they are clearly short of staff, with 15% unemployment I don't know how) Anyway, he finds someone and he loads my bags on the cart and tells me \"its going to be awhile to take it up to your room\". (What's with this place) I had food trays and three bags that needed to be taken up so I could get ready and I tell him \"I need the bags now, not in 20 minutes\".I told him I can take the cart myself and he wouldn't let me. He tries to say the valet is busy and they will get to it. I tell him \"forget it \" and he walks away and says something like \"I don't want to argue\". He just leaves me there to load all the stuff back in my car. I find the other valet guy to get my keys back and go up 5 levels and self park! This is the beauty of the resort fee. It's a non-negotiable add on that provides no benefit. You pay more, but the service is exactly the same or worse, than if they didn't charge it. In my case much worse! The suite is nice but the bed is low to the ground, the remotes are hard to figure out, but they have DVD players and Ipod docks in the rooms for the Casino tower, which don't have balcony's, per say, but have double doors which open to the pool and are railed off . If you get one of these be prepared to hear loud music coming from the club and pool, which plays music all night long (I dozed off about 4am) even in the off season, when it's shut down. I have a little kitchenette with a bar in my room, but it lacks a fridge.

It's not a big deal and is becoming the normor most establishments. And some comments about indifferent staff? Wow... I've never seen anything of the sort...except maybe a couple of low-roller pimp wanna-be's who came in demanding everthing. The folks at the Hard Rock make me feel very welcome! ALWAYS! My only pet peeve of the entire place and it's a very small one is that the servers in Mr. Lucky's like to hang-out behind the soda stand wall and chat (or something) while the food sits under the heat lamps.

As I said, I'm not in my 20s, I'm an old married hag with two small children who I love to death and who drive me crazy, so when I'm on vacation with my husband and without my little cherubs, all I want to do is sit my old, tired behind by the pool and lie in the sun all day, read books, and drink the occasional frozen margherita if I get a wild hair. Well, as it turns out, if you're in Vegas on a weekday (and/or maybe in non-summer months?), forget about getting a chair in the sun unless you're one of the first 3 or so people to get in line as soon as the one pool area that is actually open, opens. When we walked out to the pool area, the few chairs in the sun were already taken, the big \"Rehab\" pool was entirely CLOSED, and the other pool, near the Sky Bar, was closed, apparently because of the \"Dew\" BMX event over the weekend. Anyway, not being able to just lie by the pool in the sun as we had fully expected we could do was a major turnoff for me and my husband, so much that I decided it warranted a Tripadvisor Review. Hard Rock, you are a really cool hotel, with good service, a fun atmosphere, and awesome music, but you really need to reconsider your policies about closing the pools during the week. It really makes bad sense, at least for your customers, for you to keep open the one pool that remains in the shade of the new towers except for a brief time when the sun is highest in the sky. I don't need ten women with fake boobs to be standing right there asking me if I want to order a $50 beer, either, so if you're just trying to save money you can skip that part. Just please give me a chair in the sun by a pool, any pool, and let me be the one who determines whether I get skin cancer.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, California", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and Entertaining\u201d", "Author": "Caitycat", "ReviewID": "UR84099672", "Content": "First of all, it's the Hard Rock.

Fantastic dining (I recommend Rare 120 and Nobu) and great music (from The Joint to simply a good selection of music in the casinos) this hotel even offers good shopping too. It is a little pricey on the weekends. There is a resort fee. However, you DEFINITELY get what you pay for. The newer rooms (I stayed in the Paradise Tower) were stunning. Absolutely gorgeous decor and the beds are to DIE for. I fell right asleep (which is hard for me typically when away from home) and didn't want to get up in the morning. One of the most comfortable hotel stays I've had. Additionally, you do NOT have to pay to valet park or park overnight. When you think about it, the mere hotel fee alone is worth this! Most resorts charge up to $20 a night to park. They only work off tips at the Hard Rock\u2014so worth it. Great service, (I needed a Band-Aid and security had one sent up to my room within five minutes). Very clean. Yes, there are a lot of pretentious people at the pool and around the venue, but that's the crowd they cater too. Don't go to Rehab if you aren't feeling the crowd, it's a given. Some of these reviews crack me up. My stay was fabulous, and I recommend this hotel. Check it out on Sunday-Thursday nights\u2014you can get some incredible rates.

Yes, it is OFF THE STRIP. Yes, they charge a resort fee, and yes, they charge a $100 fee per night, per room for incidentals. All of these things were disclosed to me when purchasing my rooms. Yes, IT IS LOUD. NO, it is NOT kid-friendly. All things you can avoid if you stay somewhere else. For people who research hotels before deciding where to stay (like myself), if you are in Vegas to PARTY (not to relax - go stay somewhere else for that) and LIKE loud rock, you will LOVE the hard rock! Myself, my husband, his brother and wife came to celebrate my 30th & stayed 2 nights in the HRH Suites tower. Rooms were beautiful, clean and the beds were FANTASTIC! Like sleeping on a cloud! I want to run out and purchase one myself. The casino was small, which I actually enjoyed. No getting trapped in a maze, designed to keep you gambling all night. The memorabelia (sp?) throughout was very cool. We didn't do the rehab thing, as you have to get up @ 9am to get a wristband for entry, and we were still sleeping. We went to the pool up at the skybar which was nice and not too crowded on a Sunday. We didn't have any problems using the facilities (couches, etc) without a reservation or fee while there. Drinks are expensive. I'm pretty sure they would probably be at any other resort in Vegas as well. Solution - bring your own for in the room, and then you will only have to splurge on one while at the pool. Oh and yes, the mini-bar IS motion activated and there is a sign stating this. The only restaurant we ate @ in the Hotel was the Pink Taco - DELICIOUS & super service. There is a lot to do in the HR itself, so you don't really NEED to go to the strip, but if you are catching a show or what-not, it is about a $25 cab ride (one way). Way cheaper than a DUI! If you want to relax, or are in Vegas for work or a family vacation, I wouldn't recommend staying @ the HRH. If you are there to party, it's def the place for you! If you want to come party, but still need to get to bed early at some point, to catch a flight or something of that nature, I recommend ear plugs or some other sleep aid. We will be back for sure!! **Oh, one last tip: If you are staying in the HRH suite tower, there is a separate (closer) parking garage off Harmon.

Next day we asked to be moved, which the staff agreed to, however no sleep there either unfortunately and no view either! party people next door had parties every night until we left! on the last night as we had a long flight home so my husband phoned reception on five different occasions to ask for security to just ask them to turn it down a bit, nobody came, so no sleep at all for the whole week, when I complained I was told \"your in vegas!\" The mini bar was a complete rip off $10 for a small bottle of water.......so I filled my fridge with supermarket water at only $0.50 I then looked at my online check out bill and to my dismay I had been billed $250 as it was weight censored and they thought id eaten everything, after a phone call to reception I was informed that the fridge was not for my personal use! even though I was paying $150 a night to stay there.

The Hard Rock was a great (perfect) place to be, even as a solo traveler (all of our friends and families were staying at different hotels in town). I did have a check-in issue, in which the front desk agent authorized the wrong credit card (which thankfully was declined due to fraud prevention- it was a debit card), and the situation was then corrected when a different front desk agent took over and authorized the correct card which I had presented. I was slightly stressed about that initially, but as the days went by, I loved the place more and more that by the time I left, I was really sad to leave! I enjoyed the Beach Club, including Skam Saturdays, Johnny Small's, Pink Taco, even Brannon Hair, and the Luxe and Center Bars, whose bartenders were friendly and welcoming. The Rock Fitness Center was particularly well-done too. I wasn't admitted to Skybar because I was not in beach attire or Vanity because it was too late (around 2:30 am Sunday night), but I'll check them out next time.

They didn't seem to have any system in place and seemed to nearly make up the prices on the spot! But that wasn't the worst of if by a long shot...! The Rooms, Hotel, & Staff: As mentioned we had 5 guys sharing a Suite and adjoining Queen Room. There is basically nothing in these rooms that you need. We had to call down to reception to get the ipod connection and roll out bed we were promised would be in our room. In fairness they did come pretty promptly once called. The main en Suite bathroom in the Suite was covered in dust and dirt (I will also upload a photo). On night 1 I went down to reception to tell them and was told by the girl on reception that it \"wasn't her problem\". I asked to speak to see the duty manager and was told there was none on duty. I asked them to call a duty manager and they eventually agreed. I spoke to Laura the duty manager and she seemed like she was going to be able to do something about it. She also said that she would make it up to us in terms of getting access to the club (Vanity) etc...That we would be looked after. She said if we returned to our room that someone would be in touch very shortly. We went back to the room and waited about 45mins for a housekeeping representative. When they arrived (2 of them) they took one look at the bathroom, said it was disgraceful, but then left never to be seen again! Next day we went to play golf and when we got back the bathroom was still exactly the same. Hadn't been touched. I went back down to reception again. They had no record of my previous complaint and didn't seem to care less. They also had no record about the club access we had been promised. In fact they said that the Hard Rock have nothing to do with Vanity niteclub and it is completely run by a third party. They also made me feel like a 2nd class citizen because I was staying in the main Hotel and not in their new HRH Towers. Even though the bill for our stay in the hotel was relatively large as we were staying in suite + queen. At this point I gave up as I was starting to get stressed about it and that's not what you want when you are away with a group of friends in vegas!

We ventured out to the pool where we were hit for $9.00 a piece Miller Lite's. The next day we ventured to the West beach and had lunch. I ordered a Turkey Club and my wife got a chix wrap. There was barely any chicken in the wrap and all they serve is the sandwich. No pickles, no fries, coleslaw, etc. My wife ordered a diet coke and was charged $8.00 for no refill. I ordered water and they came back with a cup of ice and said the water fountain was behind me. The bill for two sandwiches and a diet coke was $44.00. The next 2 days we went off site due to prices and small portions. Try Capriotti's sandwich shop across the street....incredible! Before you are allowed in the pool, they search your bag like you are a criminal. Not to mention you cannot bring in any outside beverages. Our friend had a Starbucks coffee bought on site and they refused to let him enter the pool. This was at 11am in the morning. Once we got out to the pool, security searched our bags again!!. They also told us the pool was closed when we arrived at 10am. We asked, \"can't we sit in the sun?\" After thinking about it they gave us permission to sit in the sun but absolutely no going in the pool until 10:30am The pool scene at the HR is entirely overrated. You almost feel sorry for the crowd that is there. 20 something posers and pathetic. Or old men trying to pick up women. When we asked security why the vigilance in searching bags, they said they are not concerned with booze or weed, mainly drugs and weapons.

I did not pay for the room, I don't know what the rates are, I only paid for my flight and fun so I didn't have high expectations - I was happy to have a girl's getaway. That being said, I had the BEST experience at the Hard Rock that I've ever had in Vegas (and I have been many times and stayed in many different hotels). We were truly treated like rockstars, even when we were utlizing our free cabana and not spending as much as a real rockstar would. The staff, from front desk to Rockstar club, bell desk to bartenders, cabana hosts and servers, were all extremely friendly. The resort spent over $350 million to make the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino an \"oasis in the desert\", a place you'd never want to leave, and they have truly succeeded. From the moment we walked in, I knew I'd never stay at another hotel in Vegas (and that was BEFORE all the great experiences!) The music, the vibe, even the smell (what is that, patchouli? Nag champa?) - all of your senses are awakened and you know you are in for a good time. We stayed in the Pool Tower and the room was very nice (although the lighting in the shower area is a bit dark). My only complaint is that I must've gotten the worst bed in the hotel, because everyone talks about how comfy they were and mine slanted to the right so much that I had to stack pillows on that side to keep from rolling off! We had great food and service at Mr. Lucky's, and also at the tapas restaurant (can't remember the name, something \"Smalls\" I think - Johnny Smalls?). The Happy Hour at the tapas restaurant is great - several plates for $4 and 2-for-1 drinks. It was the perfect way to end a day at the pool before beginning your night out! We also ate at the Pink Taco, but I may have chosen the wrong dish. I wasn't impressed with the fish tacos, but the salsas were good and we enjoyed the marachi band playing that evening. The pool areas are wonderful, but you do have to get there early for the best spots. However, if you can't snag a lounge, the small chairs were perfect for the lower-depth pool areas. Even better is having the cabanas! Our host, Blade, was very friendly and checked in with us several times throughout the day. Our waitress was also attentive. The cabana was clean and comfortable. And yes, there is a lot of great scenery - beautiful men and women everywhere! I thought it was the best experience of the entire trip until... Reliquary. Oh. My. Goodness. The best use of my time and money during the entire trip. In fact, if I had known about all of the amenities provided (for any spa service!), I would've spent the entire day there! The Roman pool was so beautiful and relaxing, and one of the staff even came by to ask if I needed anything, and brought me another bottle of water. The steam room was huge (and steamy). The showers were clean and I was impressed with all of the toiletries provided. I had a 50-minute massage from Channel and let me tell you, it was the best massage I've had in my entire life (and I've had a few)! I will definitely go back to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (the sooner, the better) and would recommend it to anyone who loves rock music, the party atmosphere, and rockstar service (even when you are using every single comp)!", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cAwful service, given a free downgrade to a room worse than what had been paid for\u201d", "Author": "Pony_19", "ReviewID": "UR81440572", "Content": "Be wary of booking a room at this hotel through a third party travel agent.

Charcoal and silver wall paper, leather accents, mirrored surfaces, embossed carpet and a dry bar for making drinks. 46' Sony Bravia TV is impressive.

Areas that need help: Arriving at the hotel no one offered to help me with my 3 bags or open either double set of doors. My check-in experience sucked! Arrived at 2:45 on a Monday, room was'nt ready until 3:45. Was never offered to have my bags checked, no apology... nothing. I confirmed 2 days before my arrival the bed type, arrival time and other requests (non-smoking, extra pillows, etc) the front desk guy said nothing came up under my reservation? Additionaly the front desk staff ware printed white tee shirts as uniforms. This looks truly unprofessional and cheep... Burnt out light bulbs everywhere in the original casino, public areas and memorabilia displays.

Each request for more towels took an hour to fill when I was told 10-15 minutes. Toiletries are of poor quality. Vegas is a very dry environment; all other hotels provide lotion and shower gel, not the Hard Rock. Bathroom is very dark with insufficient lighting. No coffee maker in room. There's a Starbucks in the hotel but not close. $15.00 per day resort fee??? Considering the pools were never all opened, the gym is an additonal $20.00 per day, no in-room free high speed internet and no priority or reduced fee into thier nightclubs; this is a complete scam!!!

The resort is amazing and very well maintained, we had a fantastic suite in the HRH Tower, which I can fully recommend. However, we were charged 15$ a day resort fee when we checked in, this wasn't included when reserving the room online. As i said it is an amazing resort, 5 pool areas etc. However, the my entire stay, 3 of the 5 pool areas where closed, if you went into the area, security should very quickly move you out. This was quite frustrating because if you did arrive at the 2 pool areas that were open before 11am, you would not be able to get a sun lounger and would have to settle for just a chair, normally out of the sun. It was quite frustrating to be charged a resort fee when more than 50% of the resort was closed. I've stayed at the Hard Rock Orlando, which was also a great resort and the arson for me choosing Hard Rock in Vegas. However, the staff, especially at the poolside and bars are much friendlier with less attitude in Orlando. No coffee facilities within the room which was an obvious omission for such a great suite, there is a star bucks in the complex, but quite a walk, so not ideal when you first wake up in the morning and crave some coffee. Please also be aware that the hotel will take a deposit of 100$ per day of your stay in case of damages when you checkin. For those who are planning a long vacation and do not have unlimited credit on their card, this is something to consider, especially as it isn't evident when you reserve online.

It was indeed a game changer. Peter Morton was the man! There was no hotel like it in Vegas. So when a bunch of old friends decided to have a reunion in Vegas - We thought the HRH was the perfect spot to relive the good ole days since many a great story and possibly a case of Herpes for our close friend Rubin. The recent renovations and new owners made it an even more exciting venture. We arrived Thursday for a long weekend. Check in was spotty, We had requested rooms on the same floor. The front desk did nothing to accommodate other than to tell us we did not request it. *I always love when someone in a service industry tells you it's your fault and your problem that they cannot make you happy. But, honestly, all check ins at most hotels always seem to go wrong. Finally got to the rooms (scattered thru floors and towers of the hotel.) And yes, the rooms are great. Well done Morgans!!! As a guy who goes to Vegas 5-6 times a year, I feel I have a good lay of the land and honestly am writing this in hopes that the hotel picks up on these suggestions as they seem more than willing to make the changes they need to make this place ROCK! Comfortable and well laid out -- They have captured the HR spirit. The hotel is so close to becoming a cool hip destination. The problem again is the service. Housekeeping is weak and spread to thin. Calls to Front Desk for anything are a complete waste of time. We had AC issues and they were ignored, But let's be real. This is Vegas and the room is only a place to hold your bags and nurse the hangover, As for the casino -- Again a really cool vibe. Service is adequate. Cocktail girls aren't what they used to be but there are a few winners. Doormen and security are to cool for school. They need to remember they are al part of making the guest feel comfortable. the new dining options are a huge step up. All in all, the hotel is moving in the right direction, as should be expected form the perfect management for this kind of hotel - The Morgans Group. They have always been cutting edge of hoteliers. Ultimately, I think REHAB (HR's key draw and moneymaker) and the TRU tv show create a bit of a conflict. The hotel aspires to be one thing but the TV show sends out a different kind of message. Bottom line -- The hotel has all the tools to be trendy boutique it once was and damn am I rooting for it.

But what a great disappointment it was. It started right from the check in and continued throughout my two-night stay. The staff was unfriendly in every department. The room was OK, but not very well maintained: the safe was not working at all, the desktop lamp switch was broken and the internet access cost $15/24hrs and it didn't work either! The most I have paid before that for the internet access had been $3/24hrs, but usually it is totally free. A maintenance guy came to my room to fix the internet connection and took at the same time the desktop lamp with him to get it fixed, with a promise to bring it back later that day. Well, I never saw that lamp again. The pool area is nice but they only had about 1/3 of it open (the nicest parts remained closed), although the pool chairs were practically 100% occupied.

During in the week , it is quieter and stylish, but still with a definite party vibe. At the weekend, it becomes and eye popping collection of beautiful people who want to be seen, which inevitably changes the feel of the hotel. Two holidays in one if you stay for a week ! In terms of rooms, and cleanliness, I cannot fault the hotel (be sure to leave a tip for your cleaner each morning, this made a Huge difference) . The rooms are luxurious, spacious, glamorous and comfortable. facilities are great, massive choice of places to eat, at reasonable value, Pink Taco was my favourite, and genuinely good food. Service was absolutely fine, I was nervous about this aspect because of the negativity on the reviews, but everyone I came into contact with was polite, friendly and helpful, even the busy security guards on Rehab day. If you come at the weekend, you have to a different pool experience than in the week,, so if you want to just relax, this may not be the place. Distance from the strip, a good half hour, fine in the evening, tough in the afternoon. it's 6/7 dollars taxi ride, so again if this is likely to annoy you, get a hotel on the strip. I really enjoyed being away from the traditional Vegas lunacy ( only swapped for a slightly different version) There are extra costs that are a little irritating, nightclub entry, resort fee etc. but these are clearly stated, if this kind of thing bothers you, again choose an alternative.

The first thing to be noticed about HRH is the music. It\u2019s loud! It gives that rock and roll party atmosphere that you were promised from the get go. At the check in counter we were greeted by a very friendly front desk clerk, Derrick I believe was his name. He was very good at engaging us in conversation, finding a common interest we shared, and then chatting about it to pleasantly pass the time while he found our reservations and placed us in an available room. He also explained up front the mini bar in our room was pressure sensitive so to be careful, and that we would have to come back to get wrist bands for the pool on the weekend, I was very appreciative of the up front information. The room was great. It had a very modern design, black whites and grays, very comfortable beds, nice decent size bathroom with a pretty big tub and stand in shower, lights in the mirrors, plenty of storage space, and we actually got a free upgrade to a pool view which if you plan to stay up late throughout your trip I would highly recommend it. The music from the pool penetrates your room with little resistance till pretty late in the morning, so if you have a bed time, I would suggest a different room\u2026or hotel. Also there is a large wall mounted flat screen TV. That really just makes the room look impressive. The casino was by far the best thing about this hotel. Most of the gambling staff was amazing; we would literally come to gamble just to hang out with these awesome people. There were defiantly a few bad apples, some staff just didn\u2019t seem to understand that everyone was there to get drunk and have a good time, but the good ones more then made up for it. Kenny? (His name tag said Ge? I think?)The craps dealer was great, always made us feel like friends and welcomed us to conversations and advice even though he was insanely busy. Cindy the pit boss for the craps tables was by far the best staff experience I have ever had the pleasure of encountering. She wasn\u2019t intimidating like most pit bosses are, very friendly, and funny, treated us like her favorite customers. The thing that was most impressive about Cindy was her personality; she really treated us like pals. She playfully teased and harassed us and it really felt like we weren\u2019t in her place of business, we were just out drinking and having a good time with some new friends. She also went above and beyond to look up our individual player comps and basically any other little thing we needed. Speaking of comps, the HRH comp system is both a hit and a miss. It\u2019s great because with the amount of gambling we did most of the meals we ate there were completely comped and we did eat at some very nice places (more on the dinning at HRH in a bit), the bad thing about their comp system is that we were told the points expire 72 hours after you leave (actually this took many inquiries to find out most of the gambling staff had no idea about their rewards programs). We are coming back in October and it\u2019s a shame we don\u2019t have extra incentive to stay here again. They did however let us use our points in the gift shop which was great, but I\u2019d rather of had my points carry over into my next trip instead of having to blow them all on over priced novelties that I really had no interest in. The gaming experience at HRH overall was great, young, rowdy, loud and fun if you\u2019re looking for those things HRH won\u2019t disappoint. The dinning at HRH was phenomenal! Very good variety and so delicious! The pink taco serves amazing Mexican food and the staff is decent, had to wait a while on one of our many trips there but the free chips and salsa diminished the irritation of sitting without a server for about 30 min. I would highly recommend their chicken taco\u2019s although none of the food served their was worth complaining about, all very good. Lucky\u2019s 24/7 is a god send! Now, the food is above average nothing to rave about, but still good, they have an off menu special of steak and shrimp for only $7.77 can\u2019t beat that. Why are they a god send? If you are in Vegas to party hard, you will stumble in here at ridiculous hours needing good food quick, and that\u2019s what Lucky\u2019s will give you. The staff was very accommodating of the less then sober crowd, and the food came out before you even really knew what to order! (Not really but it was quick). Ago is a very nice Italian place that gets top marks in customer service. No complaints about the food, but no real raves about it either. It was good, nice portion and reasonably priced (well reasonably for a higher scale place\u2026 it\u2019s no olive garden). The service though is outstanding. I wish I remembered our waiter\u2019s name. Fine dinning isn\u2019t really our thing and he very much made us feel comfortable and checked up on us often enough so as we were never with wants, but not so often that we felt pestered. Johnny Smalls is expensive for what you get, but there are some real gems here. The service was slow, but they are quite busy, this place is great for splitting between a small party, they serve only appetizers and they are very small portioned so you can order a variety and get a good taste of everything. If you make it here make sure you try the \u201csmalls balls\u201d and I also really liked the Phillish. My biggest complaint is they are never open! Such a small window of time to eat here. The pool was ok. The pool itself was very impressive I loved the layout and the swim up black jack, but like most of the other posts you will read here, I agree, the staff is way below par. First of all we had wrist bands for different days to get in the pool since we were hotel guests but the pool staff had no idea which day was which band (defeats the point right?), second WOW are they elitists. They are really good at making you feel small, and like you don\u2019t belong. Mainly the male staff, the females that worked there I guess were pleasant enough, but I definitely did not feel like they wanted us there. We spent money, and aren\u2019t bad looking, thought we had a good formula for that place, but apparently not. Overall I would recommend HRH to anyone looking to party for the weekend, it\u2019s off the strip but honestly we rarely felt the need to leave and when we did\u2026 $7 cab ride, not bad. If they changed their rewards program, and did something about the pool staff I\u2019d never go anywhere else.

And you got there at 11pm on Friday, crazy that it was like a club, thought that was the slow part of the day, ha! As for the pools, the Rehab pool is great but so is the brand new West Beach pool which is just as fun and maybe bigger than the Rehab pool. I was able to get beverage service even though that last guy said you had to have a cabana, and I knew that drinks were going to be expensive and in plastic...that's for safety folks, don't want your 11 year old throwing glass bottles now do we? As for going to and from the pools, I actually liked the security...even though it may seem like a pain, isn't more better than less??? We did use the shuttle, and while it could go a bit later, it's nice to have when you want to get away. The hotel is about 2 blocks from the strip and anybody can walk there, not a big deal unless you're super lazy. And who cares where at the mall it drops off? Why did that last guy even worry about what door he was at, and why is he going into the mall when he's worried about where to go on the strip??? It's a service and you can't be too picky. We didn't have any problems with the mini-bar, we listened to what the front desk people told us and shockingly nothing showed up, strange how that works!

We had the sliders and eggs benedict and were quite impressed with both.

I roll into HRH to let loose, game and party and while I am not unrealistic and expect to win a lottery sized jackpot, the machines are pretty tight and unforgiving. The tables games at night will provide you with a lot of energy and entertainment. I like both rooms in the new and old towers, but getting to the new rooms will take about 10 minutes of walking, so be prepared...the 3 am walk (of shame - haha!) down the hall seems like something out of horror movie that never, ever ends. I have read that others thought the old rooms were run down and dirty, I hadn't experienced that ever before and I have been dubbed a hotel snob. The service from desk staff to servers is very attentive and professional, especially considering what they deal with in the wee hours of the morning.

No food is served and you cannot enter with any food or drink, or camcorder or makeup or etc. They confiscated our peanuts from Southwest Airlines. Just ridiculous. If you want pool service for food or drinks you have to buy a chair or bed. Otherwise, you wait or go without. I recommend going with 10 friends and getting a bed by the pool, you get bottle service, food and your own waitress. You can enter with your cellphone and your ID and roomkey and cash. The DJ wasn't that good. I've heard better. The Rehab closes at 5pm. In fact all the pools close by 5pm or 8pm and don't reopen until 10 am. No food is served at the pools and if you bring your coffee or sandwich with you they will confiscate it. It doesn't matter that you bought it there at the hotel. The hotel kept telling me that there is pool service for drinks and food but I never saw anyone taking orders. Also they don't like camcorders even though I snuck mine in. Very disappointing as far as enjoying the pools. Too many restrictions not even my grandmothers house has this many restrictions. At other hotels, I am used to having mimosas at the pool by 9am with breakfast and use the pool late at night until I am DONE with drinks.

This is not only a review from my experience but a rebuttal to some of the statements made by some reviewers. I stayed with 3 friends in late August and had an absolute blast there: PROs -Great casino, great atmosphere and some of the promptest (and strongest) drinks about. To those complaining about the poor drinks service\u2026\u2026 maybe you\u2019re not tipping? I actually had a problem keeping up with the drinks service and was getting laughed at because I couldn\u2019t finish half a glass of whisky in 5 minutes! Croupiers were awesome, big shout out to Rhondi \u2013 she had me in stitches throughout 4 hours of Blackjack. -Great service at the check in desk. We were given complimentary upgrades to the Paradise (pool view), and we were sorted out for Rehab and Vanity. I also evidenced the fact that I agreed a $7 resort fee when I booked as opposed to $15 and they were happy to change. -The safe wasn\u2019t working. I called and they came up in 5 minutes. -Amazing rooms, some of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in \u2013 great to recover after way too much partying. Room service was great, extra towels, etc. Maybe I am getting pedantic here, but tipping the maid may help. And once again I did my research and knew they had sensors on the mini bar drinks/snacks. So guess what? I didn\u2019t touch them! My friend however did in his room, but they immediately took it off their bill at check out, they did not check on inventory or anything. They only said they\u2019d re-charge it if they found out that these snacks were gone. -Great clientele. Yes, it\u2019s people in their 20s looking to have fun. We did our research and chose the Hard Rock for that very reason. For those complaining that it\u2019s full of 20 somethings looking to party, do your research. I chose this place over the Wynn as I did not want to be hanging around with drunk forty-somethings. -Good food. Pink Taco was great for pre-evening drinks and food - Mr Luckys is awesome for late night munching. -Pool is beautiful and loads of fun. -Good Poker room but Caesars is better. CONS (Sort of) -Rehab. In comparison to Wet Republic and Encore Beach Club, a bit of a let down. Too many idiots as opposed to those looking to have fun. I prefer a bit more of an upmarket pool party. -Distance from the Strip. But this is not really a con. Again I did my research and being lazy I cab everywhere, so didn\u2019t make any difference to me. And do people really walk from casino to casino on the Strip? It takes 20 minutes!! Yes the queue for cabs on a weekend can be long. But we would walk up to the guy, nice word and a $20 bill and we\u2019d be first in line. Vegas is a service industry and was built on tipping! OVERALL We booked this place for Rehab but turned out that was the only disappointment. Yes, it doesn\u2019t have the luxury and attention to detail as a Wynn/Encore. But if you wanted that, stay there. With regards to the service here, although we didn\u2019t get poor service, I can understand how it can be surly at times. The difference between this place and eg the Encore is that the Encore will treat you like a king whether you\u2019re a high roller or a nobody. So, a couple of pieces of advice. If you want something, or not happy with something, do it with a smile and a bit of banter. People can be a lot more forthcoming. And also \u2013 tip!! I\u2019m a Brit and not used to the tipping culture, but know that a few dollars here and there adds up to a much more memorable stay. This is the most fun you can have in Vegas with your clothes on. Love the rock music, the d\u00e9cor and the people \u2013 Vegas as it should be. I understand however it may not be to everyone\u2019s taste, but please, please, please do your research \u2013 this is a party hotel.

The pool is absolutely spectacular if a little packed especially on Sunday afternoons when there is a pool party called Rehab and everyone in Vegas seems to turn up! The only downside to this hotel is it is not on the strip although everything you could want is catered for so it is not really a problem. Also there is a free shuttle bus going back and forth to the strip until 6pm so you can easily check out what's going on elsewhere.

Afterwards, you can decide if you want to stay there or not. START HERE: If you are over 45, you should probably turn around and check in somewhere else. Not to say older people won't enjoy this hotel, because there were totally older people having a great time. However, this place is made for people 21-40. People who are old and wise will probably not enjoy this hotel very much. Unless you're a 45+ man who likes to oogle 21 year old girls. Then you may like it. YOUR ROOM: Your room will be awesome. Stay in the Paradise tower and you will probably get a great view of the pool. (You can watch the drunken lushes from your window! Bonus!) It's decorated very hip and the beds are super comfy. Nice rain shower, down comforter beds, flat screen TVs and an area to set up your own bar-- awesome! THE STAFF: The staff will treat you like crap. The bell man, the front desk agent, the managers, the security, ESPECIALLY anyone who works at the pool, will all act like they're doing you a favor by helping you. Give them a crappy $2 tip and send them on your way. This is the price of staying here. Just expect it and move on. The pool staff feels that because they work at one of the best pools in the USA they are entitled to make you feel like you're worthless (double this if you're a guy that doesn't have money.) THE POOL: is AMAZING! If you're a girl, you need to be dressed up. Yes, I can't believe I just said that, but it's so true. Don't come wearing your stretched out bathing suit with a skirt. The girls at this pool all haven't eaten in a week and they are ready to show off their hard-earned bodies. You need to look good! If you're a guy, it helps to look good but it helps even more to have money. Even if you have money, they'll still treat you kind of bad, but it's likely that you'll get a lapdance in the lazy river pool. (It's true, I saw two girls doing this.) The girls here get crazy. They can't wait to show off their new fake boobs. You will like it. You will like it A LOT! The best pool is up at the Sky Bar. It has a glass wall so everyone on the beach below can see you. (If you want to see girls flash, sit right below that and wait like 2 minutes.) I had the best day here! There's even a water slide!!! THE CASINO: They have lots of fun slot machines (not the confusing kind, the fun ones with the cartoon animals and stuff). Their tables even have suprisingly low minimums, even on a Saturday. (I played $5 roulette on Sun!) THE FOOD: Pink Taco is yummy and the staff is among the friendliest people in the entire hotel. That's the only place I eat when I come here. THE LOCATION: Is kind of crappy but you don't have to leave. The hotel is an EXPERIENCE. They have everything you need to have a great party trip right in the hotel. It's 2 miles or so from the strip, and the cab line to leave Hard Rock on a weekend is INSANELY LONG. (Slip the valet a hund-o and you will have no problem getting one though!) Don't forget to ask about the free shuttle that runs to the Strip till 6. The driver will treat you bad, but hey...free is free. YOUR WALLET: Will be totally empty when you leave.

I stayed there in April and had a few issues, which I brought to the hotel's attention and this trip was like night and day to my other one. I think it was one of the best trips I have ever taken. The highlight of my trip was Rehab, it was so much fun! The crowd was attractive, the music was awesome, drinks were strong, service was great. No problems there at all. I just can't wait until next season so that I can go back. I ate at Johnny Smalls, Nobu, Pink Taco, Starbucks, Beach Club, Juice Bar and Espumoso. Food and service at all of them was outstanding. Prices were good. Johnny Smalls was definitely my favourite, the food and service were both amazing. I will definitely be returning. The people who complain about the pool scene at the Hard Rock obviously didn't do their research before they booked. It's definitely a party atmosphere, which is what I was looking for. The pool area is beautiful, the crowd is fun, drinks are strong, staff are friendly and good looking, this is by far the best pool I have ever been to. Also, I found security to be really nice and friendly, I'm not sure who the people in previous reviews dealt with but it was clearly not the people I saw. I shopped at the Hard Rock store, sundries store, Love Jones and the Rock Spa. All of them again were great service, good prices and I would shop there again. I checked in/out through their VIP lounge and it was a great experience. The staff was friendly and answered any questions I had. They followed up with me throughout the trip to make sure everything was fine, which was appreciated, even though I had no issues at all. We had a corner king room in the Paradise Tower with a view of the Rehab pool. Nothing to complain about at all, the room was beautiful, bed was extremely comfortable (I didn't want to go home to my bed) and the room and bathroom were spotless at all times. The TV has an awesome selection of music channels to listen to while you get ready and there's also an iPod dock in the room. Next time I will most likely try the HRH Tower since I've stayed in the Paradise Tower twice now. I spent more time in the casino this trip than I normally do, but when the casino looks that great, and is that fun, it's hard not to spend time there. Drinks service was fast and the CW's came around often. Vanity was fun and a really nice club. I'm starting to really like the location of the Hard Rock. I like how it's off the strip, it gives the hotel a completely different vibe to the on strip hotels. It's like it's your own private oasis away from everything. Cab to Miracle Mile was around $9, cab to Palms was around $15, or it's around a 15 minute walk to the strip. You can't beat the crowd at the Hard Rock. This is where the best looking people in Vegas all hang out. I travel to Vegas 3-4 times per year and I won't even consider another hotel after this one.

No, not Rhab (yikes!), but the during-the-week, lots of places to sit with some shade, beach entry, lazy river, relatively uncrowded pool. Guess what -- the pool area is GREAT when the crowds have moved off elsewhere to party -- we had no trouble finding shady chairs, even at 11:00 A.M. The only drawback of the pool area is the high prices for drinks, etc. With a little less greed on the pricing, I'm guessing they could triple their sales. Bonus -- the new HRH (suites) Tower is terrific. Easy self park, easy stroll to the front desk with luggage, and then off to the elevators. The infamous indifferent service (widely reported here) was not in evidence when we checked in -- very smooth, pleasant, quick, and efficient, including detailing all those annoying resort, wi-fi, and other charges. The indifference only emerged later (after a shift change) when we stopped by the desk to ask a question about what times different parts of the pool area were open (e.g, vs. being scrubbed down from Rehab) -- then we got the \"what planet are you from?\" look and no information or helpful answer. All the extra charges are one of the reasons we don't give the HRH 5 stars -- perhaps the most telling is the required security deposit \"In case you break anything\" -- which presupposes that customers are positioned to be potential adversaries of the hotel (think frat boys throwing furniture out the windows) vs. valued guests. Hmmm, that's different. The only other major complaint we had was the temperature. True, the outside temperature was 112, but our room and the area of the Hard Rock casino itself adjacent to the new tower were the only interior areas in Las Vegas where we felt too warm over the next several days. Two phone calls to the front desk finally got our room temp to a point where we could consider sleeping by bedtime. In 3 days, with the AC cranking full blast all the time, it never got close to being too chilly. Don't know whether it's something that needs to be fixed or whether they're just conserving electricity $$, but if so, they should know that we took ourselves and our eating and gambling $$ to other properties during the day just to stay cooler. Rooms in the new HRH tower are fabulous. The beds are really comfortable (and back supporting!). The bath has 2 sinks and a HUGE shower and separate soaking tub. (There is a privacy curtain that can be drawn across the glass fronted bathroom -- too bad this oblivious member of our party didn't find it for a while.) The architectural planning may have missed the mark a bit, though, as one side of the tower faces the pool, and the other (virtually 1/2 the rooms) look straight at the parking garage. Oh well, there was a fun view of the strip from the parking garage . . . There are some great restaurant choices at HardRock -- Johnny Smalls had inventive, tasty small plates (but plan ahead, it's closed Monday and Tuesday). Mr Lucky had tasty and more interesting fare than most casinos' cafe style restaurant choices. The people watching? Well, it can be pretty entertaining, occasionally even jaw dropping -- think of it as free entertainment. The size of the rooms (suites, really, in the HRH Tower) is way more than 2 people need (unless you can't agree which tv program to watch on the giant flatscreens). Next time, I would probably opt for the Paradise Tower, and hope that it has some of the same comfort, luxurious fittings, and convenience of the HRH Tower, but with cooler temperatures in the rooms, halls, and common areas.

I did go to the pool, and it was great. Very large, drinks are a little expensive, but they are that way at every pool in Vegas.

I thought the rooms were decorated well and the bed was super soft. Once leaving my room for the first time, my experience went drastically downhill. First, it is quite far from everything else and getting a taxi took forever. The casino had very limited variety of slot machines. You will never get a drink while playing slots either. There is a foul, rancid smell everywhere around the hotel. I had read about their fabulous pool and was excited to check it out. This is where my experience went from so so to I will never return. We were never informed of their strict policy for pool access. We were greeted by several security guards and detection wands. A rent a cop went through my bag and began removing all the items that were not allowed, again, we were never informed of banned items. She then proceeded to accuse me of smuggling drugs to the pool, which actually was a breath mint. I tried to explain this and in the most sarcastic, rude way said \"sure that's a mint\" and then yelled at me not to touch anything. I also has a push pin in my bag that was left in there after I presented a professional poster at a conference earlier in the week, which according to her I planned to use to stab someone's eye out with. I returned to my room to discard all of my banned items ( breath mint, hand sanitizer, bobby pin, small vile of body splash, and the deadly push pin ). In the elevator back down, an employee asked if I were enjoying my stay. I reply that I was until the lady at the pool accused me of being a drug smuggler and push pin eye poker outer. He only laughed, no apology for this lack of respect, kindness, and courtesy. When waiting in line to go back through the security gate that is nearly as intense as the airport, I witnessed the same woman yelling at a man for proceeding in line without her permission \" back up mothrtf***er, get the f*** back.\" He also had done nothing to deserve this treatment. I was so appalled that I only went on outside to find my boyfriend and tell him we were returning to the room. In my short 3 minutes outside by the pool, I somehow got a piece of glass in my foot while wearing flip flops. After all that tight security and never ending list of banned items (glass included), how did I get a piece of glass in my foot??? I guess the power tripped rent a cop missed that item. On my return to the room, the same employee from the elevator laughed at me again and made jokes with other employees.

I loved the building: it is a very cool atmosphere with lots of memorabilia to look at. We were there four days and did not see it all. The beds are very comfortable and the room was amazing, but it wasn't all great. The room was missing simple amenities that you almost take for granted even if you stay at the Super 8. For example, there is no fridge (unless you pay extra), and there is no coffee maker. Simple things, but their absence is very noticeable, especially after recovering from a long day on the strip. That brings me to the next point. The strip is over a mile away which is a long walk in the hot sun, or a 7 - 10 dollar cab ride each time. Although HRH advertises a shuttle, it only runs from 10AM til 5PM, and only once an hour, and you usually can't get on it anyway because it only seats 5 people. They also refuse to make a second trip if you are the sixth person. My biggest complaint was with the pools. They are great, but only open until 6PM. It is still 100 degrees outside and you can't even go for a swim. We asked the pool manager why, and in his smug manner told us that that is the way it is in LV and you can't expect any hotel to open their pool longer. We asked every other resort on the strip (minus a couple we missed) and found only one other that closes that early (but they opened 2 hours earlier). He told us lies like we have to close early so that people don't get too drunk around the water, yet in order to be allowed a chair at the other pool you have to commit to buy 200 dollars worth of booze. This complete lack of service costs you an extra 16.80 a day. I highly recommend that you go see the facilities when in Vegas, but choose a hotel that will offer you better services or you will leave disappointed like we did.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat guys trip, some issues.\u201d", "Author": "BurghTripper", "ReviewID": "UR72556166", "Content": "The Hard Rock is really a unique experience apart from the other resort casinos in Vegas. 3 male friends and I(all 29-30) stayed there Fri-Mon recently, and we had an awesome time and most likely would stay there again. Above all else, the Hard Rock is about atmosphere and it truly delivers in that regard. Whereas other casinos try to one up each other in elegance or luxury or bright lights, the HR is dark, cool, and sexy. It is off strip, but then it's not entirely like any on-strip hotels anyway; the crowd it caters to is most likely happy to avoid the strip crowd. In other words, stay away, grandpa. Service: There are a lot of complaints about the service at the HR on this site, and for the most part my friends and I didn't have any problems. At check-in we were told we'd been upgraded from mountain view to pool view in the casino tower - happy for me, but not so much for my roomie with a sleep disorder who had problems with the noise. No prob - I called down to the front desk and explained the issue, and we were moved to mountain side and a bit higher. Bellman came up in 15 min(which is actually quite fast considering what the line in registration was downstairs) to give us keys and help us move. Very satisfied. Good bell service the morning I left, too. My other friends, however, did have(and have ongoing) a service issue considering over-charges to his credit card. Upon arrival at the main pool Saturday, we dropped our stuff on a chair, only to be told it was $100 per chair. This is apparently new, as we didn't have that problem last year. Don't know, it could be a weekend thing. Either way, we were offered a daybed for a $500 food/bev minimum- a good deal for a group of four considering we'd spend close to that anyway with their prices. However, my buddy's card was charged $500 three times. We figured once was the actual bill, since it wasn't $500 even, once was a hold that would eventually go away. The other still hasn't been resolved as of today(we left yesterday) and my friend has felt the hotel is giving him the runaround with it. He said the guy he's talking to is named Michael Fuller - didn't catch the title. So Mike, get this fixed and we'll come back. Don't, and we can't, on principle alone. Can't speak much for the restaurants, we only ate at Mr. Lucky's for breakfast - good stuff. The pools are awesome - the Rehab pool is the best day party in Vegas, and the beach club pool is a nice change of pace if you're not ready it hit the day so hard after a rough night. Both have blackjack tables, but the beach club's weren't open when we were there Sunday - cmon guys, don't you want to take my money? I LOVE the casino - smaller, but the best vibe in LV. No annoying slot machine chatter in the background, just great rock music, keeps the adrenaline up. The main circle is more the upbeat casino, and the expansion has a quieter vibe if that's your thing. One problem - guys, put a cashier in the main round, I can't walk a mile to the back with all drinks you serve me. We hit a lot of different casinos and I'd say they had some of the strongest drinks, so tip your waitresses fellas. Rooms were awesome, both the Casino Tower ones we were in and the Paradise Tower one my friends stayed in - good lord are the beds comfortable! Tips - if you want to hit the strip(and you should), cab it over to Planet Hollywood. Short ride, best place to start for easy access to all the big casinos, and also probably the closest match to the vibe at the Hard Rock.

Everything worked ok, staff was a bit rude but the atmosphere was good... The true service mindset of the staff was revealed when there were money stolen from my room. tl;dr-> Cleaning staff woke me up because had forgotten to put \"tied up\" sign to my door. I clearly told the lady that \"No cleaning today\". She answered ok and I woke up few hours later. Headed to the pool to see my colleague and left my wallet to my jeans' pocket, took $100 with me and counted the money, $724 was there when I left. When I came back an hour later, there were two cleaners inside my room, my wallet was on the bed and I immideately knew something was going on. I told the cleaners to stay put, checked my wallet and 224$ was missing. I had a $500 ATM receipt in my wallet and the one responsible probably thought that I'd have no evidence then. Called the security immideately and waited for them to show up. When the security came up to my room, filled an voluntary statement and when asking why they let the cleaning staff go, I was told that everything would be taken care of and I'd get a call back in an hour. After an hour, nothing. The next day, I went to the security podium and asked for any updates. The lady there said it takes 24 hours to sort everything out and while I had 8 nights left in my stay @ HRH, I was fine with it. The next day at the podium, I was told that it takes 2-3 days to investigate, and still no info. 4 days later I got pissed to the same lady who told me that it takes 5-7 days to sort everything out. I demanded to see the supervisor only to find out that I'd been lied to. Supposably nothing happens before you call Security & Risk management office. So I did, the very next business day. Elene Boyt was not at the office, so I dealt with Sonia Monahan, Security & Risk Management Investigator. She told me that she'd sort everything out, and I told her I was in hurry with only 2 days left before flying back home. She said it takes an hour and I could reach her from her office until 5:30pm. I called 3:30, 4:00 and 5:15, no answer. I left her a voicemail that I'd need all the documentation about the \"investigation\" to take back home, and would take this issue to police. It's only 200$ but FFS this is about a principle. You just can't treat people like this. When checking out 5am last Wednesday, there were no documentation at the front desk. Called the security again and they promised to take a copy of the voluntary statement and bring it down to the lobby in 5 minutes, maximum. Waited for 10 more and had to take a cab to the airport. Left my email to the reception and the girl on duty promised to email me a copy of the statement. Still nothing. Have been dealing with 10+ people, have been lied to as many times and NOTHING has been done to solve this issue. Have to say I'm disappointed to say the least. In my humble opinion and based on a two-week stay \u20ac HRH, the words \"service\" or \"customer\" means nothing to HRH staff. I will not ever stay at HRH again, and would strongly advice others to find another hotel as well.

This place is wonderful. It may not be tamed for everyone but if you are here to party enjoylife and have fun than the Hard Rock is for you. Where else would you want to be after all this is Sin City where pretty much anything goes. Location: Off strip but hey if you been to Vegas Enough times it really doesnt matter if your on the strip or off it. Some of there rooms offer an excellent view of the strip but yes like all other hotels there maybe a fee increase. Parking: Very convenient. Depending on which Tower you are in there is a garage for each one. The only one that doesnt have its own garage is the actually casino tower. But you can decide between HRH All suite Tower or the Paradise Tower parking garage. Checkin: When I have checked in i have not dealed with lines. Usually checkin midday if rooms are ready or late evening same applys for checkin each tower has its own checkin desk. Rooms: Fantastic. HRH all suite Towers are perfect. Where else can you find a place that has a built in soundbar system and you can select from a variety of music. Dont forget your ipod cause you can play your music on it too. plush bedding and a seperate living room with semi sectional couch. HUGE bathroom and shower with soaking tube. Plenty of room to store your belongings. Cant say much for the other two towers in the Hard Rock but everything is there for you on there website. casino: Love the expansion. very open with a smooth flow so there is no traffic. there are two wonderful main bars with generous sitting. plentiful of games and of course the poker room. Food: Mr.Luckys is a good sit down diner. I would recommend the french toast for breakfast. they also have other menu items to choose from like your ihop or dennys but my opinion it tastes better here at Mr.Luckys and its 24/7. Another place AGO all i can say is WOW. I had the Veal there and its was like butter. So soft and the portion was very generous. Waiters are very kind and service is great. club: Vanity is not your giant las vegas club but it is very spacious. With Dj ericdlux spinning. the dance floor is nice and has a gigantic multi colored chandlier . Note: make sure you stay in the HRH all suite tower. pool: Well what can i say about the pool. Hard Rock Hotel invented REHAB. and now all other Hotels are trying to top it. Not going to happen. They can continue to play second fiddle. fitness/spa: i didnt use it but it looked failry large when i passed by. the spa didnt go but went around the lobby area of it looked very nice. concierge: one word well two. Esteban Rey. This the best of the best. Very helpful and kind. I wont say much. Ill let you find out for yourself. Overall: The rates at Hard Rock are very generous. If your lucky you can catch on too one of there many deals when they have twitter tuesday. other than that the hotels website offers some very generous offers. And for being a 4 star hotel the rates you get are very reasonable. Or become a member of the rockstarclub where you can get even better deals. I am glad i became a member. All in all this places really Rocks with different concerts happening every week or some type of event you will be more than glad when you have stayed at the ROCK.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "champaign", "Title": "\u201cWARN ME NEXT TIME YOU REMODEL\u201d", "Author": "daleChampaign", "ReviewID": "UR70922804", "Content": "What a let down - walked into the hard rock hotel - and 90% of the gaming floor was torn down.

The beds were excellent, the shower had great water pressure, the room was quite spacious and the entire vibe of the hotel/casino was right up my alley. I also liked the fact the the hotel is not on the strip. There was a CVS across the street and several restaurants so it was nice to be able to cross the street and eat at a restaurant that isn't busy when you aren't in the mood to be surrounded by crowds of people. The pool area was beautiful and I definitely would have liked to spend more time just laying around out there but time flies. However, we did have some problems..... (1) When we checked in, we were told that the room we paid for (Paradise Tower) wasn't available but that they had a room in the Casino Tower available. We said that that would work for us but when I asked about getting a refund since the Paradise Tower is an upgrade from the Casino Tower, I was told that since we booked through a 3rd party, a refund could not be issued for the price difference. (2) We then asked the same person for directions to the Premium Outlet Mall. She proceeded to print out a map and directions using Google Map. I thought this was incredibly helpful but when we got to our room, we realized that the directions were actually from Las Vegas to an outlet mall in South Carolina! Needless to say, this wasn't helpful and was quite ridiculous. (3) Our room appeared as though it hadn't been vacuumed in quite some time. There were cherry pits, seeds, fruit stickers, twist ties, clothing tags, etc. all over the floor. (4) When we complained about the messiness and lack of a price adjustment, we were told that we would get a discount rate on our current room; however, upon checkout, we did not receive any refund (we did have to pay the $16/night resort fee, though). (5) One other strange thing... when we were going up to our room after a trip to CVS to buy some things, the guy standing at the elevator told us that he had to search our bags to make sure that we weren't bringing up a 26 oz. of liquor. He told us that we were only allowed to bring a case of beer and a mickey of hard liquor. ??? So yes, we had issues with certain things but I liked the location, I liked the atmosphere, and I liked the room (if it would have been vacuumed, that would have been nice.) Some staff were great - when our a/c broke, it was repaired within the hour and the guy that checked us out was very polite and accommodating but at that point, the damage was done.

She said that it was fine and we just need to go pick it up in the business center. When we went to pick it up, they charged us $9! What for? Oh, to sign for it. -When we checked into the hotel, the woman checking us in asked for a credit card and said that they wouldn't accept debit cards. She said \u201cif you didn't like it, then you can leave and go somewhere else.\u201d Then we're told that it's going to be $100 per night held on our card IN CASE WE BREAK THINGS! -Upon getting to our room, we saw that shampoo and conditioner were $24 EACH, and not included with the room! -We were told by the bell desk that the hours of the shuttle were 10am-6pm, and the driver confirmed this. They only go once per hour on the hour, and they only go to the fashion show mall. -We ended up leaving the Siegfried and Roy\u2019s Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat early to make it to the last shuttle back to the hotel. We showed up, but it didn\u2019t come. I called the hotel and was told that the last run was at 5pm. I told her that we were told twice that it was from 10-6, she just said that there was nothing she could do. We ended up getting a cab back to the hotel ($12). -On day 2, we were woken up at 6:30 by the crew out by the pool using a leaf blower. I called the front desk and she said that there was nothing they could do about it. Never mind that the paper thin walls had allowed us to hear everyone partying until the wee hours of the morning and we were now up at 6:30, there was nothing she could do and she honestly didn\u2019t care. -That night, we asked about the shuttle, just so we could clear it up. Once again, we were told the hours were 10am-6pm. When I explained the issue we had the night before, the bell man acted like I was stupid. He said that of course there wasn\u2019t a shuttle at 6pm, the guy who drives the shuttle is off work at 6pm! So when they say that it runs from 10am-6pm, they mean that there are shuttles from 10am-5pm. How stupid of me to not understand that! -On day three, (after being woken up at 6:30 by the leaf blower again) we spent the morning on the strip and later went down to the pool. The woman handing out towels was irritated that we interrupted her conversation with her cute male co-worker and all but threw the towels at us. There weren\u2019t any lounge chairs available at the first pool area, so we went up to the second area with these big white cushioned ottomans and sat down. We were then kicked out because they have a $100 minimum and we hadn\u2019t reserved it. There was nothing to indicate that we needed a reservation (it wasn\u2019t a cabana). We ended up going over to the back pool and hung out there for a few hours. There was a cocktail waitress over there with long black hair that was working her butt off and very nice. Didn\u2019t see her very often and drinks took forever to get to us, but that was because the other girls working that pool weren\u2019t doing anything but flirting with the cute male guests. -That evening, we went back to the hotel and called the front desk to ask about the dress code for Skybar. It was about 10:50 when we called. The woman explained the dress code, and we headed down to have a few drinks. When we showed up, it was closed. Turns out, the hours are from 6-11pm. The book in the hotel room is so old that it doesn\u2019t even list Skybar, and the woman at the front desk didn\u2019t think to mention that it was closing in 10 minutes. -We ended up going to the lounge by the poker room. It took a while to get the bartender\u2019s attention. Not because it was busy, but because he was preoccupied with his conversation with the cocktail waitress. He kept looking over at me, but continued to chat it up with his co-worker. -On the last day, we packed up our things, and went down to the front desk where we discovered that we had been charged almost $100 for the mini bar, even though we didn\u2019t take a single thing. Turns out, it\u2019s all on a weight system and if you even look through the mini fridge to see what there is, you\u2019re charged for everything you move. -We were also charged $15 per day plus tax for their \u201cresort fee\u201d which apparently covers valet parking, self parking, the shuttle, access to the gym, towels for the pool, and the phone in the room. That seems a little steep considering we used 2 towels, and rode the shuttle 3 times. -We still had 7 hours until our flight, so we headed out to catch the first shuttle to the strip at 10am. It never came. The old outdated shuttle had broken down and so we were stuck sitting there unless we wanted to pay for a cab.

Our first set of keys didn't work so we called to the front desk. After two hours, three different keys had been sent up and engineering had examined the lock with no answers. We were let into the room but our keys still didn't work. The view from our room was of a rooftop that was full of garbage and cigarette butts. We complained at the front desk and requested that they just switch our room because we had already wasted two hours.

A friend of mine living in Vegas came to lay at the pool with us for the day and had to pay $100 for a wrist band just to lay at the pool...for ONE day!! We all had complimentary wristbands with our paid hotel room but if we lost them, HRH staff said they were not replaceable. We arrived at the pool the first morning to find only two chairs open but there were five of us. The pool staff would not allow us to share the chairs and basically forced us to pay for a mattress if we wanted to stay...at our own hotel pool. We had to pay $150 for it and drinks were an additional $25 a piece. The expense took away from any enjoyment we may have had that day. In addition, when we checked out, we were informed of a $20 per day charge per room for a supposed \"shuttle\" to and from the strip. We never saw this shuttle and there was always a long line for taxi cabs. Overall, the hotel was clean and nice in the new tower. The pool was beautiful but also not worth the money.

The room looked like a bachelor pad, very cold and clinical with lots of black furniture, black and white carpet and a giant television. The room could have been in any hotel anywhere in the world, the only way you would have known it to be HR was the token framed Beatles picture on the wall. There was a tray of leftovers outside our door when we arrived and it stayed there for at least 24 hours. The stacked full of items from toiletries to food and drink - all of which had price tags on and the mini bar was weight sensored. It made you scared to touch anything and you felt the hard sell, not the hard rock magic. If you want to stay in Vegas there are FAR better hotels. Hard Rock, if you're reading this and actually care, then remove the resort fee which just starts the vacation with a very bad taste (it's a hidden charge to pay to maintain the facilities, even though you have to pay to use them anyway - it's just another way to make money and isn't welcomed) and get your check in staff to check people in and show they care. It was cold and clinical with sarcasm.

I have been to Vegas 5 times prior in the last three years and this was the first time I have ever been so disappointed in an establishment. For starters, staff workers were rude and nasty. Secondly, the rooms were no better than a motel. Granted the \"theme\" was a nicer but overall not worth the amount we spent. We called for towels and toilet tissue but they never showed. I ended up taking them from a cart myself. The water pressure was HIDEOUS. I had to fill up the tub an hour in advance JUST so I can feel clean. The rugs were worn and musty. Then to add insult to injury, prior to us booking we were told as hotel guests we would be receive some sort of discount if we attend the Rehab party. Bulls**t! The minute we arrive we are told there is no such \"deal\" for guests and not onlydo we have to pay $100 to get in but it was the same price for outside guests as well. WTF is the perk then???? The hotel is not on the strip, therefore you have to cab it (its walkable but who wants to do that in 4 inch pumps?) Oh God, even the food there sucked! All and all we made the best of it but when a cab driver tells you \"no one ever stays at the hard rock after their first experience\" then you know its not just you being picky. Lesson learned. I will never stray from my favorite hotels again. Shame one you HRH!!!! The one good thing I will say about this place was that Rehab ROCKED and it was the best $100 I ever spent for a dance fest.

He scoffed and pointed to the desk. Thank, I guess. Went to check in and we were told that the only rooms they had available were on the 3rd floor or we could pay an extra $60 or so and upgrade to a pool view room. We asked what the deal was with the 3rd floor, if it was loud or what the view was like. We were told it was fine but that some people \"just like to be up higher.\" We decided to go with the 3rd floor room only to find out you are staring directly into a parking garage and we were roof level of the hotel. Not happening. We really wanted to get out into the pool so we decided to just pay a little extra and upgrade to the pool view room. We got up there and it was a handicapped room and it also just wasn't as nice as the original room we saw. We went back downstairs for the second time to ask to switch rooms and we were told there was nothing else available and we would have to wait. They called 3 hours later and had a room ready. By the way, they were also extremly rude the entire time, no apologies at all. So much for customer service. When we went back to get our room we realized we were back on the city view but were still being charged the pool view room. The girl basically said she never saw our original rate and there was nothing she could do. We asked to have a manager call us and they never did. We got to our room and I will say the rooms are really nice. The view still sucked but the room was nice. Got out to pool where my bf was padded down and they really, really search your things! They even opened my coin purse and went through his wallet! They did take away my eye drops, aleve, and compact and I did not get them back. I asked what the deal was and they said it would be very easy for me to empty out the bottle of eye drops and refill it with drugs and put it in someone's drink. Right...Had an $18 margarita served by a rude waitress and then inquired about getting a cabana. $2500 and they are tiny, the beds were $500 and it was already 2pm. What a joke. Casino was fun, room service was sub par and the pizza was cold by the time we got it and made both of us pretty ill. Called again to ask to speak to a manager and again, no one ever called back. Only got housekeeping one day even though we put the sign on our door every day. The day they did come they knocked once and walked in without annoucing themselves at 9am. The icing on the cake was when I was in the bathroom at 7pm getting ready and a man came in to our room to \"check the minibar.\" If he knocked, I never heard him because the TV was on and the water was running. Usually if the staff knocks on your door and sees the TV on and hears the water running they would leave the room. Not him. He decided to round the corner looked into the bathroom where I was naked and annouced that he was checking the mini bar and would come back later. I obviously totally freaked out and threw a towell on and looked out the peep hole to see if he was there and if he actually did work at the hotel, he was out there with a cart. I locked the door and called security, who never came up to my room and came to speak to me. UNACCEPTABLE. After that one of the lights in the bathroom broke and we called for maintenance but guess what? They never came and it never got fixed. Service is beyond terrible, probably the worst I've ever had in Vegas or quite possibly at any hotel. I would call the manager to complain but I'm pretty sure he doesn't exist.

Pulled up to valet on a busy saturday afternoon and it was a slight wait to get the rental car and baggage situated. Less than a 5 min wait at registration. The room I'd specified was ready, a pleasant surprise - normally just a bit of a wait while they clean it. Desk clerk very pleasant and went to bat for me when I pointed out the discrepancy between current resort fee ($15) vs when I'd reserved in February ($7). With tax approximately $50 difference over the 6 nights and the clerk's manager said they'd honor my $7 fee at checkout. I'd specified Casino Tower, \"new tower\" (circa 2000 expansion), high floor. Exactly what I got, 10th floor under the penthouse. Second to last room on the hallway so no noisy partiers going by my room but a hike to the ice machine and elevator. Preferred the peace and quiet so no problem. Only noise was them moving some furniture above me in Penthouse on Saturday night. I stayed in Paradise Tower in August and found it too dark for my tastes. They've redecorated the casino tower, new furniture, patterned carpet and wallpaper and painted a lot of the former beige trim a dark brown. So the Casino tower now resembles the Paradise to some extent but it's still lighter and brighter and has the french doors that open. Weather was overall on the cool side while there and I turned off the AC and opened the doors quite a bit. Did my usual Pink Taco happy hour and steak and shrimp special at Mr. Lucky's. The new tapas place, Johnny Smalls, is a great addition and did that twice. Only gambled once but had one of my best sessions all time at blackjack. Sunday passed on Rehab and did the new West pool. Really nice, includes another casino, bar, table service, with SKYBAR above. Went to that pool three other days. Great service by waitresses Elicia and Stephanie. Chairs hard to come by but not too bad around 3 pm, otherwise get there before 11 am. Most weekdays they had both the West and South pools open with the North (Rehab) pool closed. Wednesday only the West was open for some reason, perhaps they were expecting poorer weather/turnout and it was too congested. Weekdays daytime they only had table games open in the new casino (and the pool), nothing happening in the original casino. Kind of sad. My sense is that the overbuilt, the business increase hasn't matched the expanded capacity. Even Saturday the overall casino space was far from packed. I'm well above the typical Hard Rock demographic but as always found the personnel and fellow guests pleasant and friendly. At checkout the desk clerk took care of that resort fee mentioned, it was quite a bit of work for her as she had to do each day individually but very pleasant and no complaints. There was one bogus minibar item for ~$8 and that was taken off with no problems.

Entering room i noticed it had two double beds and told bell hop that we had requested one king, he was very nice and called guest service and they said to check in now they could upgrade me to pool view for an extra 100 per night. After traveling 7 hrs i said to heck with it and took that room. Dropped our bags and went down to grab something at lucky 24/7's. Food was sub par we have cruised and had much better food and for beer, chicken ceasar salad and a couple soups I thought 35 was hign wow.. After lunch we went to check out on of the main reasons we booked this hotel other than the concert only to find 1 out of the three pools open (west pool) the security person was nice enought to walk us over and found it to be un croweded grabbed a couple chairs and relaxed. Beer ($7) Mixed (11) or (18) depending on size. Keep in mind we found out later this was the least expensive pool bar they have by a couple dollars per drink. You cannot take drinks out to pool from hotel btw. For dinner we went to pink taco and that was just ok mexican and priced a little more than lunch for two think around (50) After dinner headed to tables which I found to play very well compared to other strip hotels but maybe I was just lucky.

Everything to eat is very expensive, and the staff at the resteraunts could teach rudeness, but the real scam begins when you go to the pool, first we got searched again so we could not bring in food or drink, even if its purchased at the hotel, with pat downs by overzealous and rude security staff. the charges at the pool are outrageous, a single drink is $20, food is likewise double the normal price, the wait staff at the pool are as rude and obnoxious as possible, and all of our party had to hunt down managers just to get food we had already paid for. They are always switching staff, or closing shifts, etc, so they have to close your tab, before you receive your food and drink, and then half the time we didnt get the food or drink or got the wrong order. Finding a manager was useless, as they promised to find the wait staff, and then they disappear also. If you want a water at the pool, it will run you $6 for a 5 oz bottle. Once you get the bill, the real nightmare begins, with a room deposit of $100 a night in addition to your room fee, plus some fee of amentities, plus charges for things from the mini bar, which we didnt touch, but once youve checked out theres no way to go back and verify inventory. there was no one in our party who wasnt hit with the mini bar fees. Weve been back home 10 days, and are still fighting to get back our room \"Deposit\" of $300 Oh and heres a fun one, if you dont actually check out and just leave your hotels key, your charged another $100 dollar for them to check you out without u there. But thats better than checking out late, 1 cpl in our party didnt check out until 12.30 (even though the rooms hadnt been ready until 7 PM when we checked in), they got hit with a $200 fee, thats right... $100 per hour for every minute of an hour your late checking out. Oh, and trying to get into the famous Rehab pool party on Sunday, another $50 per person, even if your staying at the hotel. plus they keep everyone waiting in line for 2 hours to make the event seem exclusive. We went, since it supposed to be such a good experience and they advertised a topless pool, Nope , no topless pool, No thongs, no bathing suit too sexy. and no lewd or playful behavior, I was stopped from cuddeling with my husband from the security goon who threatened my husband. The party is a big scam, heavily advertised, but it seems like everyone is standing around waiting for the party, If your a girl, your in luck because there are some buff guys there, about 10 boys for every girl. So girls can expect a lot of verbal attention, even if its its not wanted. Pick another hotel, and save yourself the grief. Even by Vegas standards, you will be gouged at every turn. Besides hotel and eating (2700 for three days) , and 19 drinks over three days- $472, we were lucky to only have to pay extra and hidden charges of $583. Why are we lucky, some people showed us their extra charges of just under a 1000.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lafayette, CA", "Title": "\u201cAn Exasperating Experience\u201d", "Author": "Ruby84", "ReviewID": "UR64085828", "Content": "Our room was filthy upon check in.

The room wasnt ready until 6 Pm, and we had to fight with the staff to get the room we booked. Then when we tried to take our luggage to our room, they actually had a goon at the elevators search our luggage to prevent us from taking any food or drink to our room. Thier response was that they were trying to prevent parties in the rooms, im not sure how bringing soda and food would induce a party, or why a hotel which bills itself as a party hotel would deny us having guests in our room. but they did, we complained that this was illegal, and they threatened to throw us out of the hotel with no refund. they finally relented on beer and soda, but not food or our own licqour The wait for everything is horrible, Mr. luckys cafe was nice and fast, but the Rare 130 steak house is expensive, for very small portions and took 75 minutes to get our food, and this was on a wednesday. Nobu on thursday was the same wait. We went out for other meals, we recommend taking a taxi somewhere else to eat. To get to the pool, they search you, pat you down and dont let you take anything to the pool, my wife couldnt take her compact mirror, a roll of tums in her purse, or aspirin. or any alcohol or food even if you bought it in the hotel, this is to make sure you pay for food and drink at the pool which is incredibly expensive. We ordered drinks and lunch and it took over an hour, and 2 visits with the manager to finally get our food. 2 lunches and 4 drinks was $160 plus tip and tax. the wait staff at the pool are just stupid, the next day (thursday) they put someone elses food and drink on our tab, and after waiting almost 2 hours, they still couldnt find a manager to fix our bill. we were leaving on a sunday, but on weekends the pool is a ZOO, dont bother, even if your staying at the hotel. On saturday, the staff is disorganized, rude, and dont make a distinction between hotel guests, and the people coming to party at Rehab at the pool, They treat everyone the same, make them wait and treat them like dirt. We had to fight not to pay twice to get into the pool. When going to night life at the hotel, the security staff is obtrusive and rude, and look for reasons to hassle the guest. We were ordered to move from the bar at the Joint, because a security person thought a waitress might want to get her drinks there, even though there was a waitress stattion 20 feet away. We watched the same thing happen several times until a manager was called and told the security person to back off. Ridiculous. Some bright spots, the Spa, still very nice, gym is small but adequate.

I dont even know where to start with this. The employees there are really snobby. Not friendly at all. I guess that some famous people stay there, they think that this is okay. I really could care less about famous people. They really dont have a great selection of food there, Pink Taco is okay, and lucky 7 is where I ate, Lucky 7 is more like not so lucky average Dennys food. The service there sucked too. I will now tell you my story. It all started on Sat night when I was walking into the casino and a Cochroach greeted me on the wall when I opened up the door. Okay, as soon as I walked in there was a young man who just thought it would be okay to snort something up his nose, right there as people were walking in. Interesting. Well I cant forget to tell you that if you have a room facing the pool you will be woken up at 5am by a garden blower as I guess this is when they clean around the pool. There is a famous pool party called Rehab that is fun, but to get in as a guest you must have paid a certian rate on your room to get in for free. If you got your rooms for a really good rate you will pay 50 dollars to get in to pool on Sun, and wait in a long line. If you dont feel like waiting it will be 100 dollars. So you have a friend staying with you well dont add them to the room,unless a spouse. If it is a third person it will be $100 dollars more a night. Im not kidding. So we decided to eat dinner at PF Changs which is walking distance from the hotel, there are symbols as light fixtures all down the hallways which everybody tings and tangs all night long. Yes we ting and tanged the symbol, as we got to elevator we were harassed by a security gaurd telling us that we had destroyed property. We were very confused, long story short they threatend that they were going to kick us out, for a burned out light bulb behind one of the symbols.We were going to have to pay for the light bulb. I know it sounds like im crazy, i was tripping. He said he heard us break the symbol. People its a symbol on the wall with a light bulb behind it. The light bulb had been out the whole time we were there. It got very intense, at this piont. I called other Hotels to leave because I thought that these security gaurds were on drugs, because remember the guy a the front sniffing stuff up his nose. I am not going to pay alot of money and be herassed for something so insane. After they realized that we were not idiots. We left and ate. I complained to the Manger of The Hard Rock,and she too was in shock about a light bulb,as to the man who worked the front desk telling me he as well bangs on the symbols as he is going down the hall. We were gone for about an hour and guess what, the light bulb was changed in the hall way and wasnt burnt out. We went to bed and again I was woken up at 5am to a garden blower. The older couple who was in the elevator this morning said they were so tired and they have never stayed in such a noisey hotel. The bathroom has no vent in there so be prepared to start coughing from the hot steam, if you have respiratory issues,because of the novent it smelled funny in the bathroom as well. The tub was crooked and thin and I felt as tho I was leaning when taking a shower. The beds are cozy tho,ill give them that. My review in a nut shell, if you dont care about sleeping,want to hang out with snobs,eat average food,not be near the strip, watch people snort ? ,be greeted by cochroaches, and get harassed by security great this is the hotel for you.

Prior to our arrival, we did check out the reviews and we really thought we were prepared for our experience. We knew it was going to be a party atmosphere, but you don't understand what that means until you experience it for yourself. First, let me say that my husband and I are in our 30's and have two young children. We wanted to do nothing, but have a fabulous time....so, here goes! HOTEL DYNAMIC: Guests party all day long. My husband and I immediately noticed how old we felt. As a woman whose had two young children, I was a bit self consious because the \"youngin's\" (as I like to call them) all seemed to have fabulous bodies and implants. There is plenty to do at this property, so you won't be disappointed. It is about 1 mile from the strip, but it is easily walkable. A cab runs about $10. Above all, the hotel staff was SO nice and accommodating. ROOMS: we stayed in the Paradise Tower and the rooms are awesome! Our room had gray walls/carpet with an \"affliction\" type art deco. All of the furniture was black and the bathroom was black tile. Very retro and slick! POOLS: One pool area is used for \"scam/rehab\" and the other pool is for those who prefer a quieter pool experience. The quieter pool is located in the HRH Tower, near the nightclub Vanity. Part of the pool has a normal pool bottom, but the other part has a sandy bottom, which is really, really, cool. The staff was fabulous and try to locate \"Brittany\" as she is sweet as can be. There are plenty of seats around the pool. There are cabanas, too, but rumor has it they run approx. $500. The pool does open at 10am & don't worry about being there right at 10am to get your lounger. It's Vegas, so people trickle in/out all day long. I can honestly say that if there wasn't a quieter pool , I probably wouldn't have liked the HRH. The pool made it the party atmosphere very manageable. REHAB: HRH just started \"scam\" on saturdays and \"rehab\" on sundays. The best way to describe this...is to think of the largest pool party possible and amplify it by 10. Men....you will be patted down and women...your bags, wallets, magazines, will be searched. The security staff needs to control the crowds, so they will make sure nothing \"illegal\" is entering the area. The security staff is so nice, but will take action if they need to! INTERNET: You do have to pay for internet @ $14 day, so there is no reason to travel with a laptop if you don't want to pay for this service. If you have an iphone (like I do), the internet service will be blocked. FOOD/BEVERAGE: We attended a pool-side reception and the chicken parmesan sliders are my new fav! We also ate breakfast every morning at Lucky's 24/7 and the fruit & yogurt parfait is fabulous!!! The oatmeal is awesome, too! Breakfast was approx. $35 with tip (two people.) Overall, I don't think my trip to Vegas would be as memorable without staying at the HRH.

Soon after arriving to the Hardrock Hotel my friends and I decided to head over to the pool and have a grand ol' time. Yet, we were told by secuity that we couldn't go to the pool. We asked the security, why couldn't we go to the pool? He said, that it was close. I asked, why? He said that it was just close. It was ridiculous because the pool was absolutely not close. I then headed back to customer service and told them that I wanted my money back. I wanted to go stay at another hotel, but I was told by the other moron working there that it wouldn't be possible. Ummm so I headed back into a room that was soooooo TINY. Being there made me feel so claustorphobic. Feeling claustorphobic made me just want to get out of the room, and to relieve my anxiety I decided to get a small bite to eat at MR. LUCKy's at the hardrock. They have a menu section at Mr. Lucky's dedicated to just asian type food, but to my dismay 15 minutes into ordering food...... I was told that they didn't have any asian food available.

As an event planner in the NASCAR industry with an extremely large budget, I have never been treated more inappropriately and rude than by the HRH staff. There should have been prior indication of the impact of Rehab on business travelers, prior to making our reservation. I was appalled at the behavior of the Rehab guests, the naked women in the stores with security doing absolutely nothing about it, the sex in the hallways, it was absolutely disgusting. After my initial request to move from the Paradise Tower due to the loud party next door, with a front desk person who insisted on arguing the issue, I was told security would come handle which they never did. I moved two suitcases and backpacks to the front desk, when I was then moved to the HRH tower to only find a louder party next door to that room. I called down and asked for an alternative to which I was told there were no options. I promptly left the Hard Rock and I will NEVER stay there again and will be sure to let my colleagues in the NASCAR business hear my story to ensure they don't make the same mistake I did. I book thousands of rooms a year for incentive trips, so I hope HRH's management understands the impact of the way I was treated and the lost revenue which will be spent at a hotel property that knows how to treat its guests. The only silver lining was Eric at the Lux bar who went up and beyond for myself and my pit crew members who were hungry, tired and thirsty. He brought us food when everything was closed and did so with a fantastic attitude. Eric should be promoted to General Manager and then maybe the Hard Rock has a chance of redeeming our business.

Oh, and there is rock music blasting throughout the hotel, night and day, including in the breakfast restaurant (mr. Lucky's) at 7 AM.

Anyway, I had to go back up to my room to bring the bag up and then I carried my computer down to the other pool. Bad idea, since the music was so loud there (at 11 am) that I couldn't think anyway. This place also has a sensor in the mini bar so you're charged for basically opening the damn fridge. My room was clean and decent...the shower handle fell off the first day...but otherwise it was fine & comfy.

Hotel is now owned by Morgans Hotel Group so had high expectations for this property. But it was a let down. The rooms in the new tower where i stayed were great. Nice modern design.

Flat screen LCD TV. Nice furniture. Decent bathroom. Plenty of clothing storage space. WiFI was a bit expensive. But the rest goes downhill from here. Housekeeping totally did not clean or enter my room on one of the 4 nights. Then the maid lied and said she cleaned the room. The front desk managers took forever to respond. Called them at least 3 times and promises were made to clean the room which never happened. Front desk check-in process was a nightmare - VERY Slow and people just standing around behind the desk doing paperwork or something and not helping people in the growing line waiting to check in. One of my pet peeves - either take it into the back office so we dont stare at you not helping us with check-in... or actually look up and help someone! It's about service quality, which is obvious this hotel does not spend much time thinking about. Perhaps that is because the clientele is on the younger side. and perhaps they dont care as much about service. Another pet peeve - dishes and glasses sitting in the hallway for more than a couple hours - several days I saw the same trays sitting in the hallway for hours on end - a better hotel would not let that happen. Asked for extra towels and never showed up. Asked for extra toiletries since two of us were in the room - never showed up. This hotel is not on the Strip so make sure you know that before you book. It is at least a 15-20 minute walk to the strip if you dont want to spend money on a taxi. I would not visit here again.

I had already planned on switching my hotel to the Planet Hollywood for the last two nights of my trip (April 7th \u2013 9th) to be close to the strip (and other people we were travelling with) but I really wish I hadn\u2019t. It felt like a major downgrade going to the PH after 3 nights at the HR. Upon first impression of the hotel it was almost a surreal feeling. Music blaring and a really good smell (unlike other casinos), beautiful people (no other casino compares to the HR for this!), just a great overall vibe. I felt relaxed and excited as soon as I got there. Definitely for a young or young at heart crowd though. I had paid for a regular room in the Paradise tower (booked through the HRH website) and we were upgraded to the king corner suite on the top floor (room 31800 I think). AMAZING room! Floor to ceiling windows on two walls, a clean comfy king size bed (the comfiest I\u2019ve ever slept in), trendy wallpaper and overall design, huge tiled shower, good lighting, Sony Bravia TV with HD channels. One side of the room had a view of Vegas and the pool and the other side of the room had a view of the pool and the strip. Nothing beats the desert sunrise in the morning coming through your window \uf04a The room and bathroom were spotless at all times and housekeeping was great. I know people say that you don\u2019t spend a lot of time in your room in Vegas but once you see this room you might want to change your mind. I liked the distance from the strip. It really wasn\u2019t too far, around a 15 minute walk or $6 cab ride (to the Miracle Mile) and the area didn\u2019t feel sketchy like some reports have said. It was actually nice to be off the strip because the casino doesn\u2019t get over crowed and filled up with \u201cstrip traffic\u201d. The pool is amazing. No other words to describe it. It was like a tropical oasis, huge area with lots of different pools and little grottos. There\u2019s areas for relaxing and areas for partying. I\u2019m really looking forward to going to Rehab there in August. Lots of places to eat in the hotel\u2026Pink Taco, Ago, Nobu, Starbucks, Luckys 24/7, Rare 120, there\u2019s a Panini place in the Paradise Tower and there\u2019s a general store to get drinks, snacks, etc. There\u2019s not a lot of shopping at the casino but that\u2019s fine, there\u2019s plenty of other things to do. My brother got a tattoo at Hart & Huntington and was impressed with the whole experience. The Joint, Wasted Space and Vanity are all great places. There\u2019s a CVS and a market across the street from the hotel. I\u2019m definitely not a high roller (not even a low roller, lol) but the Rockstar Players Club was awesome. We got a comp for Ago in no time and it seemed like you actually got something for your money with it. I only played the slots but they seemed pretty decent, a few people we were with won quite a bit with only putting a little in. As for cons\u2026. Upon checkout I asked for a copy of my bill. All that was on there was my room rate, resort fee (what exactly do you get for this at this hotel?!), and taxes. When I got home and checked my credit card bill a few days later I saw that I\u2019ve been charged a $50 fee for the mini bar. I didn\u2019t touch anything in the mini bar, I didn\u2019t order any room service, I didn\u2019t use their shampoo/conditioner, nothing! I\u2019ve called every day since seeing that charge (Wednesday of last week) and so far no one has even returned my calls. Whenever I ask to speak to someone else I get told that they\u2019re busy. If I don\u2019t hear back from them by Wednesday I\u2019m going to send it to the fraud department at my credit card company. I found the customer service to be kind of [--]. Check in/out was fine, but talking to the hotel on the phone and when I called down with a question I wasn\u2019t treated well. Whoever runs their Twitter account seems nice though!

Anyway, compared to other hotels in Vegas, this one is off the beaten path of the Strip and in my opinion worn down. It just seemed old and for theprice they charge, the room was average with some minor complications with bad plumbing. However, housekeeping was very good with taking care of the Matza sized hair ball. It wasn't a bad stay. The room was confortable. However, if you are flying to Vegas for the first time and expecting a WOW Factor, this is not it. It's an average hotel with an average casino. I will say that the nightlife and crowd atmosphere is pretty good. So if you are into the party scence, definitely catch a cab from your nicer hotel over and hit the center bar and dance club.

The hotel has 3 different \"towers\" for rooms: Casino Tower, Paradise Tower, and the HR Towers. The Paradise and HR Tower just opened (July 09, Dec 09) while the Casino Towers are the original hotel portion of the property. AS with any Casino, the hotel is fairly separated from the Casino. If you are going to book here, I would highly encourage you to stay away from the Casino Tower. Usually when you see the $29 rates this is where they will want to put you. I would not stay here. It isn't awful, but it isn't what you expect in Vegas. For the best rates, I would recommend calling the hotel directly as that is the best method to try to get the best rate and get into the Paradise or HR Tower. Paradise should be cheaper than the HR Towers as the HR Towers is all suites. Casino is on ok Casino. Usually they have Blackjack from $10 and up, but I have seen $5 BJ in the afternoon, say 11am - 3pm. Poker Room is in my opinion the most comfortable room in Vegas. Spacious and the other tables are not on top of you. There is a bar in the Poker Room, so drink service is usually very fast. While the Poker Room is non-smoking, the bar area isn't so if you are at tables 1-3 expect to smell smoke. The action is average, but you rarely have to wait. I'd say if you are playing between 6pm - 8pm there is no wait and from 8pn on perhaps a 10-15 minute wait at the worst. The Poker room during the afternoon, apart from their $45 tourneys is very slow. Usually just 1 table of 1/2 NL. Food here is pretty good. Nobu is possibly the best Sushi in Vegas. They have an Italian place which I have never tried, but it is upscale and looks reasonable. Same with their new Steakhouse, Rare 120. It's a $$$$ place, but that is to be expected in Vegas. They have a mexican place, Pink Taco, which has some great Mexican fare at reasonable prices. A full Starbucks inside, convenience store open 24 hours, and a diner that isopen 24 hours, Mr Lucky's. Mr. Lucky's is well priced, has fast service, and the food is fairly good, although I do not recommend the Sirloin sandwich. Taxi's are lined up outside so you rarely have to wait, unless you are there at 8-9am during the week of CES. Airport is litterally 5 minutes from the hotel. This hotel is off the strip and I would say technically you could walk to the strip, but you shouldn't.

We got up the next morning and wanted to order breakfast through room service but the pages for this were missing. We called to see if we could get another copy again, waited 45 minutes, never got it. Called again and recieved an apology and was told they would bring it up right away. Again, THEY NEVER BROUGHT IT UP. We finally decided to leave to go to breakfast but tried calling again later that evening to request the guide again. STILL, NEVER GOT IT!. So after 4 attempts we finally gave up. We were put in a room in the old portion of the hotel. If you can avoid this I would suggest it. The rooms are OK but they just appear to be worn down. Laminate is peeling off the dresser, caulk joints around plumbing fixtures were peeling and dirty, carpet seemed to be worn, etc. The room was also not cleaned very well. There were wrappers laying on the floor near the bed. There was dirt on the light switches in the bathroom. The walls also seemed paper thin as we can here talking on both sides. We knew the hotel was off the strip but did see they offered a shuttle so we were fine with it. Unfortunately we found out when we got there that the shuttle would not be running until January 9th! What is this resort fee for? Seriously, the only thing we got was a room. There were no additional perks that were included in the room or anywhere else in the hotel that deseved a resort fee. The room was bare bones. Not even a coffe maker. Anyway, I cannot offer my reccomendation for this hotel. I will not be staying there again unless they get there act together and I stay in one of the new towers.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, CA", "Title": "\u201cNEVER AGAIN! Worst hotel I've ever stayed in.....\u201d", "Author": "queenfm85", "ReviewID": "UR52310924", "Content": "I booked my 24th birthday trip to Vegas for the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino because I LOVE Rock 'n' Roll music and the culture that surrounds it. I got a really good deal on the hotel's website for 2 nights, for a non-smoking King, and it is usually kind of pricey. I was a bit hesitant to use this hotel being off the strip but the website said that there was a free shuttle to and from the strip so I figured that would compensate for not being able to walk out onto the strip from the hotel. We got there about 11pm (drove 4 hours from Riverside, CA) and I heard the guy checking in at the desk in front of us and the guest services person was telling him about a deposit for however many days he is staying and also what the hotel offered, where everything is, what events are going on around the hotel etc. I kind of got nervous because we planned this trip on a low budget but when I approached my guest services woman she promised me that my TOTAL was only 177.80 and that amount would be charged to my card but my card would also be on file for any incidentals. She didn't tell us about the hotel at all though, just gave us our keys and told us where the elevator was. I thought that was kind of weird.... When we got up to our room it was a 2 Queen room. I was bummed. I called down and they said they ran out of Kings and it is first come first serve. Ok, I guess I understand that. I was told they could switch me tomorrow and put a room on hold for me and all I had to do was call or go down to the desk the next morning. When the next morning rolled around I called down and they put my on a \"brief hold\" which ended up being over 10 minutes so we just decided to go down to the desk. After waiting in line for about 20-30 mins we were told our room wasn't ready and someone would call my phone when it was. So my boyfriend and I decided to catch the free shuttle to the strip to get breakfast. We went out in front of the hotel and didn't see anything obvious to where the shuttle would be so we asked someone at the hotel. The lady working there told us that they don't do the shuttle anymore but the Hard Rock Cafe does which is in the parking lot. No big deal. We walked over there and saw a shuttle bus parked and empty in the lot. We went to the front of the restaurant and there was a sign that said it only runs on the weekends as of 12/14. Well, this was a Wednesday. We were shafted on our \"free shuttle\" which is also billed by the hotel as a \"resort fee\" of $7/day. In protest I wasn't about to pay a taxi so we decided to walk the mile. I am a pretty healthy 24 yr old girl and I don't mind a nice walk. I actually expect it up and down the strip but the fact that we were promised a shuttle on the website and not even told that it wasn't running is bull. When we finally made it to breakfast, I checked my bank account on my phone and saw there was only $20 in there. I was SUPER upset. Turns out, the Hard Rock took out over 2x the amount they told me they were going to. I called and they said it was a deposit for incidentals and I was told about it (even though I wasn't by the girl that checked us in). The only way we could release my funds was to have another card to put the deposit on but our family lives in MI so she said she could fax in her card and etc. We ended up walking the 2 miles (from the restaurant) back to the hotel to settle the credit card issue. We were THEN told that my funds wouldnt be released until 8-10 hrs later so basically we would be getting ready to leave by that time and it would be pointless. So, we had walked all the way back for nothing. We checked to see if our room was ready but it still wasnt. So I basically complained my butt off to this guy at the check-in counter (I was polite, but angry) and about the shuttle, he told me that \"I'm from NY and I walk everywhere anyways so it doesn't bother ME\" WHAT!!? That is what you tell an unsatisfied customer?! Then he told me the hotel isnt even in charge of the shuttle so its not their fault. As far as the rooms go, my reservation request is \"NEVER\" guaranteed and all he could offer me was a SMOKING King. He claimed that it didnt smell like smoke because they shampooed the carpets regularly. And all he could do to compensate me (after speaking to his Mgr was to refund the $7 resort fee). REALLY!?! I was SOOO upset! My bf was giving me \"the look\" because he didnt want me to make a scene and we just wanted to move on and enjoy our night. After being tired of walking and arguing with this guy we just settled on the smoking room. We went up there and walked in and it definitely smelled like smoke. I didn't want it to ruin my bday fun so I didn't waste my time. The next day when we went to check out the girl at the counter asked about our stay and I told her I was upset and the reasons why and she told me \"Well no one uses the shuttle ANYWAY\" and basically tried to make me feel stupid for wanting to use the free shuttle that was promised to me. She also told me \"Its because its New Years, its not always like this\". So.... what about it being my birthday the day before NYE? Am I just going to get [--] over at this hotel every year if I came back!? THEN on top of it all....she tried to say I used something from the minibar and was going to charge me an extra $4. WTF!? I swear to god... I have NEVER received such bad service from a hotel in Vegas and especially a 4 Star one! I am NOT a complainer at all and am usually a pretty laid-back girl but I felt the need to pass my experience on to everyone looking to stay here...

I was told that the 1 king was a request but we for sure had a non smoking room in the new tower for the Ball rate that was blocked.

That's when I thought I could forget about all the negative reviews I've read...buuuut no.. . There was absolutely NO parking in the self parking so we were forced to do valet and non of us had small bills to tip Valet so we felt bad. The Bell Hop took our luggage into a back room before we checked in to \"make sure we don't have any out side alcohol\" WHAT?!?! I didn't want anyone going through my stuff! When we got into the to the front to check in, the man who was obviously stressed out said \"we don't have any V, C, I right now\"... Since I work in a hotel myself, I knew the lingo that they didn't have anything 'vacant, clean or inspected'...Greaaaaaaaat... we were put in the casino floor, smoking, two queen and on the complete opposite said and floor of the couple we were carpooling with who were also guaranteed a room somewhat close to us. Same thing happened to almost everyone in my Fiance's battalion. One guy even got booted and had to stay at the Riviera. Basically, you give them your money for a room and they give you whatever they have, your requests are worthless. The bellman was cool enough to give us a heads up that everything was on sensors, so \"if you don't want it, don't touch it, it charges you automatically.\" Sure, whatever, we didn't want to pay 4.50 for a tiny bottle of water anyway. Funny way they stocked it too, cuz if you wanted a specific drink, you had to remove the drink in front to get to it, therefore getting charged. Way too far from the strip, here were scuff marks all over the walls, a couple of flies in the shower and the tile was chipped and what looked like rust or mold in the corners of the tub, the room reeked and there was only one working light bulb, and the lighting in the bathroom sucked and the music was sooo loud no matter where you went. I heard alot of stuff gets stolen so we left the Do Not Disturb sign on the entire night and were frequently going up to the room to make sure Housekeeping didn't go in. Felt like if we were to even touch or move anything, then we'd get charged for it. The beds were awsome though Other then that the Ball was amazing and it was great to just have to stumble back to the room.

However, my friend was a Vegas newbie with a narrow-minded plan of spending most of her time lounging by the pool. Her sister advised us that we just had to book our stay with the Hard Rock Hotel. Since I had yet to try this destination and because of its party atmosphere, I conceded to the suggestion. We planned our trip to span a Thursday through Monday to ensure that we would be poolside for the Sunday Rehab party, which was still advertised as a prominent event on their website, though we had already entered the Fall season. We arrived on the scheduled Thursday afternoon and were confronted with a lengthy check-in line. We were dying to get settled and start our trip, but we were not allowed to check in prior to their 3 pm time. We were told that our room was ready but awaiting approval from the housekeeping manager, which should only take one hour. We dragged our luggage into the Pink Taco restaurant to grab some tasty Mexican salads (see separate review) and to enjoy the sun on the patio. We returned to the check in desk over an hour later and were told that our room was still awaiting approval, but that we could immediately settle into a room on a lower floor. At this point, we were just eager to get to the pool, so we agreed to the lesser room, which wound up providing a hideous view of the parking garage! The room itself had funky wallpaper, a spacious bathroom, an iPod dock with speakers, and a large flat-screen television. We had mixed feelings regarding our stay. First, their website did not mention that the Sunday Rehab party was over for the season or that their pool was not heated. So, basically, everyone was relaxing poolside in the 80-degree weather, but had nowhere to properly cool off. In regards to the crowd, my friend and I thought we were back home among Jersey shore guidos. Fist pumping was definitely not our scene...A final note on the pool is that the waitresses were extremely friendly on Thursday afternoon, but became snooty and pretentious on the weekend. It was as if they were trying to exude a \"cool\" vibe for the rowdy Saturday-Sunday crowd. All of the pretentiousness was more discouraging than impressive. Additionally, the hotel's free shuttle to the Strip only arrived once every hour and did not even stop anywhere close to Las Vegas Boulevard. We wound up opting for taxi service instead, which saved time but cost $10 each way. I was also annoyed by the $20 a day fee to use the fitness center, which was attached to the spa rather than being a part of the hotel. The large room was packed with equipment and would have been the perfect way to counteract my extravagant dinners and evening cocktails, but I refused to pay for this \"amenity\". The main reasons to stay at the Hard Rock are for the crazy atmosphere, terrific nightlife options, and large pool grotto. However, many of these things are negligible and can be found at other properties.

HOWEVER, when we checked out we were SHOCKED to see a charge of $7.84/day for a \"resort fee\". I should have read TripAdvisor as this seems like a common issue but since we had stayed here before, I didn't even do my homework. The worst was that when I challenged the charge at check-out (the first time I was aware of it), the desk clerk told me that we were told upon sign-in (we weren't) and that we had signed off on the charge. She was very unpleasant and I asked for a manager . We waited for over 10 minutes and instead of a manager, she brought back a printout of what I supposedly signed. What had really happened was we checked in and they told us about the mini-bar and that our credit card would be charged for the remaining reservation days and then handed us an electronic signature pad, said \"ok, just hit 'accept' and sign and you'll be all set\". We signed and didn't think anything of it. After the fact, we learned that the signature pad has several pages of \"terms\" that the desk clerks were just skipping over and then handing the signature pad to the guests. As we were continuing to argue with the desk clerk, two other people came in to check-in and beautifully, the desk clerks did the exact same thing to both of them - handing the signature pad to each gentleman with the \"just hit 'accept' and sign\" instructions and not mentioning the resort fee authorization. So, we pointed it out to them and neither of them were aware of any resort fee. We were worried about missing our flight, so we left with both gentleman arguing about the resort fee. When we returned home, we contacted the hotel management and they apologized and refunded the charges. They also indicated that they were going to address the problem.

Just another tax that I don't feel guests should have to pay. Apparently covers costs for pool maintenance, free shuttles etc. 3) I booked through a travel group, and prepaid, and was still billed over $700.00 for \"incidentals\" for a 5 night stay without being told. I can understand having to put down a reasonable deposit, but that's just wrong. (Received my credit about 3 days after checkout.) 4) If they are going to offer in-room snacks at ridiculously inflated prices they should be on top of things. I found some items in the snack tray had been consumed but resealed to look like they hadn't been touched. Reported it right away, so I wasn't billed for anything. Glad I checked. Too many of the staff are very cold and not very courteous. I had to deal with bad attitudes on several occasions--I get it, it's the Hard Rock, but you're not rock stars. I blame hotel management for this one. The pools are great, though some spots have very limited sun. The casino is relatively small but I can appreciate a space you won't get lost in. Cocktail waitresses don't always come around often enough and when you do order a drink they might keep you waiting longer than you'd like. Mr. Lucky's restaurant is reasonably priced and has decent food, but 3 out of the 4 times there, I had pretty bad service and or botched orders. Pink Taco has consistently great food and fair service but is a little more pricey than need be (Happy Hour is the best time for deals). Hard Rock Cafe has great food and I want to say good service ... Unfortunately, on one occassion, we received two checks for the same meal. To top it off, the second check was four times the actual cost of our meal! When we pointed this out to our waiter we were apologised to profusely and assured there would be no second charge. Of course, when the bank statement was checked a day or two later the second charge was there. We were back home by this time and could not complain in person. Needless to say my buddy was pretty livid. Note: There are a couple of reasonably priced restuarants just across the street from the hotel grounds you might want to try. You do have other options. So it's not perfect, but the good was good and the place does have a fun atmosphere. There are some some really great staff and they made up for some of the bad, but would I stay here again? Probably not. I would consider it if, say, one of my favorite acts were performing.

It was 5 guys in 2 connected rooms which were both very comfortable and ample room for what you need it for (sleeping and keeping your stuff in). There's so much to see out there that you spend less time than you think in the room. Pool: Very nice, just get a lounge chair before 10:00 if you plan to be near the pool for the day. Esp on Fri/Sat/ (didnt go to rehab on Sunday). Otherwise enjoy the strong sun and people watching. I strongly suggest sunblock. Casino: You can definitely get on any blackjack/ roulette table during the day, but at night it gets more crowded because the casino isn't very big. Food/ Clubs: Pink Taco and the 24/7 place both had good food. If you're looking for a buffet head to Caesars or Bellagio. Body English was great. We had 5 guys and got bottle service there. I strongly recommend it. We saw a concert at the Joint which was cool. Why I gave it 3 stars: When you consider the distance to the Strip, the relatively small casino, the loud music that starts at 9:00 am esp when you go to bed at 4AM, the lack of nearby amenities/ sights, and you have to pay for the Gym.

The bad stuff: \u2022 I strongly advise against taking anything from the minibar. Not only is it expensive in the first place but you end up paying the staff to restock it so it costs about twice the advertised price. \u2022 The gym costs guests $20 per day. Ridiculous. \u2022 The hotel puts a $100 per night hold on your credit card for incidentals. Again, ridiculous.

The next day we went back to check out of that little slice of heaven and again, I was nervous. i mean, hello - we had just spent the night in a deluxe suite, our room was bound to suck after that. We got our new room, which they had put us in the Paradise Tower on the 10th floor with a pool view. while it wasn't the suite, it was one of the nicest hotel rooms i had ever stayed in in Vegas. and all this after i had booked through a 3rd party site & gotten the room for less than $90 a night.

The Paradise Tower is a little far from the casino...but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The pool and Rehab were beyond explanation, you have to see it to believe it. I am looking forward to checking out the HRH Tower Suites next summer. Pros: VIP services, Music/atmosphere, size of property, POOL and REHAB, Nobu, Rare 120 and Body English Cons: I don't know if I have any...

Their response was to offer us a free night valid till September 2009. As we were always going to return to Las Vegas in August 2009, we took up the offer. We decided to stay a further four nights at the HRH instead of moving to another hotel as we had previously planned. I had advised the lady that offered the free night that we will be arriving at the HRH at 2.00pm after a 12 hour flight from New Zealand and a further hour or so flight from San Francisco. She said that she would put notes into the system but could not guarantee anything as check in on Sunday was 4.00pm. Sunday 16 August: Southwest flight out of SFO on time and arrived at the HRH at about 1.30pm. After standing in the registration line for about 35 minutes, when I get to the counter, the lady advises me that I should go next door to the VIP check in (things are looking up!!). Go to VIP check in, they take the usual credit card imprint and advise that they would call me when the room is ready. Lunch at Mr Lucky\u2019s. Good meals and service (wife had cheeseburger sliders, I had the buffalo chicken). Wife goes to VIP check in to ask how much longer our room will be. She is rudely told that check in is at 4.00pm (3.45pm already). At 4.30pm both of us go to VIP check in. They tell me that the room is getting made up right as we speak. Get to the room at about 5.10pm. When we enter the room (540) we are overcome by a very strong paint smell. DW calls VIP desk to advise. They say that it is a VIP room and it has been freshly painted and the carpet cleaned. We had stayed in this room last year and it was not a VIP room then. When DW advises the desk of this, they tell her that as we had requested this room we should deal with it. When DW insists that there is no way that we can stay in the room as even in the very short time we have been there we are both getting headaches and sore throats, the lady advises that someone will be up with keys to another room. In the mean time a fruit platter is delivered to our room. The room service guy that delivered the platter agrees with us that the smell of paint is very strong. After 30 minutes when still no key has arrived, DW makes her way to the VIP desk. They insist that the key has been sent up and basically call her a liar. They give her keys to room 538. We move to 538. No smell of paint in the room except from what is coming out of our clothes. By this time I am on the phone to expedia to see if we can cancel the four nights we have booked after the free night. I hear loud knocking on the door of room 540. I open our door. The porter is here with the keys to room 538. I had trouble explaining to him that we don\u2019t need keys to 538 as we are already in it. He was very rude and upset that his trip to the 5th floor was a wasted one. Lady from expedia heard the conversation and commented on the rudeness. To cut a long story short, we would have lost too much money cancelling the 4 nights that we had booked through expedia and as we had planned to only sleep a few hours per night we decided to remain at the HRH. As our flight out of Vegas was at 5.00pmon Friday, we decided to ask for a late checkout (extend to 1.00pm from 11.00am). On Thursday afternoon I ask the VIP desk for the possibility of a late check out. They tell me that I should check with the VIP desk on Friday morning. On Friday morning I visit the VIP desk to ask for check out at 1.00pm. You would think that after the problems that we had getting into our room that they would let us check out at 1.00pm. No, I was told that the room had to be vacated by midday. So much for VIP service! My wife and I have made 25 overseas trips in the last 3 and half years and stayed in over 30 hotels so feel that I am reasonably well qualified to comment on hotel customer service. We have never encountered such rude, poor and arrogant service at any other hotel. From what was once my favourite hotel, I can safely say that I will not be returning to the HRH in Las Vegas. I realise that the hotel may be wanting to project a \u201chip / edgy / rock star\u201d image but feel that the staff have taken this too far and have started to behave like rock stars themselves and think that they are more important than guests. When I advised the lady that arranged the free night of the issues that we had at check in time and the fact that we had to wait so long for a room that was just not ready to have guests, her response was to offer us a free breakfast (which I refused).

We got into Rehab with no problem and our beds in the room were very comfortable but the room itself was dirty and dusty and we found items from the people who stayed in the room before us. We also put all four of our names on the hotel room but we had to ask for four towels instead of two towels EVERY day. The hotel inside is disgusting - people are smoking EVERYWHERE, including inside the casino and in every hallway. I was worried that I would get burned by cigarettes as I walked by, not to mention the stench that it left on my clothes and hair. During the four days we stayed at the Hard Rock, one of the girls left her wallet in the room for a little while and in that short time had her money stolen out of her wallet. Security told her they'd get back to her after investigating it and 3 weeks later, still no phone call. Also, one of my friends and I were assaulted by a group of guys inside the casino right in front of a security guard who did nothing to help us. After we spoke to him, he called over another security guard who showed up more than 10 minutes later. We identified the guys and the security guards went to talk to them but all they did was \"warn\" them to not do it again. They didn't get their names, didn't ask if they were staying in the hotel and didn't ask to see their IDs. Security told us that they cant do anything more than warn them to not do it again and the only thing we can do is press charges with the police, but they made sure to point out that we'd have to wait 2-3 hours for the police to arrive and that our statements would be public record so it would have our names, addresses and SSNs on it and these guys would be able to look it up and get our information. After I spoke with security again that night they told me they saw that group of guys in the casino again and spoke with them again but still didn't ask for their IDs or their names! Management was completely dismissive and insensitive with this situation. They kept passing me off to different people in administration, and no one called me back about it like I was promised. They said was that what happened in the hotel wasn't their responsibility, even though THEIR staff and security didn't react properly. After I got home from the trip, I found out that one of my coworkers was also going to Las Vegas and staying at the Hard Rock so I told her to watch herself and be extra careful in the casino because security won't help her and she told me she heard the same thing from other people too!

In my opinion, if someone were going to pick the Hard Rock as their hotel, they need to have very specific reason why they are doing so (i.e. entrance to Rehab in Sundays) \u2013 otherwise, stay somewhere else. The rooms are really nothing to brag about (though I did just stay in the new Paradise Tower, which is slightly nicer than the Casino portion), the service is atrocious (even worse than other party hotels such as the Palms), the food choices are pretty bad (really just three not so great restaurants), and their clubs have seen better days (Body English isn\u2019t what it used to be). In fact, I\u2019d even go as far as to say stay JUST the night you want to be there, and the rest of the time, stay anywhere else. The Hard Rock isn\u2019t cheap, and for the prices it charges, it should really give you much more. Also, take note of the hotel\u2019s draconian policies.

But that comes with age, mellowing, and non-stop attention to who the audience is and what is relevant to the time. Hard Rock LV has done none of that.

Of course this is the point - this is not a criticism - but beware: if loud music at 6am over breakfast is not your thing, stay elsewhere. It's also a fair walk (20 minutes) from the Strip and there is a noisy construction site next door. Oh yes, the pool was closed during my November stay (why? It was plenty warm enough) All that said, the rooms are huge, comfortable and spotless. The decor - lots of white and black leather, proper 1970s-style carpets and huge beds is perfect for what it is. Decent gym and the food is pretty good as well. Best of all, the staff are friendly and bend-over-backwards helpful. Something went wrong with my laundry ( a small delay) and lots of stuff was knocked off my room bill in compensation without being demanded.

Of course it's geared towards the younger, hip crowd. But there is something here for everyone from 80 to 2. The pool is the best and unique. The restaurants and bar or fabulous (check out the new Rare 120). Starbucks just a quick elevator ride down from your room. The gaming area is intimate and fun. The staff was fabulous - better than ever. We rquested assistance several times for minor services in our room - and they were prompt and friendly. Get a room faciling the pool - it's worth the upgrade. The pool is lit up at night with the Strip's light in the background. You can open up your french doors that look over the pool and soak in all of the sights. If you're in the room before the pool closes - you'll get to listen to rock and roll music and enjoy the sun coming in/setting. we were nervous about the reviews regarding the construction. And it was not that big of deal. We could \"kind of hear\" some typical construction noises in the morning - and we didn't notice anything at the pool They have the great Rock and Roll music playing. So don't worry about the construction. Sometimes you can hear the planes - but it just depends on what their flight paths are during the day. They have a shuttle you can use - and taxis are always usefu. If you have a designated driver, renting a car is a nice option. They have a self park - that is free and VERY convienently located/connected to the main building. It will save you a lot of money in cab fares - IF you have a designated driver. Overall, this is our number one place to stay. We've been here alone with just the two of us, we've brought our children (12 and 13 years), and our grandparents. It's a great setting for all. But if you're 21 to 30 - and like the night scene and young bodies - of course this is even more ideal. But there are all ages here too. And they treat you all the same.

In a nice touch there are french doors that open to the outside. The room is stocked with overpriced water and snacks. Go to the CVS across the street. No coffee maker either in the room. The casino is filled with restaurants but I found them pricy. Mr Lucky's the diner is the cheapest of the lot but you can pay a lot less for diner food elsewhere. But the wait staff was nice. The pool area is beautiful and probably the high point of the hotel. There is construction going on around the pool area with two new towers going up, but the noise was not an issue. Again drink prices from the pool bar are pricy. $7 for a can of Heineken. The bartenders and staff are very friendly though. You will be charged a $7.63 a day resort fee, whatever that is.

It's wild and I WOULD NOT recommend it for families or anyone conservative and boring. On a Monday and Tuesday night it was packed with people ages 21-late 30's. No offense older folk, but you will be the social pariah of the casino! My only complaint is that a friend of mine brought a party friend of hers up to my room and she threw up on the bed. Being inebriated myself, at the time it didn't seem like a big deal and something I could deal with in the morning. The reality was harsh the next morning when I received the $700 bill for replacing the WHITE duvet cover and other random [-]. So my advice is don't have messy intercourse on the beds, eat ANYTHING on the beds, or even breath on the beds cause there may be a charge. I understand throw up but $700!!!! Ridiculous. The Hard Rock has a great atmosphere, horrible service, & rude front desk people so I recommend staying somewhere else and paying the $10 cab ride from the strip.

Our room was on the pool side, however the pool and the rock music blaring at the pool close down at 6 in the evening, so nothing to worry about there.

Secondly, the hotel is surpisingly strict. You cannot re-enter the hotel from the pool with no shirt. I found this a strange rule for when you come from a pool. Also, they make a big deal about wearing wristbands at all times at the pool. They will not accept you just showing a room card. Other Vegas hotels don't have this rule. Also, the wristbands are very difficult to get off! I had to break it to remove it. Thr sports book is very small. And the TVs in the rooms are for some reason very difficult to use.

I will think twice before I stay here again. This was my third time staying here and I am amazed at how run down it is looking. I was on the 9th floor and couldn't believe how dirty the carpet in the hallway was. When I got to my room the carpet was filthy and very worn. The doors that opened out to the pool would not shut properly and when the wind blew hard enough it would blow the doors open. This would not be a big deal if the air conditioner worked well. My room was hot through the night and didn't cool off until the morning. Worst bed I have ever slept on. If I had been staying more than one night this would have been an issue. On a positive note the bathroom was very clean. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone while the construction is going on. I was awakened at 3am to the clanging sound of steel. It is ridiculous that they are allowed to do construction all night long. I found the staff to be very friendly. At check-in they changed my room from a mountain view to a pool view without me asking. I checked in at 11am, headed out to the pool and my room was ready by 12:30pm. All dealers I spoke with were very nice. We ate at the Pink Taco and it was enjoyable. Some of my friends ate at the 24hr cafe after midnight and said the portions were huge and the food very good. I called two weeks ahead to reserve a pool Cabana. I was told I would be called back in a couple of hours. After not hearing from them for a week I had to initiate the call back. I was willing to accept this since the week of the 4th of July was coming up and I am sure they were swamped with phone calls. The Cabana was the way to go. Due to the construction the North pool did not open util 12:30. When it did open our Cabana was right next to the pool in a perfect spot. No extra tipping needed for this location (though that was implied when I made the reservation). The cost of the Cabana was a $500.00 food and drink fee (gratuity not included). Simply stated: we paid $500.00 and as we drank and ate it was deducted from that. I was with seven other guys and we went over the balance by $5.00 without needing to be concerned with how much we ate or drank. The cabana had two couches, plenty of towels, a television, a safe and a refrigerator. All in our group agreed it was a good thing to have. I would wait until after the construction is done before I stay here again. I was in Las Vegas two weeks before this trip and stayed at the Monte Carlo. Right next door to that hotel is a huge construction project (largest in vegas history I think) and they stopped at night.

I've stayed at many different hotels from Hampton inn to Mirage to Bally's to the Palms. During past trips, I've visited the Hard Rock, and I've always wanted to stay there. So when the opportunity arose, I jumped on it. My 60-year old mother decided to make the trip with me, and we were both excited to stay there. I can't tell you how disappointed I've been with my experience with the Hard Rock Hotel. It began immediately upon entering. The front desk staff were incredibly cold, rude in fact. The clerk seemed annoyed to have to answer my one question (What room rate am I signing for?). They did not have our room ready when we arrived, thus, someone had to call me to inform me when the room was ready. This guy was incredibly snotty toward me. I was floored by the way I was treated. He talked down to me to the point where I was almost in tears. We sat at the casino bar. The waiter was rude there (saying he'd only comp our drinks if we were playing dollars... I've never heard of such a policy. What was worse was that we were playing dollars). We visited the 24-7 cafe. The host finally had to come wait on us when none of the waitresses had come to help us after 20 minutes. Our food arrived cold. I had to go to the hostess stand to get my check. The day we arrived (monday) when we finally were able to access our room, the music at the pool was so loud it rattled EVERYTHING in our room. I'd gotten up very early that morning and wanted a nap after a long day of work. Sadly, it was not to be. There is construction taking place here. I was awoken at 5AM today to the sound of airhorns, which continued every minute or two until I left at 8am. Half the pool is closed off, forcing all of the drunken teenagers who stay here into one side of the pool. There were literally NO chairs during the last two days of my stay, and the pool was basically standing room only. The clientele of the hotel is another thing... PLEASE NOTE- if you are over the age of 22 and mentally older than a 12 year old, you probably won't find this place interesting. I'm a fun-loving 31 year old and I feel very, very old at this place. Last night around 230am, I was awoken by a girl screaming \"IM DRUNK\" at the top of her lungs right down the hall.

They began at exactly 6am, so no sleeping in. The vending and ice machine on our floor did not work the whole trip, we notified staff a couple times, but nothing was done. Housekeeping barged into our room once without even knocking (we had allowed a coworker to put her luggage in our room for a few hours while they got her room ready, the maid saw someone with luggage leave the room, assumed someone checked out and just walked right in). I also did not like stay off the strip. This may not be an issue for some, but we ended up making 3 trips to the strip per day in cabs @ $20 round trip. So about $60 per day in cab fare. Finally, the pool was a bit intimidating for an over 30. I'm 31 and in fairly good shape, but not quite up to the Hard Rock scene. They also would not allow me to bring a water bottle (that I purchased at the hotel) out to the pool. I cannot sit in 110 degree heat in the sun without access to water, especially when already a bit dehydrated from the night before. So I didn't really spend much time at the pool.

Although I was way too young to gamble at the time, I still had a blast. Fast forward a few years and man, things have changed! At check in on Sunday night I explained to the clerk that I was in town for seminars and all I was interested in was a quiet room, away from the party activites and that I couldn't care less about a view. I get to the room and on both sides of my room there are at least half a dozen kids drinking, smoking etc. on the balconies with the music booming. So I call down to the desk and ask the clerk if he's trying to be funny... 'cause I'm not laughing. Those kids are just trying to have a good time - and good for them. I on the other hand belong someplace else. So the clerk offers me another room and I of course take it. The second room is off in the corner, which fine with me. The problem was that there were no pillows, linnens, and most of the furniture (lamps, charis etc.) was missing. So again, I call down to the desk and complain. I am again offered another room, so again I move. The third room has furniture and linnens, no view, but is quiet. I am happy. That is until I go into the bathroom to find the sink is filled with what appears to be puke... no matter what is was, it was discusting! Again, I call down to the desk... But now I'm just frustrated. I tell the clerk to just send someone up to clean it, in the meantime I need to go back to the second room to retreive a jacket I left behind in the move. I end up spending another 45 min waiting for security to esscort me to the seond room, where I left my jacket. Guess what - no jacket. And it was a super cool jacket! I go back to my room (the third room) grab my swimsuit and head down to the spa. All I want at this point is to chill out and luckily the spa was open till 10pm. By Las Vegas standards the spa is pathetic. Your local 24hour fitness offers more amenities. And i can't for the life of me figure out what the draw is for the pool. It looks just like the pool at Hooters. With pool complexes like Red Rock, Flamingo, Mandalay Bay, and even the Golden Nugget in town, I can't fathom paying up a cover charge for what amounts to really nothing special. I get back to my room at about 9:30pm and the maintence guy is still working away. So I decided to head down to the lobby for something eat. The Pink Taco is nothing more than an overpriced Taco Bell. Seriously. So back up to my room I go... The maintenece guy is just leaving. He's very nice and appologetic . I order some ice cream from room service and call it a night. Although it takes an hour, it's cold, solid and sweet. The next morning I had a long conversation with the manager who did end up comping the entire stay and even offered a second a complementary stay for a later date. But I checked out that morning and made it clear that I wouldn't stay at the Hard Rock again, even if he paid me. (I moved to THEhotel where things ran smoothly) I spend almost a month every year in Vegas hotels. Most hotels with a three star or higher ranking are just fine, especailly for a twentysomething. But not the Hard Rock. The bottom line is this - the Hard Rock attracts kids who are desperately trying to be cooler than they could ever hope to be. There is nothing \"edgy\" about this place at all. Even the memorabilia is dated... who caes about Axcel Rose and the Bare Naked Ladies anymore?!? The casino is tiny. The rooms are okay, but nothing special when compared with similar hotels. The desk staff and security are rude at best. The place is all about hype, not substance.

We checked in around 4:30 p.m. and after a rude customer interupted our check in, we got upgraded to a suite. The front desk was extremely polite and it took us less than 10 minutes to get checked in. The room was awesome!! We had a living area with a bar and both rooms had french doors, instead of windows, that opened up with a great view of the pool and a decent one of the hotels on the strip. We ate at the Hard Rock Cafe the first night. However I didn't care for their cajun chicken pasta that I ordered. I sent it back because all it tasted like was bell peppers. We also ate at the 24hour cafe they have called \"Mr Lucky's\" . Food was great, service was fast and the prices were reasonable. The atmosphere in the casino was right on. I love the fact that they have the music playing 24/7. It gives the place a good vibe. There was construction going on during our stay and our room was at the end right next to where it was going on. I did get woken up once but that was it. Other than that it wasn't a big deal. Parking wasn't too bad, since the construction is going on the driveway from the main entrance to the parking structure is inaccessible. You just have to enter on Paradise instead of Harmon which is no big deal. Any complaints about that and your just an impossible person who needs to get a life.

The scene was filled with low end tourists wearing flip flops and clothing not fit to be seen outside the house. Plus the ventilation system was not doing its job of getting rid of the cigarette smoke which permeated the casino. Our room had not changed since ten years ago. The carpet had multiple stains, and, remarkably, the pillow cases (nice quality) had little holes in them! We were appalled. One ring on the shower curtain hung off its hook when we arrived, and remained that way after housekeeping came through a second time. I had to fix it myself. The good news is that all these rooms will be renovated by 2010 and they should be pretty impressive, but the bad news is that it's not a good place to stay until then.

We stayed here on business due to the low price ($69 per night) as compared to similar resorts on the strip. Note: there is a lot of construction going on at the outside of the property and it is difficult to come and go by car. Also, the banging starts pretty early (7am). As you can imagine, the entire property is rock & roll based. As you come in through the main entrance, there is a walkway that surrounds the center casino. To the left is the registration; small with only a few check-in stations but this place is about 20% of the size of the larger strip resorts so there was very little wait. The rooms follow the rock & roll theme with classic rock star pictures on the wall. There is an HD TV in the wall, a refrigerator, a small desk, a chaise style lounge chair and a Bose radio. The bed was comfortable and everything was clean. The bathroom was a bit small and felt cramped. Our first room had a non-functioning TV and maintenance was there right away and got us a new room when they could not fix it. Both rooms were facing Paradise Road and the noise from the construction was audible. If you can, get a room on the pool side until the construction is complete. There is a sharp contrast to the restaurants: 2 are casual (Pink Taco \u2013 cool atmosphere, so-so Mexican food; Mr. Lucky\u2019s 24/7 \u2013 excellent breakfast) to 3 really expensive trendy places (Nobu, Ago & AJ\u2019s were too pricey for us). The club was closed during the week and there was only one non-restaurant bar in the casino. The casino is definitely one of the more fun places to gamble with the rock music blasting. The dealers are great and the bartenders were the best with the comps while playing at the bar. As a matter of fact, all the service personnel were top notch. The pool was closed in early March but looks like a fun place to hang out. This does not rival the larger, strip resorts like Mandalay or Venetian in terms of entertainment and posh, but if you are looking for an inexpensive, fun atmosphere, this is a cool place to stay.

The Hotel at Mandalay Bay used to be a favorite before the Wynn opened up, and next month I'll be staying at the brand new Palazzo at the Venetian. In January of 2008, however, I found myself on a personal trip to meet my family. Not wanting to break the bank on \"my dime,\" I chose the Hard Rock. Five years ago, this was THE place to stay if you were visiting LV on a business trip and were between the ages of 21 and 35. The rooms were decent, but the restaurants and pool scene were great. The casino was small and kind of cozy--a rarity for Las Vegas. Well times have changed a lot over the past five years in Las Vegas, but the Hard Rock has stayed about the same. And it is finding itself facing stiff competition. The new tower that is under construction will probably be terrific, but in the meantime, here's some things to know. The room is okay. Some adjustments have been made, including a nice big flat-screen TV, but the newer hotels are so much nicer. Despite a carpet that needed to be cleaned or replaced, the room was clean and serviced well. The bedding was very comfortable. The bathroom was small but clean. There's no turn-down service here as there is in the nicer hotels, nor is there delivery of a morning newspaper. Mini-bar seemed nicely stocked, and the bathroom amenities were okay. Internet is $12.99/day. I didn't use the gym or spa this trip, but as I recall both are acceptable. I've actually had decent massages at the spa in the past. What's not acceptable is the $20 a day you're charged to run on a treadmill for a half hour. While that's not unusual for Vegas, you don't get access to a grand spa like the one at Madalay Bay. The spa here is small. Restaurants are great at the Hard Rock--from Starbucks and Mr. Lucky's (upscale diner) to Nobu (famous sushi) and Pink Taco (Mexican). I've never been to AJ's Steakhouse, but have heard good things. A new Italian restaurant has opened where Simon used to be. The casino is small, but has a fun vibe. If you're a serious gambler, there may not be enough options for you. I actually prefer to play blackjack there. I like the intimacy of the room. Here's my gripe. All guests are charged a daily $7.00 (plus tax) \"resort fee.\" This is not disclosed to you when a reservation is made. You are made aware of this charge at check-in. What this includes is criminal: free local phone calls and a shuttle to take you to the Strip. How ridiculous. In this age of cell phones, no one needs to use a hotel room phone, and you expect a hotel that is off of the famous Las Vegas Strip to provide transportation to it. It does not include access to the fitness center or free wireless. The charge is nothing but an attempt to nickel and dime guests. Why not simply quote a rate that is $7.00 higher? I threw a fit upon check-out and had the charges removed, but HRH should lose this deceptive charge from its business model. In short, you could do a lot worse than to stay at the Hard Rock. But you can also stay at hotels that are a lot nicer and are beginning to understand the value of good service and repeat business. Don't let the location dissuade you from staying at HRH. If you can get a decent rate and don't expect a lot of luxury, you probably won't be too disappointed.", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cgood place to party\u201d", "Author": "MichaelRinck", "ReviewID": "UR12859270", "Content": "I've stayed at the Hard Rock a bunch of times since college and have always had a good time.

It's a party hotel and it's obvious that people treat it as such. I had some trouble sleeping because every few minutes this weird banging sound reverberated from the walls like someone was banging on the ceiling. Turns out the toilets have the strongest and loudest flushes on the planet because it sounded like we could hear every flush in the entire hotel. Strange phenomenon indeed. Also, the shower kept going off for no reason. Doesn't seem like the hotel is kept up very well. The bed was comfortable and we had a nice strip/pool view from the top floor. The pool is drained for the winter but for some reason we were still charged the $7/night resort fee. Luckily we got a great rate and it didn't matter all that much. But it still felt kinda odd. I'm trying not to slam the hotel all that much because it was always my favorite hotel but it seems like it's seen better days. Maybe I've grown up a bit and want more from a hotel.

The room we requested was ready when we checked in at 4:00pm. Overall we had a great time. This is my first time staying here (but have visited during previous visits to Vegas) and what I like best is the festive attitude and everyone is really friendly and up for a good time. Another big plus is the relative small size of the hotel and casino (like other reviewers have commented, it's nice to be able to navigate the hotel without a map). The room was clean and comfortable. We asked for extra towels and they gave us six. All of the staff was very accomodating. We had room service once. It was very prompt and relatively affordable but the portions were HUGE. I could have eaten three meals from one appetizer and entree - I felt guilty throwing so much away. Overall I would say the quality was good but not great. Nobu is in my top five restaurants of all time. If you like Japanese food I can't recommend it highly enough. I also like the Pink Taco but mostly for the vibe and drinks - the food is good but not great. Here is my feedback on some comments from other reviews: I had no issues with noise from the hallway or noise in general. Although technically outside beverages and food are prohibited, we, along with other people I saw, brought these into the hotel without issue. There were glasses and an ice bucket in my room. I thought the water from the faucet had a slight off taste so I went for bottled water which is expensive (until I went across the street and bought my own). The shower water pressure is pretty good but the shower head is a little low for my 6'1\" size. This isn't a negative as few shower heads are high enough. The plasma tv is nice and the picture quality was very good. There are a majority of young and fit people at this hotel. However, it's not like the pool is full of models. I saw young and old, skinny and fat, singles and people with children and no one seemed to care one way or another. I had no issues with security and nothing in my room seemed to be disturbed. If you turn the tv on (but don't turn the channel), it plays the same music that plays in the hotel and the pool. It has been a little over a year since I have been to Vegas and I'd have to say that the biggest dissapointment is the attitude of the dealers in the casinos. We visited a number of casinos and found this to be the case everywhere.

Now it would help if somebody had explained to us that there are three or four different groups of people allowed entry before anyone in the queue; in fact it turned out that it wasn\u2019t really a queue but a gathering of people waiting to be allowed entry. After about one hour and thirty minutes and witnessing several bungs to the doorman I asked how long it would take us to get in. I was asked how many of us there were and told the doorman there was eight guys; he pretty much went on to say that we didn\u2019t stand much chance because his job was to see an even distribution of women to men but if we could muster a little something together he might be able to see his way into sneaking us in. Now I have to ask the question if we had \"mustered\" a little something if they'd have stopped letting blokes in until the balance had been redressed? I seriously doubt it as it was obvious this was about bunging the doorman a bribe regardless.

I stayed here with my best friend for one night to go to Body English Sunday School. I booked on the Hard Rock site and later received a promotion. I called and the reservation staff was super nice and willing to change my reservation to the promotion (even though it meant cancelling my original and rebooking me). I work in room reservations out here and this is NOT easy, it is NOT fun, and being nice about it is truly great service. I was not able to check into the room myself so I called and they added my friend to the room so she could check in, no problems. Her check-in was quick, when I arrived, I picked up my keys; the staff was friendly and courteous. We had dinner at Nobu and it was fantastic. The service was outstanding, the food was wonderful.

Check-in \u2013 Sunday late afternoon, plenty of staff, no line. Check in quick & easy. Clerk confirmed we were NOT the oldest people staying at the hotel. Bless his heart. : ) Note, in the evenings when you go up to the elevators you must show your room key AND if you are carrying any bags they will ask what is in them. You are not allowed to bring alcohol purchased off site up to your rooms. HOWEVER, the elevators were not staffed during the day. Rooms \u2013 OK. WOW. Note, if you have tweens or younger, you may want to edit the Mini Bar section. Not sure they would need the position a day book. ; ) Beds are on a platform so while there\u2019s not much give to them, they are comfortable. Linens were OK. The 42\u201d plasma flat panel is almost too big for the room. I said ALMOST, (the rooms just a touch small, right?). Ample desk area and a small seating area near the windows. The black out curtains actually worked with no little rays of sunshine poking in to wake us up. (I hate when they don\u2019t close all the way). Bathrooms \u2026 another WOW. Huge deep tub, rain shower head that even the tallest Bubba wouldn\u2019t hit his head on. Good quality soaps & lotions, plenty of towels. Liked the lighted mirror. Only downside, no vent to help clear the room after a steamy shower. Sound proofing wasn\u2019t too great, as we could hear everyone in the hallways as well as people in the parking lots. Admittedly I\u2019m a light sleeper, so I was armed with my earplugs. A non issue really. Pool \u2013 incredible pool atmosphere. Needed a wristband to gain entrance to the pool area. Music loud & good in the pool area. If you\u2019re not confident about how you look in a swimsuit, you might be intimidated here. Mr. Lucky\u2019s \u2013 ate breakfast/lunch here one morning.

Slots had a good variety but were tight. For me, half the fun of Vegas is all the people in the casinos and lively tables. None to be had here. In the evening the place was nearly empty. Overall: I was advised this might not be the best place to stay with a couple of teenagers in tow, but have to say most of the caveats did not apply. Although it\u2019s a young college crowd hanging out at the pools, and while I might not agree with some of the respect shown to women by some of the drunk guys (or lack there of), our teen travelers reported that no one really bothered them at all. In fact one was a bit miffed because someone called her 12 (meaning 12 years old, she\u2019s 17). The valid complaint of staying here with Teens is that there is absolutely nothing for them to do.

The pool was beautiful and awesome (mostly in size per capita) and I was surprised to see many other families with kids out there. As we were there during the week, there weren't numerous 20-30-somethings partying. Don't get me wrong, if our kid wasn't with us, I'd be out there partying with them (see Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach review) and I\u2019m almost 40! I agree however, after viewing the Rehab-Sunday video ads around the hotel that kids are completely inappropriate at that venue and my kid is pretty cool (see attached photo with her playing guitar left-handed with Jimi Hendrix). We were staying with a relative that had VIP status with the hotel so that made things slightly smoother (check-in was private, the rooms were a little cheaper and we got a few rides in the hotel car) but it didn\u2019t drastically change our opinion of the hotel. We were still regular people there and still had to pay $11.99 for internet access. We were put in a \u201cmountain view\u201d room (7th floor) and my husband promptly went down to ask if we could switch to the other side. He was told that it would be an additional $120 to switch to the \u201cpool/strip view.\u201d Mountain view it is! Turned out to be the best decision we made that week as it kept our daughter highly entertained watching all the airplanes land and take off from the airport both day and night. My initial concern was that we would hear a lot of noise from both the airport and the air conditioners. Other than 2 jets that sounded like they landed in the room next to us, we didn\u2019t hear a thing. That includes people in the hallway too. As a parent, the Hard Rock Housekeeping gets 10 gold stars for getting a roll-away bed up to us in under 10 minutes at 2am! They even did it with a smile. Wow. That\u2019s service. We stupidly thought our daughter could sleep in her blow-up, Nemo bed but when we got to the hotel, there was a hole in it (Nemo, not the hotel). Hence the roll-away. Hence housekeeping. Hence the 10 gold stars. The things I would change or complain about have nothing to do with the hotel and everything to do with Vegas ...the incessant SMOKING, the self-importance of people who think they are beautiful (especially when drunk) and the air of desperation for money where people will take advantage of you at every turn.

Its a few minutes from the strip, but it was a cheap cab ride and not a huge inconvenience at all. Definitely a party hotel, but what else are you going to Vegas for?? I wouldnt recommend it as a family environment......but its classic Vegas and if you are going for a good time, this is definitely the place to go. Unlike some of the other uptight reviews on here, I thought the rooms were wonderful. Decent size for a Vegas room- bigger than several of the rooms I've stayed in in other Vegas hotels. GREAT TV and french door which opened to the pool. We ordered room service the first night and it was delivered pretty quickly. Unbelievable pool atmosphere. We reserved a cabana which was a little pricey, but WELL worth it. We didnt have to fight the crowd for a place to sit and the service was GREAT! Our waitress was Victoria and she was unbelievably nice and helpful. There was a TV, fridge and safe in the cabana, which was nice because you could walk away from your stuff and not have to worry about it getting stolen. It's one big party all day long. Again, I wouldnt recommend it for children. But then again, I don't think most of Vegas is really children-friendly! Now for the downside...... Watch out for some of the hotel management!! I should start out by saying they arent all bad. We were checked out by a very nice man who was courteous, helpful and very respectful. If all management were like him, I would have no complaints. But unfortunately, I can't say the same for the gentleman (and I use that term losely) that checked us in. His name was Manuel (dont know his last name). He was a shorter man with glasses and we were told he was a manager. He came off as very nice and courteous at first.....but dont be fooled!! When we checked in, we were asked how many people we would need wristbands for. Because we were having two people join us at the pool the next day, we listed 4 names. He then had me sign my name on an electronic signature pad for my credit card (the electronic pad did not give me amount though). After giving us the standard speech about the location of the elevators blah blah, he vaguely mentioned something about an extra charge for more people. When I asked him what he was talking about, he said that there was an extra charge for the extra 2 people we listed. We asked him what the charge was and he danced around the question and wouldnt give us a straight answer. Once he realized I wasnt leaving until I got a straight answer, he admitted that there was a $50 extra charge PER PERSON PER NIGHT. I asked him if this charge was in what I had just signed for and he said yes. I found it funny (and very sneaky) that he \"forgot\" to mention this BEFORE I signed. I pointed out that we only wanted the wristband and there would not be extra people in our room. Manuel then told me that it would be an extra 50 for each wristband anyways (which was a lie!!) I asked him if this was true even if we rented a cabana and he said yes (which was another lie!) Because I could tell he was not going to be up front about anything, I asked for a print out of the charges to my credit card for the room. Manuel told me \"we dont do that.\" Feeling like he misunderstood what I was asking for, I told him again that I just wanted a copy of my bill to see what the charges were. He again said they didnt do that and that they had no way of printing one. I said again \"So you don't give your guests any record of what you charged them?\" and his response was \"that is correct\". Well anyone who has ever stayed at a hotel before knows that there are printers right at the computer and all hotels will give a guest a copy of their bill!

Surprisingly quiet - despite the party crowd that hangs out here, once you're in the room, you don't hear them. Maybe the people who hang out in the casino can't afford to stay in the hotel... and security is good about keeping non-guests out of the rest of the hotel. 4. Mr. Lucky's remains my go-to restaurant in Vegas. When you want a good meal, fast, and without any BS, go straight to Mr. Lucky's inside the Hard Rock. The $7.77 steak and shrimp is still available (off menu) - just ask. It's not the biggest cut of meat you've ever seen, but it's plenty for me. 5. Nobu is still my favorite for the expense account. 6. If you have the time, you need to go to the pool. 'Nuff said. 7. The curtains overlap each other in the room, so you can actually block out sunlight and get some sleep without having to use some clothespins or a clip hangar to close the curtains. Minuses: 1.

That's $11.95/day. Want to use the WebTV in the room? $5.99/two hours. I didn't bother to open the minibar. 2. The rooms could use a little more light, especially by the closet. 3.

The Hard Rock would not have been my choice but I had business there so it just made sense. Upon arriving I walked to the registration desk and ran into my first problem. When I made the reservation I was told I could pay with a company check that my company was giving me to cover costs. Well, the desk agent then said we do not take checks and told me I would have to go to the onsite bank to get it cashed. So, we grab our 4 bags and walk over to the bank area. After about 10 minutes of questions they were able to cash my check. So we made the short trip back to the registration desk and attempted to check in to our room. Ouch! Unfortunately we were being helped by a new desk agent who wasn't quite ready to be left on her own. Anyway, I told her that I wanted to use the cash to pay for my first 3 nights and would like to use my debit card for the last night. Well, this didn't happen. She ended up running my debit card for the full amount of the stay plus an additonal $100 a day \"security\" deposit. I again told her how I wished to pay for the room and this time she seemed to understand. However, she again ran my debit card. More on that later. So, she gives us the keys to the room and which point I asked her if this was a king room. She then told me it wasn't. I personally called the hotel before our arrival and was told I would have a king sized bed. Well, she said she could do nothing about it but we could have a king bed that was a smoking room. This was unacceptable. Eventually they moved us to an upgraded room (however it turned out this was a smoking room as well). We got to our room and immediately accessed our bank account to see what damage the agent did to our account. It turns out the agent authorized our debit card for over $1200. And all we wanted to do was pay for the last night using this card. Anyway, we went back down to the desk and asked for a manager. Unfortunately he was in a meeting but the another agent at the desk asked if she could help us. Luckily for us she was able to call the bank and release the authorization from our debit card. She was the best part of our experience at the Hard Rock. So, we spent the first 2 hours of our time at the Hard Rock trying to check in and settle our bank account. Not a good start. On the day we were to check out we inquired about a late check out. We were told we could extend our check out to 1:00 pm for an additonal $100.00. The Hard Rock doesn't appear to regard customer service as much as their guests do. Outside of these issues our overall view of the Hard Rock is that it is a small casino, very average restaurants, very tight with the beverage service (on the third day we got our first \"free\" beverage service while gambling), pool area closed and just a lack of customer service.

The Hard Rock is tiny compared to some casino properties. The room was large with a nice pool view. The room colors were not too attractive, sort of a pale green with purple duvets and chair. Vegas hotels sure take a beating. Guests just tear up rooms. So, considering it was Vegas, I give the hotel a little slack. The condition of the room was just fine, for Vegas. There was a huge plasma TV (with working sleep timer) in the room. Nice. The double bed (2) was comfortable. The bathroom had horrible lighting for daytime makeup but the tub was HUGE and clean. It was maybe 24\" deep and 6' long. There was a rain type shower head which many people love... I do not like them that much but it worked and thank goodness there was enough water pressure to rinse my hair. We had an event at Body English. Really nice place. Ugly people... this is the place for you! The lighting is so flattering, EVERYONE looked pretty good! The meeting services were good... food was good. The location is actually good, in my opinion.

I do not party like I used to and don't want to, but, where else can you immerse yourself in good rock, party in the casino, eat in fun restaurants and not have to worry where the elevator is. On the three occasions I stayed here, I never felt slighted for being dumpy or old and everyone just seemed to be there to have a good time. Same for the staff - always friendly. I think its always dependent on your attitude. A good example - one day I finished business early and went to the pool around noon. It was packed with alot of 20-30 types with only a few like me. A group of guys made some xxx comment at me - I threw it back at them and ended up partying with them the rest of the day. Had a great time.

We are in our late 20's (26,28). We had a great time. The HR treated us well. I have stayed at many other Vegas hotels but none like this. We never felt lost or in a sea of people like other strip hotels. (This hotel Tops THEhotel for overall experience.) Friendliest dealers by far in Vegas. I loved playing cards to good old Rock-N-Roll. Never had more fun playing at the tables. I met lots of good people at the tables. I enjoyed that the casino was much lighter, smaller, and more open than other Vegas Casinos. There were plenty of non-smoking tables open. We really liked the party atmosphere. It was not too much but just right. If you like to play at the tables or the slots I recommend getting a Back Stage Pass (Players Card) before you start gambling. The HR is extremely generous with comps. Most places on the strip do not even let you get a players card unless you play at least $25 a hand. That is not the case at the HR. Once you play for a while just ask the pit boss if you have any comps for food or anything else. They are nice and will tell you yes more than no. Not only that, once you are on that list they will send you special email offers. I just got one that offered rooms as low as $25 in the week and $49 on the weekend! Food at Mr. Lucky's was great. My girlfriend loved the oversized bowl of coffee. Pink Taco was a pleasant surprise. The Guac plate was perfect. The room was good. The carpet was a little wet (from the steam clean) when we checked in, but at least I knew it was clean!! Loved the french doors opening to fresh mountain air. I am glad I brought some CD's for the Bose stereo. I did enjoy the large plasma and the live concert channel was showing Woodstock. The bath tub looked new and was a great excuse to just relax a little. The pool was very nice escape. I will say that we were lucky to get an umbrella. With out that we would have fried. I had a few celeb sightings. Tommy Lee, Dave Navarro, and Wee Man. I missed Mike Tyson on a couple of occasions. Overall I think the HR is the place to be in Vegas.

The music in the casino was great, my friends and I sung along to all of it and didn't find it too loud.

Mr. Lucky's was a big hit with all my friends especially the chicken fingers...if you're on a budget you can eat for under $10 a person here, we were more concerned with spending our money on alcohol. There is also a strip mall across the street with other cheap food options! Rehab the pool party was crazy but an amazing time everyone needs to experience it! The Rock Spa is good as well we spent an afternoon their and enjoyed our whole experience! I would advise signing up for the players club at the Hard Rock you get $10 free slot play and $25 match bet and a few other nice perks.

Also, mountain view actually means airport view. Don't do it, unless you really need to save the money. A couple of other things in our room were broken. We complained and eventually got moved to a suite on the pool side. Nice!! Separate living room, huge bathroom with jetted tub, etc. We had room service. I wanted the tuna steak sandwich that I had gotten at the pool the day before, but it wasn't on the menu, but they brought it to me anyway. I think we got much better treatment in the suite. We were 2 single girls, age 28. There were hardly any other women at the hotel. Every time we sat down to gamble, some guys from another table would try to get us to go over to their table. We were there mid-week. At first, we didn't like it bc it was too far from the strip, the shuttle service is limited, and taxi rides were adding up. But by Thursday we didn't want to leave! the hotel definitely takes on a different attitude as you get closer to the weekend. The highlight of our trip was on the last night, when we came in at 5 am, two members of Green Day were playing at the $5 blackjack table. They saw us checking them out and invited us over to play with them. Very cool!! I would stay there again, but it is so expensive during the weekends, which are the really fun time. I wouldn't recommend it for your first trip to Vegas, since it is a good way from the strip, unless you don't mind paying $10 for a taxi numerous times a day. We ate at Mr. Lucky's several times.

I guess that The Hard Rock likes the \"dark\" look. At night, I think 'dark' can be cool...but it feels sort of vampire-like when it's sunny and gorgeous outside during the middle of the day. The Hard Rock, as you might expect, plays loud rock music. That's OK, except when you need to communicate with someone...like the front desk personnel. Speaking of, there was a long line at check-in...and it moved slowly. When I finally got the counter, I was surprised that I was not greeting warmly or with a half-smile. The front desk representative seemed like she would rather have been anywhere else rather than doing what she was doing. That's a turn-off. I asked a question, and she seemed annoyed to have to answer it. I knew at that moment that the stay might be problematic. The room was fine. It looked somewhat \"worn,\" as the hotel is obviously constantly busy with lots of young partiers. I ate in the more casual, cofee shop-style restaurant for a late dinner one night.

It takes about 25 minutes to walk to the strip, or the hotel has a shuttle, or there are always lots of taxis available. The room was awesome! It is a slightly above average sized room for Vegas. We had a room with a pool view. The beds were very comfortable and the Bose stereo, big screen plasma TV, and stocked mini-bar were great extras! It was nice that the shower and toilet were separate from the sink and mirror. The only complaint I would have was that the bathroom floor didn't seem completely clean. There were spots on the tile (what looked like water spots from people getting out of the shower), but it wasn't a big deal as we were only there for a night and I always lay down towels anyway. The pool was the part of the hotel that I was most excited about so we tried it the next morning. It was wonderful! There was plenty of loungers on either sand beach areas or tiled areas. The \"sand\" however is more like rocks (I guess to keep it at the edges of the pool and not in the filters) and really hurt my feet so I had to keep sandals on when I walked on it. There are waitresses who will bring you drinks and food. The cabanas looked great with chairs, a fan and fridge and music, but we didn't rent one because we were only there for a quick visit.

I've always enjoyed my visits to the Hard Rock but this was the first time I actually stayed at the hotel. Let me attempt to clear up some of the complaints. The unfortunate thing about these reviews is that a hotel can be unfairly criticized for issues that are out of its control. Vegas is a tremendously popular destination, especially on weekends. As a result, there will be lines at check in, waits at restaurants, etc. Also, stop complaining about the casino taking your money, because you lost your shirt has nothing to do with the quality of the hotel. My check-in just happened to be quick and pain free, but yes, the $5 resort fee is ridiculous and unnecessary. I've read many complaints about the rooms, most of which I found to be blown out of proportion. Our room was equipped with a flat screen tv, Bose Wave radio w/ cd player, digital safe, iron & ironing board, & web capabilities. There were various cd's in the room to listen to and rock n' roll photos throughout. The best feature in the room was the window/door that actually opened up to the outside. I know of no other major Vegas property that has fresh air access. One reviewer complained that the alarm clock was bolted down and that it somehow cheapened the feeling of the hotel. The 'alarm clock' in question was actually a $300 Bose Wave Radio so you can understand why they might bolt it down. The water pressure in the shower was poor but otherwise it was a clean, comfortable room. I think a lot of people who don't regularly travel to Vegas need to understand that it's only been in the last decade that the hotels have been creating standard rooms with luxury in mind. In the past, the idea in Vegas was the more time people are in the rooms the less time they'd be spending in the casinos, shops, restaurants, etc so they never put much emphasis on amenities. As the high end casinos become more and more competitive, they've had to seriously upgrade the quality of the rooms to keep their clients coming back. Unfortunately, the Hard Rock was completed just prior to the onset of this change in philosophy. Nonetheless, this is still one of my favorite Vegas properties. It is small and manageable and I fit right in with the target demographic (under 35, single, rock n' roll fan).

In the last few years, I've stayed there 2-3 times per year. I was at the 10 year anniversary weekend. Whenever someone asks me where I stay in Vegas, I enthusiastically say \"The Rock!\" But my enthusiasm is starting to wane. With the exception of a few select hotels in this world, most hotels have problems in one form or another. So my expectations are not unrealistic. And as a result, I've overlooked a few incidents I've had at the Rock over the years (such as the time we checked into our room and found food beneath the sheets). Because in general, the staff is friendly and responsive. And it's just a cool place to be. But problems are definitely starting to surface. The rooms are starting to look a bit worn down (and some of them have a very strange scent). I don't appreciate being told that there are no tables available at Body English one month in advance, while also being told that they don't reserve tables more than a week in advance. It also bothers me that I get no preferential treatment whatsoever when I know that I stay there more often than 95% of their guests and regularly spend $1000+ in the casino in a night. Each visit feels like the first time. And their website -----. But I do love the restaurants - Nobu is one of my favorites. I love AJ's - I've eaten there multiple times and have never had anything close to the bad experience described in another review on this site. I also like the Rock Spa and Brannon Salon. And the casino is one of my favorites in Vegas because it doesn't feel like you're gambling with 10,000 of your closest friends (or their kids). I've also always liked the Rock's location off the Strip, which creates an atmosphere that attracts more locals and young people from the Southwest, and less tourists or kids. So while I haven't officially written this off as my Vegas hotel of choice yet, I am shopping around for other options (and the Palms is not a viable option...don't get me started on that...). To start, I'm checking out THEHotel in a couple weeks. And I'm looking forward to the W Hotel that is supposed to open across the street from the Rock in a couple years.

After the letter I have some additional info that you should read. Dear Mr Morton, Thank you for asking for my comments about my stay. I would like you to know that I travel frequently, I have visited over 20 countries, and I spend 20-30 days a year in hotels with three trips a year to Las Vegas and that this was my second stay at your establishment. I will tell you about my stay as events occurred chronologically. For starters, your online hotel reservations system is buggy. I made a reservation and for some reason it was automatically cancelled and re-reserved. I had to call to confirm my reservation. Also, I do not know why you do not include the $5 \u201cresort fee\u201d into the cost of the room. Am I going to be nickel and dimed at every turn? Is there an option of not paying the \u201cresort fee\u201d? If so, why was I not notified? What\u2019s next, a bathroom fee? You could raise more revenue by requiring guests to place a quarter in the bathroom door. Is this a classy resort or a cheap motel? Upon arriving, the check-in line was short and I was able to get to a representative within 10 minutes of standing in line. The representative was professional, kind and courteous. Upon arriving in my room, I noticed that the carpet was still wet. While I appreciate that you shampoo your carpets, I feel you should wait until they dry before renting them out. It was somewhat uncomfortable to walk on it with bare feet. The carpet was a very cheap looking green/yellow and not the deep purple I remember from my last visit, but I suppose this is just a matter of taste - some people like the color of vomit. The bathroom was tiny, there was mold in the shower, the bar holding the curtain was rusted, the bowl was stained and the sink drained very, very slowly. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room and restocking towels and other supplies. I appreciate that there is a free room safe. I was impressed by the large flat screen TV in the room. One peculiarity of the TV is that once it was turned on, it became progressively louder and louder and the remote did not control the volume until it became uncomfortably loud. Also, reception on many channels was poor. Maybe you should include some aluminum foil and rabbit ear antenna so we can get better reception. My impression kept diminishing as I noticed that the alarm clock was bolted down. Do you really think we\u2019re going to steal the alarm clock? I cannot remember the last time I stayed at a hotel that bolted things down to prevent them from being stolen. I\u2019m starting to get the feel that this place is more of a cheap motel. I thought it was great that you have a refrigerator in the room, but I didn\u2019t realize that it was sensors and that if you touch anything in there, you will get charged for it even if you put it right back. I know you don\u2019t have a poker room even though on my last stay more than a year ago I was informed that a poker room was planned. This is understandable because poker is not very popular and no one likes to play (sarcasm intended). When I called the front desk to ask about the nearest casino with a poker room, I was misinformed that Terrible\u2019s has one. I eagerly went there and found out that I was lied to and that they do not have a poker room. The next day at the pool was another disaster. At every hotel I have stayed at in every country in the world I was able to order drinks and food by the pool by just mentioning my room number and my last name. Not at your classy joint. There I was told that I would need either my ID or cash to purchase drinks. So, back to the room it was. Later, at about 4:15 I decided to order some food but the pool waitress informed me that the kitchen is closed. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done your accounting, but I was surprised that the kitchen would close so early considering the sun is still out until after 7pm this time of year. Oh well, your loss \u2013 I spent my money elsewhere. To top everything off, I clicked on the survey in this email and after I submitted it, I got a bunch of gibberish. Considering all else, this came as no surprise. As I mentioned earlier, I have visited Las Vegas many times and I have stayed at the Flamingo, Bally\u2019s, Excalibur, Aladdin, Mirage, MGM, Stardust, Sahara, the Las Vegas Hilton and of course, the Hard Rock. I would recommend many of the hotels on this list, but certainly not yours. I\u2019ll stay at the Palms next time. You can contact me if you need any clarifiacation.

The pool is rented for Private Parties EVERY evening/night, which means that it effectively closes at 4pm, when staff start to move you all to one end of the pool and then remove all sun beds and generally hassle you so that you leave. This can lead to confrontations between staff and guests that refuse to leave so early! There are hidden charges for everything! A resort charge of $5 /day is automatically added to your bill and it costs more than $20 to use the gym.

But this visit my friend and I decided to change it up and stay and the Hard Rock. We felt it would be a fun place to stay and be with others in our own age group. After check-in we ask the front desk about putting our name, as guest of the hotel, on the list for Body English. She told us to speak with the concierge. We did. He said a host would be calling us in our room. We did receive a call and he informed us our names were on \u201cthe list\u201d for Saturday and Sunday nights. Saturday night we were too exhausted to go out, but Sunday night we made it down there. We approached security and told him we were on the list and where did we need to go. He said, \u201cWe should go to the bar, get a drink and stand in this huge line of others who were on \u201cthe list\u201d. We got drinks and stood in line. As we stood there for 1 \u00bd hours, we watched and listened to security tell people that the club was locked down, it was full to capacity and they weren\u2019t letting anybody in. During that 1 \u00bd we must have seen him and some of the hosts let in approximately 200 people. These people would come up and say they knew this person or that person. Next thing you know, they are going in with many others in their group. As you can imagine, this was very disconcerting to us. We then decided not to wait any longer and we went back to our room. I am sure had we given any one of the security officers some money would have been allowed in, as we saw this going on also. In addition to the fiasco at Body English, Saturday afternoon I was retuning to the pool from my room and one of the security officers, was very rude to me, as I was entering the pool area. As I was walking back to my chair at the pool, I stopped another security officer to talk to him about this officers horrible behavior. He claimed he was the \u201csecurity manager\u201d. I tried to tell him what happened, he was very disinterested and not any more pleasant than the first one. Not only is the security staff dreadful, but many of the bartenders and the waitress are also, especially at the pool. Friday afternoon we were in the pool, I asked four different members of the staff if they would get a waitress for us. We probably waited 2 \u20133 hours when one finally came by. And then she was extremely rude to us once we did order. And it wasn\u2019t just my friend and I that had trouble with the staff, we heard many other guests complain about some of these same issues. In the guest rooms the beds are very comfortable and very nice. But our sink and tub had an awful drainage problem. The tub took probably 30 \u2013 40 minutes to drain. Luckily there were only two of us. It would have been a horrible scene had we had more people staying in the room with us. I would think the Hard Rock would want their staff to provide good service to the guests. I would imagine they would want return guests and them to tell others how wonderful their stay was. I was absolutely amazed at the dreadful treatment my friend and I received during our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel. I sent a letter to Peter Morton at the Hard Rock and I did receive a phone call from one of his Vice President's. We discussed the situation for a few minutes and he offered a complimentary stay. I told him why would I want to do that!!!!! I told him I would discuss his offer with my friend and see what she thought, since it wasn't just my weekend that was ruined. He said, okay, and to call him back. I called back and left him a message. I never heard back from him. I then sent him a letter and still haven't heard back.

I did all my gambling there & ate at Mr. Lucky's & Pink Taco. I even made it out to the pool to take a look-which I'm not sure how I managed to gain access to at the time, not having a room key, which they checked each time on my recent visit-The pool is amazing, & it was the reason I choose to book a room here on my vacation to Vegas. From 9am until 6pm I would just lay out in the sun by the pool & order a Corona or dive in once I got too hot. The eye candy at the pool is truely amazing! Hot girls everywhere! It was like Spring Break in Cancun! And don't think that the pool is just someplace for celebrities & models under 30, there was a wide array of different people hanging out at the pool when I was there. Families even, with kids. As long as you don't mind loud Rock music-which you can even hear underwater in a certain area of the pool-and feel comfortable in a Rock N' Roll, laid back atmosphere, then you'll fit in just fine at the Hard Rock. I for one, loved all the music they played at the pool, 95% of which seemed to fit into the \"Rock\" category, either Alternative, Hard Rock, 90's Grunge, 80's, or Classic Rock from the 60's & 70's. I did hear a Dean Martin song one day, which was played right after the Scorpion's \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\", an interesting segue. The rooms at the Hard Rock are equally awesome as the pool. Flat screen Phillips TV's in a large room with pictures of Jimi Hendrix & Keith Richards on the wall, all decorated in a Nordic Minimalist style. One of the cool things about the TVs, is the muisc they pump in on several channels, as well as the Music DVD's they sceen on other channels. It was cool to watch old concert footage of Led Zeppelin on a huge flat screen TV when I came back to my room after gambling late one night! If youv'e read any of the other reviews, youv'e no doubt heard about the mini barrs in the rooms. The Front Desk staff are quick to point out that they are on motion sensors, & you will be charged if you move anything, so be warned. But $5 for a Corona is not bad, only $.50 more than at the bars downstairs. Keep in mind that Vegas is just like New York or LA, everything is more expensive, just accept that, & you will be prepared for your trip! A few other observations about the hotel; they will probably never have your room ready if you arrive before 2pm, I was on an early flight & got there at 11am. They did give me a key so I could go hang out at the pool, though. Just somthing to keep in mind should you arrive as early as I did. The Sportsbook bar was very cool also. If you gamble at least a dollar per hand on the video machines in there, they'll comp your drinks, so at worst you'll have gambled for free for a half hour or 45 minutes & paid for your drinks with the money you lost! Loved being able to watch like 8 baseball games at once, too! I'd love to be there during NFL season! Other cool things of note nearby are the Hofbrau House (German Beer Hall & Restaurant) across the street, as well as a small market (white building, red lettered sign) that will sell you sun tan lotion, aloe vera gel, soda, & almost anything else you could buy at the Hard Rock for half the price (suntan lotion @ Hard Rock=$10.95, at the market $5.95). You can probably buy beer there much cheaper, but you'd have to be discreet about bringing it back to the hotel, as that is strictly forbidden, & they have security watching the elevators in the evening, so I guess if you must drink as cheap as possible, bring it in in the daytime! I prefer to get my drinks at the circle bar or the sportsbook bar though, especailly if you gamble, & do well, they are pretty much free down there anyways! I did have 2 beers from the minibar, though. One right when I checked in & another the last night after I finished gambling. Oh yeah, if stripclubs are your thing (bachelor parties, guys night out, etc), Club Paradise is also across the street, you can walk there versus paying $35 roundtrip cabfare to somewhere else. Decent club, although you will probably go through your winnings quickly! One thing is for certain after my last visit to the Hard Rock, I will never stay anywhere else in Vegas again!

I've stayed at quite a few Vegas hotels like Excaliber, NYNY, Tropicana, San Remo (soon to be Hooters Casino), the Orleans and the Palms. I don't know why I keep coming back to The Rock but I do. I love the pool and on Sundays they have a pool party called Rehab. I would not stay at the Hard Rock when the pool is not open, that's what they are known for...the pool. I would say the service at the Hard Rock is not all that great but they are known for that. And it's all good. It's a party house. From Body English the club(formally Baby's), the Joint (Beacher's Madhouse Comedy Show is great), to the circle bar. AJ's steakhouse is great....best shrimp cocktail and crabcakes in town. Like I said Rehab pool parties on Sundays is the bomb!!! Lots of eye candy for both men and women. It's worth taking a later flight back home or leave on a Monday. Rehab is open to the public but you would have to wait in long long lines (sometimes 3-4 hours on 3 day holidays). The Hard Rock is not a place where you want to get some sleep....um you're in Vegas....sleep when you get back home. You'll hear people crashing the symbols down the hall (there are drum symbols on the walls), to room parties to little naughty room action if you know what I mean. Don't be offended if you smell some strange cigarette smell down the halls. Like I said it's party house and don't bet on getting 1st class service. It does seem like half the OC are there on the weekends. You'll see a lot of fake boobs and lots of wanna-be Nick and Jessica's out there. You'll see a lot of whale tails (thongs that show when ladies sit) just walking around. There is a strip club across the street (Club Paradise) and some of the girls come to the circle bar after their shift to make some extra $$$. This is the most sinful casino in Vegas. It is off the strip and advise you not to walk especially in the Vegas heat. There is a shuttle that drops you off at MGM, Ceasars Forum shops, Fashion Mall. If you want to take a Taxi sometimes it would cost you a lot depends on where you want to go and how bad the traffic is. Best advice, if you can probably share a cab with someone going to another hotspot. Just yell out \"who's going to Drai's, anyone wanna share a cab to the Palms\" etc. Good way to meet up with some hotties that night. The taxi lines can get really long but they do move fairly quickly. I would try to find a taxi on the side of the casino then walk your way to the taxi line. Many taxi's drop off people on the side then you can grab that taxi. If you need some business work done or to print a a boarding pass for your flight, there is a kinko's nearby. I print out my boarding pass the morning I leave therefore I do not need to get to the airport 2 hours early. That's more time for me at the pool. Well hope this helps.

After living in Las Vegas for 61/2 years, I have visited my share of Hotel Casino's. Hard Rock Hotel Casino is by far one of the KeWLeST casino's here. This has become a second home to me. I am known by alot of the staff. I have come across some bad apples with attitudes, but never let that effect my opinion of the place in general. The staff in Mr Lucky's are always awesome to me. Scott in particular gave the best service I have ever received. He has no problem making even your typical local feel like a VIP! Kudo's to him. Most of the dealers are friendly, some have had attitudes but dealing with thousands of drunk tourests daily, people spilling drinks on the table, people bending cards, smoking at the table (not all dealers are smokers) well, you get the idea. Anyone can have a bad day. I have seen more guest's that pissed me off then I have dealers. If you really want to have fun, track down a dealer named Bam Bam, this guy is a ------ to sit at a table and play with. Trust me he will make it for a fun experience.

Leather walls and leopard print carpet, funky. The rooms are in great shape, kept clean and fresh looking. The entire hotel is spotless. Security - At night, there is a security guard posted at the elevators checking roomkeys. no room key - no elevator. The music rocks. It is just awesome to hear classic rock everywehere you go in the hotel. The pool........the whole beach club area is amazing. From the sandy beach that extends right into the pool, to the swimup bar and blackjack tables........it is a great place to hang out. The BOSE alarm clock in the room was spectacular. 102.7 is an all 80's radio station and to have that music on that clock radio every morning was a great way to wake up. The entire staff was tremendously upbeat and accomondating. The Pink Taco has some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The bed was big and the pillows very SOOOO comfortable. CONS: Booked my room via the web and got a great rate, however my room faced the airport. I was told it was a mountain view room, which it was; the mountains were behind the airport. Extra charges for EVERYTHING. Room Servie adds a $3.00 delivery charge per order. HELLO ??? IT'S ROOM SERVICE. In addition, there is an automatic 18% gratuity added to the bill. Your $9.95 breakfast quickly turns into $14. The mini bar is on a sensor. If you move anything around, you will be charged. Also, upon arrival, I had an iced tea from the mini bar and someone was at my door within 15 minutes to re-stock. Kind of freaky knowing your room is being somewhat monitored. I purchased a sixpack of beer to have in my room. I expected the ice bucket to be filled when i came home back from work that day, but it was not. I assume they are not going to assist you in drinking for cheap at this property. The hotel is not on the strip and the complimentary shuttle stops running at 7pm. you will have to pay for taxi's to get back and forth, it is a pretty good walk from the Hard Rock to Las Vegas blvd. The pool is only open from 9am thru 7pm. So, if you are there for business, you are not going to be able to take a swm at night and enjoy this awesome spot in the hotel. There is a $5.00 per night resort fee added to the room that is supposed to cover the shuttle and pool area. But, again, both shutdown really early.

Visited in June 05 and it was my first trip to Vegas. I'm in my 40's and people kept telling me that the HR caters to a younger crowd. I was worried at first that I might feel out of place. I was wrong to worry. There were a lot of young kids in their 20's and early 30's, but there were also people there my age and even older. The HR was the only place I wanted to stay and I was definitely not disappointed. Booked our room thru Expedia and got a great price. No problems at check in and within 20 minutes of arriving, our room was ready. Room was very comfortable. Great bed and great pillows! The lighting in the bathroom was great, three full length mirrors and a wonderful shower head - one of those \"rain\" showerheads. Within two hours of arriving, we ran into two celebrities - that was way cool. The pool is amazing! Crowded, but not uncomfortably so and very clean. Beautiful people and everyone was so friendly. Service at the restaurants and bars was great. The Center Bar was lots a fun and a great place to hang out on Friday night. The security guys at the elevators at night were not bothersome at all.

Let me just say that taking the following day off from work was the best idea of my life - I needed to catch up on my sleep from staying up basically for 3 straight days!!!! <p> Now, if you're reading this review to decide whether or not to stay at the Hard Rock, it's important to understand who the hotel is meant for. If you are part of a bachelor or bachelorette party or just with a group of buddies and are looking for a great time, this is, hands down, the place for you. The place is rocking 24 hours - every day I was there, I was up until 7 a.m. gambling, drinking at the casino bar and hanging out, and up by 10:00 a.m. to hang out at the pool with absolutely gorgeous women (about 50% of whom have fake breasts, by the way). Let me just emphasize, again, how GORGEOUS the women at the Hard Rock are (and the guys seemed to be good-looking as well, for you ladies). 24 hours a day, they have a really kick-a*s mix of rock music playing in the casino and at the pool. The nightclub in the Hard Rock, Body English, is awesome - it's kinda hard to get in, though, if you're with a group of guys - I only got in because one of the guys I was with is a major player at the casino. (And he couldn't even get all of my group in of about 15 guys, only 5 of us - the rest had to slip the bouncer a good wad of $$ to get in). MTV was there for two of the days we were there - one day we saw Black Eyed Peas, the other Fat Joe - we missed Snoop by a day. Another day I saw the actress Shannon Elizabeth on my floor. Down the hall from us, Run DMC had rented a ridiculously lavish suite for the weekend, and a few of my friends actually managed to get in for a party there one night. All in all, it was absolutely what we were looking for, and I could not have had a better time. Truly, a bachelor party to remember. If you're also looking to book a bachelor party in Vegas, don't look anywhere else!! <p> However, if you're looking to go somewhere in Vegas with your family and kids, or if you're part of an older crowd (my group was late 20's and early 30's), I'd advise you to stay somewhere else. After I get married and I take my family to Vegas, we're sure as heck NOT gonna stay at the Hard Rock.

The bed was very comfortable and the feather pillows were heavenly. The plasma screen TV gave and excellent picture. Housekeeping did a great job of cleaning our room early in the day and responded quickly when asked for more towels. The bathroom was average w/ the shower head being very low so that my 6'2\" hubby had to duck to get under it. It was also a very deep tub and you have to be careful getting in and out if it. The worst thing about the room was the bathroom lighting. It is horrible. It was nearly impossible to put on makeup. I had to put my face right up to the mirror under the small light and even then I couldn't see. I called to see if they had light up makeup mirrors and was told that they did not. My friend also noted that she had a horrible time seeing in the bathroom too. Definitely could use some updated bathroom lighting. The casino was very nice. We were pleasantly surprised. It is small and round. But even better, they had a lot of $5 min. tables which we were thrilled about as they are hard to find at most places. The piped in music was a much better alternative to annoying slot bells and whistles. The music had a lot of variety in the casino and at the pool. The dealers are very nice and made the gambling experience much more fun. The pool is really nothing great. I did not care for the sand beach part. The water temp was great and bar service at the pool was fast and efficient. The loungers were adequate and the pool towels were nice and big. We are in our early 40's and were led to beleive that we would feel out of place here. We did not. In fact we were about the average age of people staying and gambling there.

I very much enjoyed my stay and am planning to return in mid-April of this year. I'm 40-something, but I didn't feel out of place at the Hard Rock in the least. On the contrary, I felt welcome right from the time of check-in. I requested a room in the new tower because I had heard rumors that the bathrooms were better laid out and appointed there. There were two (2) queen-sized beds and they were probably the most comfortable beds that I have had in a hotel anywhere. I was on the mountain-view side of the hotel and could enjoy that view from an extremely comfortable chair. As others have noted, the pool area is beautiful (I found it even more attractive than the pool at Mandalay Bay) and the cocktail servers were always very pleasant. That made it very relaxing to hang out poolside and enjoy a drink while people watching. Hard Rock's casino is probably too small for serious gamblers. I didn't play tables there, but I did kill some time at the slots during the afternoons and had about as much luck on Hard Rock's slots as anywhere else, I suppose. I seem to recall that cocktail service was good, at least when at the times that I was around in the casino. For the record, I would mention that I've been to Las Vegas several times and have stayed in various hotels, including New York-New York, Treasure Island, Circus-Circus, Paris, and theHotel at Mandalay Bay. I wouldn't stay at Circus-Circus or New York-New York again, but Treasure Island would be a remote possibility. I liked theHotel at Mandalay Bay (and MB's pool is nice), but I wasn't awed by the place like so many seem to have been (I got an offer there at the time for $159/night but I question whether I would pay that for it again). The Paris is excellent and its casino is one of the most attractive in Las Vegas, but if you want an attractive pool scene, you won't find it at the Paris. Therefore, stick to the Paris during the cooler months. One final note: I wouldn't recommend Hard Rock for the first visit to Las Vegas. It would be wiser to stay on the strip for better access to explore the other casinos. I've been there and done that, though. I'll stay at the Hard Rock and enjoy a drink at the pool then gamble at the Paris and the other Caesars Palace-affiliated hotels and downtown.

Every time I\u2019m there, we don\u2019t leave the pool until 7/8 PM when it closes\u2026I\u2019ve been chased out of that hot tub at closing time more times than I\u2019d like to admit. It\u2019s just that difficult to leave! Another aspect of the Hard Rock that just sucks you in\u2026the Circle Bar. Again, you\u2019ll meet great people, make friends and the bartenders are great. Get down there early and get a seat. This entire place is so much fun, the last time we were in Vegas, we left the property TWICE\u2026one time to go across the street to the liquor store. The other time was on our last night in town, we forced ourselves to leave and go to Olives at the Bellagio for dinner. While dinner was great, we went right back to the Circle Bar afterwards! My friends and I can\u2019t get enough! On top of all of this, the rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The beds are unbelievable\u2026soft sheets, great pillows, etc. Get a pool view room if you can\u2026it makes a huge difference. We love the French doors, being able to get fresh air in your room is a rarity in Vegas. I personally like the rooms that have vanities outside the bathroom (not sure if this is the older or newer section), makes it easier for two or three girls getting ready.

In our previous trips we always enjoyed the dealers and the casino at the HR so we thought we'd also try the hotel for once. What a great idea it was. We had a large group with 10 people and 5 rooms. They put the 5 rooms right in a row, all interconnecting. The front desk staff was kind and professional. I read several horrible reviews so I was worried about this part- well, don't believe them. Without fail EVERY staff member I encountered in our 4 day stay was great. Again, we are used to the venitian, which had 700 sq foot rooms at about 400/night. So you're getting a good reviewer here. I have high expectations and was NOT let down. The HR rooms will surprise you right away. They are plainly appointed, but the money is put where it counts- the beds. The bed was among the most comfortable I've encountered in any hotel stay. Down comforters, super high quality sheets and fanastic pillows guaranteed a sound sleeping experience. Each room also has a 50 or so inch plasma tv on the wall, which is awesome. If I could complain about anything it would be the complete lack of soundproofing. You can hear every conversation in the hallways and every peep from the rooms next door. Rooms 220-238 or so have administrative offices accross the hall from them, which helped here. It was relatively quiet for us. If you had some partying room next door though, you would not get any sleep unless you were deaf. The casino is unbeatable. I have gambled at almost every major casino downtown and on the strip and have never encountered nicer dealers.

I booked the room through another travel site, in full, on my credit card. I suppose its my fault, but I did not bring this credit card with me to the hotel. Upon trying to check in, I was informed by the clerk that I would not be allowed to because of the absence of the card. Their attitude (expressed to me by more than one employee) was \"there is nothing we can do\" and basically, my only option would be get back on the plane to Los Angeles and get my card. I had never been asked before to present my credit card for inspection before, the hotel always kept it on file. I also had never incurred any incidental room charges or done any damage to any room I stayed in. After much negotiation, I convinced the 'head honcho\" desk clerk (who looked to be about 19) to accept a faxed photocopy of my credit card, front and back. Not an easy thing to get someone to do 400 miles away at 6 pm on a Monday evening. Even though this eventually (3 hours later) got me into the room, the \"Honcho\" made me feel as though his behind was on the line, and he truly was doing me a huge favor and I should kiss his ring. The attitude of the people I dealt with was never \"Lets see how we accomodate you and solve this problem\", it was more like \"Sorry. Next.\" Its amazing how one experience can sour 9 years of fantastic memories. It was surreal. I couldnt beleive that was how the Hard Rock was going to do business.

The historic costumes and guitars displayed were kind of interesting. The musical theme was well done throughout. (E.g.: Zildjian cymbals for corridor light sconces). The lobby is very loud, and the main restaurant was closed for a group, so only breakfast restaurant available was Mr. Lucky's (loud, crowded, smoky and overpriced). One morning they were working on the lobby floor with a jackhammer. Instead, I got room service, which was prompt and very good (expensive, $18.00 for a waffle and coffee, about the same as Mr. Lucky's). I did not eat in the restaurants but friends said the Japanese restaurant was good. At night, security made a decent effort to check for room keys at the elevator. The taxi starters/doormen were helpful. The desk staff was prompt. No check in / check out issues. The casino waitresses are all dressed like hookers in fishnet stockings & leather minipants. Service at the elevated bar, located in the center of the casino, was good and the ever-changing colored lights were cool. Drinks were pretty expensive at the bar and at the gift shop (Coors Light, $3.50. Each.) No minibars in rooms. The room itself was pretty good, with French doors opening onto the pool. However, the jet exhaust from arriving planes and loud music outside prompted me to keep them closed. Live or canned rock music plays continuously in the pool area from 9AM to 10PM.

When we questioned what this was for, we were told it was for the 'free shuttle' (which only runs to the strip between 10am - 7pm on the hour) and 'free local phone calls'. So we are paying $5.45 per day for something we are getting for free we asked? I could tell even the desk clerk was embrassed by the charge and I expect he gets a lot of complaints about it. We had to wait 45 minutes for our room which really wasn't a big deal. While we were waiting we were given pool passes which are basically wristbands which allow you to enter the pool area.

The pool area looked awesome.", "Date": "August 2, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cIt depends on what you want\u201d", "Author": "ljnative", "ReviewID": "UR2346104", "Content": "I am early 30s, a little old to consider myself hip or cool, but I have stayed here twice, both times during the week, and it has always been fine. It is not a place for serious gamblers or people who generally like the traditional vegas scene, but I prefer it because it is less crowded and overwhelming than some of the larger strip hotels. The pool is great, sandy lagoon, water slide, cocktail service, etc. I ate at Nobu and it was ok - Pink Taco good for drinks and a quick bite. All that being said, I would never try to stay here on a weekend. The rates are outrageous and I am sure it is extremely crowded at that time. Also check their concert calendar - you might want to coordinate according to who is (or isn't) playing during your visit!", "Date": "July 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cIt's a great place\u201d", "Author": "DavidPortland", "ReviewID": "UR2299111", "Content": "I'm shocked by all the negative reports on the Hard Rock Hotel. I've stayed there three times and would definitely go back again. Yes the clientele is twenty-something but what's wrong with that. I'm in my late 50's and enjoy being aroung the young folks. I must admit that all my stays have been \"off season\" with no major events going on and therefore extremely reasonable rates ($49-69). Their website is terrific for indicating the days with the best prices. Twice I was able to get a pool view room for just $10 extra. I love the decor and the wooden floors. I haven't tried the \"upscale\" restaurants but have enjoyed the Pink Taco and the 24 hour cafe. During the day when everyone is out at the pool the casino area is quiet, attentive and winning. I've always been impressed with security measures around the elevators at night and never experienced the loud noise and disruptive behavior described by others. One other nice feature is the feee shuttle to the strip. Every driver I've had was courteous and on time.", "Date": "July 14, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hard Rock Hotel and Casino", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d91840-Reviews-Hard_Rock_Hotel_and_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$63 - $249*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4455 Paradise Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "91840", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/b5/f7/e7/paradise-king-room.jpg"}}

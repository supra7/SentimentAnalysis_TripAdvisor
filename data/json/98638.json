Not only did the front desk person not know,they asked two other people and no one had any idea where the meeting room was.

I walked into the room, which apparently used to be a restaurant/bar and was surprised that the overall setup and sound quality of this room. I was pleased that the bathrooms were near, but upon visiting those bathrooms wondered how long it'd been since they had been cleaned. Needless to say, the odor made quite a bad first impression. From there it was all downhill. As I struggled to focus on the conference content due to the sounds of the heater kicking in , because it sounded like an 18 wheeler was driving through the room. The speaker did his best to overcome the negativity of the hotel accommodations, but one can only imagine what the rooms look like if the meeting rooms for this poor. Fortunately it was in my hometown and I did not have to stay at this hotel. One last comment how they claim this is near the Galleria is beyond me. Near would indicate within walking distance and this is definitely not within walking distance.

Without a doubt, all our requests and last minute needs were carried out timely and flawlessly. Our attendees were complimentary of the friendliness of employees, from the cleaning staff to the GM, who actually stood in the lobby on several days and greeted and shepherded our members. I did not receive one complaint about individual sleeping rooms or meeting space or food from any attendee, which is a true measure of the tremendous efforts of the Doubletree staff. The food, oh yeah, the food was a big hit. The two chefs were known to many of the conventioneers and everyone commented on how delicious the food was for all the events. Chef Morris and Chef James will forever be considered the State NAACP favorite chefs. Meal service was timely and done not to disrupt or disturb our presenters. I was always asked when the main entree should be served....this was incredible. The Banquet Manager Clem is the master of getting rooms set-up, banners hung, and food served without a hitch. Let's talk about the facility....I can not say how many times, at the last minute, I called for AV needs and again we received flawless execution. He was always sensitive to the time and followed through on my every request. The Catering Manager, Fran who came in a few weeks before our convention deserves a medal. She made a fan out of my husband and insured on every level the success of our convention.

My room had two lamps and they must have had 30 watt bulbs because the lighting was so dim. When you leave the room after dark, make sure to leave a lamp on because there is no ceiling light near the entryway. Hence, you will have to stumble half-way across a very dark room to turn on one of the lamps if you don't. The concierge service was excellent and so was the food in the restaurant. The restaurant, bar, and lounge area are gorgeous and conducive for relaxation. There's a waterfall, lots of plants, and plenty of private, comfortable seating in the lounge. The equipment in the excercise room is in good shape. However, the room is located in a corner on the lowest level of the building. As a single woman, I didn't always feel safe in there alone.

{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Somewhat Disappointing I'm an annual traveller to Honolulu and stay from 2 weeks to a month. I booked by phone with Hawaiian Condo Resorts. I was warned that this is not a luxury property as I had stayed at the Royal Gardens in 2007 and found it very comfortable.However, I was not prepared for the dirty bathroom, kitchen (thick grease and dead bugs under the kitchen sink) and seriously stained rug. They did send someone in to clean and shampoo a few days after arrival but this should have been done beforehand. It takes valuable time away from your holiday when you have to spend time on the phone making arrangements and then sitting around waiting for them to arrive.I was informed when booking that this was a 'recently renovated' unit and it was anything but with cracked tiles, damaged floors and bedding that did not fit the mattress properly. I understand that there are some fairly decent units in the Marine Surf but I wouldn't book with Hawaiian Condo Resorts again as you cannot trust what they tell you when you can't check things out beforehand.The best thing about the place is its proximity to just about everywhere in Waikiki you'd want to go. Also the monthly rate was low for the location. As far as I'm concerned you benefit most when you're NOT IN the actual hotel.", "Date": "Dec 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR888528054", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "teluogirl"}, {"Content": "Great location The rooms are spacious non-smoking studios with kitchens. While it is not a luxury hotel, we found it very comfortable and clean, with two long double beds which accomodates up to 4, as in our family. The location is great, 1and half short blocks to the beach and the center of the action in Waikiki, walking to all the restaurants and shopping in the area. The International Market Place is right across street next to the Waikiki Trade Center. Parking is available for $5 daily. Matteo's restaurant located in the hotel lobby, was closed for renovations during our 8 day stay, but it is said to be a very good Italian restaurant. The staff was friendly and helpful, and we saved a lot of money by staying here, which was better spent booking tours, sightseeing, and dining at the beachfront restaurants in some of the big hotels. By the way, I recommend Chris from SAV-ON TOURS for your tours and luau, he is located in the Waikiki Trade Center across the street. Toll free: 1-866-729-8016 and be sure to tell him Mrs. Fernandez recommended you and he will give you good prices. I recommend this hotel for families and if you want to budget in your accomodations as you do not pay extra for up to 4 persons, other hotels do charge after the 2nd person.

We arrived late in the evening (11pm) so we had to pay for a late check-in even though they guy only had to cross the street to bring us the keys. We stayed in unit 1605 which was close to the elevator and we were facing Seaside Ave so we just had to look to the right to see the ocean and down to see the pool. There is only sun by the pool from about 11am to 3pm and it closes at 7pm. A parking stall came with our room at no extra charge and that was nice to have as we had a car. Unfortuneatly the first night we were there our brand new convertible was keyed and the staff we not very helpful and said they saw nothing on the surveillance tape. We also received a warning for parking in our own stall but got that cleared up PDQ as well. The staff got friendlier as time passed though and seemed genuinly concerned as to how we made out with our vandalised car.The a/c worked great, many times we shut it off and opened the lanai door as it was getting too cold.I saw roach hotels in the room but I never saw a bug of any kind. I was glad I took dishclothes and teatowels as there were none in the room. Also, there is laundry on every floor but the washing machine on our floor was out of order the whole time. You have to buy a 'laundry' card from the front desk for $5 and load it at a machine in the lobby, its 1.25 to wash and .75 to dry. We had to go and buy pillows as the ones provided were extremely flat. I know I will be leaving some the things I purchased for here in the room but I have no idea if they will stay there. Things I would suggest you take along if renting a private unit is a paring knife, dish and hand soap, dishcloth and teatowel, salt/pepper, cling film/tin foil, laundry soap/dryer sheets and toilet paper and it's expensive here. I guess it depends on the length of your stay. We stayed for 3 weeks.There is also and iron and ironing board and a vacuum as you are on your own, you have to supply your own toilet paper as well.This unit is in a great cenral Waikiki location, close to everything.It can be noisy but that's Waikiki, I don't know if you can find a 'quiet' place there.", "Date": "Mar 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR564332930", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kirababy"}, {"Content": "Smell of Mold -Pubic Hair in Tub Stayed there for one night Oct. 30.

We arrived at around 9:00pm, and the front desk was closed, with no staff around whatsoever. It took us a while to check in.Once we got up to the room, we were shocked to find that it wasn't quite the 'spacious studio loft' that they had advertised it as. In fact, it was quite the contrary. With just two double beds, a table, two chairs, and a dresser (and the ensuite kitchen - which was actually just a counter with a sink, a fridge, and a stove), it was cramped and barely big enough to fit all four of us and all of our luggage. We also discovered that the dresser, which stood about 2 1/2 feet tall, only had 2 drawers. That meant that two of us had to live out of our suitcases for the 2 weeks we were there. Not a good start to our 'family vacation'.I have to mention - you need a key to operate the elevators, which we didn't know when we got there because nobody at the front desk expained this to us. Also, only one of the two elevators was in full working service. That made things quite aggravating, especially if there were a lot of people waiting. It also didn't help that it was a particularly slow elevator.The pool was salt water - yes, SALT WATER! What kind of hotel uses salt water in their swimming pool? Needless to say, the kids weren't too thrilled about that. Also, the pool was no more than 6 x 12 feet, which has to be one of THE smallest pools we've ever seen. It was pathetic. Plus, the positioning of the pool meant that it only got maximum 5 hours of sunlight a day, because it disappeared behind the adjourning buildings at 2:30 everyday.A couple times during our stay, the second elevator broke down, leaving us with no choice but to take the stairs - TO THE 21st FLOOR. We were less than pleased.Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a quality vacation. Although the staff was friendly, the beds were comfy, and the rooms were clean, we expected much better.

Stay was last week of November 2002 and my husband and I were there for a week before going on a cruise. It was our 25th anniversary so this was a special trip and had a great time, both in Waikiki and crusing the rest of the Islands. Hawaii is very beautiful, but a bit expesive for the Canadian dollar!! Location of the hotel was perfect to everything, bus, excursions (which can be booked in the lobby) malls, shops, resturants/bars, Internet Cafe, a bit of a walk to the ocean, but a plesant walk and you can cut through the Royal Hawaiian Hotel (can't miss it , it's PINK!! Hotel views were amasing (17th floor) and had 2 balconies, one city and one ocean view. Flaws: 1. Front desk was closed after 7 p.m. and we arrived at 10 p.m. Security had to call the manager and after a very long flight and a very hot (and humid) night wasn't a great start to our vacation. 2. Had to call for a hairdryer and it was taken away when the maid came in next morning. 3. No microwave, which made cooking in the room more awkward as we had to buy food that had to be either cooked on the stove or oven and despite air-conditioning made the room slighly warm. Groceries are also more expensive and not being able to buy microwave foods made it even more expensive. Ate in 2 nights and eating out is the same as in. depending on your taste. We found out upon check-out we could have rented a microwave for $10. (US), but we had been told there would be one in the room?????????? 4. No resturant in hotel other than an Italian resturant off the lobby, but very expensive. Since it was our anniversary trip, we went and despite the cost (again for us Canadians, was double) the place, the service and the food was excellent!! In all, the hotel was good and knowing the flaws would stay there again.

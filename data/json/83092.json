Where do I start...Fist I show up early so I pay an extra $20 for early check in so they can \"clean\" the room according to them this means leave the pubic hair in the bathtub, the weed on the desk and in the drawer and hair all over the floor in the bathroom. Next they forget to tell you there's construction on the building so you will be woken up at 8am by the sound of a nail gun and generator running. They just turned off the water in my room to top things off!! So I went to check out today but they already had charged me for the day so instead of sleeping in my car I decided since I payed I may as well tuff it out. What a dump!! Lesson learned here and never again...\"Quality\" Inn may have to change the name because there was ZERO quality involved...The people who rated this over 2 stars must be the ones who stayed in our room before we got here and high as kites!!", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cperfect location near Navy Base\u201d", "Author": "SailorMom64", "ReviewID": "UR118935058", "Content": "Son and I stayed here and the room was adequate and economically priced.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGood Value\u201d", "Author": "redanteater", "ReviewID": "UR115633779", "Content": "Our family stayed in the Quality Inn during our trip to San Diego.

As we don't reside anywhere near the area I booked online ahead of time looking for the best quality for the best price. First of all, the hotel is located in NATIONAL CITY--not San Diego. National City is a rough area and my husband was dismayed to find out I booked a hotel there--he is familiar with the good and bad parts of San Diego county. The hotel's directions on their website is vague. We made a few wrong turns getting there. In fact, I overheard a couple in front of me checking in stating the same thing. Not an area you want to be lost in at night. The parking is really really bizarre. The layout is just wrong and it is small so there's a good chance if you plan on arriving late you will have to park on the street out of view from your room--not a good idea in this area. Checking in, the staff were friendly and informative. The room was a nice surprise--roomy for two queens and had a classy look. It had a microwave, fridge, table and a nice sized tv. Only one complaint here. Upon close inspection I noticed the toilet was not completely clean--the part we all sit on to do our thing. Not only that but the toilet seat itself kept sliding when I sat down and I am not a heavy person! Breakfast was just ok. Cold cereal, oatmeal packets, dried out pastries, fruit, sausage links, bagels and bread that the toaster would not toast properly. There was also waffle batter that the waffle iron did not really get crispy on the outside so when trying to peel it off I ended up with a broken up pieces of mushy waffles on my plate. I just remembered one more thing. I don't know if the ceilings are not properly insulated, but we had the first floor and we could hear what sounded like continual stomping above us for at least an hour(it was 9:00pm) before I called the office and asked them to intervene. The first time we called, the front desk made excuses for the nice ladies above us who were getting ready to go out for a night in town. But the noises were so loud for so long I called the front desk again and told them they needed to deal with this ASAP or move the people. Unfortunately, the hotel was completely booked. Would I stay again? Yes, but not before trying to find something in a better area.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Angelo", "Title": "\u201cExcellent bed and good free breakfast\u201d", "Author": "SkinnyDDS", "ReviewID": "UR60915813", "Content": "Reservation thru website; which was correct.

The rooms are decently sized, and the bathrooms were clean, but the beds are very uncomfortable, and our refrigerator didn't work. It was missing the knob on the thermostat, so we didn't know if it was on or off. We got it taken care of, but it was a hassle. I wouldn't stay here again.

We paid $180/night for a room with a single (full size?) bed for Saturday night. Arrived around 4 pm. Assigned to room 302 - third floor above office next to a stairway. Room smelled musty. Went to wash up and head out. Water worked for 5 minutes, then stopped. After trying faucets, toilet, and shower, went downstairs to the front desk where they said the city was working on some pipes and water would be back in 10 minutes. It took 20 minutes. Initial water was brown. Ended up brushing my teeth with bottled water. No apologies from desk person. Water pressure died again when I was washing my face. If there was another room at a reasonable price anywhere in town I would have left to find it. Also, when I used the restroom, there was a t-shirt hanging on the hook on the back of the door. From a previous guest, I assume. I guess housekeeping doesn't clean very thoroughly. I'm also used to places that change the toilet paper roll when it gets below 1/4 roll or so. Not here. Guests should be asked to use ONE parking space when the place is booked up. A few folks with monster trucks felt the need to take 2. When I returned to the room at about 2:30 am, I squeezed into the last space in the lot. A few cars that came in after me were forced to park on the street. Beware of continental breakfast. Noticed on Saturday afternoon that they were restocking for Sunday morning. No wonder the pastries were stale! And something as simple as having a trashcan in the breakfast room (to toss food, jam containers, etc.) might cut down on the insect/rodent problem. The plus side - high ceilings made room (especially bath) feel much larger. I like the green tile in the bathrooms. A bit confusing to find (print out directions on hotel website).

I was so pleased to see a whole bunch of sugar packets instead of the two you usually get. Even two logo'd wine glasses (available for purchase $3 each) and a complimentary cork screw.

To top that off there is both a pool and jacuzzi open to 11:00 PM. Each room has a small fridge, microwave and coffee pot. And they provide a breakfast roll (prepackaged) in AM.

My room was ground level on the back side in the thirties. It was chilly in Napa Valley so I found my room a very chilly 54 degrees upon arrival. After boosting the heat several times I finally found a tolerable temp of 75 degrees by the second day. I was in a king room and worried upon seeing the bed I may need a step stool to get in it. The bed was so high from the ground was actually uncomfortable getting in and out. The bathroom was probably the worst part of the room. The jetted tub was heavy with chipped and peeling paint; not to mention the yellow stain line around most of the tub. Getting in and out of the tub/shower also proved to be difficult as there was about a foot and a half edge....good thing there was a grab bar! Also, the area is pretty safe, however I feel the need to mention there were also sliding glass doors that opened to a shared grassy area.

It has become a destination for both domestic and international tourists. Consequently, room rates for hotels, inns, and B&Bs in this area are quite high. El Bonita motel offers a bit of relief from this never ending price escalation. My wife and I stayed here 5 nights at the end of December with an average room rate of $121 plus 14% tax. There are several different buildings in the motel. We chose a king bed Garden room. The room was fairly spacious, containing 2 big comfortable easy chairs as well as a small glass topped table and chair set that looked like it belonged on a patio. There was a microwave and refrigerator and some dishes. Decor is absolutely \"motel-standard\". It was quite cold during our visit and the management had no problem providing extra blankets. (Recently at several hotels, I have been told that \"there are no blankets available.\" The only negative would have to be the continental breakfast, available from 7:30 to 10:30. There are 4 kinds of cold cereal, instant oatmeal, bananas, apples, and oranges. (The oranges were sporadically available during the 5 days and starting on the 3rd day the bananas were bright green and not edible.) They provide apple juice boxes like you would give your elementary school child and bottles of orange drink. (Water plus sugar plus a little orange juice). Pastries are individually wrapped supermarket type. The clerk told me that the health department did not allow them to put out fresh pastries from the local bakery. On one day there was no milk available for coffee or cereal and the desk clerk said in so many words, \"I can't do anything about it, I just work here\".

It was clean, though, and the bed was comfortable without that annoying 'roll-into-the-middle' feature so common to hotel beds. The bathroom had been recently renovated and was immaculate - with a river rock shower floor and all glass shower wall/door. It passed the most critical test for me - good water pressure and lots of hot water. Being a MO-tel the rooms all border immediately upon the parking lot so people arriving after you're in bed trying to sleep are very much a problem. We always travel with earplugs, though, and that solved the difficulty very nicely. Without earplugs I would have had a lot of difficulty here because of that.

We also had 2 balconies. - the suite was exceptionally clean (I am picky). As others have commented, housekeeping was always available and happy to clean your suite as soon as they knew you were heading out for the day. - balconies were spacious with potted plants, tables and chairs. Balconies were well-tended with walls/floors swept daily - there was plenty of closet/storage space - suites are air-conditioned, though air conditioning was not necessary -bed was very comfortable. Black-out draperies in suite. -free internet access in lobby, free breakfast too though we didn't partake. - property is just a couple of minutes (by car) from the centre of town, a great, central location for wine touring in Sonoma and even Napa.

Its a functional motel room, nothing more. Its too bad other hotels in the area command such a high price because this hotel isn't worth what its cost was (in high season) but its soooo much cheaper than its neighbors.

It's right on Highway 29 just south of St. Helena. When you approach the place it looks quite ordinary and that's part of its charm. We stayed in one of the poolside rooms which is a little misleading as you have to cross the entry loop to get to the pool and spa. The room was small but comfortable and very clean. We enjoyed the pool, spa area. It was very well maintained but quite noisy as it's right beside the highway. We had a glass of wine in the garden area away from the highway where it's quieter. The continental breakfast was average. I guess what really makes this place is its location as it's close to downtown, good restaurants and some of the best wineries in Napa Valley.

We stayed in a poolside Queen room but next trip we'll choose a suite. The place is a definte bargain and well located near winery's, restaurants and the town of St. Helena. The room was clean and furnished to include a microwave and small refridgerator. Unfortunately, the chairs were very small and uncomfortable so no place to sit other then the bed. The TV was very small too but reception good. The continental breakfast was slightly different everyday and very nice with an outside patio and fountain. The pool and hottub were also very nice. I would stay here again but choose a larger suite type of room. The only downside was the service. The staff does not appear to be very experienced and appears to lack enthusiasm and had limited knowledge about the attractions in the area.

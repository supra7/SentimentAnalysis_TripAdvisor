{"Reviews": [{"Content": "would not return There was no continental breakfast. They served a standard bacon egg plate to everyone. I cant eat eggs, so was served stale cereal, and no toast. The restruant has very small menu, and expensive for what you get.An entire unit has burned nearly to the ground, next to the pool. This has not been repaired or removed or fenced off. They didnl't inform us of this when we registered over the internet. Only one ice machine was in use, and it couldn't keep up.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR857325744", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lucky19"}, {"Content": "\"Rooms should be Rented by the HOUR, not the Day, It's Just that kind of Place\" Rooms should be rented by the hour, not the day, it's just that kind of place, stained carpet, missing bedside table lamps, broken parts loose in refridge, door hinges loose and rusted to point you have to force bathroom door shut, unfinished edges to tile on jacuzzi platforms(should have used bullnosed tile), plastic rubermaid kitchen type steps to get into jacuzzi tub mounted 3 feet in the air(careful don't slip),old decor, old building, old furniture, we booked for 8 nights and stayed 1, but had to pay for 2, because I waited till other hotel room at the Courtyard Marriott was ready to move into before we moved. Took hotel manager on tour of room, she agreed that room was definitely unrentable, but didn't refund my money. She said this is what she needs to hear so she can fix things, I suggest she get off her butt and walk thru rooms and look for herself. A Hotel worth the gas to drive past even at today's prices !!!", "Date": "Apr 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR906523870", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "johnmig"}, {"Content": "A++++++ Great owners and a most pleasant stay.

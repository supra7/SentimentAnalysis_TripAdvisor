It was a good value for the price. If you are looking for a fancy resort...this is not the place for you. If you want a good nights sleep, very friendly and helpful proprietors, very clean accommodations...this is your place! The people working there could not have been any friendlier!!! They were very also very helpful. I WILL STAY AGAIN!!! You are close to town and also close to Silver Dollar City. HOWEVER, Silver Dollar City was 5.5 miles away, not 3 miles away. But, that was not a problem for us. I also want to make everyone aware that the motel DOES have WIFI access. It is not mentioned in their ad, but they do have it. So if you have a laptop and want to use it while your there..bring it,, you can use it.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monroe, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cWe are repeat customers\u201d", "Author": "cnh624", "ReviewID": "UR128677609", "Content": "Quiet location, peaceful setting, comfortable room had us return.

It might be 5 miles as the crow flies but driving was a good 10 miles. When we went to check in there was a note on the door to wait 10 mins to check in due to laundry needing to be done. I totally get needing to do laundry but when we drove down to the laundry to ask to check in she made us wait until she was done because the laundry would not be there later I guess. Then the second night our keys all stopped working all three of them. When I went to get new ones I had to wait for her to wait up and she was super rude about it. They only made the bed one time during our 3 night stay. Our friends stayed at deerrun which is a better hotel and closer to tablerock and silver dollar city. Save your money and stay somewhere else. The breakfast was also gross! And also the internet was down most our stay.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wichita, KS", "Title": "\u201cExceeded Expectations by far!!\u201d", "Author": "jurny1", "ReviewID": "UR115329230", "Content": "We stayed at the Econo Lodge (Branson West) for one evening for July 4th Holiday. We had a condo reserved, but our schedules changed and we were able to head out a day early. The condo was booked so I searched for a hotel in the area. Either the hotels were requiring a minimum of 2 or 3 nights, or they had jacked their rates up astoundingly!! I found the Econo Lodge and I have to admit, was a little apprehensive because I have never stayed in one and the rate was $45.00 for a Holiday weekend! We went ahead and booked and I am definitely not sorry. We had wonderful service! The room was honestly one of the cleanest rooms I have stayed in for a motel. You could tell great care had been taken to make it this way. On top of that, I had lost my wallet in the room and we had already left for Tablerock. The owner not only called and left a message assciated with my reservation, but she knew we were just starting our vacation, so she did some investigating and tracked me down through my work number. I was so incredibly relieved. If we find ourselves in the area again I would not hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malden, Mo 63863", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!!\u201d", "Author": "misterzip43", "ReviewID": "UR78411222", "Content": "This was the third motel we stayed in during our trip.

I am glad that my family decided to stay here. We had a wonderful stay. It did take a bit longer to find the hotel than we expected, but we didn't google as we should have. We called the hotel and they appologized for no road signs on the hwy. The state hadn't put any up and the hotel was in the process of putting one up. After receiving directions, we had no problem. Upon check-in the I was a bit flustered because my five year-old was having a breakdown. Erin didn't take a nap on the drive and was rather cranky. The owner quickly checked us in. She also gave recommendations on things to do and places to eat. When we went to our room (we had two queens) we were plesantly surprised by the cleanliness. The beds were comfortable and the towels were soft. The continental breakfast was good. I wasn't expecting a Bob Evans meal, because that isn't what we paid for. Erin loved the mini muffins.

I'm TELLING you!!!\u201d", "Author": "fangclub", "ReviewID": "UR4035459", "Content": "We booked this hotel online a few weeks before we went on our anniversary trip. It was a gamble, and we crapped out! We had a tough time finding the place, to start. When we booked, we were told that it was \"just down the road from Silver Dollar City\". \"Down the road\" is about five miles. When we arrived, no one was there to greet us. We had to get back in the car and drive down to the nearest gas station to find a restroom instead of going to the one in our room. When we came back, we still had to wait for ten minutes before anyone came to the desk to check us in. When we were finally checked in, the lady (and her annoying little yappy dog) complained the whole time about missing her soaps. The office building apparently is also her house. The room was comfortable and clean, the alarm clock and TV worked fine and the hot water was hot. However, we had an electric cooler that we kept my wife's medicine in and the only outlet we coud fit it near was by the door. Problem is, when you threw the light switch it cut power to the cooler as well. We told the front desk about it and they said they would pass it on to the housekeepers. The housekeepers kept turning off the light switch and nearly ruined my wife's medicine and, therefore, our trip. The \"free continental breakfast\" never was. The breakfast room, in the basement of the building, was never opened and we had to go out to eat. Parking was a problem, too. It looked loke there were only two other rooms in our building being used, so naturally, they put one in the room immediately next to ours on the ground floor and one directly above us. The other folks brought at least two vehicles with them and we had to park almost halfway down the building from our room. When we checked out we had to go through the waiting game again, and when it was all over, we couldn't get out of there fast enough. Never again will we subject ourselves to this place, nor will we let others be subjected to it (hence, this review). Save your money and your piece of mind, STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!", "Date": "October 19, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Econo Lodge Silver Dollar City", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g44161-d96620-Reviews-Econo_Lodge_Silver_Dollar_City-Branson_West_Branson_Missouri.html", "Price": "$52 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">State Route 13</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Branson West</span>, <span property=\"v:municipality\">Branson</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MO</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">65737</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "96620", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3f/65/3f659cd8c436e6ff74abfd8bd9360b383large.jpg"}}

He asked us about our day and what we were going to do which I thought was wonderful as some places do not take the time to make you feel at home. This place was delightful.

Castello di Amorosa (castle/winery) is a must to see! We ate dinner at the Calistoga Inn & Brewery and Kelly recommended ordering the Yankee pot roast, which was excellent. No lie...it was to die for. Tip: the \"small plate\" would be enough to feed two people. Before we checked out of the hotel, we had a hot breakfast of waffles, eggs, sausage, fruit, muffins, cereal...and much more.

Do I judge them based on their standard rate, or should I review them based on what I actually paid to stay there? I lean towards the former, and so I will judge this property based on it's advertised rate. On that scale I think it falls short. Admittedly it is an expensive area, but the property is dated and generic. The hotel is functional, the staff is polite. It's within walking distance of downtown, but be aware that for half of that distance there is no sidewalk, there is just a very wide shoulder on the road.There is a complimentary breakfast, but on the morning I was there the lobby was so packed with guests it was a hassle. The coffee was so bland that my companion and I drove into downtown Calistoga to buy more acceptable coffee to start our day. (and I wouldn't consider us coffee snobs) The wood in some areas is showing it's age. A couple boards in the stairs were flexing quite a bit and a board on our balcony made me wary of standing on it. Speaking of the balcony: it was cute but it fronted the main road, so the main view was of cars and the glass didn't do much to block the sound of traffic, even at night. Speaking of noise, the walls are very thin. While we couldn't make out words (thank goodness) we could tell every time the people in the room next to us were talking, or snoring. The cleanliness was less than hoped for, with multiple hairs on the wall in the shower. It took almost 10 minutes for the water to turn warm in the morning. When we turned the heat on at night, the obvious scent was of barbecue sauce. None of this would have mattered at a cheap motel.

One room with 2 beds, one room with a king size bed and one suite were utilized during the stay. This area of California is very expensive, though I was still shocked to learn how expensive the rooms are at this Comfort Inn. That said, for a Comfort Inn, the rooms were roomy, the beds were comfortable, the linens and towels were high quality and the staff was accommodating. The housekeeping were cleaning our rooms before we left for the adventures of the day. The room keys, though, were awful. They usually didn't work, having to try over and over again before it would take. Having to go to the front desk at least 3 times to get them remagnetized. The pool was great, naturally heated. I wasn't bothered by the green color, as the water felt so good. The jacuzzi was also very nice. The chaise lounge chairs were ok. The three times I was at the pool area, in the late afternoon, it was mostly just my family at first before others arrived. The location to the little town of Calistoga is convenient and walkable, though there are no sidewalks. Because of this we would drive into town for dinner, not walking to walk on the side of the street at night with kids. Though I did the walk myself 3 times during the day and it was ok. I also went for jogs in the morning over on the Silverado Trail road up the street from the Inn, which also didn't have sidewalks but was very quiet and lovely that time of the day, before the wine tours begin. The breakfast was plentiful, though standard. There were hot eggs and sausage and you could request a waffle be made for you. Otherwise it was breads, cereal, yogurt and oatmeal. The Inn also offers a computer in the breakfast dining area for free, which was convenient to be able to check-in on line and print our boarding passes. The suite could use an upgrade, as the little kitchen didn't provide any plates, glasses or utensils, there was no microwave and the sink leaked. Also the air conditioner was old. It was nice they had a dvd player in the suite and the room proved useful as a gathering place for the family. Keep in mind there is no elevator, just stairs, and the courtyard setting can be bit noisy with people/kids congregating in the courtyard throughout the day. Also, the speedway is nearby and when they have races, you can heard the very loud cars buzzing all the way up to after 10p at night. I believe they only have races certain times of the year, and would imagine the other hotels on that side of the street have the same problem as it's also close together.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, Canada", "Title": "\u201cInexpensive but basic\u201d", "Author": "PeachyPeterborough", "ReviewID": "UR117988157", "Content": "Stayed at this property on September 8, 2011.

When we decided to go Calistoga, the first thing in our list for a hotel is to have a hot spring pool and hot tub. The Lodge made the cut and we were extremely happy with our decision as we had a great stay at the Lodge. We saw a lot of other inns and motels around and we were glad that we chose the Lodge because some other motels/inns seriously need a face lift and updating! The room at the lodge is spacious, clean and nice. It looks exactly like what they put in the website. It has a refrigerator and a coffee maker, plasma TV..nice :) The lobby is also beautiful and cozy with nice furnitures. We enjoyed the heated pool, hot tub and steam room at night (close at 10PM daily). You might want to request a room that's not right by the pool because you would probably hear people chattering in the pool until 10PM (assuming people are swimming until that time). When we were there we got the pool and hot tub just for ourselves as most people don't probably want to swim at night. The pool was heated though..so we were totally comfortable. Our room was across from the pool and it was quiet, but very convenient to get to the pool, perfect location! We were extremely impressed with the FREE breakfast. They had everything from cereals, hard-boiled eggs, bagels, muffins, toasts, pastries, fruits, milk, orange juice, apple juice, and FRESHLY MADE WAFFLES!! We got there around 9:50 (breakfast ends at 10) and there were still plenty of food. We will certainly stay here again if we're at Calistoga.

We planned a relaxing and lovely weekend in beautiful Calistoga to celebrate a friend's birthday. We checked into the hotel in the late afternoon and a woman greeted us at reception. She asked us many questions about our stay, plans, where we had gone in town, etc. We thought she was being friendly and we were pleasantly surprised this \"average\" hotel had apparently \"above average\" service. We left for dinner at 7pm and returned around 10pm. We returned to the hotel tired but excited to ring in the New Year. Our happiness and excitement quickly turned into extreme stress after discovering 2 out of our 3 rooms were robbed of credit cards and cash. We immediately called the receptionist and she placed us on hold as she called for the on-site manager. After being on hold for more than 10 mins, one of us went to the front desk and found the receptionist at her car leaving the facility. We called the police and woke up the on-site manager to help us get to the bottom of this robbery. After a hotel audit of all of our rooms, it was revealed that the MASTER KEY (that only the manager and the front desk have) swiped into ALL OF OUR ROOMS within a 20 minute period of when we left for dinner. We filed a police report and over the past year, we have tried every way possible to get the hotel management to reimburse us for both the money that was stolen and the total amount we were charged for our stay. As many people have mentioned in there reviews, we want to emphasize that the on-site manager, receptionist and staff are extremely unhelpful.

He got me checked in asap and offered advise of where to eat if I wasn't familiar with the area etc. The room we were given was on the ground floor by the pool. We had to get up super early so we started to unwind around 8pm. I noticed a loud banging noise that went on about every hour that shook the walls and I thought maybe it was a heating unit or motor that needed to be fixed. My first call down to the front got me a very snotty woman who didn't care what the problem was, but said she could move me - that was my ONLY option. Since we had already unpacked and had taken showers I didn't want to go through all of that. But then we noticed that the traffic going down Lincoln was very loud and disruptive - so very thin walls! On our bed we only had a sheet and comforter (which of course I always remove when I go to hotels). No extra blankets in the room. After the banging came back on, I knew I'd never get any sleep if I stayed in this room. I called back down and got either a different woman, or someone who decided being snotty was not a good idea. She told me she has had SEVERAL guest who are light sleepers complain about that room and that it was nothing outside (she checked?) and it must be the room above me -their bathroom fan which goes on automatically. She brought us new keys and said no problem. We moved to a room upstairs with no guests on either side. It had not only top sheets and comforters BUT blankets too! Also it smelled better + had a brand new flat screen. It also had more towels. So we were happy with that. I couldn't sleep there - too loud for those who are light sleepers, as other reviews had mentioned. Do bring earplugs if you stay here. Although we were told about the free breakfast, a packaged danish and thick carbo bagel doesn't not sound good - nor did the dry cereal choices. I love good coffee in the am, but having to grind our own beans in the room was not the best idea. First of all if you are going to grind your own beans, at least make the coffee good. Blech.

We asked for two more but were refused. - automatically charge $1.50 per night for the in-room safe. If you choose not to use it you have to remember to ask for an adjustment to your bill upon checkout. - thin walls - closet was so small our suitcase almost didn't fit inside. - pool: funky green color, too much chlorine, not skimmed - bugs floating in it. - poor WiFi connection - kept losing the connection in our room - stairs and upstairs walkways are uneven and look run-down. You had to watch your step on the stairs because they were built with uneven heights between one step and the next.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harpenden, UK", "Title": "\u201cWas better As A Comfort Inn\u201d", "Author": "UKPeripatetic", "ReviewID": "UR26465944", "Content": "I have happy memories of this hotel when it was a Comfort Inn, but when I went to book it this time I discovered that it had been elevated to Clarion status and that it now had a silly name.

While driving to the hotel at night, we were confused about the directions we had obtained from google maps, so I called the Lodge, twice, and they were extremely helpful in giving us directions, as well as different options, explaining which routes were fastest, and which were more winding roads, etc. Once we arrived we were greeted well, everyone was friendly, and the check-in process was very fast. We were given some restaurant suggestions for dinner, and the main part of the town of Calistoga is very close, so it was very easy to get there (walkable even). Our stay in the rooms at night was very comfotable. Everything was clean, and the beds were especially comfy, and everyone commented on how well they slept. It was a particularly cold night, but the heaters worked well and we were all cozy in the rooms. In the morning the lobby had a very nice breakfast with bagels, cereal, muffins, etc. and freshly made waffles and breakfast burritos. The fireplace had a nice fire, so I sat and had coffee there and read until the rest of my group woke up. There was also a computer with internet access available for use. Again, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly, and gave me suggestions on wineries, spas, and restaurants. They even gave us passes and discount cards to several of the wineries, which we used later in the day. Before checking out, all of us used the pool and hot tub, as well as the sauna and steam room. There were even robes in the rooms for all of us to use which was a nice touch.

My husband and I as well as another couple we were traveling with booked this hotel on Expedia for 1 night in May while visiting Napa. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted promptly and given our 2 room keys. Once my husband and I opened the door to our room we noticed the a/c was broken and partially knocked off the wall. I also quickly glanced around the room and noticed the stains on the comforter, carpets and just a plain dirty room. I will say, I am a picky person, as typically in Napa we stay at the Candlelight Inn which is amazing, but during this stay we couldn;t get a room due to only needing 1 night accomodation, so we thought we would give this hotel a chance. I quickly went down to the front desk and told the girl that the room did not have an operable a/c unit and we were not happy with the cleaniless of the hotel, room, green swimming pool, etc.. She gave us another room key, before we even entered that room, I decided I didn't want to even chance the germs we might catch at this place and opted just to leave. I went back downstairs and told them it did not meet Clarion standards and I was highly disappointed in the cleaniless of this hotel and I was checking out and wanted my reservation cancelled. She cancelled my reservation as well as our friends, and gave me a piece of paper showing I am cancelled. We immeditaley called the Marriott in Napa and was able to book a room. Months later, I am still fighting with this hotel to reimburse the charge on my card (my friends were never charged just ours) as well as American Express is fighting with this hotel- they have repeately commented stating our a/c was not broken, and they kindly moved us and we choose not to stay and they couldn't re-rent the room and that is why they are charging us.. We never entered the other room, and the a/c was broken, this is the worst hotel experience I have ever had, and we typically stay at Marriott's , Westin's and while in vegas even The Wynn- this is inexcusable and I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.

For those who have not figured out, the Lodge is a fancy name for a Motel. If they gave awards for internet PR campaigns, this place would win. After seeing the website and doing minimal research it looked fine. Upon checking in, we knew we were in for the classic Motel 6 experience. The pool is gross, forget the long \"Geothermal Hot Springs Mineral Pool\" description. It is a normal motel pool. Using fancy words changes nothing.

I took the dried green balls of mold sitting in the vents of the A/C to the hotel front desk.

(The room was already overpriced at $152 a night. with my Access membership..I stayed at the Best Western Stevenson Manor the night before (great accommodations across the street) and paid $128 with my Access membership). Needless to say the 10% offering was a slap in the face. I told the clerk I would not stay there...period, discount or no discount! She did not charge me for the room even though it was outside their cancellation policy and showed me the note she wrote to her manager to let me know she had taken the situation seriously. The note indicated that she had \"gotten several complaints about the musty rooms...isn't there something we can do?\" The word in town with the locals I talked to during my 4 day stay in Calistoga is that the owner does not want to invest money back into the hotel to maintain it.

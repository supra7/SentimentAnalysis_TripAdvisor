I stayed at this property March 10th and found it acceptable--with one exception; the rooms are claustrophobically small. If traveling alone, with minimal luggage you will get by, but I would not recommend this property for couples or persons staying longer than a few nights. If you needed to use the phone you had to crawl across the bed as the space between the foot of the bed and the wall was approximately 6 inches. Rooms do not have their own climate control, and mine was incredibly hot so you get what you get without anyway to adjust the temperature. I like some space in a hotel room, not a lot, but at least enough so two people aren't bumping into each other.

The lady at the reception was very friendly and quickly booked us in to our room on the top floor looking out on to 47th Street. The room I found was extremely small, yet adequate for what we needed realistically. We just about had enough room to throw our suitcases in two corners, but for two people that were planning on being up early every morning, room space wasn't really a priority. We had expected it, especially at the competitive price we got the room for. The room was clean and tidy as was the bathroom however small it was too (I also found that after we'd showered the room got very warm, mainly from the steam in the bathroom), but again adequate. If you want a cheap room, expect a room along this lines. The big plus for me was the fact that the hotel was only literally a 2 minutes walk from Times Square. I did find that at night the location in general was very very noisy (horns blowing, trucks moving around, etc) but as it was only a block or two from Times Square, that was also to be expected, and as far as I'm aware all the rooms face the one way. There was breakfast served in the lobby every morning (coffee, orange juice, small selection of teas, croissants, bagels, etc - ps the orange juice was delicious!!!) but my problem with this was that it seemed to be cleared away shortly after 9am. I don't think it would have hurt to leave it out a little longer. Check out was quick and efficient too with the same girl that checked us in. She kindly took our luggage into the office as we still had time after check out to wander around, and booked us a taxi to the airport. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for a place to lie down for about 6 hours sleep, nothing fancy but a nice clean room where you can get a few hours rest to get up early again and get out for the day.

As previously mentioned in the reviews the room is very tiny and cramped. I would not recommend this hotel if you are travelling with a family, the room is ideal for 2 people at most. There is little space to walk in the room, I would have to climb over the bed to get to the bathroom or door. One thing about this hotel is you would have to \"recharge\" your hotel room key every day before leaving. I tried getting back into the room late at night and my \"key\" would not work. When I went to the desk they said you have to recharge it every day when you leave and its could for that day only. I guess for security reasons that was good but annoying cause before going back to the room you have to \"recharge it\". Breakfast was non-existent it was just a shelf of juice, coffee, possibly toast, not much to choose from. And the Wi-fi would not load even with their password and login ID, just plain slow. If, you wanted to use the common area for the internet you would have to pay for usage and printer usage. The hotel room could use some updating: - The bathroom: Although the sink looked updated, the showerhead/tub could use some renos and spots of rust were noticed. The shower curtains had stains and looked \"old\". The overall space in the bathroom was small, the toilet was right near the door, so you had to \"squeeze in\" before closing the door. - The carpet floor was just average and dirty. - The room : Air condition was the one where you put on the window sill, I noticed stains on the walls and cracks. - The hallway is narrow and quite humid cause the aircondition does not flow though the whole hallway. I would ONLY recommend this hotel, just for the location. It is walking distance to most things and does not take long to get to your destination, but if you are looking for comfort, this would not be the hotel to book at. For me, I would have spent a little bit extra to be comfortable and have space to put my luggage. I guess it was just a place to sleep, but the bed wasn't that comfortable either.

The same again on the day you leave. They do not do early check-ins. I was unable to speak to the manager - even though the manager was there - they pretended she wasn't. The customer service is rated 0/10. The worst customer service ever. They really don't care to make your stay pleasurable and if you are unhappy - they don't care in the slightest. Two ladies who checked in before us said they would never stay there again because of the $3 per bag charge (they had 4 bags).

The room had a weird smell without the air conditioner on and you definitely needed air conditioning in August. The hotel did manage to squeeze in a table into the room. This room is great for if you are going with just one other person and you aren't planning to spend too much time in the room.

So when the hotel we used on our previous vacation to NYC closed, we obviously turned to Tripadvisor to select a new place to stay. All the positive things said about this hotel are true - the water pressure and hot water are just fine and for the noise complaints - I can recommend a great place in Alaska (this is NYC after all). But let's start at the beginning. We arrived early at the hotel after a 23 hour flight (yeah no kidding) and could obviously not check in but they offered to keep our luggage at no cost. After roaming the streets in our \"not so fresh\" state we got our room just after 12:30. Now use your imagination and imagine the smallest a room can be in a hotel. Take half of that and you have the Econo Lodge! These rooms are TINY but they are clean and the bed is comfortable. What more do you need really? So unless you are a little bigger than the average size this hotel is more than adequate to have a good night's sleep and a place to clean up. You will not spend your days in the hotel with the streets of New York calling outside. The breakfasts consisted of a few pastries, bagels, a choice of two cereals, juice, fresh fruit and good enough coffee. No room really to sit downstairs to enjoy the breakfast so most use the tray in the room to carry it back to the room. The hotel staff was in general friendly enough by New York standards. We had a problem with our toilet and this was dealt with promptly. Most people rave about the location and we must also throw our penny's worth in. It is absolutely true that you'll be hard pressed to find a better location for the price. In the heart of the theatre district, one block from restaurant row and Times Square. Across the street is a Duane Reade pharmacy for convenience shopping 24 hours a day. Another little gem is the Food Emporium two blocks north at 49th and 8th. We can really recommend them for a late night snack. Will we stay there again? Absolutely!!

Also that it got a bit cold sometimes in this hotel in March and they did not really have a \"real blanket\" so you have to sleep in a bit warmer clothes. Don't understand me wrong, those are only little things. When you want to visit New York and pay less for the hotel, you should book the hotel from Econo Lodge. Almost every hotel with 50-100 USD / fare / per day are around the same quality than this hotel.

Although this hotel was very popular and almost all full, the staff found me a room and even gave me a room on the top floor (floor 6) when i requested it. They were all incredibly helpful and friendly. The hotel is very clean and beautifully decorated. There is 24hr complimentary tea and coffee at reception, and a gorgeous continential breakfast in the morning. 24hr internet access also available. The only negative side would be that the rooms are very tight, but u get what u pay for, and they were very clean!! The bathrooms are the same. There is also a safe in your room and a T.V. which shows around 30 channels, and you get complimentary crisps and bottled water in your room when you arrive.

But, thre was one problem at check in. They couldn't give us our room key! The card reader was down and was supposed to be fixed the next day. OK, no problem. Got to our room. Yes, the elevator takes forever like everyone has stated. You could honestly walk up faster. The room is postage stamp size. Actually a similar size to a small cruise ship room. Barely enough room to go around the bed sideways. I'm not kidding. Oh well, knew that coming in too. Friend of mine in NY said that if your door doesn't hit your bed when you come in the room then you have a big room. LOL! But here's where I draw the line. So, it's around 1am and the wife & I turn down the sheets only to find the most horrible stains ever! Disgusting. So we had to sleep on top of the bed sheets since we were really tired and already showered. Next AM, told front desk and they changed them right away for us and gave us a discount card to a restaurant (we never went). Still no keys available. Also, window unit sounded like it was powered by hamsters. Too loud, had to shut off. Saturday night keys became available! But when we came back to the room Sunday we were locked out. Oh yeah, they forgot to tell us that everyday you have to have the room card rekeyed. No big deal if not for the turtle of an elevator they have. And then Sunday night got into the elevator with 3 other couples and got stuck in there for 10 minutes. Won't go up and won't open. Had to use emergency button and then it opened. Funniest thing was girl at counter who said \"Oh you're all back down\". LOL! No we never left! Hey for the $129 a night we paid I got what I expected. A bagel and coffee in the AM, a room I'd be livid with anywhere else but NYC, a great location, & a friendly staff. So I give it mixed reviews. Don't come expecting the Ritz. But if you just need a place to lay your head, take a shower, etc. then it's great. By the way, don't plan on bringing a lot of luggage. You won't have room to put it anywhere.

Nevertheless, the room was spotlessly clean (only 2 years old we think), had a plasma TV, USA Today paper delivered daily, and included a free breakfast. The breakfast was a stepped up continental: cereal, local fresh made bagels and butter croissants (not the stale packaged ones), other pastry delights, hot cereal, and fruit. PLus, the fruit (nice afternoon snack), coffee, & tea were there 24 hrs a day. What distinguished this property from other NYC hotels is that the hotel staff went overboard to assist: bottled water whenever we needed it at no charge, directions, etc. All in all, we enjoyed our stay due to the friendliness and price of this hotel.

As pointed out in other reviews the hotel rooms really are TINY! This isn't too much of a problem on a short stay as we spent very little time in our room. We stayed four nights and as we acquired goodies from various shopping trips space became a bit tight , but we managed. The bathroom is again small, if you are of large stature you will struggle! Nevertheless it was very clean with fresh towels and toiletries provided daily. The shower was powerful with plenty of hot water available. The location of the hotel is fantastic and we found we could walk to most places of interest , Times Square, Rockerfeller Centre, Theatre District, Maceys, Empire State, Madison Square Gardens, Central Park. As others have mentioned this location comes at a price! It is very noisy at night with sirens and car horns being sounded well into the small hours so bring your earplugs or make sure you have a large night cap! There are a few negatives with this hotel however it is all about compromise. Yes it is noisy at night, yes the rooms are very small, however, the staff are friendly and helpful, the location is fantastic, for a hotel in the centre of everything the rates are very good!

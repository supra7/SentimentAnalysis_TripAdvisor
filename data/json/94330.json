They also had Keurig coffee maker with coffees, and teas. It had a small fridge. They had really big windows with a view of the dock. The only downside (for me) is that it's a bit pricey, but I guess you do pay for all of the details. They had a couple of places to eat on the property, along with a bar. They left a voicemail for me that if I'd flown in, they'd even print my boarding pass if I let them know at the front desk.

But they DID send a porter to move my luggage, and as noted elsewhere, all employees were quite consistent about their \"service included\" policy! Very nice, indeed! As is the free internet - something you rarely find in an upscale, city hotel. My room was very nicely appointed. I somehow missed the pillow menu, though there was a nice selection on the bed, which also was very comfortable. My second room had a view of the World Trade Center and the harbor - a bit industrial at best, but worth requesting, I think. My business was at the World Trade Center, and the hotel is essentially connected (just across the street). Very convenient. It is also very close to the Silver Line which means you can get to South Station or Logan Airport very easily. Would be ridiculous to take a taxi to the airport when the Silver Line is right there. Why not five stars? Just not quite the five star ambiance. Would somehow expect something a bit more grandiose when you walk in the door. (Stopped by the nearby Renaissance to visit the Starbucks - VERY sleek lobby with a real artistic flair - Seaport doesn't have that.) And I'm simply not a fan of the Keurig coffee systems. Seems like a bad deal in terms of plastic waste, and I never quite get enough coffee! But... that all said, I would stay there again in a heartbeat.

My work in tourism marketing has me attending or participating in events to promote my region. The show was at the Seaport World Trade Center in Boston harbor and I booked a special rate room at the Seaport Boston Hotel. My 12 year old daughter came with me. Check in was smooth and easy. We had quite a few bags and I can usually handle that myself but a porter brought the stuff up. Service is included in the price, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no tipping expected which was kind of nice. The room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t huge, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect huge. What I did expect was clean, modern and nice and I got it. It had a Keurig coffee machine with a couple of choices of their Kcups, including tea. The bad thing that I discovered the next morning was that there was only one little packet of powdered creamer and sugar, barely enough for one cup, and not really a good one at that. I like my coffee light and sweet and despite the cool little machine, the coffee sucked. I would recommend that if you like coffee in your room in the morning and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go out to get that first cup, you bring some cream with you somehow. My room did not have a refridgerator. Some nice touches included the two very plush terry robes, a special black towel in the bathroom to wash off makeup and the shampoo and conditioner wall dispensers in the shower. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever tried to stretch one tiny bottle of shampoo over two or three people, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll recognize that this is a wonderful thing. I usually pack my own shampoo and conditioner for this very reason. It was plentifully dispensed. Beds were very comfortable, with nice cotton sheets and duvet and an extra blanket. They actually have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pillow library\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to their website where you can go an select the type of pillow you prefer. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it mentioned anywhere in the room, though, or anywhere in the hotel for that matter, only on the website. The view from our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very nice. Being that we were right across from the harbor, I would have loved a nice water view, lights twinkling on the horizon and all that. I do understand the fact that a building has four sides and only one can face the water and there are only so many of those rooms available. Add to that the fact that I got a discounted room because of my affiliation with the show and well, I suppose I should be happy we could at least SEE the water. We did get a 9th floor room, though, which was pretty cool. A couple more notes on the room; perhaps I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used to staying at hotels that are more family oriented but two things would have been great: a small refrigerator and dare I say, a microwave. I know that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushing it. Our bottled water got warm and our dinner doggy bags got cold. Something I really appreciated was the flat screen TV with easy to clean remote (have you read about how disgusting hotel room remotes are?) and the free wifi with no password/login was great. Something that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so hot was that our room was near the ice machine and the housekeeping station, also near the elevators, so it was noisy, people coming and going all night and early in the morning. I suppose SOMEONE has to have the room near all that, but it would have been better had it not been me. As a woman travelling with a child, those voices and bumps in the night have a way of disrupting sleep. I had read reviews about the indoor pool being really small and it was. It was obviously catering to the guests that come for business and want a workout swim along with their use of the gym. The night we went, however, we pretty much had the pool to ourselves, and swam for quite a while. I noticed that the hotel was promoting a school vacation special \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pool, play, breakfast, etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and while I applaud their outreach to this market, I think any parents coming here thinking they could unleash the kids on the pool for the afternoon would be disappointed, or rather, the kids would be. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to say this, though: the ladies locker room was FABULOUS! Ok, I only went in to use the bathroom and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take full advantage of it all, but really . . . nice finished wood lockers and cubes for stashing your stuff, wall dispensers for lotion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a really nice touch that I wish all locker rooms would provide \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hair dryers, plenty of counter space and mirrors (magnified ones, even!) and large roomy showers. One more note about the gym at the Seaport Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gym; at the entrance, they have a large glass container with lemon water. I thought this was a nice treat. I would have appreciated it more had I actually used the gym for a good workout but nonetheless had a couple of cups worth while sitting by the pool. The next morning, given my no cream experience of the day before, I did something I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never done, ordered room service. Just a small pot of coffee with cream and sugar. It arrived early, around 7:30 and was the perfect amount for me. Two little pitchers of cream, nice cups, all was good. The room service order form said it was $6.25, which I figured was better than two grande lattes at the caf\u00c3\u00a9, but when I got the bill upon check out, it totaled over $11 after the gratuity, room taxes and other crap was added. Lesson learned: perhaps it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t better than two grande lattes. Easier, but not cheaper. A couple more things; check out is at noon and I had to work at the show until 1pm so I asked the front desk if I could possibly have a late check out and was given until 1:30, a courtesy that I appreciated. It just eased my mind and allowed me to avoid some morning hassle of checking out, loading up the car, finding something for my daughter to do while I was at the show, etc. When I left the show and came back to the hotel, I had a very heavy box of brochures that I was taking with me. The concierge offered to keep them at his station so that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to carry them up to the room and then down with my luggage and kid in tow. Just a little thing, but certainly labor saving and appreciated. Overall my experience at the Seaport Boston Hotel was a good one, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be happy to recommend the place to others and will plan on staying there for next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s show. http://celestecota.blogspot.com/ www.celestecota.com", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cOne night getaway for local family\u201d", "Author": "Celerychow", "ReviewID": "UR125244135", "Content": "We live just 15 miles from Boston but took the school vacation week as a chance to spend one night in the city with my husband and 7 year old son.

For most of the families swimming it's a bit cramped and likely intrusive to those hotel guests who choose to swim laps. We also came across a couple of globs of hair in the pool, eww. The depth is 4.2' all around so no wading for little ones just one set of stairs in to the water. The rest of the spa and workout area looked great and was busy with hotel guests on the various workout machines. We had lunch across the street at Jerry Remy's a relatively new sports-type bar. On a Saturday afternoon, there was a 15 minute wait for a table; the place was hopping. The food was sports-food type with burgers and wraps. A wee bit loud with TVs everywhere and music but it is what it is. The views were great with lots of windows overlooking the water. The Seaport area is a bit removed from the rest of the city. It's walkable to the downtown on a nice day but we opted for a $9 cab ride to the North End for dinner and desert. No problem getting a cab in either direction.

The hotel had shampoo and conditioner dispensers in the bathroom with pretty good quality shampoo and conditioner. I stayed in a double queen room on the 16th floor with a awesome view of the skyline and port. I liked it alot. I didn't pay for the room so I can't say anything about the price of the room. I was with a group of other travel agents. I will say that the prices of alcoholic beverages in the bar downstairs was crazy. 10.00 for a mimosa is nuts! We walked across the street to Dunkin Donuts for breakfast most of the time.. The shower was nice.. much like a waterfall .. It was soft and didn't have a whole lot of pressure but it was enough to do the job. The tub was quite large. My one complaint- the beds are too hard! They had a nice down comforter on the bed..but it was like sleeping on a rock lol.. The front desk was quick and responsive to requests for toothbrush/toothpaste as I ran out and forgot mine..

The bed was comfortable. Robes were included (love that!). And that's all the nice things I can say. Upon check in, the desk person was very pleasant and cheery, but she sounded very robotic in telling us about the hotel amenities. One thing that really makes me \"like\" a hotel I stay at, is the friendliness of the staff. I didn't find the staff friendly at all. The servers and bartenders at the party never smiled. One waitress was snippy with the people seated at the table when she brought out the wrong food. She \"insisted\" there were 3 salmons at the table, when no one ordered salmon. The look she gave us was that someone must have changed their mind and wanted the filet mignon. The following morning, hubby and I decided to try the brunch that the desk person at check-in raved about. Hubby *loves* going out for breakfast. The hostess didn't smile or welcome us. She asked us if we'd have the buffet or regular breakfast. We asked how much was the brunch buffet? Her response, \"Um, I don't know---low 20's.\" She seated us, and our waiter wasn't very friendly either. And 2 waiters started to have an argument near our table. Although the food at the buffet looked nice, we opted to order just the omelettes (since it wasn't clear if omelettes were part of the buffet price). The breakfast was bland and tastless. The chef decided to make it healthy---no salt, no seasoning. The hotel has a \"no tip\" policy, but 18% is automatically added to the bill. Hubby hypothesized that the staff isn't motivated to be helpful and friendly since they won't get an extra tip. But this review isn't of the food--it's of the hotel.

I stayed here for a friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wedding in a Deluxe King bed room. The entire hotel is very clean and the lobby was very big with many chairs and couches to relax on. The room was also very clean and was pretty spacious with 2 chairs, a small table and a very long desk. The lights must have been the modern CFL bulbs because they always took a little while to turn on. The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable. The bathroom and shower were average, but the water pressure from the shower was very weak. The TV was a flat screen, but was pretty small, probably about 27\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The room had a nice iLive iPod alarm clock dock, an iron, ironing board, hair dryer and very good coffee maker. The only trash can I could find in the room was in the bathroom and it was very small. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a door tag for maid service, but instead they had an electronic button you could push for either \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Make Up Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which was the first time I had ever seen one of those. The service throughout the hotel was pretty good and they allowed us to use the conference room for a pre-wedding poker game, so that was incredibly nice of them. The hotel location is very good since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right near South Station and Logan airport. The harbor is just outside the building and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short walk to some great local bars, including Whiskey Priest, Atlantic Beer Garden and Jerry Remy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. As nice as this hotel is, there were a few things I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like about it. It was hard to find the actual hotel and underground parking garage upon entering the area. The self-parking fee of $32/night and $42/night for valet is outrageous. I know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Boston, but that was about 25% of the room cost! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also confusing trying to park under the correct building with the East and West underground parking garages, as they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clearly marked with what building was above them. Getting into the hotel was also hard because there were two handicapped power-operated doors on each side that were awkward to get through and just a turning door in the middle that was very hard to push. The doormen never seemed to provide much help. There are 4 elevators in the building, yet it still took forever for them to come around. And the worst part about this hotel is that every time I bought a beer at the bar, they included the tip in the cost. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get more presumptuous than that. I always tip well for good service, but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stand being told what I should tip or that the tip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already included in the cost. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll tip what I want to tip based on the quality of service I receive.

We did not pay for the harbour view room, but still had a harbour view, so don't waste the extra money. The beds were also extremely comfortable, and there is a fridge and safe in the room. This hotel is only a ten minute walk from South Station, where you can catch the Patriots Train on gameday. I strongly recommend this train as a way of getting to the stadium. There is a 7-11 convenience store and Dunkin Donuts right next to the hotel, and just down the street there is a pub called the Whiskey Priest (excellent food) and a Sports Bar called the Atlantic Beer Garden (tons of high-def tvs, and cheap beer). The Barking Crab (best seafood in Boston) is also a short walk from this hotel.

As a European, even though I tend to be overgenerous when I tip, staff assume that I won't in bars and restaurants etc and they treat you less well. The Seaport's no tipping policy means that everyone is treated the same way. The staff are amazing and *nothing* was too much trouble. The breakfast was excellent. The toiletries are definitely worth taking home. One thing I really, really liked: I read recently that if you are in a hotel and ask the concierge for, 'an extra pillow' it is secret code for you want a visit from a lady of the night. At the Seaport, if you ask for, 'an extra pillow', you actually get - an extra pillow - or two. It is the only hotel that I have ever stayed in that has a PILLOW LIBRARY. They stock buckwheat pillows, goose down, duck feathers, Swedish memory pillows, hypopallergenic pillows, and my personal favourite (after extensive research) the water pillows.

Although my husband had to work all four days, the kids (ages 8 months and 3 yrs) and I had a fantastic time. The Seaport was a fabulous place for us to have as a 'home base'. From the moment we walked in the door, my children were treated like special guests. They got to pick toys out of a (huge) treasure chest (a big deal for a 3 year old), and were constantly doted on by the staff. Our best experience was when we got accidentally locked out of our room during a trip to the pool (the keycard demagnitized)-- a lovely maid took one look at my two tired, wet kids and let us right in. What a doll! The concierges were always very helpful and professional. They gave us fresh maps and walking directions every morning, and made me feel quite at ease about traveling with two little ones in tow. The aquarium (Longwharf) was only a 20 minute walk away, and we also walked through downtown to Beacon Hill / Public Gardens in about 35 min. The close proximity to the Boston Children's Museum (5-7 min walk) was another perk.... plus we booked the \"Seaport Kids Package\", which included four free tickets (they're pricey otherwise) to use whenever we wanted to. The pack- n-play was perfect for my 8 month old. I so prefer those to the \"Romanian Orphanage\" style bar cribs that so many hotels have. The only 'negative' I have is that the pool is definitely a lap pool set up for adults. It was on the chilly side (good for exercising, bad for little ones), but they had kickboards available that my little girl enjoyed playing with. We actually stayed here right over the time that Hurricane Irene blew into town. I was impressed by the preparedness of the staff-- we received letters in our rooms detailing emergency evacuation procedures and were kept up to date about the storm's progress by the concierge every time we saw him. This is a full-service hotel and no one would accept any tips! Quite refreshing-- Highly recommended-- Oh-- and my husband and I quite enjoyed the 'Pillow Library' to select from.

The rooms are nice - the TV is wall-mounted making it easy to view from desk, chair, or bed. The wireless was great despite a full hotel of IT people (you KNOW everyone was connected)! One of my favorite things was finding out that the hotel offers a \"pillow bar\" where you can order from several different pillow types in order to find the one that best suits your fancy.

With a city so alive, there are many options - let the professionals at Seaport Boston Hotel help you figure it all out. We started planning this trip about 5 months ahead of time. I chose Seaport based on other reviews, but didn't decide until I picked up the phone & called their concierge department. I won the lottery with Betty Salemme! I quickly nicknamed her \"Boston Betty\" & I felt she really became a friend. She planned this trip to Boston for us & it could not have been better. She knew what questions to ask, to discover what type of experience we wanted. She even helped my husband plan a surprise for me, behind my back! This hotel has everything: spa, gym, built in \"nightlight\" in the bathroom, electronic \"Do Not Disturb\" button, clean sleeves on the remote control, restaurant & bar, coffee shop, \"pillow menu\", easy access to The T, fine dining within walking distance, \"party\" bars within walking distance - even in heels! Seriously, if you can't find what you need here, you just didn't ask the right question! I happened to love the location. Some reviews here act as if the hotel is poorly located. I appreciated the fact that it wasn't in the overly crowded, tourist-trappy area. Directly across from the hotel is a Dunkin Donuts, a 7-11 & a Fresh City. Boston is a walking town - be ready to hoof it. If you think you don't want to walk, or if you are going pretty far out of the city center, say, out to Fenway, the city makes getting around very easy! I appreciate a city that takes responsibility for transporting its people. And it is one of the best bargains in Boston. The locals are fun to watch, they have this place figured out! I learned a lot by watching them. Again, if you think you are gonna come here & NOT have to use your feet, you are mistaken. I come from a place where you have to use your car to get to anywhere, so yeah, walking in a city is a bit foreign, but a vacation is about experience. Staying at the Seaport offers you that in so many ways! We were in town for the celebration of Independence Day. The city was packed, but surprisingly serene. I have been to Chicago, NYC, LA, ATL. I assumed Boston would be similar. It has a whole different vibe & each section of the city has it's own pulse. I will say that our stay at Seaport was enhanced by the planning Betty did for us. During such a busy time in Boston, we would have been scrambling for reservations & tickets to attractions. When we arrived at the Seaport, the front desk had an envelope waiting for us, with our complete itinerary, tickets, and even contact names at the places we would be visiting . Betty came from her concierge desk to greet us, too. After talking to her for months, it was a joy to finally meet the woman who put this trip together for us. She even went to the trouble to get us an early check-in & a secluded corner room with a nice harbor view on one side & a city view on the other! We will be back to Boston & some of our friends have expressed interest in visiting.

This was not our first choice, but most hotels in the area were sold out, so at the Seaport we stayed. The hotel is acceptable, but nothing special, particularly not for this price range. First, the hotel is in a less desirable area of the city. Not much is within walking distance and access to the T requires a first leg of travel on the Silver Line on which travel is by bus. Getting to virtually any destination of note in the city takes multiple transit transfers. We did find a good little breakfast spot (Flour) and excellent restaurant for dinner (Sportello) each about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Second, the front of house staff (doormen, front desk, concierge) is reasonably professional, but not particularly friendly or helpful. Third, when I made the room reservation, I was told that a suite could accommodate a cot in the living area along with the pull-out sofa and so requested one. However, when we got to the room the cot was not there. When the housekeeper brought it up, she was reluctant to set it up and for good reason, it would have blocked access to the bathroom. Note, after several nights of poor sleep from growing children knocking each other off of the pull-out sofa, we again requested a cot. This time a smaller one was brought up and we rearranged the room to put it below the window in the living room - cramped, but better than blocking access to the bathroom. In general, the suite was small with furniture pushed against window coverings, a television blocking the view in the bedroom, and a tiny closet. The furnishings are worn and frankly, kind of boring - neither elegant or interestingly contemporary. The bed and pillows were comfortable. Climate control was fine, as was sound insulation from other rooms. Room service was very good - the room was very clean when we checked in and neatly tidied and cleaned every day. Fourth, the pool is warm, clean and in a bright space with a nice view. Lane markers were always in place which made playing with the children difficult, even when we were the only ones in the pool, which was generally the case. The locker rooms are spacious and clean. The exercise equipment is adequate. Fifth, we did not take advantage of the restaurant or bar, based on others' reviews. Sixth, we needed a rental car for a short portion of our trip. The Seaport has an arrangement with Enterprise where they will meet you at the lobby, forms in hand, with a car at the curb.

We stayed in a \"deluxe double\" room and although they apologized for not being able to give us a Harbor View room, we actually could see the Harbor just by looking to the right. Everything was very clean and very comfortable. This is a no-tipping hotel, with a small fee added each day that covers all the gratuities you might need give at other locations. My daughter was intrigued by the \"Pillow Library\" so we called and requested a couple of Swedish Memory Foam pillows to make our beds even more comfy. The room included a Krups coffee maker with coffees and tea (yum!), Gilchrist and Soames toiletries (divine!), and a fridge, though we found that it wasn't cold enough to keep milk fresh. There was a Bose clock radio that works with any MP3 player. The room also included a hairdryer, iron and ironing board, bathrobes, and there was even a much-appreciated umbrella in the closet! The flat-screen TV is mounted above the desk area, so it doesn't take up valuable real-estate on the desk. The internet access worked flawlessly. They offer to store your luggage for you when you check out, if you aren't leaving town right away, and give you a claim ticket. The stored luggage was very secure. The hotel is very convenient to the MBTA's Silver Line from the airport, and they have a shuttle for employees and guests that will take you down to State Street near the old State House and Quincy Market, for free. We didn't give it a try, but they say they have free bikes you can use, and their garage is a ZipCar rental location, so there are lots of ways to get around. Need food? There is a Seven-11 just across the street and a Dunkin Donuts (of course - there's a DD every 10 feet in downtown Boston.) The hotel has 3 different eateries within it, as well - a sit-down restaurant, a bar, and a small cafe with sandwiches and coffee. There were events going on while we were staying, with lots of loud music, but we didn't hear a thing in our room.

The rooms at the Seaport are packed with amenities and I appreciated the refrigerator being stocked with water. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room seemed more insulated than the Westin. The biggest difference I found, and the piece that made this a four vs. a three review, was the food and beverage. Mike in Tamo was out of this world. A terrific bartender who truly loved his hotel. His service had us talking the whole week. The food was definitely a leap above usual hotel fare, and everything was tasty. We had planned on dining in Aura, but just couldn't leave Mike's company...a very nice touch was that we could still order Aura's food in the other outlet.

My recent six night stay for a convention at the nearby convention center left me wanting to be at the nearby Westin or Renaissance for a number of reasons. The rooms are decent, but nothing to write home about. My room, on the 14th floor, had a pervasive moldy or mildew odor and on my second night at the hotel, when I asked to switch rooms, the second room on the same floor had the same \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funky\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd odor. The room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pros: Bose wave radio with easy-to-use alarm function, free high-speed internet that was screaming fast, and comfortable beds. The cons: 26\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wall mounted flat screen TV (still shaking my head at that one), a/c unit that barely breathed cool air with any force, and no opening window or vent to the outside to try for fresh air. There are no balconies available, which is a shame in this setting. The bathroom was, again, adequate. Fairly small room, with piping hot shower and good water pressure, but no individually bottled shampoo. I respect the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153green,\" but the bulk dispenser in the tub/shower dispensed a mystery liquid that would not lather, so on one of my trips by the Westin, I stopped in and asked for a bottle of guest shampoo, which the housekeeper gladly handed me and which I used for the remainder of my stay. There was a nice bar of soap, and a bottle of lotion, but no special amenities to speak of. My sink had nearly no water pressure, and only offered either scalding or icy water, which made shaving difficult. There is a makeup mirror (not lighted). The Keurig coffee machine is in the bathroom, which is a nice touch, but the housekeeper stopped restocking it midway through my stay, for some unknown reason. Other nice aspects of the hotel: the front desk staff is very attentive and welcoming, and the hotel delivers the guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choice of USA Today or Wall Street Journal each weekday morning. The lounge staff is friendly and attentive, and the wine list and menu are adequate. For breakfast, the hotel has a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We proudly brew Starbucks coffee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (read: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a real Starbucks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) off the lobby, but service there is slow, and there is a Dunkin Donuts located directly across from the hotel if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re prefer a fresh, quick, breakfast. For truly wonderful dining, visit the nearby Legal Seafoods Test Kitchen (in the same block as the Renaissance), Del Frisco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (five minute walk) or the Union Oyster House, which is a 10 minute cab ride away. All in all, this hotel is an adequate choice if you cannot get into the nearby Westin or Renaissance while attending a conference or convention. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a four minute walk across an uncovered bridge to the convention center, so bring an umbrella if rain is in the forecast.

Upon check-in, the staff member wandered off with my driver's license for several minutes, leaving my credit card at the desk unattended. He finally came back and it turned out he was checking on the status of the crib we had requested for our child, but I could not understand why he needed to wander off with my driver's license instead of calling housekeeping. 2. Later that night, I needed to order in-room dining but as our child was asleep, I didn't want to make the call from the room, so I went down to the front desk to place the order. There were I believe 3 bored-looking staff at the front desk, with no other customers in sight. One of the staff, upon hearing of my situation, looked irritated at being bothered, waved me to a house phone so that I can call my request in, and went back to chatting with her colleague. 3. The following morning, we realized it would be difficult for me to finish attending my meeting while my family packed in time for the noon check-out, so I called the front desk to ask for a ONE HOUR extension. Of course, the hotel has a right to refuse this request, but the staff who answered the phone seemed annoyed at being bothered, said no very rudely, and practically hung up on me.

And after that i called the frost desk and the staff made a report of it and laughed when i told them what happened. And i thought it was very unprofessional to do such a thing after being burned with scalding hot water for 15 seconds. The manager said he was going to contact me and try and give us a few perks for the remainder of our stay for the whole thing happening. But he never called back and when i called him back he ignored my phone calls and i still have yet to have him call me back for that and the other issues we had while staying there. The Direct TV was out the entire time we where there. So late at night there was nothing to do but just sit there... We couldn't enjoy any shows or anything. Thank god i had my laptop with us and i had some movies on there that i paid for through a digital movie rental place. And not to mention while outside trying to take photo's one of the hotel security staff screamed at me and told me to stop and tried to drag me off the hotel property and said that i need to leave now because no pictures are aloud to be taken outside of the hotel. And i asked how? So he showed me a clip board that said \"Suspicious people are not aloud to take photo's and must be removed off hotel grounds\" So after telling him i was a guest at the hotel and told him my room number he said \"Really? You are a guest?\" And i said. Yes i am staying here. He said \"I dont find that very likely\" and he continued to try and kick me off hotel grounds. So i went back in and tried to report that once again like all the other issues we had when we where there. And like everything else. Nothing was done about anything. So to be honest we will never stay there again. Those issues are the kind of issues you would expect to see a a red roof inn or one of the cheap hotel's. Now that i think about it you would not see those issues at a red roof inn. So in closing. Save your self the trouble and go elsewhere. There are far more hotels in the Boston area then the Seaport Hotel. And you will get the respect you deserve.

Excellent.\u201d", "Author": "Fuller1981", "ReviewID": "UR89481128", "Content": "Wow. This was, without question, the most luxurious hotel we stayed in out of a total of nine in two weeks. Not without some faults, but very impressive indeed and certainly worth a visit if you want to treat yourself. The location is perhaps slightly out of the city centre, but perfect for the financial district and conference centre, as well as next to a metro station, which was very convenient. The parking is very expensive (albeit normal for city centres) but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much luggage and are prepared to walk a short distance, there is cheaper parking in the area. We were warmly welcomed and the enormous, very tastefully decorated reception made us feel somewhat under-dressed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very spacious and provided access to the restaurant and bar, both of which looked smart and sophisticated. Small details like a table of different vases filled with apples in the day and changed to candles in the evening, make you feel that a real sense of attention to detail is exists and pride is taken in keeping the place presentable at all times. One of the best features about this place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for a tourist at least \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that they stress that gratuities are included in the costs and tips are not expected. Furthermore, staff echo this time and again, demonstrating that they have been very well trained. We have no objection to tipping in the slightest but will always feel at odds with the fact that it is virtually mandatory everywhere in the USA. In the UK, we tip to say give thanks for hard work, a good job or exceeding expectation but Stateside, it basically means that no service ever costs what you are charged and you have the anxiety of working out what is and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appropriate, fearing rebuke by staff if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it right. To have this nuisance taken away was really lovely and something the hotel deserve commending for! Moving on, we were not offered assistance with luggage and instead made our own way to the room, on the twelfth floor. We had booked one with a view over the harbour and if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not something you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to, it was quite fantastic, especially at night. The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. We had a fridge, couch, TV, the usual things and unlike ever before, our own PC! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too exited \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a wonderful thought but internet access is an additional price and was the slowest we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve experienced since dial-up connections. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it may have been temporary but simply could not have managed had I been a business customer. I'm sure we saw mentioned somewhere that the whole media system was due an upgrade shortly. The bed was very comfortable and I can honestly say I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never come across a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpillow library\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 before but I suppose it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice touch if your fussy where you place your head. Breakfast in the morning was the best of nine hotels during our stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a wide selection for the continental breakfast, excellent buffet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fresh and hot and delicious! Staff were polite and friendly and service was swift. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try dinner (but presume it would also be good). We did, however, try cocktails and a dessert in the bar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a lovely venue in itself and both drinks and food were very enjoyable. While there, we did have some clothes laundered, as they reeked of smoke following a trip to the excellent Plimouth Plantation. Although not all that expensive, they definitely came back slightly smaller which was a disappointment. However, when addressed at reception, we were not charged for the service and given the parking for free which is, to our mind, more than adequate compensation. In conclusion, we were very impressed with this hotel and would certainly stay there again. There are some minor flaws to remedy but they are certainly getting nearly spot on. It is certainly somewhere to stay if you want to splash out on something a bit nicer than your average hotel and was much appreciated on our road trip!

The location of the Seaport is not great because the neighborhood is mostly corporate. The good news is that the silver line stop is right across the street. The hotel staff was okay not the most attentive, you have to really reach out and ask for help instead of them coming to you to make sure everything is alright. They need at least two doormen to help people check in. The hotel was fully booked but they really need more staff during peak times. The hotel has a no tipping policy which I like in theory, however without tips I feel like people are less motivated to go the extra distance for you.

Let this go & dealt with cold evenings because I didn't want to have to deal with hotel staff. Worst experience of all was when - after having \"do not disturb\" light on, I returned to room that evening to find that comforter I'd placed on the ground had been thrown back on the bed, my pajamas had been touched and folded on dirty comforter and, worst of all, my toothbrush was removed from glass holding it safely off counter and placed on a hotel towel (bristles and all touching it - gross!). Other toiletries had also been touched/moved around. Called the manager on duty and he forwarded call to security who did nothing but (30 minutes later!) send up someone with cheap disposable toothbrush. Location was okay (~7 min walk from conference), rooms okay, parking was only ~$30-something/day, but rude, unprofessional staff made this stay a horrible experience.

Overarching theme: either service was great or substandard. There was no middle ground, and no consistency.

The shampoo and coffee didn't get restocked the first two nights, so I left a note for the maid, and the problem was resolved. Room service was very late twice; both times I was quoted 15-20 minutes for a bowl of soup, and it took up to 45 minutes. I did try to go down to the lounge area, the Taro, and sat there for 10 minutes without getting waited on, so I left. (Most complaints happen during non-busy times.) The next time I ate there the service was great. Finally, the complimentary umbrella was broken. No problem, I brought it downstairs to ask for a new one and the staff member said \"You're the third person looking for one, sorry, I don't have any. \" No solution, no follow-up...just out of luck I guess. Okay, but several hours later, I called down to guest services and they brought one right up. Finally, for the last two nights, I've noticed small welts on my abdomen and back...strictly reporting my observation. Maybe I'm having an allergy to something, draw your own conclusion.

I stayed here for only one night with my spouse while he was attending an event at the BECC (Boston Exhibit Convention Center). It was a Saturday night, and there were many weddings and social events in the hotel. Our room was on the fifth floor, the floor above some of the event rooms, and it was a little loud at times. The location is great for the convention center; it's an easy walk over a bridge on an extremely low-traveled street. The lobby area is small but attractive, with beautiful floral arrangements that they seem to change every Sunday (when I arrived on Saturday, the flowers were not the same as when I left on Sunday). There is a gift shop, coffee bar (Seaport Cafe), a more formal restaurant (Aura), and then a more casual bar/restaurant with some outdoor seating (Tamo). I saw the fitness center, which seemed well-outfitted, but not the indooor pool. There is a very small outdoor garden space on the plaza level if you feel you need to relax outside. Parking is included in this hotel, as are all tips - very unusual in the USA. The valet parking attendant and bellman would not accept tips, telling us that service is included. The rooms are a decent size, with a small seating area with two comfy chairs. Bathrooms were a good size also, and stocked with Gilchrist & Soames products. There was a bathrobe, safe, and umbrella in the closet, and there's an empty small refrigerator for your personal use (it was only filled with four bottles of water - which were not complimentary). There is a 7-11 convenience store as well as a Dunkin' Donuts across Seaport Boulevard, so it's easy to buy things to bring back to the room. But beware of bringing wine or beer into the hotel - we were told that it was against Boston city law to bring alcohol into a hotel room. We were stopped in the lobby and asked to check out cooler containing beer (and it was just a 12-pack, enough for personal use for 2 people for 2 days; it wasn't like we were rolling in a keg!) There are a few restaurants within walking distance: the Barking Crab, Daily Catch, Legal Test Kitchen (LTK), Mortons, Wicked Priest, Anthony's Pier 4. The hotel location is really close to the traveling Cirque du Soleil production called OVO, and we were fortunate to score great seats at the last minute. We weren't sure what to expect, having seen permanent shows like KA and O in Las Vegas, but it was excellent. It was very easy to get to Logan Airport from this hotel, a 15-minute trip costing only $2 per person. There's a subway station for the gray line right outside the plaza-level door. (It's a bus, though, not a subway train that drives you to Logan.) I would stay here again if I were in town for a convention or trade show. While it's a short walk across a bridge to the Downtown/Financial District area, it's probably not the location that I would choose for a stay unrelated to a convention-center event. On the other hand, it's really easy to reach the airport from this hotel, and since you can even see the planes lined up on the runway across the river, it could be a viable option for an airport hotel (without the noise) that still allows you to enjoy the city.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cNear perfect conference hotel, though not cheap.\u201d", "Author": "rebg23losangeles", "ReviewID": "UR75513548", "Content": "Beautiful, modern interior design & decoration, excellent location across the street (literally) from the Harbor & water-taxi stand.

Top-shelf AV gear, and above-average food too. Aside from minor quibble about $$, the computers in the business center were set up a bit funky, in that the nice iMac (which I prefer) wasn't configured to print, and the Windows machines didn't allow direct access to USB thumb drives for printing stuff from it. They expect you to email it to yourself then open attachment from web email -- not very slick, but minor overall. From BOS airport, take the Silverline bus!! In the airport / baggage claim, look for 'T' transit-ticket-vending machines & buy a $5 pre-paid fare / ticket. Look or ask for for Silverline stop at Pickup curb, and the First Stop after leaving airport is 'World Trade Center / Seaport Hotel', 4 miles from BOS.

The room was furnished with an out-dated topped built in, with lots of storage. But the other tables were nice wood pieces. They have a card telling about their pillow library.

The closet was stocked with an extra blanket in a bag. (I'm sure that's good for allergies.) The iron seemed a little better than most hotel irons. There also was a large safe (big enough to fit a laptop). Also a robe and umbrella. They have Bose radios and keurig coffee makers in the rooms. Again, the toiletries left me confused. The shampoo was strong smelling and harsh, but everything else seemed mild. I like that they use a pump for soap at the sink. (seems less wasteful) Something interesting that they had were doorbells on the rooms. The wireless Internet was free. So was the gym. Which was a real full blown gym with exercise classes. Parking cost us $30 for a 2 night stay. There is a cafe, bar, and restraunt down stairs. The cafe was great for a quick breakfast. And we got the \"trio\" for dessert and coffee at the bar. They brought a pot of fresh coffee and the desserts were well worth it. Oh, and they have a no tipping policy in the hotel. So no maid tip, and tip was added to our bill at the bar. So overall...

How was it for the previous week when I called to confirm the day before?That's never happened to me before. There wasn't too much going on in the location, kinda boring. Just far enough from downtown to be dead. There was only water in the mini bar which I thought was weird for a \"fancier hotel\" and forget about the room service menu! $16 for small eggs with toast.

The immaculatley clean and unthreatening subway stop is a short walk from the hotel and can take you to Boston Common within minutes.

Internet access was free and a computer was on a large work desk. The bathroom was adequately spacious and was stocked with towels and complimentary toiletries. Recycling bins were available in the room. The room was at the front of the hotel and had fantastic views of the harbour and the city centre.

While it seemed to have potential to be an outstanding 5 star hotel , this must have been an off weekend. The parking concierge was welcoming, helpful and efficient. Then we stepped through the doors and it all ended there. I had prebooked using the online reservation system, so we had no problem that way.but the staff had an edge that day, and were not very welcoming nor helpful. we were not even told our room number! Had to look at the key and ask somebody in the Lobby where to find the elevator. truly, we had our luggage, room paperwork and just stood there looking lost. We booked a Harborview room and that was a true delight. Although the bed looked as if it had been sat upon several times after being made, we looked beyond that to great view of the Harbor. We attended a dinner in the Lighthouse Room. The staff there were incredible. Polite, respectful, smiling, helpful, and presented the food and themselves and ultimately the Hotel in a very posivite reputable manner. Then we returned to the room. This was the weekend of the Water Main break and Boston was under a BOIL Water ordinance. There was no signs nor information beyond a piece of paper slipped under our door that said we would be allowed to use the small bottles of water ($2.00 each) at no charge. 2 small bottles for drinking and brushing teeth . I started to worry about the water served at our meal and the ice in our drinks and the food prep.....but I tried to ignore this and gaze out the window at the wonderful view of Harbor lights. There was a computer in the room. it apparently was broken as there were all types of warning windows and Low Battery alerts. But the dang thing would not turn off.....so we tried to sleep with a glaring monitor....then gave up and threw a towel over the whole thing. we really didn't want to call maintenance at 2am. we read the inroom information and were hoping to see a map of some sort. we did not know there was a pool..and when we found the Fitness room it was locked tight. The lack of information regarding what ended up being a State of an Emergency, the lackadaisical attitude of the front desk staff, the \"Surprise\" extra charges and taxes and fees on our bill....all added to a less than favorable stay.

The location is right on the wharf, across from the World Trade Center. There are several restaurants around, a 7-11 and starbucks nearby but other than that, not much shopping or things to do. You can catch the silver line T across the street which is direct to the airport if you need that, otherwise you can connect to other T lines to tourist spots. Self-parking is $31 with in/out privileges until midnight the day of checkout, which allows you to spend the rest of the day touring the city if you want. The hotel was easy to find and the parking is in a garage right beneath hotel with an elevator straight to the lobby - uber convenient. I got a king room which was plenty roomy, flat screen tv but not the best reception of all channels. Free wifi was included and had a strong signal at all hours of the day and night. Coffee maker and fridge in room, ice on every floor. The only complaint I have is the taxes that are added to the bill, almost $10 per night which I suppose all Boston hotels have, tis just annoying. They should post the REAL price when you book the place. They also have a free shuttle running into the city near Faneuil Hall and Freedom Trail. Found out about that quite by happy accident :) If you have a car that you want to park easily and go in and out like I did, this is a great place to stay.

Indeed, the staff is remarkably warm and caring - I found this to be true on a business trip in August, and again on vacation in December. Seaport is a modern tower along the waterfront, near the Renaissance and the Westin. Wonderfully convenient to the Silver Line, and in the warm weather it's just a few steps to the wharves & the scenic harborfront. From the Silver line, go UP a level to the concourse & use the lovely plaza-level pedestrian bridge. It brings you in above the lobby, but saves crossing streets and dealing with traffic ... and it brings you in past classical music piped through speakers in the Seaport's little garden area. The front desk staff here is beyond top-notch: Helpful and warm, and well-informed about the city if you have questions. There's also a good concierge. The porters/valets working the door are great, too - equally friendly, professional and well-informed. The good news: There's no \"back\" side of the hotel facing the industrial zone. Bad news: There's also no front side facing out onto the harbor. Instead, Seaport is set perpendicular to the waterfront (same with the Renaissance) - so views improve a bit if you're on a higher floor closer to the water, but the average rooms have no magnificent water views. The rooms a understated: A slightly nautical theme, perhaps, with light wood tones and light colors. All attractive, new, crisp. Smallish rooms but sensibly laid out with excellent amenities. More importantly, there's there \"cozy\" feeling that very few business hotels come close to achieving. Enjoy the remarkably sensible doorbells: You use a switch in the room if you wish to illuminate little \"service room now\" or \"please don't disturb\" signs. Best of all, the doorbells mean there's none of that hideous keys-on-door rapping in the early morning, followed by the awfully loud \"Houskeeeeeeepppping!!\" that you hear in so many business hotels. Instead, the maids can use the doorbells - which generate no noise to other rooms. The gym is magnificent - first-rate machines in ridiculous abundance, along with a spa-like locker area (including heated tile floors) with first-rate showers and one of the best steam rooms I've found anywhere. (Don't forget to use the ingenious eucalyptus-water spray bottle; there was one in the men's steamroom that added a lot of sinus-clearing power to the steam. I've heard the women's side doesn't have one -- if not, ask at the desk). The only improvement here would be to make the pretty pedestrian pool more interesting (removing the lap-lane barriers would be a start) ... and surprisingly, there is no hot tub. That's the only serious squawk I've got about Seaport. The restaurant needs a makeover: It has the feel of a Clarion (or an upscale cafeteria at a nursing home) because of the boring design and decor. The overpriced breakfast buffet was just too small and had too few interesting choices. Lunch and dinner might be better. Room service is also mondo expensive. But this is one place where I'd spend the money: Clam chowder, a coke and a pizza is crazy costly, but that 'coziness' factor means a lot. Room service here is more of a treat than a \"oh well, I'm too tired to go downstairs\" sort of chore. Swing out the flat screen TV and enjoy. Climate control is modern and efficient, amenities are outstanding. Bathrobes and FREE overnight shoe cleaning. Which brings up the nicest feature here: They hit you with a small service charge when you register, but then expect - and accept - no tips. It's not a \"tipping isn't necessary\" guildeline, but truly a \"we kindly request that you not tip\" policy. I forgot and offered an extra buck to the cheerful and efficient guy working at the Starbucks - he politely declined, saying that's included already. Free Internet: A very nice extra! Look for special activities here. At Halloween, they did an imaginative game that send kinds to a half-dozen areas of the hotel to gather candy. At Christmas, they had an outstanding $99 a night special - and did up the public areas with plenty of appealing Christmas decorations. Nearby are Legal Seafoods Test Kitchen and several interesting seafood places along the wharves.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cA simple room - good price ($90-) for the location\u201d", "Author": "BostonWagga", "ReviewID": "UR51679181", "Content": "The simple clean and comfortable hotel room we obtained for the night of the \"Boston Blizzard\" was a close location close to the airport.

Ill get straight to the point. Cons. The flat screen tv came in really scrambled and the channel selection was very poor. The room service was extremely astronomically over priced for the food quality. The bedding was something youd expect a 95 year old women to put on a spare bed very thick and uncomfortable. I had the misfortune of being in a room near an elevator and this one guy kept going out in the elevator hallway to try to get his girlfriend to go back out with him over his phone both nights I was there he was out there multiple times talking about personal information I only eves dropped because watching the tv was pointless and the walls are very paper thin you can hear everything almost everything in your neighbors room. The 12$ grilled cheese with bacon I ordered in the restaurant came with out bacon and wasn't that good. The restaurant staff didnt seem that concerned with serving their patrons instead they were more glued to a baseball game that wasn't even the SOX!!! Expensive Parking. Pros. The beds mattress was comfortable. Good soap, polite desk staff, Good parking garage staff the guy cut my bill by 1/3 once he saw the look on my face( as my company wasnt paying me to park) Also the staff will refer to you as your name which is cool and the housekeeping will even leave you a voicemail to figure out when you want your room cleaned. They also have a light switch type deal for the do not disturb sign. In short I stayed in a double room im not sure if the suites are nice but I had the opportunity to stay 2 extra days instead of driving an hour in the morning to the trade show but I denied my boss and chose to go home and drive in the next time. It kinda pains me to be negative about this because from the outside and just knowing Boston I always though it would be an amazing hotel to stay on for business of pleasure.

This hotel is a good, solid business/convention hotel. Comfortable but not plush, more utilitarian than luxury. Overall, this is a very good hotel. First, a couple of good things. The proximity to the convention center is very good. The hotel is close to Logan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the morning I left it took 12 minutes to get to the airport. The gym facilities were new, well maintained and in a nice, light, airy space. The food from room service was good, though limited choice. There is access to public transportation and I believe the hotel runs shuttles during the week to downtown. It was only about a mile walk to South Station, but I noted that there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153T\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd station near by. Views of the harbor and city from our 15th floor room were spectacular. Close by the new Institute of Contemporary Art. Our room was clean. The service was efficient. Notably, for many of the services, there is no tipping and a service charge is built into the tab. For example, I tried tipping the doorman who helped me with my bags and he refused, as did the waiter who brought up my room service order. The staff was nice, efficient and helpful. The bed was comfortable though not outstanding. There is free wi-fi in the rooms. Now, a couple of negatives (though they are small). Location: the hotel is out on a wharf in what had until recently been an industrial zone/port facility. So, while there are other hotels and office buildings in the area (close to the Convention Center) and some well known Boston restaurants (like Anthony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pier 4 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c overpriced and over-touristed) the hotel really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close to the action of the city. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, for example, a nearby drug store or a lot of choices of restaurants, bars and shopping. For all of those things you have to cab or walk more into the center of town \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my guess is that it would be at least a mile and a half walk. Next, I like my rooms cool to cold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m staying on the upper floors of a hotel. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open the windows and while the thermostat said it was set at 65, it never felt cool or cold in the room. However, these are minor complaints for a good hotel in a area of the city that is quickly being rebuilt.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "houston", "Title": "\u201cOk\u201d", "Author": "Freeway12", "ReviewID": "UR46019797", "Content": "My husband had a business seminar here last week and I went along.

This was only our second trip away from our kids in 6 years. In shopping for a hotel, I was shocked at the rates in the area over the Columbus Day holiday. Simple 4 Star hotels seemed to be in the $350 range....which to me translates to the Grand Wailea in Maui...why would I pay that in Boston...okay so not a big city traveler. Anyways, I went with priceline and got this for $175/night. We bought the Charlie card that is $15 for a week of subway/bus use...what a steal! We took the silverline bus to the hotel, which was as easy as riding a hotel shuttle. We arrived at the hotel at 730AM and the front desk clerk advised she could offer me a room then, even though check in wasn't til 3pm, or we could wait to get the king sized bed we had requested. We decided to wait. At 1030AM she called and had given us a king size bed with a beautiful view of the seaport. The bed was great. The room had nice bath products, a cool flat screen that could be turned, the ability to print from our laptop in the room to the business center down stairs, and in room bath robes(I love that). For tourists, there isn't a lot outside the front door (dunkin donuts and 7 eleven) but it is a clean industrial/commericial area. There is a bus stop across the street and that was our link to the city. We were about a 10 min ride to downtown on this underground bus, and again we only paid $15 for the entire trip for unlimited Subway use. Of note, our favourite restaurant of the trip, Yankee Lobster is about 2 blocks away. The twin lobster dinner with coleslaw, corn, and two lobsters was only $23 and was great. The lobster roll was pretty good, too. I definately recommend Yankee Lobster. We went to Park 9 and others, but this was our favourite. The main drawback of this hotel is that is isn't in the heart of the tourist attracttions. If that is essential for you, then perhaps you should look elsewhere. We walked to Quincy Market once, but it took a good 20min, so we opted to take the subway day and night. The service, amenities, cleanliness, and comfort of this hotel were great.

The hotel also discourages tipping. This is a little strange and I left a tip for housekeeping anyway, but I would guess that they must do a reasonable job of compensating their staff. OK, all the other stuff is nice, but the best thing about this hotel is the health club. It has free weights, cardio machines, weight machines, spin classes and a lap pool.

Previously stayed there in 2006. Check in/out - Both the desk attendant for checking in and the one for checking out talked as quickly as possible, almost like a rehearsed speech (I live in the area, so I thought I talked fast, but WOW, they are speed demons). Both in and out, there wasn't anyone else waiting, so there was no need to rush. I wasn't asked if I needed anything checking in, nor was I asked how my stay was checking out. Very cold. Conceirge was great! Very friendly and chatty! Told us about some things in the area. Also told us that there is a free shuttle running every 10 minutes from the hotel to downtown Quincy Market! We used it and it was great. Very nice drivers. The hotel was under construction in the lobby, making the bar area tiny and very noisy. We didn't know about this until we checked in and saw it. No mention of this to us by the hotel desk clerk at check in. No compensation, such as a reduced drink at the reduced bar, or anything. Extension cords running through exterior doors, plastic hanging down in the lobby bar, smells, drills, saws and noise. Room was small but nice. Very clean. Only a few (maybe 8) channels on the tv!! As there is really nothing to do in the area at night, this was a surprise! Beds comfortable. As other reviewers mentioned, you could hear every toilet flush in the other rooms. As long as you wanted to be up at 6:30, when you can hear everyone's showers starting, and be awake about 10 PM to hear them all flushing their toilets as they go to bed, you'll be OK. Breakfast buffet was just OK. Very expensive. Ate a lunch and dinner at Morton's Steakhouse across the street. Also tried LTK down the street. Both were good alternatives for the restaurant in the hotel. Easy walk to the convention center. In fact we had a lovely view of the Convention center, the MBTA Silver Line station and its parking lot from our hotel room. Wireless internet worked fine. Parking is $29 a night. Beware that the hotel adds a $3 'service charge' to your nightly rate, and then Boston adds a hotel tax, a convention tax, a local tax, and maybe another one I've forgotten, to your bill, so your nightly rate will end up being more than the original quoted room rate. Overall, it wasn't as good as our stay 2 years ago (service seems colder and restaurant not as good).

The room was beautifully appointed with soothing decor, a very comfortable bed, complimentary wireless internet (and ethernet cords for wired laptops) along with television and a lovely Bose Wave Radio. Walking in upon check-in, the radio was playing and when they came in for turn-down service....it was turned on again. I loved the bathroom with the curved shower rod, meaning I didn't have to fight the clinging curtain from the traditional rod configuration. The \"Green Concept\" was also something that gave a good feeling over stewardship from water consumption, use of towels/linens and each room was also equipped with recycling bins with splits in the waste basket. They're also a LEEDS hotel so they're most energy efficient. While there have been posts about the noise level in this hotel, I didn't experience any interference from rooms adjacent, or noise from the hallway. Hotel staff was also very accommodating, friendly and guest centric with their attentiveness. I didn't dine at the hotel or avail room service...but I did note the lobby bar was very busy and quite animated with patrons. I learned that during the summer, there are concerts just a couple blocks away that not only draw crowds before and after, but many times, the hotel is utilized by talent and road crews on production. The convenient location to the airport was a swift 15 minute ride to and from the Boston Logan Airport. Cabs are also plentiful and can pickup from the street level, or from the 3rd level that spills out on the walkways for both the convention and trade centers. We took a day trip on arrival to the JFK Library, only a 20-25 minute cab ride and then walked two blocks to a wonderful seafood restaurant that was FABULOUS, recommended to our group of meeting planning professionals that was \"right on\". I have very acute hearing....so it was a pleasant and wonderful night's rest...and you gotta love the lamps in the bedrooms that have dimmers on them.....and the night light in the bathroom was also a bonus!", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "HawkeyeChicago_IL", "ReviewID": "UR8063996", "Content": "I stayed here for 5 days as part of a convention group.

The last night of our stay, there was some sort of Fire in the hotel and the alarm system came on, annouced the situation, and instructed us to wait for further instructions. The message kept playing, but we recieved no instructions. I kept looking out our 10th floor window at the fire trucks below and the growing number of people gathering on the sidewalk. Upon trying to get information from the front desk, I was told that no one could talk to me about the situation. VERY UN-NERVING. After 20min of getting no where, we left the room and walked down 10 flights of stairs, met other guests who reported the same sense of uneasiness, not being able to get any information. When we reached the Lobby, my husband was again told that no one could talk to him. There seemed to be a lot of confusion. We sat on the sidewalk for over an hour before we were finally let back in, and were never told anything about the incident. When we checked out the next am, the desk clerk asked how our stay was, I mentioned the fire incident the night before and she just laughed, shrugged it off and said \"oh, yeah, that\".

The room was very neat and though I agree that you can hear the neighbors shower and toilet, I did not find that to be all that disturbing but maybe it was because we had quiet neighbors.

The gym staff were also very professional and helpful. The hotel had several wedding receptions going on at the same time but they did not intefere with ours. The reception we attended was in the Lighthouse hall. This is the newer room and had wonderful views. The only problem was that to go to the bathroom you needed to go down a steep outside staircase or take a small elevator. The food and service was very good at the reception.

The mini bar was well stocked and there was a coffee machine in the bathroom (the coffee was pretty good too). An iron, ironing board and hair dryer are provided and there is a laundry service if you need it. High speed wireless internet service is complementary in every room. The business center has computers, printers and a business quality copy machine. The fitness center is well equipped. As other reviewers have stated, the staff was very gracious and accommodating. This is a \"service\" hotel and there is no tipping required, in fact, it's discouraged. (However, when we had a drink at the bar, they added a 15% gratuity to the check.) During the day, our floor was very noisy, there seemed to be a lot of activity coming from the housekeeping station so if you're the type who likes to take a mid-day nap, it could be a distraction. At night however, it was very quiet. One thing that we found disappointing was that there was no complementary breakfast - it may sound petty but I expected more from a $150 - $200 per night hotel. There is a restaurant on the premises and you can have breakfast there if you choose. There is also a small cafe where you can get coffee, pastries, cereal, etc. The hotel is not exactly near the center of town but you can walk there if you like walking. There is also a subway nearby (we found the subways very easy to navigate) and complementary shuttle service into town. (Every 15 minutes Mon - Fri 7am - 7pm via coach - on the weekends they provide a van but less frequently and only until 1:30pm.) There were always taxis parked outside as well. If you drive there and choose to park in the hotel's garage, you should know that at the time of this writing, the fee is $29 extra per night - we found this excessive and do not believe guests should be charged. Overall the experience was pleasant - the only reason that we would not choose to stay here again is due to the hotel's proximity to the center of town.

Although I did not stay at this hotel, I had friends staying at this hotel and spent a lot of time there while attending a conference this past week. If you are attending a conference at the new Boston convention center, would highly recommend staying here over the neighboring Westin hotel. It is just a short walk across an overpass to the convention center and much nicer and cheaper than the Westin. Service, food quality and options and the business services offered are much better than the Westin. Here are some specifics. While the Westin hotel charges their guests 20 cents a page to photocopy, the Seaport charges 10 cents. It cost $10 to print out a 6 page Word document at the Westin--at the Seaport, access to computers and printers was free for hotel guests in the business center. Also, a computer is set up in the lobby for free guest use (Westin charges 9.95 per day for wireless access in the rooms). Unlike the Westin hotel, guests were notified when overnight packages arrrived (at the Westin they charge for the privilege of picking up the packages and don't even let you know that they arrived). Although very large, the Westin hotel does not have sufficient capacity to serve food to its guests. Only one restaurant plus a Starbucks in the lobby at the Westin--at the Seaport there is a bar/lounge, restaurant and Starbucks. One night, I was told there was a 1.5 hour wait for Westin room service. When called back 1.5 hour later, was again told it would be 1.5 hours. When shared this story with a friend at the Seaport--she said that the wait was always a half hour or less for room service. Other Westin guests also complained about the food. One day, guests waited over half an hour to access the Westin lunch buffet even though there were empty tables (not have enough staff). In comparison to the Westin, service was warmer at the Seaport. To say \"thank you\" to the Seaport for their kind service while attending the conference, I ate as many of the meals that I could there. Food was also better at the Seaport (e.g., turkey sandwich at the Seaport was carved turkey instead of pressed turkey at the Westin). Cleaning could be better at the Westin although only about 6 months old--big stain on the carpet, a previous guest's old food was still in the minibar, and used glasses were put back where the clean ones should have been. To be fair, I did speak to the Westin manager about these problems before I left and she did offer $100 off my very expensive week stay.

The Seaport has a highly-rated upscale restaurant, the Aura, and an early-morning to late afternoon \"Bakery Cafe\" snack bar, as well as 24 hour room service . Contrary to other reviews on this site, the Seaport is a short walk from eateries of various price, cuisine and formality levels, including the Barking Crab, Daily Catch, Anthony's Pier 4, Seaport Bar and Grill, Yankee Lobster Company, the brand-new, ultra-modern LTK, (\"Legal Test Kitchen,\" of the Legal Fish Company empire,) the No-Name restaurant, a Chinese restaurant and the breakfast/lunch cafeteria of the Boston World Trade Center (weekdays only). A new Panini restaurant is about to open a block away. The just-opened (June, 2006,) Westin Convention Center hotel, with its facilities, is a short walk away, so the Seaport is not an isolated hotel. We occupied an attractive one-bedroom corner suite, #1001, with a partial harbor view, while attending a convention at the neighboring convention center. It was not large for a suite, but we were impressed by the attractive, and thoughtful layout and details which made it extremely practical AND comfortable, (which is a pleasure compared to so many \"boutique\" hotels which sacrifice practicality and comfort for stylishness). On request, the Seaport will empty your minibar so that you may use it for your own (refrigerated) storage. Rooms include many \"mod cons\" (e.g. a Bose Wave radio/CD player as the clock radio and a laptop-size complimentary electronic safe) and good communications options, including complimentary wired and wireless broadband, public spaces wireless-equipped, and public computers in the lobby. Thoughtful touches include free loaner LAN cables on the desk in the room. The hotel has a business center; if guests need, as I did, to print out documents, the \"PrintMe\" system allows printing from your room to a high-quality color printer in the Business Center, another complimentary service. (The center is open, by guest room-keys, 24 hours a day, and is staffed during the day.) Outstanding service, though, was the high point of our five-day stay. We were pleasantly surprised, in a completely non-tipping environment, at how eager, without being obsequious, every staff member we encountered seemed to be to serve us.

Like another post mentioned it really isn't near any of the restaurants/bars that make Boston such a fun city. However, Boston is a fairly small and compact city and very walker friendly. I walked to the North End one night and it took 30 minutes. It's a very nice walk along the water and wharfs, cut through Columbus Park onto Richmond and you'll hit Hanover street which is the heart of the North End (boston's Little Italy). Go to Antico Forno at 93 Salem for brick oven baked Gnocchi...delicious. And after that, hit Mike's Pastry for some of the best cannolis and pistachio macaroons (you can see why I hit the fitness center so much). I also walked to the Back Bay in about 40 minutes, again a great walk and you can cut through Boston Commons and the Public Garden. So the location is not great to get somewhere in a hurry, but there are plenty of cabs that will get you just about anywhere in a max of 15 minutes. Plus the T is very efficient and frequent. If you're coming for business, especially at the convention center/WTC it's a great place. If you're coming for a vacation, I would probably stay somewhere else, just to really experience the city.", "Date": "May 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cWould not stay again.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5021082", "Content": "I have stayed at the Seaport in the past for business and events at the hotel.

The clerk issued a mild shrug and then provided our keys. We were both dissapointed. The room was small, bland, and simply had a view of the nearby building. It was nothing special. However, after discussing the situation with the concierge, we were placed in a very comfortable mini suite with 2 rooms (bed room and 2nd room with couch and TV). We did not have a view of the water, but the room was comfortable and nice. The concierge was extremely helpful and friendly. Location: We took a harbor cruise, so the location was excellent. The hotel is located next to the world trade center and across from the pier. There is also a MBTA stop adjacent to the hotel. The area feels very 'corporate' and not like traditional boston. Think conventions, office buildings, and a pier. It does have very easy access to I93, so getting into/out of the area is extremely easy. The hotel bar is nice and the interior is clean and fresh.

The Spirit of Boston dinner cruise boat is also directly across the street as well as the WTC convention center and several seafood restaurants. The hotel was clean, service good, appointments nice but the room itself I felt was on the small side. The furnishings were good but I expected more for the money except for the bathroom which was tops. A nice touch was the Bose Wave alarm clock/radio which provided really great wake-up music, not one of those little cheapies you usually get. I was on the 14th floor and the views were great but I wasn't in the room long enough to appreciate it. There was a bar/lounge on the lobby level serving food and a pricey restaurant. I ate in the bar and had a $10 hamburger. The bun was humongous, the burger smallish and overdone.

However since the deluxe king room there was more than double the price at the Seaport I decided to stay there with the group; more politically correct anyway. Am I really glad we did! We had a wonderful time. The staff was just terrific and I love the service being included. You never tip here and everyone bends over backward to be courteous. I don't think I've ever had so many people say good morning to me in a hotel. The deluxe king room was the same size as at the Boston Harbor which was plenty of room. I don't understand the \"small room size' complaint. I was not guaranteed a harbor view but for the money that was OK. Lucky me I got a harbor view from the 15 floor. It was wonderful. The bed and pillows were also very comfortable. Down feather pillows which I always use.The new silver line for the MBTA (subway) for Boston is open next door so getting around town is now a breeze. We walked to the New England Aquarium on Sunday along the \"Harbor Walk\". It was very pleasant and we needed the exercise after our huge buffet breakfast Sunday morning. I also ordered from room service several times and it was quick and very good. Saturday evening I wanted a desert that was not listed on the room service menu. No problem, they were happy to oblige.

I'd like to preface this by saying that given that since this was a complete surprise to me, I had zero expectations. I will be very frank - I have stayed in many hotels ranging from a Four Seasons to a Super 8; as well as many hotels in Boston. The #1 criteria for me are these: a.) Cleanliness and b.) Customer Service and c.) Value. If you're paying for grade A service, you are entitled to receive it, if you are paying for B service, don't expect A service. At best, I'd say our room was small, though it was clean. I was surprised at the rates we were charged for standard size room. The bed covering seemed cheap, and bed itself was uncomfortable to merely sit on. Aside from that, it was about the size and aesthetic of a dorm room with carpeting. Location - For people visiting, I would strongly suggest you stay closer to the city as this hotel is really meant for business purposes. The area completely shuts down at night and there is nothing to see once you take a stroll through the deserted courtyard. An empty wharf, a shut down warehouse and what appeared to be a seafood restaurant somewhere down the way. All in all, we spent about 1/2 an hour in the room, surveying the contents and trying to make do with what was available to us. After seeing the completely deserted restaurant, and realized there really were not any available areas for even a quick snack we decided to try elsewhere. What made me give this review a 'Terrible' as opposed to an Okay or even a Neutral, was the attitude the Manager downstairs dispensed to us after we had very amicably explained our situation. We were not expecting a 100% full refund. That would have been nice, and in my mind, probably the best customer service they could have provided -- but CERTAINLY not the argument of \"you are from the area, you should know better.\" Instead of walking away from the situation with both parties satisfied, the manager on duty chose to charge us $50, openly claiming we had dirtied the room after we offered for them to come up and please look at the room we were given [for condition and quality], claim that our complaint or reason for leaving was bogus all in somewhat of a distasteful manner. I think, the charge may have been fair, I expected better manners, customer service and poise from a hotel that praises themselves in the regard in which they do on their website and I'm completely dissapointed that we have extended ourselves to what we thought was an A/B Hotel and was met with D or Failing service and paid for it. I only hope that sharing my experience will help the hotel reform their management or deter some visitors from wasting their time. If you are a visitor to Boston, I have always, always had great luck with the Marriot Copley.

I chose the Seaport because after reading various reviews for other Boston hotels, some of which weren't great, I chose Seaport for the good reviews I had read about it, and because the price wasn't too over the top. I'll start with what I liked about the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and they answered every question I had to my satisfaction. Check in and out were quick, baggage was delivered to the room promptly, and picked up within 5 minutes of my call to the front desk upon departure. They even gave my 1 year old daughter a little teddy bear while we were checking in. They supplied us with brochures and driving directions for things my family wanted to do outside of the city. As far as staff goes, I would rate the Seaport top notch. The computers in the lobby with high speed net access were nice when I wanted to check my email. The free USA Today paper weekday mornings was a nice surprise that I did not know about. About the room. It was very clean, but other than that was nothing special. There were enough draws and closet space for 2 adults and 1 child for our 5 day stay. Upon arrival, the crib, refrigerator, and microwave we requested were already there in the room. The view from the room was nothing amazing. Very deceiving is the main picture that most travel sites use for the Seaport. It looks as if the building is free standing on the water with nothing around it. Well either that picture is old or has been edited, because there are buildings as tall or taller on either side of it, which cuts down on the view dramatically. The bed in the room was also rather uncomfortable. The bathroom was nice with the marble tile and counters, but the water pressure for taking a shower was awful. The toilet was also very noisy when flushing, which wasn't fun with a baby sleeping in the room if you know what I mean! We did not use the gym or the pool at all, so I cannot really review them. I had wanted to use the pool, but again the pictures you see online are a bit deceiving, as the pool is much smaller that it appears, so with all the kids in there I decided against it. The restaurant sure smelled great every time we walked past it. I heard good things about it, so we decided to have breakfast there one morning. The food was nothing special, all the basics, pancakes, eggs, bacon, cereal, etc. For $42 for that, for 2 people, needless to say it was the first and last time we ate there. Parking for the hotel is in a public lot below the building. It is $25 a day for self park, or $35 for valet. I opted for self park, which was fine, but depending on the time you go to park, you may have a decent walk to an elevator since it fills up at times. There are outdoor lots right down the block that signs said were $7 or $8, so they might be worth looking into to save some money. There is a lot of construction going on in Boston right now, and a LOT of it is in the area around the Seaport. While they claim the hotel is in walking distance of things like the aquarium and Quincy Market, unless you feel like walking past noisy and dusty areas, you wont be walking too many places around the hotel. All is not lost though, since free shuttles run all day from just outside the hotel into a few spots more centrally located in the city, up until midnight. They don't run on weekends though which kinda stinks. Overall I guess I would recommend the hotel. It was a pleasant stay other than the few minor gripes I listed.

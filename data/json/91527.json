The main breakfast area was under construction, but they had a nice temporary set up in a double room that worked just fine. The room was very clean and was well stocked with kitchen utensils for someone there for an extended period of time. The only negative was that the pool and common areas were under construction and it would have been nice to know that before arriving. I suppose it is not fair to hold the hotel responsible as we booked online, but now we know to ask in advance. We stayed just one night over Presidents' Day weekend.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201c\"Thank You Residence Inn Fishers\"\u201d", "Author": "kcetnar", "ReviewID": "UR124416539", "Content": "I was extremely surprised when I arrived at this hotel. For the price, it is a well maintained clean hotel. The thing that really stood out was the staff, they were soooo friendly and helpful Thank you Ezra and Inge who truly made out stay special.

Soft bed, quiet room, terrific free breakfast and buffet, in a great neighborhood. In deciding between this hotel and the downtown Residence Inn, TripAdvisor reviewers rated Fishers highly, and they were right, plus, downtown is an easy drive from Fishers, which is on the northwest side of Indy. Enjoyed wonderful breakfasts in the hotel's dining area. We bought New York Strip steaks from the Super Walmart down the street and grilled them on the hotel's gas grill. Enjoyed relaxing dinners with my sons at the dining table in the room. Cooked on stovetop in room. The evening buffet was always a nice selection of snacks. Internet connection was easy, with great speeds. The sofa sleeper was comfortable. The pool was a little cool. Visited Ben and Ari's for pizza and video games. We love Indy, it's clean, feels safe, and the people are very friendly, Lots to see and do, and it's easy to get around. We toured Lucas Oil Stadium, but only offered Tuesday and Wednesday. Take a lap around the Indy Motor Speedway, on a tour bus, for $5, it's worth it. Buy your Children's Museum ticket online the day before you go, or you may be waiting in a long line. Almost anywhere you park downtown is fine, because of the walkway system, but expect to pay for parking downtown. The Indy Auto Show had all the major automakers, without the hassle of a bigger city auto show. IUPUI has a law school, medical school, dental school, and a 23,000 undergraduates, it's a great school with a low profile. GPS helped us choose between freeways and local streets. After a minor plumbing issue in our bathroom, the manager immediately apologized and provided us with a new room. Fishers RI is getting $3.2M in renovations starting in February 2012, without disturbing the guests. The manager said Fishers RI service scores are always high, and I can see why. The staff is very friendly and hard working. Be careful on 96th Street, it's a very busy street, with some odd lane markings.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery Comfortable Hotel, Nice Staff\u201d", "Author": "Japanesejockgirl", "ReviewID": "UR121860192", "Content": "Several business colleagues were staying in this hotel and it was very convenient to the business area of Fishers.

I am staying with my wife and kid in a 1 BR suite in Fishers (suburbs of Indy). The suite is quite spacious. While I am busy with business calls, my wife and kid can relax in the bedroom unlike the studios which would make things worse. The food is great for the morning breakfast and they also offer evening meal thrice a week (reduced to thrice a week because of recession). There are 2 TVs so while you watch, spouse and kid can enjoy their own.

It was clean, the staff was extremely friendly and the service went above and beyond.

I've always liked Residence Inn's because of The larger rooms, The great complimentary breakfast, and The manager's cocktail parties. I checked in on Wednesday, and was greates by Rio. He made the check in process easy and pleasant. He informed me about the pool, fitness center, the free hot breakfast as well As suggesting I grab a drink As The cocktail party was winding down( I got there at 7:00 and it only lasts until 7:30 Monday - Wednesday). I was less than impressed with the studio room I was assigned via Priceline. I dropped my bags and then Asked Rio about Restarants- which I provided a list for. Thursday when I was back from work, Rio asked how I liked my room- I exPlained how I felt the studio room was not on standard to the regular Residence Inn's I've stayed at nationally. He without a beat- said he wanted to see what he could do, since their studios and one bedrooms have Thr same rate, and wanted to upgrade me. Unfortunately due to booking through Priceline- he couldn't change my room, I was fine with that. The rest of my stay was pleasant- and all the staff greater me when they saw me- from maintenance, to the maids, to all front desk staff. I would highly recommend this hotel- not only for the staff- but all the great restaurants within walking distance( cheeseburger in paradise is next door, and Wolfie's a local Pub, and Petersons- an upscale restaurant were across the street). For peoPle who travel For business- having a hotel that employs people like Rio- makes being away from home bearable!!", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cSpacious clean well designed suites and most of all a good breakfast to start your day right\u201d", "Author": "amdu", "ReviewID": "UR81138162", "Content": "We had booked a suite for 2 nights at this hotel and it surpassed all our expectations. the room was clean, spacious and well divided into kitchen, sleeping, living and dining areas.

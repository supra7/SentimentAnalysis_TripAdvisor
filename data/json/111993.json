But this place is worth it alone for the location. Seriously LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! I've been coming to New Orleans for 7 years straight and this place has the best location in the quarter. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The patio was very nice and if I had a group joining me this would be an even stronger plus. Great place to start with a bottle of wine! Again we had an inside room without a window. The room size wasn't bad but the hotel is old. I can't imagine the cost to upkeep them all. We were on the 2nd floor and we could hear any noise above us. The bed was a bit old but better than the B&B I stayed at last year. To sum it up this place is worth the location and I will book next year as well.

The only occasion we did not stay here we booked at the Provencial over on Ursulines (the Place d'Armes was already booked full with a convention). On our first visit we were able only to secure an interior room which was dark and damp (pretty recently after Katrina) but perfectly adequate. Our second room was right on the courtyard, and tho a bit noisy on the pool, we had a lovely stay there. The last two visits we've been lucky and have been given a large private \"suite\" at the back of the hotel, the windows of which face out onto Chartres. We found the room itself lovely, the new bathroom is huge and there was plenty of room for all my shoes. (You think a girl would learn before packing). As for the staff? Absolutely delightful (hey Ryan & Chris, hat's off to you both for making us feel at home). After reading several of the reviews, it seems the negs are all the same. Bugs (It's New Orleans people), noise outside the windows (um, still in New Orleans, and right in the heart of the Quarter) and age of the facilities. (may I remind y'all that the character of these places is in the history, which means they are OLD buildings?). Kidding aside, if you want a real Old South experience, this is your Hotel. If you would be happier in a slick corporate hotel, know yourself well enough to admit it. Head up to Canal, stay at a Marriott and walk back into the Quarter. You'll be comfortable and the rooms won't have bugs. Of course they won't be in a crazy beautiful historic building, but we all need what we need. I need to be in the heart of things, and Place d'Armes does not disappoint. The only complaints that seem bizarre, and borderline untruthful, are those about the staff. The bell hops, in particular, have without exception gone out of their way to make our stay easy and comfortable. The idea that they are rude or inattentive is preposterous. I often wonder why some people leave home. Traveling for me is an adventure, a submission to the elements around me and most of all, accepting the culture and friendships offered along the way The gals at the front desk are not overly ebullient, but do they have to be? I found them cordial and willing to get what I needed done. I don't ask more than that. The Place d'Armes has become a home away from home. We just wouldn't be happy anywhere else. It's a magical place, and yes, there are loud noises on the street at night and early morning. If that bothers you, just do what I did. Have a nice jungle juice cocktail before you go to bed. Everclear and kool-aid does wonders for a nap. Yes, the air is always wet and it gets into the fibers of everything, and I do mean everything. Yes, the rooms can be dark, but they are not at all unclean, as some have stated. The humidity in this part of the country will leave a lingering must in things that are old, like the walls, and it just is what it is. But the staff does their job, and the rooms are clean, the toilets flush and there was plenty of hot water. The breakfast is a continental one, and it's free. I love the \"dining reviews\" on free food. Really? Because it's not a courtesy? Sometimes in reading these reviews, I wonder if folks on vacation are looking to be unhappy with things. Traveling is expensive, and spent money can bring a kind of regret that has nothing to do with the hotels in which one stays. But I can make you a promise. In the land of the \"big easy life\" if you open your heart, slap on a smile, and just say \"hey, how y'all doing?\" before asking for assistance, you will find that the South will charm you too, especially at the Place d'Armes.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wausau, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cPlace d'Armes Hotel\u201d", "Author": "MaryHeedy", "ReviewID": "UR128194008", "Content": "Make sure when you stay here, that you get the newer part of the property for your room.

No problems with either of the rooms or with the billing. I don't understand why there are so many negative comments about noise, \"musty\" smells and \"mildew\" in the rooms. Both our rooms were very clean, although a bit dated with brass fixtures, a tiny bit of rust around the drain in the tub, that sort of minor stuff. This part of town is pretty insulated from the noise of Bourbon and Decatur Sts. I really wonder if any of these complaints were brought to the attention of Management, as they seem very eager to please. I witnessed the Front Desk Supervisor telling another departing guest (who was upset about internal noise the previous night), to contact her personally the next time they were coming to town, so that she could make it up to them. Everyone has addressed the location, which is great, but the main courtyard, the furnishings and the staff are just wonderful. We sat out almost every evening after dinner, hating to leave the beautiful setting; but when we did retire, the room itself was gorgeous. The In-room safe is large enough for a full-size laptop and the free Internet worked fine the entire stay. Breakfast is baked goods, juice & hot beverages, but it IS New Orleans! Aren't you still full from those Red Beans & Rice you ate last night? Won't you be chowing down on a BBQ Shrimp PoBoy for lunch in a couple of hours? Really, we didn't miss the \"cooked breakfast\" scene at all. St Louis Cathedral is less than a block away for church-goers. There is a (tiny) elevator in case you need one, the size of which can be a problem for those on low floors at check-out time. I finally gave up and carried my bags down 2 flights of stairs.

One of the chairs looked broken. That wasn't what we had in mind when we imagined ourselves relaxing on our balcony! The walls are paper thin and we could hear EVERYTHING. As a few other reviewers said, you can not only hear if someone is outside in the hall but also the street noise including the trash pick up at 5:00 am! We didn't get good nights of sleep there. The free breakfast consisted of a few pastries, fruit, orange juice, and coffee. It was adequate. All that said, it was a charming hotel and what you would picture New Orleans to be like. We would likely stay here again just based on the location alone however.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location but Long in the Tooth\u201d", "Author": "tjshearer", "ReviewID": "UR123563623", "Content": "This is a nice old hotel, just one and a half blocks from Bourbon St., and half a block to Jackson Square. They do have valet parking and it is reasonably priced. It is quiet on this block so it is a nice getaway from the noise of Bourbon St. Checking into the hotel, we were early so a room was not ready, no big deal. They were supposed to call us when it was ready but never heard from them. The front desk ladies were not particularly friendly, no smiles, no thank you for staying. When we came back and they figured out our room was ready, we asked for the bags to be brought up. We waited twenty minutes or so, never got them so just told the front desk clerk to put them in the room. They were there when we returned. The rooms are old but nice and generally clean. The bed was horrible. They need to be replaced asap! The bathroom was tiny with a narrow shower, about what you would expect in an older place. There was a fair amount of mildew in the shower. The hot water would come and go in the shower so one minute it was scalding, the next it was ice cold. TV was an old 19inch tube type but it worked fine. There was no wireless internet in the room but the front desk did give me a cable to plug in my pc. No Ipad use though. If you use the valet parking, leave PLENTY of time to get your car back. The valets are sometimes hard to find, or understaffed. I suggest at least 15 minutes but once ours was closer to 25. The continental breakfast looked nice, but hey, Cafe Du Monde is block and a half away! They do not seem to have a real concierge. When asking the front desk folks for suggestions, etc., they really did not have much to offer. The bellmen do a better job with info. They did introduce me to Diane Webre who offers private walking tours of NOLA. We did a little over two hours in the French Quarter and it was fabulous. Susan is engaging, knowledgeable and would be a great choice. Next time in NOLA, I will probably give some where else a try.

I love the location of PDA, I think it might be the best location of any hotel in New Orleans. I really wanted to love the hotel, so that makes it difficult to write this review. We got a fantastic room rate, probably because of December being off-season. When we arrived in New Orleans, we stayed our first three nights at the Hotel St. Marie, which is a sister hotel to the PDA. The HSM was extremely clean and well-maintained. When we went to the PDA, I expected the same as the HSM. The lobby of the PDA is very small and somewhat cluttered. Check in was easy. After checking in, we followed a young man to our room. The courtyard that we passed had a bit of a neglected look. Nothing terrible, it could just use some sprucing up. It was December, so I didn't expect the foliage to be blossoming, but at the Hotel St. Marie, the courtyard appeared to be very well maintained even during the cold months. Not so much for the PDA. We went past the courtyard and down another area to our room (I believe that there are either five or seven buildings at PDA). Now this was where I was particularly disappointed. The building we were in was having construction done, and there was scaffolding along side the building, plus a bunch of construction tools. I am a big supporter of maintaining older property, I know that maintenance is necessary. But my question is - the hotel did not appear to be completely occupied by any stretch of the imagination, so why were we put in a building that was having construction work done? I would have preferred a room where we didn't have to pass the scaffolding and construction tools each time we left/entered our room. However.....when we saw our room, I was completely enchanted and all negativity flew out the window. Our room was the only room in our hallway...when we went in the door, there were no other rooms, just ours. The room was huge, possibly the biggest hotel room I have ever stayed in. There was a small entry area, and we had a four poster bed with a step stool to get into it, a huge closet, a bathroom the size of a small bedroom (with heat lamps and a huge tub big enough for two people). And best of all, our view out the window looked right out onto Chartres Street. We were on the ground floor so we could look right out at the people walking past, and we awoke to the sound of a carriage passing by our window. Absolutely magical! And, the room was spotlessly clean. It was an amazing room, and the location of PDA just can't be beat. Right across from St. Louis Cathedral, 1 block to Cafe duMonde, five minutes or less to Pat O'Brien's, etc. If we had visited in the spring months and the courtyard was in bloom and was having more care and attention, and if the construction was done, I would have given this a five star rating.

We like balcony rooms and the street noises had not bothered us at other hotels. Pros: Location. You can see Jackson Square from the St. Ann Street balconies so you know that you are really in the heart of the French Quarter. Anything in the French Quarter is within easy walking distance as is Frenchman Street, Canal Street, Louis Armstrong Park and many other attractions. The room was clean and was big enough, even with a king sized bed, to accommodate two adults. The wireless internet worked flawlessly, the TV was modern and the channels available were more than enough. The bathroom was huge, seven by seven plus the bathtub area. There is a hair dryer, iron and ironing board. They have a safe in the closet which is large enough to put your laptop as well as other valuables. The closet isn't the largest in the world but is adequate. Dresser space is okay but if you bring everything you own it will be tight. The doors to the balcony are french doors that are wide enough an adult can get through it without turning sideways. The balcony, at least on the second floor, has a roof so you can sit out there even when it rains. The courtyard is nice with lots of plants. There are actually two courtyards but it appeared that they were working on the part of the hotel where the second courtyard is. The plumbing, heating/cooling and electrical systems worked like they are supposed to work. The average: The breakfast isn't much. We are not big breakfast eaters so it was no big deal to us but the selection is limited to muffins, croissants, danish, some fruit, coffee and orange juice. The selection looks like what you would get at the local Wal-Mart's pastry aisle. The breakfast area did have food until 10:00 am. There is parking on-site and the one time we wanted our vehicle it was at the entrance in a few minutes. However like most places in New Orleans they charge an arm and a leg for parking privileges, $28.00/day plus taxes. The maid service did a good job when they cleaned the room. However one day we had to ask if they were going to clean the room that day. It was after 4:00 pm and we were going out for a while. When we got back at 5:30 they were \"in process\" of cleaning the room. The people who were checking in to the room next to us (there were only two rooms in that hallway) had to wait until their room was cleaned. As I mentioned there are only two rooms that have balconies facing St. Ann St. and there is no elevator going up to the second floor. The stairway is somewhat narrow and goes right over the lobby counter. The \"door\" to the bathroom is one of those louvered doors used in a lot of the French Quarter hotels. It is not sound proof!!!!! Staff: I must say that the lobby staff always say hello when you travel through the lobby. But it seems perfunctory at best. The garage staff were much more genuine and friendly. The other staff we met were friendly. One gripe I do have was that one night the staff appeared to be having a gab session among themselves with another person. Due to the fact that our room was just a few steps away from the lobby I could have recorded everything they said from the bed. We arrived early, about 1:00 pm and dropped by to let the lobby staff know that we were in town and to call us when the room was ready. Check in time is 4:00 pm. We called them about 3:15 to see if the room was ready and received the canned statement \"Check in time is 4:00 pm.\" The person was different from the person I talked to earlier but I got the impression that she didn't even check. Not so good: We have stayed in other hotels with a balcony facing the street in the French Quarter and the street noise was not bad. It seems that the canyon effect of St. Ann Street keeps sound between the buildings. People talking in normal tones can be heard. The street sweepers are bad but the single worst sounds came from an employee of Muriel's whose job must require him to clean out the trash cans at 6:30 am every day. Not only does he clean them he drops, pounds on and in general makes lots of noise with those blasted trash cans. If we go back to this hotel we will NOT get a balcony room on St. Ann Street.

You are a few steps from Jackson's Square. Muriel's restaurant is at the corner of the street. Stanley is a few paces past. If you turn left at Chartres and go a several blocks, you will hit Irene's Cuisine and then Stella! Get to Decatur, turn left and walk past the Esplanade and yu will come to Frenchmen St. The hotel is an old building. Although the rooms are a bit small, they were clean. We had a room with one queen and a window overlooking the courtyard. It can be dark in the room. We saw a corner room that had no windows and it was larger. All the staff were friendly and the service was excellent. As I'm writing this, I'm waiting for my blazer to be returned to me, after having forgotten in it the room. They were very easy to deal with in implementing the process to get it back to me. They offered a continental breakfast and this was fine, except Stanley was so close and so good that we ate there a few times. The price was reasonable given the location. It's too bad it was too cold to use the pool. An exercise room would make this hotel almost perfect. The only think that was a bit goofy is that there is only one key to the storage room. If the person is not around (like the day we were getting our golf clubs to head out), they had to run around looking for him....but this was a minor issue.

The location is top notch, to be sure. The courtyard is beautiful, no questions. The actual hotel though could probably use some updating that would make a world of difference. Our plane touched down in New Orleans at 8 a.m. on the Wednesday morning before Thanksgiving. I had called prior to our trip and asked about early check in. I was told that I'd have to check for sure when we arrived. No problem. I understand. When we got there we were told there were no rooms available at all for early check in but that they'd keep our bags while we toured the city. Great. No problem. It's at this point that I wish they would have told us there would be nothing available until 4 p.m. because we would have just gone about our business, but every time we checked they kept telling us to check back in an hour or two. When we were able to check in the front desk attendant told us we were getting a great room and we would love it. Oh how I hoped that was true because I was ready for a nap! Our room, 223, is up a flight of stairs by itself facing Chartres Street. Outside the door is one of the great floor to ceiling windows that opens out onto a balcony. Little did we know that window was our entrance/exit to the balcony outside of our room because the windows in 223 are painted shut. Yes, you read that right. To access your room's balcony, you have to leave your room. Seems weird, no? The windows being painted shut also caused a lot of problems for my allergies. Our room was musty and reeked of a rather noxious air freshener every time we entered. We tried propping out door open while we were in the room so that fresh air could come in from the other window, but then you've got the whole, \"I'm at a hotel leaving my door open for anyone to hear my conversations\" situation and it's a bit awkward, to say the least. The room itself was very large and had a king size bed, which is great since that's what I have at home and I loathe sleeping on anything smaller. Unfortunately the comforter is scratchy and old and has frankly seen better days. The same goes for the wallpaper, which was peeling in sections, and the area around the giant air conditioning intake which had visible water damage. I can vouch that the cleaning staff DOES change your sheets during your stay as we returned on our last full day to find a bed with long, black, curly hair in it which very clearly was not there when we left earlier in the day. Note that I have short red hair. (At least it wasn't a toe nail which is what I found at the Maison Dupuy in 2004.) There are some reviews here that have mentioned the cleanliness of the bathroom. That wasn't really a problem for us, with one major exception. On our last day as we were packing to go home, I dropped a makeup brush on the floor. Kneeling down to pick it up I saw quite the horror at eye level: dried boogers on the vanity. I don't know how long they had been there, but it was pretty clear that at no point had anyone wiped that area down or tried to get the offending particle off. I don't know what kind of person does that in the first place, but I would hope that a well-trained cleaning staff would be doing more than wiping down the top of the sink, especially in a bathroom where the toilet is so close to the vanity. I can't imaging what other hidden germs were lurking in the room. All of this said, we really enjoyed our stay at the Place D'Armes. I don't know that I'd recommend it to a friend, but if we were coming back to Nola and got a phenomenal deal, I'd likely strongly consider it. The location absolutely cannot be beat, and the view of Jackson Square from the balcony rooms really is spectacular.

We booked a deluxe room with a queen/king bed through expedia and requested a balcony room over looking the court yard. Expedia did not give the same room options as the hotel website (balconies being extra and not called deluxe) and we were given a first floor deluxe room in a back court yard. I went back to the desk to be sure we were given the right room and the staff was very helpful in trying to find us other choices even though the place was mostly full. We could stay in our room and then move to a balcony with 2 beds at no extra charge. They also found a suite with a balcony and king bed as opposed to a queen and it had anice sitting area and microwave and mini refrigerator as well as a second flat screen TV. They agreed to waive the up charge for the first night and after viewing the suite we took them up as it was definitely worth the difference. I would opt for a balcony room or if you want more space a suite.

The reader must take into account that some individual event or experience may have set the reviewer off or started them gushing. What to do? I went with my gut and was very very pleased with my choice. It was romantic and lived up to all of the accolades. The hotel is in an old school house and brings with it the charm of looking out the balcony for hundreds of years. We booked early and per the reviews asked (begged) for balconies. Ours overlooked Chartres street and my Brother opted to upgrade to a suite which overlooked the courtyard. Now why this hotel did NOT get a bad review . . . Our \"incident\" was a day when the maid failed to make up our room even though we had the sign out and were gone from the room from breakfast until 3:00. When we got back she was working next door, so we kept our sign out and went on the balcony to people watch and relax while our room got made up. Only 2 hours later and still no housekeeping, so we gave up and were going to take a belated siesta. No sooner did the Do not Disturb sign go up and we snuggled into bed when housekeeping knocked on the door and said oooooops, time for me to clean. We were not too happy at this point and told her to forget it. On second thought we needed clean towels and clean glasses, so I called down, explained what happened and asked for the items. Less than two minutes later, the Front Office staff was at our door, asking what happened and apologizing. She hauled the housekeeper up - who thought she got to go home early - and had her and two others make up our room on the spot. I am a real believer that everyone can have a bad day, even gracious old hotels. I was amazed at the attention and service we got. While we expected an apology, we did not expect an instant fix.

Although they offer free continental breakfast at the hotel, we chose to walk one block to Cafe du Monde and have coffee and beignets. I can't think if a better way to start the day! We drive a (new) crew cab truck, which I worried would be too long for their parking garage. I was surprised to find that there is a car elevator, which takes the cars to their parking spots. Not to worry. Our truck rode the elevator and came back out without a scratch. Room 223 has its own narrow staircase, which only leads to this 2nd floor room and its balcony. We liked the privacy of it, but I admit that it was hard on our aging legs. We had to ask for help in taking our luggage up and down those steps. So we both liked and disliked the private stairs. The room is big, with a high ceiling and what was once a working fireplace that is covered now. It is furnished in beautiful antiques and has a ceiling fan. The only negatives would be that the room and balcony show their age and are not \"sparkling clean\" and in perfect repair. However, I can overlook the fact that it wasn't a pristine environment, because after all, this hotel is centuries old! Also, there is an air conditioning unit in the room, which makes noise when it cuts on and off. It did not bother me, but my husband noticed it. The courtyard is charming and is probably just as it was 2 centuries ago. However, the surface is very uneven and would not be suitable for anyone whose mobility is challenged. As far as I could tell, all guests must pass through the courtyard to enter and exit the hotel. I was impressed with the fact your hotel key was required to re-enter the hotel lobby at night, which made me feel safer. I should mention that our son had an inside room which was in another part of the hotel. He said it was very small and \"nothing like our room\". I will assume that the lower priced rooms are in the category of \"You get what you pay for.\" Spring for a balcony. You won't regret it!

For our first visit to this beautiful, bustling, historical city during the first weeks of August, we stayed for 4 nights in a junior suite facing the courtyard. The suite was perfect for my husband and myself, and consisted of a bedroom and an adjoining room with a sofa, mini-refrigerator, microwave, closet, desk and sink. Given the ample portions of the restaurant meals that we consumed during our visit, I made good use of both the mini-refrig and microwave for heating up leftovers for snacks. On the third night our 15-year-old granddaughter joined us and stayed on the fold down sofa bed, and given the suite configuration we all felt sufficient privacy and space. Just a few feet away from our door was the courtyard and swimming pool, and we made ample use of both. The rooms were clean and well maintained and it was easy to hook up to the free wi-fi. The only downer about this suite is that I love waking to natural light and because we were on the ground floor, next to the pool, we had to keep our drapes closed for privacy, making the rooms too dark for my comfort level. Others might not mind this so much as both rooms did have adequate lighting from lamps and light fixtures. Best of all about this hotel, is the incredibly convenient location, as it is just a few steps away from Jackson Square. We had no need for a car to get to all of the places we wanted to go, including a walking tour of the Garden District. Across the street is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Katrina and beyond\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd exhibit located in the Presbytere, which provides a sober analysis of the effects and aftermath of the 2005 hurricane on the city and population. I and my family were emotionally affected by this exhibit and found it well worthwhile to spend a couple of hours or so viewing the videos, artifacts and even the piano recovered from the flooded home of Fats Domino. Just a couple of blocks away from the hotel is Caf\u00c3\u00a9 du Monde, where you can treat yourself if you are brave to a plate of beignets, or on down another block or two, is the Central Grocery Company which serves the humongous Muffelettas. Thanks to the Place d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Armes for the mini-refrig.

The rooms are varying sizes and some of them have no windows at all. Best idea is to call hotel direct for info on rooms if you don't feel you have enough information from website. If you want quiet, be sure to ask for courtyard room. Anything on St. Ann side of building will hear everything on the street. The rooms are well appointed, but things are starting to show their age a little. She's a grand old lady but her slip is showing was a description a family member used. French quarter hotels are like this unless they have gone through a complete overhaul. This hotel is for people who want the convenience of being in the quarter and don't expect the Four Seasons. They have a breakfast available, but I always walked to Cafe du Monde for breakfast or one of the cafes on Jackson Square. Great restaurant right next door for dinner.

The concierge recommended restaurants to try around the hotel, and helped us book our tour. The lobby was very nice. The courtyard was also quite charming. We didn't take advantage of the pool or hang out in the courtyard during our stay, but it looked like a relaxing experience in a private garden. I envied the people who had rooms with the courtyard access. They can go for a dip in the pool and head back to their room easily. We stayed on the fifth floor in a junior suite. The room was great and much bigger than I expected. It had a king size bed, a couch, a microwave, and a refrigerator. The room was clean and quiet, and the air conditioning worked very well. The room had small windows that faced the courtyard. The bed was very comfortable. Only things that I wasn't crazy about was the carpeting in our room, the elevator, and the breakfast. I'm not sure if the carpet was old and worn or affected by the humidity, but it seemed sticky to me when I walked around barefoot. I just kept my socks on while we were in the room. The elevator was small and quite slow. It took a while for the elevator to get to the 5th floor. Luckily we didn't have to go up and down too much. Breakfast consisted of only croissants, muffins and danishes. There was coffee, tea, juice and apples/oranges too. It was okay, but I was looking for something more to sustain me until lunch. We didn't have a car during our stay, but I noticed that there is a parking garage next to the hotel with an entrance from the hotel. I saw that the parking rate was $28/night. The location of the hotel was amazing. It was center to everything. Just a block away was Cafe du Monde. Less than a block away was Jackson Square. In the opposite direction, Bourbon Street was a block away too. The blocks are not very long in the French Quarter, so getting to the east and west perimeters of the FQ from the hotel was so easy.

Though we were in an interior room without windows, we had balcony access mere feet from our door, and from it we enjoyed a superb view of the vendors and performers that were scattered about the square. I was a bit hesitant about the interior room, due mostly to some scathing reviews, but when you consider that New Orleans' bars and their patrons do not observe the normal hours of revelry or raucous exuberance, the thick interior walls provide the peace and serenity needed for that deep rejuvenating slumber required after a day of walking the beautiful French Quarter, River walk, or having a few or more drinks along Bourbon Street, which is but two blocks away. The hotel itself is everything you would expect from a hotel in the French Quarter. From the wrought iron oil lamps flickering about the great hall, to the lush foliage and flowering trees overlooking the upper courtyard to the lovely ironwork of the balconies, the Place d'Armes exudes a charm that is unmistakably old New Orleans.

We couldnt have imagined a better experience The location is absolutely perfect, right next to Jackson Square, a block away from cafe de monde and about two blocks from bourban street. It was also about a block to the mississippi river. and maybe two blocks to Jax Brewery (we loved the gumbo pot restaurant & the marie laveau bar) We also walked the 10 blocks or so to Frenchman st. but we didnt see what all the fuss was about. oh and I was a bit concerned being two blocks from bourban, but it was no big deal and was actually nice to be an extra block away from the craziness! It really is within walking distance to everything, just remember to wear comfy shoes bc your feet will hurt by the end of the week!! The courtyard was absolutely gorgeous and the pool was much bigger than it seemed in the photos!! It was so nice to be able to come back after a night of partying and jump in the pool. They had signs up saying the pool closed at a certain time, but we would be in it until all hours of the night with other people who had the same idea and not once did any of the staff comment. (but we werent being loud or obnoxious or anything, which probably helped) Oh and this isnt a hotel of a certain age (ie young people partying, older people, families) there really was a healthy mix of everyone. We are in our mid twenties and came across people to hang out with but there was a healthy mix of age groups and not too many kids or people partying. We had an interior room on the third floor, which was really nice. The only complaint is that we would sleep much later than normal due to not having windows and not realizing it was daytime lol normally i will wake up when it gets bright regardless of a hangover! I think next time we'll get a courtyard room, so we can have immediate access to the pool and can go out to smoke whenever, instead of going down the elevater and outside which was a pain.

My brother ended up in a room withno windows that had a terrible odour from which we demanded he was moved from. Again, his room became better.

It's in a terrific position; close to everything, without your stay being spoiled by excess noise. The room we had was small but was furnished beautifully and was spotless. It overlooked the internal terraced garden and pool which were shaded by two really old and beautiful magnolia trees and was a great spot to just chill out while we planned our next days activities. The breakfast was fairly basic; danishes, croissants, tea coffee and cereal, but was pretty much on a par with other hotels we'd stayed in whilst in the US. (They don't have toast or raisin bread fellow aussies, or tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms, here or at most Americal hotels. We were fore-warned and took a one litre jug with us and our own tea-bags!) The lady who was managing the restaurant was very helpful and friendly too. I loved the ambience of the hotel. It's very old and has a great history and having somewhere to relax other than your room was a definite bonus. I reccommend the paddle steamer cruise. It was fantastic with a great jazz band on board, plenty of places to sit and listen to the tour guide provide the history of what we were passing and a magnificent sunset. A tour of the Oak Ave plantation, which is an hour and a half out of New Orleans by bus, is worth the effort. It's an amazing place and makes you feel your in the middle of Gone With The Wind! Bourbon street is brassy and bawdy with so many bars and restaurants to eat, drink and be entertained in, you'd need a month to visit them all. Frenchman Street, at the end of Bourbon had less people but the quality of the band and the sound was much better. The Katrina Museum, situated in the cathedral and opposite the hotel is definitely worth a visit, as is Cafe del Mar, about 100 metres from the hotel. (apparently you haven't really been to New Orleans if you haven't had icing sugar all over your face from the famous donuts!) The frozen yoghurt shop is also a definite must, 15 flavours and you serve as much of each or just one, as you like. Cheap way to keep cool and it's delicious. There are heaps of clothes stores but one of the best is 'Jackies' which is about two minutes walk from the hotel, in the same street. Beautiful clothing and wonderful fabrics at really cheap prices.

Our room was as promised, 2 doubles with a streetside private balcony. Nice, very spacious, comfortable room although the bathrrom was a bit small compared to \"new\" standards. You have to expect this in an older and historic hotel. The same with thinner walls. We did have a very noisy neighbor who blared the TV very loudly until 2 AM. We called the front desk and the problem was taken care of immediately. I did look in the window of a few courtyard rooms and they were nice as well. I didn't peek in the windowless rooms, but if it clearly says no window, I'd believe them. Splurge for a room with a window. The bell captain and front desk ladies were quick to recommend \"local\" places to eat, off the normal tourist beat. All were fantastic (especially The Joint BBQ and Jack Dempsey's) and are now on my favorites list. The parking valet knew us by room number and car by the end of the 2nd day and we never waited more than a few minutes. Location is ideal, the hotel was very clean overall and all 6 of the staff we had direct contact with were very professional and polite.

The pool area we didn't use but the guests there seemed to enjoy it. Room service is not available but there are so many options within a few blocks of the lobby.

The room had a single king bed and two very dark blue walls with two brick walls that were once on the exterior. There was one small window, and while the overall feel of the room was dark, plenty of lights made it brighter and it had that unique personality my husband and I wanted. The bed was fine, towels were plentiful and of reasonable quality. Hotel staff (both housekeeping, bellhop and front desk) were all helpful, friendly, and personable. The daily breakfast buffet was simple but perfectly adequate to keep us going until we were out and about, or until lunchtime when we could have some unique local food. Our room was clean and there were a few signs of age (nicks in the wallpaper, carpet didn't look particularly new), the uniqueness of it made up for that and again...everything was well kept. My two complaints are (1) we received fresh towels daily...which was nice but we easily could have reused the same set for our stay if we had been given the option, and (2) every day we received more complimentary soap, shampoo, and lotion even though the previous bottles we had received were unopened....silly waste of the hotel's money.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Andover, NJ", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location!!\u201d", "Author": "lovecharleston612", "ReviewID": "UR111579526", "Content": "We stayed here 4 nights.

This hotel probably has the best French Quarter location available. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 du Monde is at the end of the block and Jackson Square is directly across the street. Bourbon Street is 2 short blocks away. My business meeting was at the Convention Center which was about a 1 mile walk each way. I actually enjoyed the morning & afternoon walks so the distance to the convention center worked fine for me. I found the staff at the hotel to be very pleasant and efficient. On the first day of stay, my room had not been cleaned when I returned from work at 4:30pm. I spoke to the front desk and within minutes housekeeping was there. There were no other problems with housekeeping that week. The room and common areas were very clean & neat. I did notice a slight musty smell in the room. It seemed to get worse each day and I developed a bit of a cough that would stop when I left the room. The room was a bit oddly arranged (room 111). It was a ground level room directly in front of the pool. You walk into the bedroom area directly from the outside. There is a hallway & bathroom leading to a nice size sitting room. I think this was called a junior suite. The space was perfect for one person. I do think the hotel could invest in updated furnishings. The style was very \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcold lady\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Perhaps that is the period look they are trying to accomplish. I personally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care for it. Also, I agree with the other reviewers. An investment in new mattress is long over due. Also, it is time to rework the bathrooms. The fixtures are old and difficult to operate. Anyone staying in room 111 should be very sure the water temp is adjusted properly and consistent before hopping into the shower. This hotel has VERY hot water and no problem at all with water pressure. The shower was almost painful. Additionally, anyone staying in a hotel in the French Quarter should realize where they are. It is NOT going to be peaceful quiet. There were people out in the court yard talking all night, every night of my stay. This did not really bother me because I wanted to be in the thick of the action in NOLA. If you want quiet, you should pick a high rise, major chain hotel. The wireless internet works fairly well. AT&T wireless customers BEWARE!!! There are no bars to be found in this hotel. I had to step outside to make a call or text. In fact, that was the case in most of NOLA. The hotel offers a quick breakfast of coffee, juice and pastries. The pastries were the most tasteless I have ever had so I decided not to waste the calories on stuff that did not even taste good. The coffee was good and the area clean and well stocked. The breakfast room attendant was neither friendly nor unfriendly\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand those reviewers who comment on the friendliness of the lady stocking the tasteless pastries. I will not likely stay at this hotel again but only because there are so many others I want to try. I would recommend this hotel to others with the understanding of the things I mentioned above. I give this hotel high marks in spite of the imperfections I have identified. To me the noise in the courtyard added character and with so many great coffee shops and cafes, I see no need to rely on the hotel breakfast. Please modernize the rooms and look into the musty smell.

The friday before we left I got an email that said we would have one kind sized bed. I called and complained and showed them the email conversation I had with a member of their staff which spoke to the 2 beds and they offered to put a sleeper in the room at no charge. When I get there and see the room it is clear the sleeper won't fit. So I feel as though I was lied to about the room and it nearly ruined the vacation. Beyond that there are some good things to say about the hotel. It has a real New Orleans feel and the courtyard that our room opened up on was beautiful and marred only by a swimming pool that was in serious need of a cleaning. The king sized bed was comfortable but the sleeper was not so bottom line is that if you are planning to put more than two people in the \"suite\" prepare the one who sleeps on the sleeper sofa to be uncomfortable. The staff was responsive and the valet parking was a breeze and well worth the price. Your car goes up a lift to a higher floor so security for your vehicle is never an issue. The continental breakfast is pastries and crosants (spelling?) of the quality you would expect from a grocery store and the coffee was fine and it was convenient to have that option in the morning. The hotel has a real New Orleans feel to it and I can't imagine a better location to stay if most of your plans focus on the French Quarter. Half the places we were told were must visits were a short walk from the hotel. Room was quiet enough but then we went during lent and most of the other guests appeared to be senior citizens so no telling how it is during Mardi Grass.

This was my second visit and the first for my husband, he now understands why I speak so highly of this hotel. I had room 401, a deluxe double which was a good size, had comfortable beds and although some of the linens were a bit worn they were clean and abundant. Once again I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. I know they have received some poor reviews in the past but that was not my experience. I think if you treat them with respect you will get the same in return. Dionne, at the front desk, once again helped me with some questions I had about places I wanted to visit on my own. She told me how to get to different places as well as told me which areas I should not be going to by myself. I did use the beautiful courtyard more on this trip and can imagine using it much more as the weather keeps improving. We had hot and sunny weather and I did sit in the courtyard several times with a drink. Some guests ate their breakfasts out there as well as sat around the pool or at the tables to eat, drink, read and relax. One thing I would like to see in the future would be small fridges in the rooms. There are drink and snack vending machines and an ice machine on the ground floor but a fridge in your room would be handy. I won't bother listing all the places that are close by this hotel - they have been listed over and over again in other reviews. I will just repeat that this hotel is in a wonderful location.

Let's start with the good: The location is very good as the hotel is in close proximity to a number of different points in the French Quarter like Cafe Dumonde, St. Lois Cathedral, Jackson Square, etc. The courtyard is very nice, and would be a nice place to relax during nice weather. Now, on to the bad. We arrived at the hotel in the evening of our first night of stay and the person checking us in was not very friendly at all. I only received one word answers to my questions and very limited information. I saw this same comment in a previous review, and thought it might have just been an off night, but sure enough, we encountered the same attitude. In reading previous reviews, I found out that the hotel has interior rooms with no windows, so when I booked my reservation, I specifically asked for a room with windows as I did not want to be in a room without any windows at all. When I made the reservation, the agent told me that she was going to put us in a junior sweet, which had a balcony and would either overlook the courtyard or the strstreet. After we checked in and got our keys, the woman behind the desk told us that the young man (I think his name was Paul) would show us to our room. Well, this man did not offer to take our luggage on a cart, all he did was proceed to walk in front of us, so we followed him. He didn't even hold the doors open for us as we pulled our luggage through the maze of hallways. Our room was on the fourth floor, so he showed us where the elevator was and pushed the button and then left us. We get to our room and open the door, and as soon as we opened it, the musty smell was overwhelming. As I walked in, I immediately noticed that there were no windows! I called down to the front desk to complain about the fact that my reservation was not right, and the woman said the only thing she could do was leave a note for the manager in the morning. She could not move me to another room. I gave her all the details of my complaint and tried to settle in for the night as we were exhausted from our travels. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get passed the strong musty odor. It was almost unbearable. Not getting very much sleep that night, I got up early and went downstairs to talk with the manager. Even walking in the halls to get to the front desk, there was a musty odor, but not nearly as bad as in our room. I spoke with the woman working the front desk in the morning and she was very nice. She said she did see the note left from the other agent and that she was going to move us to a different room. I did appreciate the effort to move us, however based upon our bad experience from the night before, and knowing that the rest of the hotel had a musty odor to it, I did not have confidence that our new room would be much better. We made the decision the previous night that we could no longet stay at this hotel because if we did, I would not have been able to sleep at all for the duration of our stay. I did explain all of my concerns to the manager and he was understanding. Even though the room they were putting us in had a 3 night minimum, he was willing to cancel the remainder of our reservation based upon all the circumstances. The rates for this hotel are typically very good, however the weekend rates for the room we were in did increase significantly each day, and there was no way I would stay in a room like that, under those circumstances for the money they were charging. I've seen similar comments in other recent reviews about the smell. Maybe I am more sensitive to the musty odors as others seemed to be able to deal with it, but unfortunately I could not. That's how strong it was. The smell seemed to be imbedded into the carpet and furniture in the room we were in. The management of this hotel should really take the time to inspect each room and do something about the musty odors. The carpets need to be steam cleaned and they should do something about the air circulation.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cDon't get room #104\u201d", "Author": "MustG0", "ReviewID": "UR95496453", "Content": "The location of this hotel was nothing but perfection.

My only disappointment was that there was only a shower, but a nice one, and no tub. but we were only there 2 nights and that was a small price to pay for the great location and other pluses of the hotel. We had a deluxe room with a window but no balcony. (some rooms don't have windows, so if you are claustrophobic, be careful when booking to choose a room with a window) the room was quality priced, as well and it was the deluxe category. I did book it well in advance, probably 3 months out, The front desk people were so very nice and hepful; they really made you feel welcomed. Cafe du Monde was 2 short blocks away and Broubon st. was about 3 or 4 blocks away. We toured the Garden district by walking to the St. Charles St. Trolley. (About a 15-20 minute leisurely walk) The hotel was also well located for getting to the pier for our western caribbean cruise. We walked the next orning along the river walk and were at our ship in about 30 minutes. One very imortatnt point about the hotel is the beauty of it in a very quaint way. The outdoor areas were lovely and you could bring your breakfast out there or just relax. There was also a lovely pool but being January and 60 degrees, it was just a litte too chilly to use it, but nice to look at it. Breakfast was on the simple side, rolls and bagels with juice and great coffee; but who needs more to get started with so many great restaurants right outside your door? The taxi in from the airport was around $30 and for 2 people, that was the most economical way to go.

The room, (219) though supposedly a deluxe room, is a little on the small side because it is built at an angle with the bathroom jutting into the main space, but it was adequate and offered what was needed. Unlike the interior rooms, it at least does have a window overlooking the courtyard and is just a few steps away from a balcony with table and chairs. Now for the downside. The room decor is a little tired looking. They definitely need to update that 1980s wallpaper border and bedding. Most of all they need to replace the mattress set. Today most hotels, even of the budget variety, offer sleep perfect mattresses. This is a cheap motel grade bed, low to the ground, with squeaky springs. I felt very coil in that mattress.

The staff was simply out of this world again....and always there to help, answer any question, or there to just say a simple \"Good Morning!\" The free breakfast was once again, a great way to fill up one's belly....and start the day off right! The rooms were even being updated from the old lock & key system to the new card entry system...so, the hotel in trying to stay new & improving....without taking away the old charm! And as everyone says....the hotel is close to everything!!!!! Jackson Square and St Louis Cathedral is across the street....Bourbon Street is 2 blocks North, Cafe Du Monde is one block South, Pat O'Brien's is 2 blocks Northwest.....and all the food & shopping of the French Quarter establishments all around you!!!! Now, once again, with any review I make, I can always provide a little something to improve on....I would still like to see the coffee (in the rooms) improved....because my wife & I do enjoy a nice hot cup of coffee sometimes before we geaux to bed....and this time I did notice a little wear & tear in the mattress we had this time....I do hope it gets changed out before our 2011 stay!...other than that, everything is still 100% great!!!!!! So, if a person is looking to stay in a hotel, were the building has been up since the 1700's....one is looking for the old world charm and a historical place to stay in, The Place d'Armes is the place for you! (just imagin if those walls could talk!!!!!) I just sit back, in my room & court yard, and just imagin all the history of the place (which I provided on my first review back in 2009). So, if stepping back in time, and enjoying a little bit of old New Orleans history is not your cup of tea, please do not stay at this hotel...because it is not for you! But, if you enjoy staying in something that was once a slave trading building, to the first all-boys school of Louisiana, then made into a warehouse, and then the Place d' Armes (as I said TONS of history) is the place for you! Just imagin you are being given the chance to stay in a place that you have just paid to tour!

I booked this hotel based on our tastes and reviews on this site. We were not dissappointed! There are a number of buildings that make up the hotel that range in construction from 18th - 19th century. If you are expecting a super clean, spartan, modern hotel, this is not the place for you. If you want a period experience to compliment your trip, then this is right up your alley. Due to noise concerns, I requested a courtyard room instead of a balcony room. Our most difficult time at the hotel had to do with finding our room. The front desk did walk us into the courtyard and pointed out where to go around and to the left. It still took us a while since we didn't realize that there was another courtyard off the big courtyard that was accessed through a walkway through the first building. This made for great privacy as there was rarely anyone else sitting in that courtyard. The fountains were soothing and you could hear the cathedral bells when in the courtyard, but not from the room. The only other noise factor for our stay was a group of people who had attended a wedding took over the \"bar area\" in the courtyard and partied on Saturday night. However, it wasn't that loud in the room and they were finished by midnight. My husband is a very light sleeper and he never had a problem the entire trip. We stayed in room 227 which was obviously one of the two oldest buildings on the property. There were only 4 rooms in that building on our side, maybe in the whole building? There are so many interesting nooks and crannies to the hotel that I couldn't say for sure. One wall was the original brick and the rest was outdated wallpaper but who cares about that! The room was very large with two comfortable double beds and it had a long wet bar. The TV was the older analog version and didn't have hookups for our portable DVD player. We also had the cable problem mentioned earlier, but I jiggled the cable at the wall outlet and it corrected itself. We also had to plug the power cord into the back of the TV as it had somehow become unplugged. There was a very large closet with sliding doors and a vanity with chair in the nice sized dressing room. The bathroom was also surprisingly roomy as I expected cramped conditions in such an old place. There was a location in the bathroom where the wallpaper had come apart and I could see some mold, but that is not surprising in the south. I have a mold allergy and was not bothered the entire time. The room did not have any odors as can be expected in such an old place. While we were there, they were putting new carpet in the room next to ours, so they are updating these rooms at this time. The Wi-Fi was intermittent. I think I figured out that, even though they have five hookups for you to choose from, they are limited in the number of users. I had an extremely difficult time getting full connectivity in the mornings and around dinner time only, so I think it was just overloaded with users. The breakfast was very disappointing. There were some Entemann type pastries and some very dry croissants. There was also some fruit that did not look very appealing. It would be nice if they at least offered cereals, muffins, toast with peanut butter or the like. But begneits a few steps away at Cafe du Monde and a full breakfast with \"debris\" at Mothers in the CBD took care of that need. I did like the security and felt very safe. The passageway from the street has a locked gate so everyone must go through the small lobby with a security guard to gain entrance. The lobby staff never failed to greet us coming or going. The maid did an excellent job. The groundsman, when appearing in our little courtyard to sweep and clean up, would immediately start saying \"excuse me please\" as though he felt guilty invading our territory. He was very nice and smiled constantly. Now that I have found Place d'Armes, I doubt that I will ever stay anywhere else in New Orleans.

The price is nice too. Now for the negatives: The front desk staff was completely apathetic to anything/everything from the moment we walked in the door. After trying for an hour to connect to the Wi-Fi I went downstairs and politely asked if there was anything special I should know about connecting as I was having trouble with it. The attendant (who was slouched over texting) looked up from her phone and just said \"no\". I eventually was able to connect to the (weak) wi-fi but found that it dropped frequently throughout the night. We decided it was nice enough though and decided to stay another night and went down to ask if there were any other balcony rooms available for the next night - she told us no but that we could have an interior room with no windows for around the same price. We decided against it and when we went back upstairs and looked around the website we found that they did have balcony rooms available to reserve on the website - I'm not sure why she only offered a windowless interior. So we went downstairs and said we'd like to have one of the balcony rooms available on the website. She took care of everything (while mumbling on the phone with someone) and told us to just come by the next day and pick up our keys to the new room shortly after checking out of the old room. When we went to pick up the keys the new woman at the front handed us the keys from a room in the 100's which we found a bit strange as all the balcony rooms are 200-300 - but we went and checked it out anyway. Sure enough, we're in a courtyard room - not what we wanted, not what we asked for, and definitely not what we were told we were buying. So we went back to the front desk and told her and she magically pulls out two keys from a balcony room and says \"we thought that one might be more convenient for you\". Again, not sure what gave them that impression. She points through the door and tells us \"it's out there\". After wandering for a while (there aren't a whole lot of signs with what room numbers are down what corridor) we finally ran into a worker in the courtyard and had to ask him how to get to our room. Now is when we started noticing a lot of differences for two rooms that are the same rate/category. Our first room had a large private balcony with a table set and chairs that overhung the street - the new room had a two foot wooden \"balcony\" that's really just a thin porch connecting the rooms in this building and overlooking the courtyard. Our new room has an air conditioning unit and a ceiling fan - the old room only had a ceiling fan and was incredibly hot throughout the night. The old room had very high ceilings and two large windows - the new room is what you'd expect from any Super 8. The old room had a large working tv - the new room has a small boxy 90's model that won't even turn on. The new room has hot water - the old room never got cold and never got hot no matter how much you messed with it, it was permanently luke-warm. Lastly, both rooms are full of cracks and tears, doors that you have to lift up to shut or tug around, holes in the carpet, and scratched up headboards. Our new room even had a giant sheet of wallpaper peeling off, Could definitely use a little bit of work.

Next time I think I will pay a bit more and get a courtyard room but we were satisfied with room 220......NOW for the \"negatives\"........( actually just a few things you need to realize before you book).....This is a converted set of connected buildings that are VERY old, so even though they have been remodeled, the sound barriers you find in new construction are just not there. You get a lot of noise from the other guests as they leave their rooms, hang out in the courtyard talking and laughing ect. We found it a bit hard to sleep late in the mornings due to the noise. The other thing we noticed was the condition of the furnishings. Most of the items in the room were well-worn and could use replacing. The mattress was comfortable but the head board was pretty beat up. The TV was an old model with reception you would expect to find without cable, although it WAS cable TV. We didnt spend much time in the room anyway but the lack of clear reception and the lack of a flat screen were noticable. All in all, we LOVED this place, the ambiance was amazing, the location was perfect, the room was serviceable and clean, the continental breakfast was spartan but fresh ( enough to hold you over till lunch).

A conversation even woke me up one night and then I heard the guy next door (with whom I shared a wall) snoring!

They were NOT pleased with their room either. Our other friends had a balcony room off of the second floor and it was better - didn't have as much of a smell and was more recently renovated.

Our first stay we had a room that was a double/double....but actually it was a queen/queen which was a big plus. The woman at the front desk who seems to work weekday mornings was not particularly friendly or accomodating, in fact, I felt like she hated me. The day of our check in we arrived at about 10:30 am to be told that the room would be ready in a little while. It was a very stormy day. We left, had breakfast and saw an IMAX show. We tried to stay away as long as possible in hopes that the room would be available upon our return. We returned at about 1:00pm to be told the room wasn't ready. We had given our car to the parking attendant already and were in the lobby with our belongings. With no options left, exhausted from our 3:00am departue from our house in NJ, wew alked in the rain over to St. Louis cathedral and sat (like homeless people) in the church for about an hour. We returned to the hotel and sat in the lobby till about 3:30pm & was finally given a room. This room was OK. It was a courtyard room. We left the hotel for 3 days to visit family and upon returning, we stayed in a King Jr. Suite. \"WHAT A DIFFERENCE!\" Spend the extra money it is well worth it. we met people with a balcony room and when they saw ours, they said ours was so much better then theirs. We had a courtyard room that was sparkling clean, beautiful and in the best spot. Our doors opened right to the pool area. My teen daughter and cousin had a different queen/queen directly across from the one we stayed in during our first visit. This room seemed a little bit newer and nicer, but there was this horrible stench that was covered up by a very strong perfume smell. I couldn't bear it for more then a minute or two, but the girls said they didn't mind it at all. Being that we had 3 room during our visit 6/29-7/09/10 I noticed a huge difference in the rooms. OK so the bottom line is: If you get a great room your gonna be happy. The breakfast is just the same old cherry, blueberry, apple or cheese danish every single day. Croissants, apples and oranges, coffee, tea or OJ. If you get there later then 9:00, you probably wont get danish or there may be one or 2 left. They need to order more then they do. The pool is cleaned almost everyday. the trees surrounding it tend to drop petals in the pool, but it isn't dirty by any means. I think it may be a salt water pool, water seemed slightly salty to me. There are alot of mosquitos in the court yard....so bring bug spray or better yet yard gaurd! The courtyard is nice enough to just hang out in or entertain friends. There was a wedding performed in the courtyard one afternoon. The guys who get the cars do an amazing job. Just call them when getting ready to leave your room and there is really no wait. My husband did tip them well, so maybe that was why :) The entire staff (except the one woman in the morning) was great and went out of their way. At night, the woman who watches the desk, locks the door, and only buzzes in people staying at the hotel. The location is as good as it gets. Even though its right in the heart of the french quarter, its quiet. My husband is from New Orleans and we visit alot. This was by far my favorite hotel we have stayed in. If you wanna feel like you are in N.O. and love being able to access everything with ease, this is the place for you. If you want a modern chain hotel, I do like the Sherraton on Canal St., because it has a pool on the roof...........but it's just an ordinary chain hotel.

The bedding is old, the tv's aren't great, the decor is about 15-20 years old, rugs need to be replaced. We had 2 rooms since we had teens with us. We had 3 teens (2 were 19yrs and 1 was 13 yrs).

The parking was $25 per night....though that didn''t surprise me. We skipped the free breakfast since is was just crossiants and sweet rolls with some fruit. I didn't care too much for the haunted tour they recommended. But what really bothered me was the really bad smell in my room. A very musty smell. It may have been from the exposed wall, but they should really try to figure out something about that. The beds were not so great and the bathrooms were just worn out and old. This hotel has so many possibilities and could be great with a little more work. I just don't get why there isn't an extra effort. That said, unless it is renovated, I probably won't be back.

We live about 2 hours from there and have been hundreds of times before. I always check these things out on Tripadvisor and have never been let down, until now.

The price is right. If you'll be sober and want to enjoy your time there, this is not the hotel for you. The staff was great, I will say that. Very helpful, very friendly. My husband and I got the king room with a balcony. Sounds nice right? Not really. The balcony faced what I assume is the runoff street from Bourbon and it was so stinky you couldn't sit out there. The bedding was in very bad need of updating, which I could overlook, but the mattress was inexcusable. When I awoke I felt like I had fought with this thing and it beat my bum. I felt like I had slept on stones. The bathroom was roomy but was in desperate need of a cleaning. On the surface (toilet, bath) it was clean, but there were dingy fingerprints all over the door. It had not been cleaned in a long time and looked as if a mechanic had been living in there. The floor, tiled, was the dirtiest floor I have ever seen in a hotel. True, hotel floors are dirty, but they didn't even try to hide this. The TV, which was a large flat screen, went out while we were winding down for bed and it took them a good hour to deal with that, but the man who came to take care of it was very nice and friendly. It was very hot, the ice machine was broken for the entire stay. Very noisy room, as it faced the street and I had expected that. But it was VERY noisy. Motorcycles, garbage trucks, fighting couples, screaming kids. You name it we heard it. The one good thing, at least in our room, was that it was a good cold room.

I was sick to my stomach and wanted to check out of the Place d'Armes immediately. Let's compare the two properties: Place d'Armes has small double beds that remind me of an old horse, the beds are sunken in the middle and very uncomfortable. The tub takes 30 minutes to drain, the tv is this tiny thing across the room that you need a pair of binoculars to see the tv screen! The rooms are accessed via stairs, NO elevators...so forget it if you have luggage to lug up two flights of stairs, the pool has all types of debris and leaves in it so you are not going to be swimming in it unless you are not bothered by this sort of thing! Hotel Monteleone has a large flat screen tv, new King size mattresses, marble bath rooms, elevators and a door man, gourmet restaurant on site, wireless access (I forgot to mention that hell will freeze over before you can get an Internet connection at the Place d'Armes) I could go on and on, but I think you get the gist, both of these hotels are the same price and so it is like comparing a \"Motel 6\" to a Ritz Carlton. THERE IS NO COMPARISON! So save your sanity and book a room at the Hotel Monteleone. I am counting the hours until I can check in as I am stuck here at the Place d'Armes tonite since they already charged my credit card and I cannot get a refund. On a positive note, the clerk kindly offered to refund my parking fee as she felt bad that we were not happy with the room.

Nice photo opp, esp if the Natchez steamboat is docked. I love to hear the calliope ! Because it was Mardi Gras, many of the famous places like Pat O'Briens and Acme Oyster Bar were packed, but we spent much of our time going back and forth to the parades on Canal St. Some of the places that we did eat at w/ little to no wait were: Felix's (across street from Acme) had good poboys; Frank's on Decateur St by the Joan of Arc statue had good gumbo and muffelettas and a GREAT upstairs dining balcony that overlooks the street; and Pere Antoines' on the corner of Royal and St Ann (1/2 block from the hotel), had a good bkfst and decent dinners - crawfish pasta, blackened catfish, fried crawfish poboy w/ sweet potatoe fries.

Notwithstanding the rain, we liked the accommodations and would return. They got 25 inches of rain in December setting a record for the most rain in any month ever. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another story! The biggest assets of this hotel are its charm, its staff, its location, and most importantly, its low rates, compared to other hotels in the Quarter. The hotel is just a half a block from Jackson Square and one block from Bourbon Street. We booked a deluxe room at $62/nite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not including the healthy 13% local tax. With the deluxe you get either a courtyard room or one facing the street, depending on availability. Because it was very low season we figured we had a good shot at a courtyard room; unfortunately we figured wrong! We ended up with a room on the ground floor but facing the street. In hindsight it probably would have been better to have just paid the few extra bucks to guarantee a courtyard room since it is quiet and peaceful back there. We were first sent to a room on the fifth floor that was dark and small with one small window. Reluctantly, I went back down to the front desk and asked to see a different room. Courtney at the front desk was very accommodating. Lucky for us, the one remaining deluxe room was much, much better. The room (#129) was bigger, the bathroom was much bigger, and the room was much brighter with huge windows. The room also had a 12-foot ceiling which made it feel bigger than it was. The room faced a relatively quiet side street, but trucks did occasionally rumble thru. In general, a very nice room. Having said that I do have one significant complaint about the room: Water in the shower did not drain properly. I do not know whether this is an issue in other rooms, but management should take note as this is never pleasant for hotel guests. A smaller complaint is that the wireless internet was not available for any of the days we were there either. To their credit, we were warned of the internet issue at check in. [I had actually called the hotel before our visit (trying to decide whether to bring my laptop) and was told that our room included internet access, but that not all rooms do. The hotel website seems to indicate something different, so not really sure what is correct.] The hotel breakfast was better than expected based on what I had read here. Even though they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a big selection at all, the croissants and pastries were extremely fresh and good and you can have as much as you want. The OJ was fresh too and there are some very nice attendants who work in the breakfast area and keep it fully stocked. Complimentary newspapers were also available at breakfast. Maid service was also very good, they give you plenty of extra towels and toiletries. They also made our room up when we left the room late one day and even left towels in a plastic bag hanging from our door one day when we did not leave the room. All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. Dionne went out of her way to help us with restaurant recommendations and directions and was always very pleasant. We had two excellent breakfasts outside the hotel. Right down the street is Stanley. They have excellent pancakes, served all day, and one serving is just about enough for two people. My wife also loved the reuben there. For a truly authentic Nawlins experience ride the Charles St. street car out to the Camellia Grill. It takes about 25 minutes on the streetcar and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to ask the driver where to get off, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth the trip. Just make sure you go on a day or a time that it (hopefully) won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too busy. There are only about 20 seats in the entire place; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never forget the experience. The vegetable omelet was one of the best omelets I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had. We also tried the Old Coffee Pot on St. Peters St. around the corner from the hotel and it was worth a try. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have as much luck at dinner. Deannie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Cochon were both good. We thought the Gumbo Shop, around the corner also on St. Peters, was overpriced and could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been better. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 DuMond is also very close, maybe 100 yards from the front door of the hotel. The beignets were fine, although it is a tourist trap. With all the rain, we tried the Insectarium and it was actually much better than expected. We also had a cab driver take us on a tour thru the lower 9th ward - where the levee failed during Hurricane Katrina. (We arranged this on our ride in from the airport.) This was cheaper and quicker than taking the formal 3-hour tour that we had originally planned. It was $35 for a one-hour tour. It was an interesting way to spend a rainy afternoon. Sadly, some of the abandoned houses are still there, but there are also some brand new, futuristic-looking solar houses too. You may even see Brad Pitt (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t)!

We had no idea without national channels. The local channels never mentioned what was going on elsewhere so it would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been nice to have had at least one cable news channel.

I had considered staying at the Place D Armes a number of times and they had availability. It was also close to the Saint Louis Cathedral where we planned on attending some Christmas events. The hotel has 8 buildings. Our room was in a building at the back of the hotel. Some building have elevators. Ours did not. We were glad we had help getting our luggage up the steep narrow stairs to the second floor. The hotel has a number of small courtyards and our room overlooked one of them. We've stayed at a number of 100 to 200 year old hotels in the French Quarter. Therefore we were prepared for some eccentricities. For instance the floor in our room was not level or flat. Therefore it felt like you were about to lose your balance as you walked across the room. The coffee machine was located on top of the desk. However the machine had a three prong electrical cord that couldn't be plugged into the extension at the desk. The bathroom was very small. It rained very hard the first night we were there. In the morning there was a small area around the bed that was wet and there were some water stains on the wall. In addition to that the heater stopped working at night. It should also be noted the room didn't have a microwave. We mentioned the water leak and the inoperative heater to management the next day. They wasted no time in getting the heater to work. We asked the person at the front desk about that day's events in the French Quarter. Perhaps because he was slow to answer two other employees management immediately came to our aid. I also asked if they could show me how to fix the heater in case it stopped working again. They had someone waiting for me at the room before I could walk back there. A continental breakfast was included. This consisted of pastries, coffee, tea and juice. There was someone present during the breakfast at all times that made sure you didn't run out of the offerings. Due to the lack of fresh fruit or a toaster for bread we elected to have go out for breakfast a number of times. In summary, the hotel was located in the perfect spot for our visit. The hotel staff was very helpful. It it weren't for the weather we would have liked to have spent some time having coffee in one of their the courtyards while planning the day. Please note that with 8 buildings it is possible that many of the rooms are distinct. Would we stay at the Place D Armes again? We probably would.

We at first chose The Place D'Armes because of location and price. What better location can one have....right in the middle of Jackson Square? You are 2 blocks from Bourbon Street, just on the other side of the St Louis Cathedral is Pat O'Briens, and one block down is Cafe Du Monde and the ever famous French Market. So, as you can see, you are right smack in the middle of it all!!!! One of the other very pleasent items we encountered was the hotel staff and the GM (Mr. \"Bubby\" Valentino). The hotel staff is very friendly and will make sure to geaux out of the way to make your stay simply out of this world. It is very nice to have the experience of having the hotel staff, as you enter the hotel upon arrival, smile at you, and ask, \"How may we help you\". Each time we have stayed, we have asked various hotel staff members for restaurant suggestions and they have been just \"spot on\" for what we were looking for. One time my wife and I were in a food discussion with the front end staff and the GM, Mr. Valentino, came out of his office (after overhearing the discussion) and gave us a few suggestions as well. One very nice surprise was that the hotel also provides you a \"free\" breakfast to help you start out your day. It is just a wonderful idea to start out your day by stopping by, having either a fruit filled pastry or a croissant w/jelly, a fresh brewed cup of coffee and orange juice, and being able to read the morning paper. Another one of the items that we simply adore about staying at The Place D' Armes is the history of the buildings and the way that the Valentino's have kept the hotel in that old world style and charm. I learned about the history of the hotel from one of the very old hotel staff members and from Mr. Valentino himself. The building was first used as a slave trade building. You can actually stay in one of thier Junior Suite rooms, which was the actual room where the slaves were kept. The room still has the steel bars over the window...and there is even a part of the wall, by the door, where the slaves carved out to show what part of Africa where they were taken from. After the slave trade was abolished, it was then turned into the very first school (all boys) and stayed the school until one of the boys started a fire in his dorm room and burned most of the school living quarters down. The building was then rebuilt and made into a ware house building. Then it was purchased and made into a hotel (why not, the rooms were already there because of the design of the school and the dorm rooms). The room that my wife and I enjoy to stay in, room 122, was actually the room provided to the \"Head Master\" of the school. The room has a king-size bed, full bath, a wet bar set-up, and is right in the back of the courtyard, on the first floor of the old dormitory area. The only thing that we ask is that you DO NOT request our room on the very first weekend of December...besides, I think that Mr. Valentino has us booked for that room for next year already! :) Now, on all good reviews, there should always not just be all good items....because there is always something that can be improved upon. This year we did notice that the old matresses have been replaced with new ones (so, our previous years item has been resolved). We still think that paying $28.00 dollars a night is way to high for pareking your car (if you are staying in the hotel)....but, the affordability of the hotel makes up for the extra cost of parking your car. The only last complaint that I can give is that the coffee provided in the room is horriable....LOL....my wife and I always stop by the grocery store (one block away - up Royal Street) and purchase some Community Coffee and filters. Hopefully this will give you a little look into the hotel, the history of the place, and why we will keep going to this hotel every year that we visit New Orleans.", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, TN", "Title": "\u201cread all the reviews - I discovered that most have validity...\u201d", "Author": "paranan", "ReviewID": "UR50392165", "Content": "Place D'Armes is certainly not the worst hotel...the location is fabulous, the staff is friendly and the courtyard is gorgeous.

The walls are paper thin. My husband and I were woken up at around 6 am by other vacationers in the next room who we discovered were actually talking at a reasonable volume. There is absolutely NO bathroom privacy. There are two slatted doors and approximately 10 feet separating the toilet from the bed. Not so awesome. The continental breakfast - coffee, oj, water, croissants and some danishes - was mediocre as best. The rooms were pretty shabby. There was a layer of dust on the walls from the ac/ceiling fan. Clearly the walls had not been cleaned in several months. The blanket (not bedspread) had lots of holes (cigarette burns?), the mattress was on beyond firm to \"hard.\" I felt like the room could have easily been broken into - there is a physical key instead of a card and the deadbolt is only able to be engaged when one is in the room.

However, since we wanted to stay in the French Quarter, it turned out to be the most practical way to park our car. There were other lots several blocks away, but there was no assurance that they would be any cheaper for 24 hour parking. The hotel's location was great - the Haunted History Tour and the Cemetary tour both met just a few blocks away. We found out on the Haunted History tour on the last night of our stay that this hotel has had several paranormal sightings over the years. However, we both found the room to be quiet and comfortable (except an occasional noise from old plumbing) The continental breakfast was just croissants and danish, but they were very fresh and tasty. The coffee provided in room was exceptionally good (with the liquid coffee mate I brought from home) I never got around to actually trying the beignets at Cafe du Monde which is just down the block. HERE IS A TIP: If you take the cemetary tour at 1:15, DO take a umbrella especially if it is sunny. The Vaults in the St Louis No 1 cemetary white washed and reflect the heat. I am from Tennessee and thought I was used to the heat, but I almost passed out. I wish I had followed this recommendation.

The bathroom was a little out of date but not in anyway the worst I have seen. The room had a king bed, armoire with TV and some storage drawers, small table and two chairs.

The staff at the front desk was counting money; it took about 3 minutes before they finally looked at us. \"Last name?\" - that was the first phrase we heard. No welcoming, no \"HI\", no smile. After I provided the information, the next thing was \"His name?\". His name was not of a dog, but of my partner standing next to me. Never mind that she could have asked him directly; for some reason she decided not to and stick to her prison-like questions. Finally, after taking his information, she said - \" The check- in time is 4 PM, you are too early and you room is not ready\" . She asked me to leave my phone number and said that she would call when they room is ready. She did not offer to us to wait at the court yard, or in the dining room, to read a paper, etc. We went for a walk in the FQ. By 5 PM, not hearing back from the hotel, we went back. The room was ready. Even though I made my fully prepaid reservation in January and specifically asked for a courtyard room ( and confirmed my request at least 3 times), I did not get what I requested. I am not complaining about the room because I knew from the friends (who stayed there before ) that the rooms are a bit outdated. But there were dead plants on the balcony and the pots were being used as garbage cans. Judging by the amount of garbage,I don't think they were ever cleaned. In 3 days of our stay we never heard a word of greetings from the front desk staff. One day I asked people by the pool about their experience, and it turned out that they all had the same treatment. There was actually one front desk person who made a point of turning away when you looked at her. Since our flight was at 6 AM, we asked for a wake up call. The person who took our request ( the same slim lady that would tun away) sighed as if I asked her to carry us to the airport on her back. No wonder that the wake up call neve happened. Luckily we had called the car service in advance and the driver woke us up. The person who was at the front desk at that moment was actually very apologetic to us and very friendly ( may be that's why they keep her at night?) Not sure how the hotel made top 10 - once again, aside from the location, there is nothing going for it. The breakast is very basic ( the breakfast serving staff was very nice, I have to mention).

The hotel is located on St Ann street about a half block down from Jackson Square. So you are literally in the middle of it all! It was a 15 - 20 minute cab ride from the airport, not bad at all. We arrived about 11a, so our room wasn't ready yet. However they stored our luggage for us and gave us some great suggestions for lunch. There was a little issue with my check in and my friends, but it was quickly resolved. At about 4:00pm, our room was ready (the time it was supposed to be). My husband and I had a balcony room. BE AWARE: some of the balconys are private and some are shared and what you request is NOT garunteed. We requested a private balcony and we got a private one and the larger of the two that were on our floor! Our room (228) was up the stairs right behind the front desk and the bellman met us there with our bags. (What service!) Ask for this room, it has the larger balcony and its easy to get to after a long day or night! When we opened the door, we were greeted by a little sitting room right there at the door. (How cute) The bathroom was sparkling, the bed had fresh covers and we just adored the exposed brick wall that sat behind the tv and desk area. We had two doors to the balcony (only one opened) and you were able to the lock them. The baclony faced St Ann street and came equipped with our own lantern and patio set. The only thing we didn't like was that it had a slight lean to it and there were no flowers or foliage. There, also, were a few cigeratte butts and bottle tops left behind, but I called to the front desk and someone came immdiately and took care of it. BE AWARE: They don't have allies in NOLA so the trash is put out on the street for pickup, so there's the smell and noise of the garbage trucks you have to deal with. Its not that bad, but I guess it depends on where you live. We' re from Chicago so we are used to noise and smells! :) The shower was amazing and there was a heat lamp available for use. Nice tolietries, plenty of towels, and they kept extra supplies in the closet. The AC worked well, easily controllable, just had an outdated panel. The bed was huge, bigger than the queen we booked and it came with extra pillows and blanket. The cable could have been a little better....only 1 movie channel. The room was really spacious, bigger than we expected. They were a few burn marks on the table and 2 tears on the wall, but no hotel is perfect! They had 3 courtyards...one with the pool, one with a fountain and a smaller one around the back. At night, there will lights in the trees in the courtyard with the fountain and golfish in the fountain (so cute). The breakfast is scarce, only croissants, danishes, coffee, juice, and tea. The could use some cereal, fruit, and one hot item. There's a garage, but we didnt use it. My friend had a courtyard room. At first her's was around the back. It was ok, just a wall for a view so hardly no sunlight. She called and complained and they gave her a new room the next day. Her 2nd room was alot better. It opened up the fountain courtyard and was alot larger. The service was great! Everytime we had an issue, they took care of it right away. They booked our Creole Queen cruise, tried to print our boarding passes (it was there fault why they couldn't print them, airline issue), gave us maps, suggestions for dining, call our cab, and even kept our luggage after we checked out because our flight wasn't until 7:00pm. NEVER HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE STAFF! I read some of the other reviews and alot of people complained about the Interior room. CALL BEFORE YOU BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!! They will tell you that room has no windows and being that its hot there it can get musty! Others complained about about the furniture and the look of the hotel.

It was ready in 15 minutes and he took our bags upstairs (we had a 3rd floor room) and took us to the room. I can't say enough about how friendly and nice the staff were. I read other reviews here talking about impolite staff, but we didn't encounter a single one. The desk clerk even happily printed our boarding passes for our flight home with no hassle at all and they have a nice list of recommended restaurants they give to guests. The room was beautiful and actually quite spacious for an older hotel in the French Quarter. Six years ago we stayed at another hotel and our room was literally the size of a closet. Our room had access to a shared balcony on the 3rd floor and two huge windows that let in plenty of light. The air conditioning worked like a charm and there was also an overhead ceiling fan. The room showed no signs of disrepair or aging and the decor was nice. The only thing I would suggest would be to update the faucets in the shower and the water pressure wasn't the greatest but adequate, also the toilet didn't flush the best, you had to hold the handle down until the bowl emptied completely, but other than that, it was well worth the $99 a night (weeknight rates) that we spent, especially since you can easily pay just as much or even more for a less nice hotel in the French Quarter. The bed wasn't the most comfortable I've ever slept in but it wasn't terrible and I don't usually find any hotel beds that comfortable but the pillows were nice and plump. I would recommend if you have one of the rooms on the 3rd floor that you be patient about maid service as they don't seem to get around to those rooms until around 3:30 - 4:00 p.m. but that's understandable considering how many rooms there are and they can't really start until check out at noon. The courtyard was beautiful and we spent more time there than the balcony. The only problem was the heat and humidity were quite high and you don't get much of a breeze in the courtyard. However, they do have a pool there, it's a bit small, but nice to keep cool in. They also serve a continental breakfast in a very nice room off the courtyard. It's nice if you want to just grab a quick croissant or danish (nothing special) but I would suggest that they offer some fruit with breakfast like most places serve that offer a continental breakfast. They're also very close to Cafe du Monde so you could just skip the breakfast and go get beignets. I've read some negative reviews on here but what I've noticed is that most of them are people that booked what they call \"interior\" rooms, that is rooms without windows. Yes, in a high humidity atmosphere you may get a \"musty\" smell in such a room, and yes, believe it or not, there are bugs in New Orleans being near water and with its climate, get used to it (though we didn't see any in our room.) If you are claustrophobic or have problems with not having natural light, don't get an interior room either. We were already aware of this when we booked from reading reviews so we made sure to request a room with windows. To be honest, the rates for such rooms aren't that much higher than the interior rooms, so it's worth the extra few bucks and you'll enjoy this hotel much more if you get one of the non-interior rooms. It's so often true that you get what you pay for so if you want to be cheap and not pay the bit of extra money for a better room, then don't complain. Also, though we didn't book through an internet site like travelocity or expedia, when I was looking for hotels on their sites, I noticed that you are automatically booked for the lowest rate room if you book through them which is the interior rooms, so if you use them, make sure you upgrade and it doesn't hurt to call the hotel and make sure your booking is for the upgraded room before arriving. We will definitely be returning to Place d'Armes when we go back to New Orleans in the future. They definitely made our trip pleasant and enjoyable, especially after our experiences with other \"older\" hotels in the quarter that cost just as much and weren't nearly as nice.", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lawton", "Title": "\u201cWe will be back again\u201d", "Author": "wcoklahoma", "ReviewID": "UR32644576", "Content": "This was the second time we have stayed here.

He was possibly the nicest and most positive person on the face of the earth. We weren't in the best of moods when we arrived late after a full workday and a long drive, but by the time we got to our room, his attitude had completely turned ours around. The room was much larger than we had expected with very high ceilings, perhaps 15'. Floor to ceiling windows, great morning light. Our room also had a small alcove with a large mirror and table by a window where my wife could get ready. The large balcony was fantastic with a great view of Jackson Square. It was perfect for breakfasting in the Quarter. It felt like living in the French Quarter. The room was immaculate. The bathroom was clean with a good shower. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

We always request the same building - the 3rd floor of the building facing Chartres. If you are expecting a fancy hotel with all the amenities...this is not the place for you. So don't stay there and complain about it later. It does have free wi-fi and all the usual items one expects in a hotel room. The buildings are 1800's & 1900's so you will find brick interior walls and it can get muggy in your room. The rooms we have stayed in had fans and a/c (although a bit noisy) but it worked well to move the air around and keep it cool. There are signs of mice (holes chewed, not droppings!!) , but most of the buildings and residences in the French Quarter have them. It's part of the territory!! There are some interior rooms - meaning no windows. Our room during our last stay was a double room with a small room on the other side of the entry door (open, no doors). We needed a roll-away and this small room, under the window, was the only place to put it. Our guest who slept there got quite warm at night since the fan is over the double bed as is the a/c. We were steps away from the balcony that looks onto the beautiful courtyard, however, with no chairs on this 3rd floor balcony we preferred to sit on the Chartres St. balcony. Be aware that these are 'shared' balconies on this side. So don't expect privacy - keep your blinds closed and be a tolerant of those who choose to have coffee or a drink sitting outside listening to the music in Jackson Square. (We had someone come out at 9pm and tell us to move because they could see us outside!). The staff is wonderful and very helpful. From the desk clerks, valets, bell staff, grounds crew and maids, everyone made our visit even more delightful. Remember, If you want to have a friendly hotel staff, be friendly to them! We heard some wonderful stories and were given great advice on places to go that were beyond the average tourist spot. The continental breakfast is basically coffee, tea, croissants and orange juice. Not impressive, but it's free, the oj is great, and beignets every day can get to be a bit much! The history of the hotel - a former boarding school that burned down on a Good Friday killing the occupants - is very interesting. We first heard it on a Haunted History Tours (ask for Jonathan or Brent or Tina). We had several 'experiences' both stays: the smell of fire, the elevator in our building tends to act up (a floor button goes on, elevator stops, no one is there and several times as we got in before we even pressed \"3\" it went on for us - no one was on the 3rd floor waiting). There is an interior stairwell in this building that is steep, circular and a bit dark - late one night we decided to take these stairs and my daughter and her friend were both pushed. Not hard, more of a 'move out of the way' type of push. We, like others including some staff, have heard children laughing, talking late at night and there were no children near us. Supposedly a man with a beard, hat and 1800's style clothes has appeared to some; we've yet to see him. But we never felt afraid during any of this - if we did, we wouldn't go back! The hotel doesn't really advertise themselves as haunted and it took a few conversations with the bellman to get him to confess his experience. Just know, it's an old building and things have happened there! It is situated perfectly, right next to Muriel's restaurant (also haunted!). If you go out on either the St. Ann or Chartres St balconies you can view part of Jackson Square and watch the vendors ply their wares and the musicians serenading. Because of it's location, you feel fairly safe walking late at night, although don't try it alone!

I booked the room directly on the hotel's website with the \"Value Rate\" about two months previously -- so we got a really great deal. I also called after making the reservation and requested a room with a balcony on the street. Room 302 is a pretty large room with a king bed and a large balcony facing St. Ann Street (FYI: Room 301, next door, also has a balcony on St. Ann Street). The hotel's location really can't be beat -- especially for a first time trip to NO and the French Quarter. I also liked it because the block was never desolate -- it never felt unsafe or creepy. The FQ is so small, nothing is really far away from anything else, but the Place's central location was a nice extra. The staff were all nice and helpful when we needed anything. The room was super clean, and the bed was comfortable. But, as others have said, this is not a luxury accommodation, and if you need everything to be perfect, I wouldn't stay here. One of the blankets on the bed had a rip in it (we didn't care!) and the pillows were not great -- though we got slightly better ones when we asked. Aside from the coffee, the breakfast was not very good, and I'd suggest skipping it. But, even with those few negatives, I'm still giving this place 5 stars because everything else it offers counter-balances those few little things. Even though there were normal city noises as others have pointed out, I'm so glad we had a room with a balcony on the street. There were at least a couple little parades that went by our room at night, and it was great just to be able to run out and check it all out. We could also hear jazz and other stuff happening at Jackson Square -- it would just pass by every once in a while, unexpected. We loved the furnishings, the French doors, the wrought iron on the balcony -- it all worked well. On our last day, as we were waiting for our cab to the airport, we finally got to sit out in the courtyard. Very lush and pretty. Next time, we might ask for a room back there just for the experience. Also, a newish deli is on the corner of Royal and St. Ann -- Sean Kelly's Royal Street Deli -- is just a half block away.

It was a great way to start the NOLA trip. Their courtyard is beautiful, we enjoyed haning out there in the early evening before heading out for our ghost tour, dinner and drinks. We also enjoyed breakfast fountainside. Our room was on ground level, right across from the fountain. It was quiet and nice. The matress wasn't all that comfortable and the room wasn't of high style, but the charm of the hotel and courtyard made up for it! Our friends stayed in a room that faced the street and they said it wasn't overly noisy in the late hours. The breakfast included danishes and croissants, coffee, tea and orange juice. The danishes and croissants were good, we did see a few people with Cafe du Monde bags though, which would have been a little tastier. Cafe du Monde is about a 5 minute walk away.

I've visited this city numerous times pre- and post-Katrina, including this hotel. I stayed in Room 112 for my first trip this month, which is located in the front section of the courtyard, near the pool. I had requested a different room, but the staff seemed to have lost the request which I submitted and confirmed in advance. However, I have no complaints whatsoever about this room or my stay at the hotel, which is saying a lot for me. This room was equipped with two queen-size beds, exposed brick walls, and had plenty of light (a big plus with this hotel). The room smelled fine and was extremely clean. The bathroom wasn't as big as some of the other double rooms here, but it was fine. Unfortunately, though I had requested it, the staff did not allow us an early check-in upon our arrival, which is typical of my experiences in New Orleans, but was still annoying as we had to kill five hours before our room was ready. As others have noted here, the main perk to this hotel is its central location, just yards from Jackson Square. Secondary to this is the exquisite courtyard, which is perfect for relaxing or a swim. (The loud children I could have done without though.)

When we decided to stay here again, I called the hotel to find out how to request a similar room, since their website doesn't specify balcony rooms. I expained that the private balcony was central to our decision to book here, and was told to book a deluxe room, and in the \"special request\" area, ask for a balcony room. The hotel e-mailed me and said the only balcony room they had was a queen bed instead of the king I had requested. I told them the trade-off for a private balcony on St. Ann's was worth the smaller bed, but if a king room opened up, book that instead. When we arrived, we were given room 221. No one offered to help with our bags, so we lugged them across the courtyard and up the stairs ourselves. When we opened the door to the room, I couldn't believe my eyes!! The room was the size of a postage stamp. The queen bed took up most of the available room, with enough room to walk on one side, and a desk stuck in an alcove you couldn't get to because of the luggage holder. The bathroom was literally 5 feet from the bed, and all it had was louvered doors, no real doors, just something you would expect to see for decoration. The real kicker was that someone was already occupying \"our\" balcony. We quickly realized there was NO access to the balcony (which was on Chartres St., not St. Ann) from our room. We had to leave our room and go down the hall to get to the PUBLIC balcony. It was nothing at all like the balconies that face St. Ann Street. It was uncovered and public, so we were unable to use it for much of our trip due to rain and others occupying it. I immediatley went to the front desk to tell them there must have been a mistake in our room reservation, only to be told that was all they had available, since they were completely booked. I pointed out that I had made reservations several weeks in advance in order to secure a room that was acceptable and was told that special requests were only granted if available. When I gave up and went back to our room, I realized that the pillows were very thin. We found one extra in the bathroom, and I gave that to my husband, and called the front desk for another. He told me all the rooms were booked and since he would have to take one from another room there were no extra pillows. No extra pillows??? Unbelievable! I slept with all the towels piled under my pillow that night, and in the morning found a maid and asked her for one, which she produced within 5 minutes. No extra pillows, indeed! If I had known that I was paying for a tiny room with a public balcony, I would have booked elsewhere. The hotel had previously e-mailed me that they could meet my request if I would accept a queen instead of king room. I feel that they completely misrepresented what I was getting. The room type I wanted was the same price as the awful one I had. I paid premium price for a terrible room. I asked to me moved to another room if one became available, but no one even noted it. Every day of our six day stay, I asked. Each person said \"Sure\" but when I asked if they recieved our request from the previous shift personnel, I got a blank look, and a \"No, Ma'am!\" One more thought - on the first night, as we lay down, we realized the bed was canted to the left. Throughout our stay, we woke up to find ourselves piled together against the wall, due the sliding toward the lower edge of the bed.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jonesboro, AR", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "choocie", "ReviewID": "UR17233803", "Content": "I had high hopes for this hotel, but it missed by a long shot.

The room was dark, we had an interior room without a window and we choose that room because of the great price. (we booked online and paid less then $350 for 5 nights!) However, in retrospect I would have paid more for a room with a balcony/window just because it was very dark in the room- dark enough to make it hard to see if I was putting on brown or black shoes unless I went close to the lamp. The beds however, were very comfortable, extremely so for hotel standards, We did have one \"incident\"- the light in our bathroom burnt out, I called the desk and asked for another light bulb- they brought it up within 2 min. When I put it in, it shorted our whole room, so I had to call maintance- they had to replace the light fixture but it was done before we got back from breakfast at Cafe du Monde. So, it was handled very well. Or room was cleaned well each day and smelled very good- not like room spray and not too strong, just clean and fresh. The courtyard was stunning and we were literally steps from Jackson square.

There were lots of great reviews, but a few really dreadful ones, so I didn't really know what to expect. I'm happy to say that my weekend at this hotel was a classic New Orleans stay. The Place D'Armes is a little \"old\" looking, but in a classic, New Orleans way. The courtyard is absolutely breathtaking, so you should book early enough to get a courtyard room. We didn't book early enough, so we didn't have that option. But I spent plenty of time relaxing in the courtyard, and it was sensational. We were booked into a street side room, which was noisy one night and quieter the next, so that's a tossup. Our room was large and well appointed, considering that it is an old hotel. It's not a brand new freshly decorated Best Western, but, if that's what you want, you shouldn't book any hotel in the French Quarter. The location is magnificent. You will not find any hotel more centrally located in the Quarter. Considering how close you are to everything, the price was surprisingly reasonable. Now, I'd like to address two areas that caused others to leave negative reviews: cleanliness and helpfulness. I found my room to be very clean, and cleanliness is a huge issue for me. We had no trouble with the maid service or towels or anything like that. The common areas are clean and my room was clean. I'm not sure what else to say besides that. I found the staff to be helpful. From visiting with the happy fellow maintaining the cleanliness of the courtyard, to the desk clerk calling a taxi for us on Sunday morning. People were professional and helpful. I was particularly impressed with the gentleman in charge of the parking garage. He was friendly and accommodating. If you realize going in that this property is historic (old), then you will not be disappointed.

Yes it has a great location and the pool courtyard is very picturesque. That still does not make up for a dirty hotel. At the end of the second day, our room was not serviced by housekeeping. My wife found us fresh towels on a cart at the pool area. Hotel staff later delivered us clean wash cloths and did not offer to clean and straighten the room. They claimed we put out the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. We did put out the sign but it read \"Maid Service, Please\". On the morning of our third day, I found fingernail clippings in the bed I had been sleeping in. We stripped the beds of the linens and searched the rest of the room for filth. I found a pair of men's underwear on top of the television armoir! We immediately went to the front desk and talked a manager. She apologized, comped my parking fees for our entire stay, and promised that the room would be cleaned before we return. We did return a little over five hours later. When we got to our room, there was a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign hanging on the doorknob. This surprised us because we did not put it there. We opened the door and our room was exactly like we had left it. Housekeeping had not touched our room at all! I went back the the front desk and I spoke with the same manager again. She used the excuse that since the sign was hanging on the door, housekeeping could not touch the room. This just enfuriated me more, especially since she saw my family and me go into the parking garage to leave for the day. She knew that we would return mid-afternoon and they still did nothing with the room. The manager told me to go back to the room to meet with the new housekeeping supervisor. When she did get to the room I showed her what we were so upset about. She did give us her apoligies that followed that with excuses: 1. She is new to the job. 2. It takes time to train the staff. 3. She had to come from another building (read hotel). 4. Housekeeping staff was following the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign request. My wife and I talked this over and we decided to cut our vacataion short so we checked out and left. We are lucky enough to have relatives just 2 hours away. Later that night I did get to speak with Mr. Volentine, the general manager. He offered his apologies and admitted that \"The ball was dropped not once but twice in the mishandling of this whole situation\". He offered other incentives to get us to try Place d'Armes again. Even with the offer of gas reimbursement we are never going back to that hotel. I have worked in the people service industry for more than 28 years. I feel that qualifies me to say that I did not detect an ounce of sincerity in any of the apologies, much less the excuses, that we received. Please, protect yourself and your family. Go as far back in the reviews as January 1, 2008. There are other complaints. I believe just like some other reviewers, that hotel staff or other administrators must be the ones giving this place such a favorable review score. I read those same reviews.

The courtyard is simply lovely, the pool is clean and well-maintained, and the rooms are individual in style rather than step-and-repeat hotel fashion. What made our stay special was the outstanding personal attention and warmth of the staff. I had just completed a business trip to a Ritz location and had a fresh comparison. While the Ritz service is legendary, this location had shabby and dirty carpet as well as A/C issues. While staff said \"sorry\" with great warmth, they did nothing to rectify or change my situation.

Linda Cooper went out of her way on more than one occasion to help (even hunting down a pair of scissors!).

Literally steps away from Jackson Square in the heart of the French Quarter, the Place d'Armes hotel is, in my opinion, the BEST in ambiance and value. My wife and I have stayed at a number of other hotels in and around the French Quarter over the past 20 years and none of them compares to Place d'Armes. We simply won't stay anywhere else, it is just that great. The staff was decimated by Katrina and things were a little shaky for about a year but they have gotten everything back together and the hotel is better than it was pre-Katrina. You won't find a nicer bunch of folks from valets, desk clerks, maid service, etc. Here are some reasons why we love the Place d'Armes so much: * Less than two blocks from Bourbon St. and our favorite spot: Fritzels European Jazz Bar * Less than two blocks from Cafe Du Monde (gotta hava java & beignet to start the day!) * A short walk to Frenchmen St. * Obscenely quiet despite its location in the center of the French Quarter * $20 a day in & out parking facility (Katrina taught us to ALWAYS rent a car when in NOLA) * Courtyard and pool is always well tended and essential on hot afternoons * Close to all the great shopping everywhere in the Quarter In closing I will say that we have never had a bad experience at the Place d'Armes and we've been staying there for about ten years now.

If you would prefer to really submerge yourself in the local culture and get a feel for the heart of New Orleans, then Place D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Armes is for you. As for the accommodations themselves, we found the rooms to be clean. They vary in size and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but if you ask, the hotel staff is extremely forthcoming about what to expect. They warned us repeatedly that our room was an interior one, without windows, so we were not disappointed to find we had no view. Frankly, as we were there during the height of Jazz Fest, the lack of windows provided silence and a darkened room when we found we preferred sleep to the bustle and activity out on the street. I would love at some point to have a street balcony, but would expect it to be loud and perhaps something best appreciated by 30 something\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out for a great time in the Quarter. This hotel is old and that is its charm. The rooms were really pretty, in that authentically French Quarter sort of way. The staff was friendly, authentic, helpful and really cheerful, in spite of the fact that many of them were still displaced from their own homes or had family who was still struggling, even after three years. If the plumbing was a bit faulty due to the age of the building and the lack of tourism dollars to perhaps repair it entirely, I didn't find any minor discomforts I couldn't overlook. We had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sink issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the hotel took care of it for us, but it did take until the next morning. None of these minor problems impacted our visit. I felt that the tiny difficulties we had were negligible, and certainly understandable, in light of what New Orleans has been through in recent years. This is, after all, a City struggling to, in the words of Marc Cohn \"Dance Back From the Grave.\" It is easy to forget this, and to evaluate the city and its inhabitants as though their lives are like our own, and to perhaps hold them to standards we would expect in New York or San Francisco. But I know from the tour I took of the devastation left by Katrina, that contractors are in short supply, and there is little that has been done. This is a town that is still missing two-thirds of it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population, is still waiting for almost non-existent government assistance for damage done by a monumental national disaster. Everywhere I went I was met with kindness and a smile, if not the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153speediest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd service or attention. But after all, it is the South, and they just don't move at the frantic speed we do on the Coasts. It may be that they have a better appreciation of the fafact that life is, indeed \"too short.\" If they need some slack, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to be inclined to give it to them. I loved this hotel, and it's staff, and its location and I will definitely make it my new home in New Orleans.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Streator, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cThe Worst Rip Off EVER\u201d", "Author": "niugirl21", "ReviewID": "UR15755516", "Content": "I am not one to post reviews at all, but this place moved me to tell the world not to waste their money.

There were no windows, so good luck knowing if it's the middle of the night, 11 in the morning, sunny, or pouring rain out. The room's air conditioning units were pumping out a foul smelling 'moldy' odor, that the staff seemed to not care about. We spent $30 extra dollars at Walgreens to purchase our own de-odorizers, which only masked the stench. When given the key to an alternate room, we found it stunk worse that the original!!! The room was filthy, we found a presntation board, from a previous guest, under our bed that was dated 2002, if that tells you anything about the cleaning staff's dedication. It seemed that everyday as we were leaving the hotel, the cleaning staff was always sitting in other rooms watching tv and lounging around. In addition to outragous room rates, we were charged $25 a day plus tax for parking!! Plenty of other Quarter hotels don't charge if you are a guest! And the kicker is, the front desk staff got caught talking smack about us as we were leaving the hotel. And although we called hotel managment on it, we still saw the same staffers in the lobby each evening of our stay. So, I felt uncomfortable the entirity of my stay, everytime I came or went through the lobby area.

I would say that this hotel has both good and bad points. First the good - the hotel is a historic building so don't expect cookie-cutter rooms - they all have their own character. The buildings are beautiful and the courtyard is absolutely gorgeous (a couple got married there during our stay). We stayed in a room facing Chartres street and could see St. Louis Cathedral from the balcony. I was worried about the street noise but had no trouble sleeping. The location of this hotel is perfect. We were close to all the French Quarter attractions but far enough away from Bourbon St. that we didn't hear the partying. The desk staff were very accommodating and even let me use the manager's office to check my flight. Now for the not so good - the rooms are older and could use an update. The carpet in our room was stained and I don't think it was vacuumed once during our stay. If you don't put your used towels in the bathtub the cleaning people will fold them and set them on the counter for you to use again. The tub in our room drained slowly so by mid-point in your shower you were standing in an inch of water. This left soap scum in the tub that was not cleaned daily. Our toilet backed up one day and when my husband talked to the staff about it they gave him a plunger and a bunch of towels \"in case it overflows\". The plunger then remained in our bathroom for the rest of our stay (although the cleaning staff did take away all the extra towels). Even with the negatives I recommend staying at this hotel - mostly because of the location and the beautiful buildings and garden. Just remember that all older building have their problems. This was our first time in NOLA and it was wonderful. The people are welcoming and so glad to have visitors back after Katrina.

It is a very well maintained property, locally owned with a beautiful court yard and caring staff. Simply put it is the only place to stay if you care about price and convenience. I have stayed here on all my trips to N.O.LA ( 5 weeks or so each year since Katrina), except for 2 nights last year when the hotel was booked. On that trip I stayed at the Hilton and while it was an efficient business class hotel, it wasn't friendly. I am not a morning person and stay out listening to jazz until the wee hours. In the mornings, at the Place, on the way down to the beautiful breakfast room both guests and staff say hello. Frankly a little jarring to my sleepy self. Well, there was none of that to be bothered with at the Hilton. Nobody said hello, and there was no free, continental breakfast. Most importantly, the hotel is owned by a local family that cares about the city.

We have family in town, but will make each stay to include time spent at the Place d'Armes. The staff, ambiance and rooms were unique New Orleans.

We booked the hotel by contacting the staff directly. We were worried after reading some of the tripadvisor reviews that we might get a room without windows, especially when the written confirmation did not give us any assurance. However, when we called the staff, they assured us that we would get the room we asked for. We stayed in a room on the third floor, which overlooked Chartres Street, and has easy access to the balcony that runs the length of the chartres st side. Whatever street noise there was at night was no worse than Hoboken, New Jersey, where we live. The Place d'Armes hotel is a complex of old buildings clustered around two courtyards. We were able to eat breakfast in the courtyard, which was a great way to start each day. There is a small swimming pool, but the weather was not warm enough to use it during our stay. The greatest advantage of this hotel is its location, which could not be better. It allowed us to get tickets for the 9am National Park Ranger tour of the French Quarter, and allowed us to wander around the quarter during our stay. We ate at three great restaurants which were all a few blocks walk: Irene\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cuisine and Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Amelie, which are literally only two blocks away each, and Olivier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which is on Decatur, close to Canal Street. The hotel is two blocks away from the river bank in one direction, and two blocks from Bourbon Street. This part of the French quarter seemed to be very safe, any hour of the day or night. We toured the Cabaldo, and we browsed around the shops on Royal Street and elsewhere. The staff at the Place d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Armes, particularly Laura and Sandy were helpful. They recommended a plantations tour, which we took during our stay. There were a couple of negatives: the people in one of the rooms on our corridor were smoking throughout their stay, despite the fact that this is a non-smoking hotel. Also, during the stay, the locks on the doors in our corridor were changed. We were not told why, but I guess this shows a willingness of management to take some post-Mardi Gras precautions !

Although we normally stay at Hotel Monteleone; we picked the Place D Armes for this trip due to its location and the reviews on this site. PROS: Location - The location of this hotel at Jackson Square is excellent. Courtyard - The ambiance of the large courtyard gives you the feel of the French Quarter. CONS: Room - We stayed in Room 319 which was a deluxe one bed room that was in the three story building at the end of the main courtyard. One of the problems with this type of older hotel is that there can be a lot of inconsistencies from one room to the next, which is bore out by the varying reviews on this hotel. Some of the problems noted were: / We found that the sitting area of the room was very dark. When we checked it out there was a light bulb missing from this two bulb lamp. / One of the bedside lamps was broken and not functional. / The window curtain to the common use balcony had a torn lining and would not close tightly. / The electrical receptacle which had been added to the brick wall in the sitting area was not securely anchored to the wall. Bathroom - There were louvered doors leading in to the sink area and subsequently into the toilet & tub area. This meant privacy was somewhat limited and the noise from the hairdryer would overpower the TV. / There was not a exhaust fan in the toilet & tub area. / Sink area was small and very cluttered after adding our toiletries. Ice Machine - The only ice, soda, and snack machines were located close to the reception area. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been much farther away and during a stormy night you had to go through the courtyard to get there. Staff - We found the receptionists to be indifferent. Hot Water - When we arrived on Sunday night, my wife found the water for her bath that night was not particularly hot. The next morning, though, the water was nice and hot. Mice - We had an unexpected visitor one night - a mouse. Would guess that he came in under the door which had a gap of at least an inch between the bottom of the door and the floor. The hallway outside the door led directly outside. Although this intruder did not bother me, I did not tell my wife about him until we got home. NEUTRALS: Breakfast - The breakfast included in the room price consisted of croissants and sweet buns with coffee and orange juice. We only ate the breakfast once during our stay. I either liked a full breakfast or, more often than not, went to the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Du Monde for caf\u00c3\u00a9 au lait and beignets. Although the negatives far out number the positives in my review, this hotel is not really as bad as it may seem. Too often the faults of a particular room seems to stick in the mind more than the good aspects of the overall stay. Also it seems that by reviews from others that have stayed here there are some excellent rooms within this hotel. Yet, will probably not stay at the Place D Armes again.

I picked this hotel mainly because of the reviews here on tripadvisor and I would definitely stay here again. The location is perfect, you are in the middle of the French Quarter, steps away from Jackson Square, Cafe Du Monde and the French Market or head in the opposite direction and you're at Royal or Bourbon Streets. I was in room 301, which overlooks St. Ann St. and has a big, private balcony. When I was awakened at 4:30 am on the first morning, by the garbage trucks on St. Ann, I seriously considered trying to change rooms (garbage pickup is most mornings at this time). But I'm glad I stayed because I got to watch two Mardi Gras parades walk down St. Ann St., right by my balcony as well as people watch and enjoy music from the quarter while sitting outside. The courtyard rooms might be quieter but I don't think they would be nearly as entertaining. A few notes/observations: Hotel - beautiful, old, interesting inside and out. Room - loved it - good size, everything worked and was clean enough, bed was comfortable, balcony was great! Staff - all were good, some were great. Breakfast - well, it's free. ;-} Transportation from airport - hotel - airport. I took the shuttle from the airport to the hotel. It was $15 one way and the van carried 10 people. There are 2 lines - one for the French Quarter and one for the CBD - make sure you wait in the right line. It's easy to spot the booth where you buy your ticket - very close to where you pick up your luggage. I took a taxi from the hotel to the airport. It was $28 + $1 (plus tip). I was lucky to get a great driver who told me his personal experiences with Mardi Gras, Katrina, etc. Tours I did - French Quarter/History tour - Free from the National Park Services. Meet at the Jean Lafitte Visitor Centre at 419 Decatur St. They give out 25 passes, starting at 9:00 for the 9:30 tour so try to get there by 9 at the latest. The tour is interesting and covers a lot of history of the Mississippi Delta, New Orleans and the French Quarter - it was good but we didn't explore as much of the FQ as I had hoped to. Cemetery/Voodoo tour by Historic New Orleans Tours. $15 There were only 3 of us on this tour (I think the tour goes no matter how many people show up). The small group was great because Greg, our tour guide, was able to give us a more personalized tour and answer all of our questions - whether they related to the tour or not. Streetcars - I bought a 1-day transit pass for $5 and used it to ride all three streetcar lines from end to end. You get to see some very different parts of town this way and the streetcars are wonderful. Other info - Visitor information Office - St. Ann St., Jackson Square Post Office - N. Peters St. - close to Iberville St. Riverwalk - mall on the riverfront - lots of touristy shops. Food court is on the third floor and it's a good place to grab something to eat or drink and watch what's happening on the Mississippi - you can go outside. There is also a Cafe Du Monde here so you can try those famous beignets - warning - you are going to get that icing sugar all over you! Canal Place - higher end shopping mall. Harrah's - too loud, too hot, too smoky. Quick takeaway food places - Central Grocery - 923 Decatur St. I went here the first day to get one of their muffulettas. I ordered HALF of one and ate half there and took the other half home for dinner. Delicious! Verti Marte - 1201 Royal St. Tiny store with a lot of great takeaway choices for snacks or meals. Rouse's Market - 701 Royal St. Small grocery store with all the basics. Two restaurants I tried and liked were Cafe Maspero - 601 Decatur St. and Cafe Pontalba 546 St. Peter St./Jackson Square. Both had good food and a relaxed, friendly atmosphere. My favourite street was Royal Street. It is filled with art and antique shops, cafes, musicians and street performers. Favourite places to just stop and sit for a while - Jackson Square, there is always something to listen to or look at here. I also liked to go down to the river and sit on one of the benches. The Moon Walk along the riverfront is a nice way to get to different places like Riverwalk, the Aquarium, Imax theatre, etc. instead of walking through town. This was my first trip to New Orleans and it is going to take me a few weeks to digest and process everything I saw, heard and experienced. I went on my own and wouldn't hesitate to tell anyone that they should experience this city at least once. I didn't do a lot of the \"typical\" things like nights on Bourbon Street or dining at the more famous restaurants or take a lot of tours. My plan was to see New Orleans and absorb the atmosphere of this city in a way that worked for me.

This was my second stay at this hotel but will not be my last. We arrived back in New Orleans from a 5 day cruise early Thursday morning and took a cab to the hotel. It was probably around 10 AM and because check-in is at 4 our rooms were not ready. We were advised to return around 2 or 2:30. We left our bags with the bellhop, who locked them up for us and we walked around the Quarter, the Casino, and the Riverwalk mall. We got back around the time they advised but the rooms were not ready yet so we went back out. When we returned our friends from Tampa had arrived and our room was ready but theirs was not yet so we all went to our room and shortly after that their room was ready. I don't fault the hotel for this because we were early and apparently they were fully booked so it was fine. The front desk personnel have always been friendly and helpful and this stay was no exception. The courtyard is very nice, but this being winter it did not get much use, at least from us. We had booked interior rooms, which do not have a window, because we don't spend much time in the room anyway so a view is not necessary. It might be a problem if you are claustrophobic but it was fine. The rooms are very clean, sorry forgot to take pictures, though ours had a tiny bit of a musty odor when we arrived but it either went away the next day or I got used to it, it wasn't that noticeable anyway. The bathroom was very clean as well, I always look their first, because if the bathroom is clean you know the room is taken care of. The location of the hotel is perfect, especially if you plan to head to the gay bars, as the main ones in the quarter are a block and a half away. It's a perfect location though for sightseeing and just enjoying the ambiance of the Quarter. It's just a few blocks from St. Louis Cathedral, the French Market, and Cafe Du Monde. The location really can't be beat. I did not realize the hotel was haunted until my friend sent me an email with some reviews from here as well as another site which explained the story behind it's haunting. I was glad to read that the ghosts are not mischievous or mean but mostly children who perished in a fire when the location was a school. I believe we might have encounter at least one of the children in our room. We didn't see or hear anything, but my cell phone which I turned off while I was charging it, inexplicably turned on. I turned it off again and about five minutes later it came back on. Once again I turned it off and again it turned back on. I left it on and it started making a beeping noise as if I were plugging it in or unplugging it. That part may be because the outlets at the hotel were a little loose so that may have an explanation but after I kindly asked them to stop playing so my phone could charge that stopped as well. And when I turned the phone off it did not come back on. So, I believe one or more of the children were playing with my phone. I thought I would be scared, but it was actually amusing. By the way, someone here mentioned flickering lights that they thought was a ghost but when they tightened the bulbs it stopped,, we were looking for this to happen so we might get a laugh out of it and as we were waiting to be checked in we noticed a flickering light in the lobby and my friend went up to it and in fact the bulb was loose so he tightened it. We did get a kick out of that. The TV picture was a little off as far as the color goes but there were a lot of channels and we didn't go to New Orleans to watch TV anyway.

While definitely convenient there is a lot of foot traffic walking around. Also, the rooms do not have the electronic keys. This is a major issue especially if you had kids. I would never put my kids into that situation. The doors are hollow and anyone could break into the room at anytime. There aren't even safes in the rooms. In fact we did have someone break into our room and steal our tickets. When confronted the desk they were extremely rude and had total disregard for our situation. They even questioned whether we had tickets. A week or so went by and we discussed the situation with the GM; he questioned whether we had tickets as well. I told him I would provide him the receipt and he said I need a lawyer and hung up the phone. During the whole time, never once did the hotel even offer a small token of understanding, never offered to compensate us even a $1 for our troubles, nor said sorry. You definitely get what you pay for at Place D'Armes. Terrible service, terrible manners, poor leadership and awful consideration for security and the guests well being.

Over-zealous, maybe. But I feel like I did a pretty good deal of research before deciding on the Place d'Armes... and it paid off! I chose this particular hotel for it's location and their great prices! (We paid $79/night for our king-courtyard view room, two weeks before Christmas!) I booked by calling their reservations number and speaking with Barbara. She was extremely helpful and put special requests in for a balcony and to have the two rooms that I booked close to one another. (Both of which, by the way, were fulfilled.) Parking was something like $22 a day, but the gentlemen working in the garage were always helpful, smiling, and full of advice about good places to eat, and things to see. Not to mention we didn't have to worry about where to park after a full day of sight seeing. The rooms, sheets, bathrooms, carpet, and furniture were all pristine. I had read a review at one point saying something about the sheets/linens looking tired and old, but ours looked like they could have been brand new. No mysterious stains or holes of any kind. I also read that there were no hairdryers in the rooms. Again, not the case. There were a wall mounted hairdryers in the bathrooms of both rooms that I booked (note the pictures.) The beds were comfortable, never saggy but not too firm either. The water pressure was excellent, but the hot water took a few minutes to get going. The A/C was in good working order and the cleaning service was superb. We always had fresh towels and soap, and the sheets were always clean. The courtyard was lush, green, and again CLEAN. The pool had a few leaves in the bottom, but that's to be expected with as much foliage as there is in the courtyard. On the second to last day of our visit there was a gentleman tending to it. Yes, the breakfast was small: croissants, another type of pastry (can't recall), orange juice, coffee, a wide variety of jams, and maybe milk. Just enough to get you going. But there are plenty of shops in the quarter to satiate your breakfast needs. If nothing else has made an impression on you, Place d'Armes' location certainly will! The hotel is only steps away from Jackson Square and Bourbon Street (ie: right in the middle of all the action!) You're never too far from anything within the Quarter. Like other reviews have said: the Place d'Armes is not the typical hotel. I could be wrong about the exact number, but the buildings themselves are all at least 100 years old, if not older. You might feel like you're staying at your grandmother's house (but without all the doilies.) The ambiance is meant to be feel old, but it never felt dirty.

I asked if our room had a balcony and they said no, not all Deluxe rooms had balconies. But right away she started looking for a Deluxe room with a balcony and one was available!! Room 302 - street balcony and great room with King Size bed. So be sure to ask for a balcony at the front desk if you reserve a Deluxe room. The room itself was clean as well as the bathroom. No complaints there! Being in our mid-20s, the location of Place D'Armes was perfect!! You walk left 2 blocks from the hotel and you're at Jackson Square, you walk right 2 blocks right from the hotel and you're on Bourbon Street. A great location for 2 different atmospheres. Jackson Square - the cathedral and area around it is beautiful plus the river view is soo nice. Bourbon Street - lots of action, music, people, drinks, and fun! YOU MUST GO TO THE FUNKY PIRATE ON BOURBON STREET. GO SEE BIG AL CARSON AND THE BLUES MASTERS!!! What a show Big Al puts on...he was great! Both a great blues singer and a comedian! We did a swamp tour on an airboat with Louisana Tours Co. It was great! Saw lots of aligators and had some nice time cruising on the air boat.

We kind of noticed it when we would first come into the room, but you get used to it quickly and its not a big deal. My girlfriend was hoping to have some super natural encounter, so when the chandelier would cut in and out in the evening she was delighted. However, tightening a few light bulbs apparently caused the ghost to leave us alone after that. I have to agree with others that the hotel in general is in need of some maintenance.

The room was spacious, but a little dark; the lighting left something to be desired. Our room had a lovely fireplace with an ornate wood mantle. The king bed was the size of a footbal field! The room was releatively clean, but there were some maintenance issues that need to be addressed - nothing significant, though. For example, the door to our room had a pretty good size gap between the door and jamb that allowed the mosquitoes easy access to a meal.

The story is that the building formerly in that location was a boys' school in which there was a fire. A number of students and the headmaster were killed. The haunting is suppose to consist of the sound of children playing in the courtyard and/or the sighting of an older gentleman with a white beard who disappears when spoken to or followed.

This is not the first time I've stayed there (as a matter of fact, its about th 7th or 8th time), but it was the first time for my friend. I kept telling her that this hotel is unlike any other she's ever stayed in. The Place d'Armes lived up to my bragging. She couldn't stop exclaiming over the place. If you are looking for a hotel with ballrooms, restaurants, a spa, an olympic size pool and mini-bars, then this is not for you. But, if you are looking for the most convenient, friendly, \"New Orleansly\" hotel, then stay here. Living in this hotel is what it must of been like over a hundred years ago when the wealthy families lived in the French Quarter and did their living within the interior courtyard of their home. The only differences are that the rooms are air conditioned, 70+ TV stations, electricity and in-door plumbing. The hotel, while keeping the charm of \"old new orleans\" is thoroughly modern with almost every room being a little different from any other. I always ask for a patio room either on or overlooking the interior foliage filled patio and swimming pool. The atmosphere and character are old New Orleans and the staff is so helpful and friendly that when you get back to the hotel, you just want to sit in the small, intimate lobby and talk with them. Convenient? Less than 50 yards from Jackson Square and the St. Louis Basilica. Less than a block and a half from the Cafe du Monde and the Mississippi River Levee. Half a block from the art galleries on Rue Royal and a block and a half from Bourbon Street. Yet, no noise filters down to the hotel. When you are in the interior courtyard, you don't hear much at all. One of the best facilities is the indoor, valet parking. The attendant takes your car up on the elevator and brings it down whenever you need it. Both the bell staff and front desk staff act as consierge and happily make any arrangements you need made; whether it be a jazz cruise on the Steampboat Nachez, a restaurant reservation, or even an airboat road down in the bayous. (See if you can get Felix to handle your airboat) While they do serve complimentary juice, coffee, sweet rolls and croissants, I always go for a walk/run (emphasize walk) on the levee and then stop at the Cafe du Monde for Cafe au Lait and bignets. In the same building is Muriel's restaurant if you don't want to go far for lunch or dinner. Less then 100 yards down St. Ann St. is the River's Edge restaurant which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. And only a 10 minute walk on Decatur is Central Grocery, home of the mufalatta. Just get there early before they run out. I hesitate to write this review because i am afraid that the Place d'Armes will get too popular and I won't be able to get a reservation in the two or three rooms I like the best. The other thing is the price. It is very, very reasonable for New Orleans. Sunday through Thursday I have gotten prices as low as $79/night. On weekends or during special events the prices do go up, but usually less than the \"name brand\" hotels.

Not noisy because of cars, but noisy because of the people drinking to all hours of the morning on the patios opposite the hotel. Inner court yard was very nice. Pool was fine, minus the 3 large tiles missing from the upper side. ROOM: The room was clean. One issue is one of the windows was level with the public patio that faced the side street. If you are concerned about people being able to see in from the patio, you had to keep the window closed, which made for a dark room. BATHROOM: Dated, but clean. BED: The queen size bed must have been at least 20 years old as it was EXTREMELY soft. If you have any type of back problems or desire hard beds, do not stay at this hotel! I am guessing all the other beds are similar to the one we had. WALLS: The walls of the hotel were paper thin; I swear there was no insulation in the walls! You could hear everything/everyone outside of your room . Not nice when it is 4:30AM and your across the hall neighbor is cursing because he lost his cell phone, nor when all the true drunkards come home after 4:30AM either.

Parking expensive $22/day, but same all over the city. Some minor noise from revellers in the hotel, but that's part of the charm of New Orleans. Would definitely stay here again. Regarding New Orleans in general - would highly recommend the Grayline Hurricane Katrina Tour, Preservation Hall (awesome brass band on Thursdays) and for good meals The Acme Oyster House (Brits won't believe the price of the oysters!), Fiorella's (we didn't get ill afterward contrary to other reviewers on here). Angeli's was overpriced. Girod's has closed down. The people of NO were very welcoming, please visit now, this helps them to rebuild.

The room was of average size, exposed brick, ceiling fans, lots of windows. It was very quaint to stay here. The bathroom was a bit small without a lot of counter space but we managed. Shower pressure was great. We were always hot in New Orleans but our air conditioner could more than keep up with our needs in addition to having ceiling fans. I loved the windows during the day time but I prefer a totally dark room at night and there was no way to achieve this as they are simple shades covering the windows. However, it was very quiet and private so that was a minor inconvenience. Our room was old, as the building itself is well over 100 years old but it was in good repair and always cleaned perfectly.

Most everything in the Quarter is within walking distance. Tired of lugging packages around from shopping in the Quarter? No problem. Take everything back to your room and keep on going. You can walk everywhere from here - the casino, buggy rides, French Market, restaurants, jazz, shopping, museums, the River, the Aquarium, Gray Line Tours, Bourbon Street (I know, you don't go to \"that place\"). Even at 60 I can hike everywhere from this hotel, it's right on Jackson Square. Being one block from Cafe Du Monde (open everyday but Thanksgiving and Christmas, I think) is worth the aggrevation of things not being just right. Staying at this place is dependent on how much you are willing to tolerate in order to afford a trip to NOLA and how much you want to be in the heart of what's happening there. If you expect and can afford the best, then you might not want to stay here.

She told me that I needed to pay an extra 20.00 for a roll away since one of my boys is 16. When I booked with an online service it did not tell me of that charge so I told her that. I asked for the manager and she said he would be in the next day. Well I guess she had a change of heart and she waived the 20.00 for us which was nice of her. We requested a deluxe double with a balcony and we got just that...on the 3rd floor with access to the balcony where we could see the square nicely. The room though was a little on the untidy side. The ceiling fan was shaking so bad that we turned it off for fear of it falling off and hitting one of us. The room was dusty with hand smears all over the place. It was a wonderful size for us with two boys 12 and 16. I guess they are going to replace the TV since it was very small but it worked for the boys. The bathroom was not the cleanest I have seen. I don't think anyone has swept in there for awhile. Also the bathroom doors are not solid doors they are more like french type to the sink area and to the toliet area.

Light globes above vanity sink loaded with dust/dirt, had not been cleaned in a long time. We are clean people so this was unacceptable and not fun to be exposed to.

We experienced two rooms at this hotel as the first night we spent on the top floor (5th floor) and then moved to a room with a balcony overlooking the street on the 3rd floor. The reason we moved our room was just so that we could have a balcony if one was available, which it luckily was. The courtyard of this hotel is second to none! Absolutely beautiful and they don't open it up to people on the street...only hotel guests can use it. The courtyard is loaded with beautiful flowers, trees, bistro tables/chairs, lounge chairs, tables with umbrellas surrounding a lovely pool. It is truly a beautiful site to see at any time, but especially during the early morning or evening hours. This hotel truly captures the feeling of being in the French Quarter! Both rooms we stayed in were clean, comfortable, roomy, and well decorated. Both rooms had one wall of brick, which gave the room a very nice look. We stayed in a deluxe room both times for a great price! Every single person that we ran into that worked for the hotel was very pleasant, accommodating, and welcoming! Southern hospitality is very evident here! I don't freely give out good reviews....but I felt compelled to tell everyone looking for a hotel in New Orleans to look no further....this hotel is truly charming, elegant, and everything a hotel in the French Quarter should be. If you want to experience the quaint feeling of being in the south in the beautiful French Quarter....the Place D'Armes is for you!", "Date": "June 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrisburg, PA", "Title": "\u201cHats off to the Place d'Armes by Jackson Square!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3516660", "Content": "My husband and I just stayed at this wonderful hotel, the Place d'Armes on St. Ann Street.

The location is perfect. It's just a few short blocks from Jackson Square and the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Dumond. Two blocks the other way, and you're on Burbon Street. My check-in went without a hitch and I got the exact room I had requested. Tim and the entire staff were more than pleasant and helpful. Everyone from the bellman to the housekeeper made my stay a real treat, and Tim is a pure delight. He is absolutely dedicated to that Hotel and the comfort of the guests. The front desk clerk that some have complained about was no problem at all. Although she does not have an overly outgoing personality, she was very professional and helpful with directions and other questions that I asked. When I dashed in the door one afternoon and asked her to hold some bags at the front desk so I didn't have to take them back to my room while I continued shopping, she was very nice about it. But then again, I greeted her with a smile when I arrived and said Please and Thank you when I asked her for something, and maybe that made a difference. My room was just fine. It wasn't perfect, but it was clean, comfortable and very large. It had a balcony overlooking the fountain and garden and there were two chairs and a small table on the balcony where I could sit and enjoy a cup of coffee or just marvel at the beautiful surroundings. You have to walk up a flight of outside stairs to get there, but it was worth it. I'm not excusing the conditions some have reported at this Hotel. I would have been really upset if my room had mold on the walls, but I never saw anything like that. I think people need to remember that this hotel is not \"hermetically sealed\" like some of the new hotels. It's very old and New Orleans is a hot, humid place. There may be some imperfections, and their decorating style is not something I would copy at home. But, if you're looking for a real taste of New Orleans, this is the place.

The courtyard is absolutely stunning and I found the staff to be very helpfull and nice. And as mentioned in so many other reviews, the location in the Quarter simply cannot be beat. My friends and I occupied rooms 120 and 123 last weekend. These 1st floor rooms that have two beds were good for what we needed, which was simply a place to rest for the night. We spent very little time in the actual room. The most notable thing about these rooms is the fact that the windows face the street and are so close that the first time I opened the window I felt like I was actually IN the street. A drunk was asleep outside our window. A sad sight. It only took a little while to get used to the window (we kept the curtains closed most of the time). The street was not busy, so their was no noise problem. My only real complaint about the room, was the fact that: 1) mold on the bathroom ceiling of room 123, 2) the beds were as hard as rocks, 3) the pillows were flat as pancakes. But hey, after a night on Bourbon St., who really notices! :) We spent the mornings in the courtyard getting ready for the day. A pefect place to gather your thoughts, chat with other guests, and just take in the beauty of the vegitation. I found the morning hotel breakfast not to my liking, but have rarely had a continental breakfast that I really cared for. We were in and out of the hotel lobby all day and night. Most everytime we stepped through the door, the person working the desk would acknowledge us with a smile or a hello. This is a small but noticiably nice gesture. Overall, I enjoyed staying at Place D'Armes, and would definately stay again. I would, however, pay a little extra and get a room overlooking the courtyard. If only they would pay attention to the rooms with as much pride as they do the courtyard, this hotel would rank much higher in my book. If your looking for a no frills hotel in a great location with a LOT of New Orleans character, then this is the place to choose.

I read a number of reviews before booking and it seemed like this hotel was going to be pretty hit and miss in terms of rooms. I took my chance and, unfortunately, ours was a BIG miss...Hands down, the second to worst hotel room I have ever stayed in. 1. Carpet was disgusting. Definitely would not walk on it without shoes. I understand New Orleans is prone to flooding and the carpet in this room definitely must have been a victim. At this point, it wasn't much better than indoor/outdoor carpet. Thin, worn, dirty looking. The floor under the carpet was apparently in bad shape too. Rather than utilizing some floor leveler first, they just slapped that ratty carpet over the top so the floor was all lumpy and uneven. 2. Wallpaper must be older than I am. It was dingy, dark and peeling off the walls everywhere. 3. MOLD growing on the walls. I'm not talking about a little mold on the grout in the bathroom (although there was some of that too). I'm not talking about dust or any other kind of dirt. I mean black colored MOLD growing right on the wallpaper in the bedroom area. And a good bit of it too. One wall had patches of it covering an area about 2 feet x 3 feet. And I didn't have to look hard to find it. It was CLEARLY visible above the armoire holding the TV. 4. Minor fear that the ceiling might fall on us. There was an area of the ceiling that had clearly suffered water damage\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6very close to being directly above my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head while he slept. Around the damaged area, the paint was peeling and flaking\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a big brown stain surrounded by peeling paint does not inspire confidence in the structural integrity of the place. 5. Room just generally smelled...the mold probably didn't help. 6. Room location was uneventful. We had a ground floor 'courtyard' room, but it was more like an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcalley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room. Room 124 was off a smaller courtyard and even then it wasn't really on the courtyard. It was off of a walkway leading away from the courtyard...hence, more of an alley. 7. Room decor was dark, dull and dreary. In addition to the previously mentioned dirt, the dark brown bedding and curtains didn't help liven things up. The furniture was well worn and didn't have the feel that it was worn because it was antique...it just seemed shabby. Overall, the room felt like a cave. And having a room with a window didn't help since it was ground floor and we kept the curtains pulled so that we weren't on display for all of the other guests...well, the ones who would venture up our 'alley' anyway. Being an old building, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised or even upset by the fact that the floor above us was pretty close to paper thin\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Well before 8:00 in the morning I awoke to the stomping of our upstairs neighbor. I think they were actually just walking around, but each and every footstep sounded like a stampede. And I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised or upset by the tiny bathroom\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get the bathroom door shut if we were sitting on the toilet. But when combined with all of the other negatives, even the things I had been expecting seemed like bigger drawbacks than they would have otherwise. As for the positives, the hotel location was good. Right near Jackson Square. However, the area isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t THAT big\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so it seems that the vast majority of French Quarter hotels have a good location. For perspective, as 30-year-olds who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in particularly good shape, we had more than enough energy to walk anywhere we wanted to go in the Quarter and even took 2 walking tours in the same day. The courtyard was nice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we left our alley and ate our breakfast in the main courtyard. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on spending a whole lot of time there because the furniture, while nice to look at, wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly comfortable. Fortunately, we only had to stay one night at this hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Which is the only reason I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t inquire about switching rooms. Much more than 1 night and I really would have had serious concerns about staying there. Molds can pose serious health risks and there was just too much of it in that room to feel safe or comfortable. The shame of it is that the room had a lot of potential if hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been one of the grimiest, dingiest, least-cared for hotel rooms I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen.

However the room that we were moved to the next day was really nice. It was a suite really w/ a separate sitting room w/ a sofabed and the whole balcony on that side was ours! It was nice and clean and in much better repair. It was Room 211 I think. The staff was very nice with the exception of the dayclerk lady who wasn't really overtly rude, just uninterested. Tim the evening clerk was absolutely wonderful. He gave us directions and recommended places to eat and they even sent has us a bottle of chamagne for our arrival since it was our anniversary! The housekeeping lady (I didn't catch her name) was great and sweet and very helpful. The courtyard is beautiful and the continental breakfast was great w/ the crossonts being wonderful and not greasy. Of course the location can't be beat either. All in all it was a great stay and we will probably stay here again when we visit NO again.", "Date": "December 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greensboro, NC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2856048", "Content": "I travel to New Orleans several times a year for personal medical business and always stay here.

The problem is many of their rooms are inside rooms, meaning no windows. We travelled last minute and could not get anything else, so we were aware of what we had reserved. What surprised me however, was the steep rate charged ($149-$219 per night) for a very small room which was clearly intended for one person not two. For example, there was only one bedside lamp, so my husband and I had to take turns reading at night. In fact, it was so dark, we started to refer to the room as the crypt and the bathroom as the inner-crypt. It was rather dull and drab indeed. Not having stayed here before I can't rate the outside rooms, (the only one I did see looked lovely), but do be aware when making reservations that the inside rooms are truly that. Other than this lament, the hotel was pleasant, clean and the staff competent. The shining star was the woman who worked in the breakfast room.

The rooms are all a littel different, which makes for an interesting stay occasionally. The rooms are amazingly large. It is only one half block from Jackson Square and 1 block from Cafe Du Monde (the doughnut place). While there, get a shrimp PoBoy at the Royal Street grocery (St. Ann and Royal Street, at the corner) for only 5bucks. It is the best shrimp poboy in the world. I mean that because I am an expert with Shrimp poboys. Johnny's poboys are a close second (Toulouse St and Decatur). Anyway, while in New orleans, don't miss the observation deck at the top of the Royal Orleans hotels at Royal and St. Louis Street..It's above the Pool. You can see all of new Orleans up there and... it's free!!!!!!! Ask the bar there for a rock candy sugar stir stick. They used to have them in 1975 but have since stopped serving them.

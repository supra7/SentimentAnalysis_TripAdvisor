The Seneca was perfect for our trip - great location right off Michican Ave. I was participating in the Hustle up the Hancock stair climbing race, and this hotel is literally right beside the Hancock building. Our room on the 15th floor was huge with a great view of the Hancock, and although the furnishings are a little dated, everything was very clean and comfortable. The entire hotel had a lot of great character, from the lobby to the exterior to the rooms. Our great room rate even came with a full hot breakfast - awesome deal!! The only negative I encountered was the surly front desk staff. Both the woman checking us in and the man checking us out said almost nothing - no \"How can I help you\", no \"How was your stay\" - the check-out guy literally just stared at me and grabbed my room cards. It was almost comical. Luckily those experiences only accounted for a couple minutes of my great weekend at the lovely Seneca hotel.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "China Grove, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cNot worth it!\u201d", "Author": "Jennbte2ct", "ReviewID": "UR124867513", "Content": "I am a pretty easy going traveler.

The rooms are suites, converted apartments, that are actually more than the average hotel guest requires. On my last stay I had a room with five closets, four of which went unused. I prefer non-chain hotel properties and this fills the bill. Service can be a little uneven: on my last stay the clerk failed to give me coupons for breakfast when I checked in. The next morning the desk clerk told me that breakfast wasn't included in my room - although I was paying more than I had paid a week earlier when the coupons were included. A quick chat with the manager got things straightened out, although he also made a stab at declining. Customer service is such a moment of truth and word of mouth is now at light speed, one would think that managers wouldn't even try to win such small disputes. There is a business center, but when I asked about printing a boarding pass, I was told that the printer was down. A week later, the printer was still down. On the plus side, you get a huge suite for $109 per night and they'll park your car for about $35. Incidently, the \"free\" breakfast is pretty good.

The kitchen came with a full size refrigerator, dishwasher, 4 burner stove, microwave, coffeepot, toaster as well as some pots and pans, plates, glasses, cups and utensils--more than adequate for our 4 night stay. The dining table was set for six, and the living area had two sofas, chair, end tables, TV etc. One walk in closet in the bedroom with safe. At least two closets in the living area. So, plenty of room for the work we had to do to prepare for three meetings during the conference (e.g., putting together attendee packets). The staff were very helpful, including bringing up a very large/heavy box of materials, and running out in the cold/rain to nab a cab for us to the airport. Breakfast was not included in our $149 conference rate, though it is included in some of the other special rates from what we could understand so worth checking. Going downstairs from the lobby is a small cafe that is not part of the hotel, but, the cheese omelet, juice, tea and home fries that we had were just fine. Instead of toast, they offered to bring me extra fruit as a gluten-free option. The room was quiet, plenty of hot water, and generally clean.

The location is terrific - just a short walk to Michigan Ave. and nestled right behind the John Hancock Center. There is really no need to have a car when staying here if you plan to spend all of your time in the city. The walk to the subway is about 5 minutes and several bus lines run along Michigan Avenue. Parking is at an off-site garage and since we did not have a car, I do not know the rates. We had a slight problem at check-in, but the staff handled the problem quickly and was very friendly. The rooms are spacious and CLEAN. Some may complain that the furniture/decor is dated, but my theory is I'd rather spend less on my hotel and have that extra money to truly enjoy the city. The building is old and on a central heating and cooling system. While we were there (late Oct.), the system was still set to AC. The only problem was it was cool enough outside that the air was not running and our room was quite warm (75). We opened our window a bit and it cooled nicely (68-70). We were happy that despite the fact that the window was open overnight, we did not hear traffic outside. One last bonus - many rooms in this hotel are suites or at least have kitchenettes. During our prior stay, we had a full kitchen, dining area, living room, bedroom & bath. This time, we had a queen delux room which included the kitchenette, but no living room or dining area.

Bedding was lush and comfortable; bed itself nice and firm, like we like it. Internet access was free and wireless and worked very well. For this trip, we decided to rely on public transportation, and got 7-day CTA passes. The Seneca was perfectly placed for everything -- there were buses that literally left us off right at the corner of the hotel. At most, we had to walk a block to catch a bus on Michigan Avenue. We will probably never use a car in Chicago again, especially because of the incredibly high cost of parking -- not just at the Seneca, but anywhere in town! Everyone at the Seneca made us feel welcome and part of their family. We will never stay anywhere else in Chicago; we feel like we returned to our Chicago home!", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel Location & Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "lovehotels2011", "ReviewID": "UR114881155", "Content": "This is an excellent hotel situation right in the heart of Chicago city. Stayed here for 4 nights and loved it. Booked it online with expedia and got very good rate I thought. I was even more impressed at the price when we booked into the hotel. The room was actually one of their suites. It was basically a 1 bed apartment. Large living area with sofa bed, coffee table, tv, dining room table and chairs, two closets. Off of this was a fully equipped kitchenette with every appliance you would want and floor to ceiling cupboards. Coffee maker. The bedroom had a large king bed with tv, walk-in closet and ensuite bathroom. Although bathroom was smallish, it was adequate. Electronic Safe. Airconditioning might not be the best in the bedroom as it is controlled from the living area but it did not cos restless nights and the heat had not hit major highs yet. Decor was what would probably be considered a bit old style but everything was extremely clean. Housekeeping came every day. On top of this there was breakfast included in the cafe in the basement of hotel. So surprised at this as it was not stated when I was booking either so thrilled. Location is perfect, just off Magnificent Mile, behind John Hancock Tower and right next door to the Water Tower Shopping Centre. Small walk in opposite direction and you are on Lake Shore Drive. About 15-20 stroll to Navy Pier - which I love. Also able to get the bus to the Museums for $2 from Magnificent Mile. Only negative is bad lumpy pillows but this was a problem for all of US hotels with stayed in during our trip During our 10 day trip to US this was best value for money hotel and right in city centre.

I must state first off that I got such an awesome deal by pre-booking this hotel - $69 a night! Yes that is just $69 a night for a great hotel one block off Michigan Ave - right behind the John Hancock building. The Seneca is an older property with full service professional Valet and Bellhops. I like this feature. The gentleman who checked us in on Thursday evening lacked personality but not everyone is a chatter box at 9pm in the evening. The Bellman brought up our bags in a separate elevator as the guest elevators are the wonderful (in my opinion) small type you get in older buildings. Our keys were not working in our door - he promptly opened the door with his passkey - unloaded our bags - and went to get us new keys that worked. He was back in a flash and was friendly and courteous the entire time. The rooms was clean and nice as one would expect in an old hotel - very European feel. Our room had two queen beds, two really great closets - one with nice shelves. A cute little kitchen hidden behind its own door off the main room. It had an apartment size stove and fridge, along with mini microwave, coffee maker and the kitchen tools you would expect. The bathroom again is the size you would expect in an older hotel but ample and clean. The shower had great water pressure and plenty of hot water. Nice vent and heat in the ceiling made the bathroom cozy and you got ready. And I like that the window opened to the outside and let in fresh air in the morning. This was true of the windows in the main room as well which we got to open as the wether was mild. The beds are comfortable and the pillows to my liking - softer. The beds could be a bit more comfortable (and I mean a bit softer for my taste). But we still slept well - really no complaints. This hotel is not for those who like the newest, most modern in their hotels. It is a very nice, clean property with European charm. The rooms are ample, love the kitchenette, and in an excellent location. The staff was wonderful and the on-site dining is wonderful.

The online reservation system for this hotel stated there were no available rooms but when I CALLED there WAS an available room. That would be my only negative review of this place. The location is amazing...just around the corner from Michigan Avenue, a 1 minute walk from the Hancock Tower. The outside decor is true to the hotel: solid, sturdy, historic hotel in Chicago. The lobby is nicely decorated and a fire was going in the fireplace. True, the receptionist was not friendly and he was all business but hey, I'm not really looking to make new friends at the front desk. We were upgraded to a Presidential Suite, the room was amazing with a nice sized living room, flat screen tv, dining room and kitchenette, two bathrooms (one with washer and dryer) and a full-sized bedroom with two queen beds. The room was very clean, the noise was non-existant (and we were right near an elevator and our room opened out onto the street). Breakfast came with our room plan and we had a hot breakfast each morning with bacon, pancakes and hash browns. The doormen WERE very friendly and hailed a taxi each morning with a traditional whistle, helped load the luggage and bags, etc. This room charge was just a few dollars more than what we would've been charged at the Red Roof Inn AND it didn't even remotely resemble a crack house! I guess it wasn't total crazy luxury, so if that is what you are craving then you need to look elsewhere AND spend more. I/we are normal every day people who work a regular job and enjoy a little luxury on vaction...so this is right what we expected.

The hotel is in an up-market district one block from North Michigan Avenue, half a block from the John Hancock and Water Tower buildings and one block from Oprah's house! At the end of the road in each direction there are restaurants and shops to spend some dollars - especially if you're travelling in from the UK where the currency exchange is great right now. After an early start and long flight to Chicago, check-in was awkward to say the least - the spectacled receptionist barely looked up from the desk to acknowledge us and perhaps grunted when handing me my keys and wireless Internet information. No point in asking this chap for tourist information I thought and not a good start to our visit. We had decided to use the Airport train and 'L' to get to the hotel and after a few wrong stops and one taxi ride later I wasn't exactly in the mood for a receptionist with an attitude problem. On to the room. We booked a double queen which was surprising and much larger than I was expecting and very spacious for the price. The room consisted of two walk-in wardrobes, a large bathroom with jacuzzi tub and a separate kitchenette in addition to a safe, TV, air con and free wireless throughout the hotel. After a long day walking around town it was pleasant to find double-towels in the bathroom - most hotels insist you re-use the towel provided :( but with no radiator this wouldn't be an option. The bed was comfy and there was almost no street noise from our John Hancock-facing room. Sometimes at night though, we could hear the people next door knocking around in the kitchen which was a little annoying. On our first morning down to breakfast we went to avail of the free Continental menu but our travel agent hadn't sent the request through properly and we were suddenly given a bill. After requesting some assistance from the reception desk, a very helpful woman by the name of Kathryn got us back on track. The breakfast menu was extensive and the food was nice and filling - service staff were friendly and welcoming also. We only ate breakfast in the hotel, but there was a small restaurant adjoining the front of the hotel albeit the menu was small and specialised consisting of pasta/spaghetti dishes - alternative options where within walking distance from the hotel.

The location, as many have noted, can't be beat. And I found the staff quite helpful and obliging on the whole. Other than that, however, I'd give the place a big thumbs-down. I stayed in three rooms over the course of my visit. In all of them, the furniture was old and run down, as were most of the other items -- even the TVs were ancient, not a flat screen among them. The appliances in the kitchenettes were also pretty ancient, and the grout in the bathrooms the worse for wear. It wasn't dirty, but everything looked worn out and run down. The most horrible thing about the first two rooms, though, was the fact that they faced west, looking out over the rear of the Hancock Building. From a very early hour each morning, I was rudely awakened by a steady parade of trucks -- garbage, beer, linen delivery and so on -- that parked on the street below, left their engines running (loudly), and proceeded to thump, bang, crash, and rumble, for minutes on end, and no sooner had one left than another arrived to make the same racket. And if they didn't pull up below, they drove down into the nether regions of the Hancock Building, their motors growling and grinding all the way down -- and back up. The Seneca stands in imperative need of better sound insulation. That goes for the interior, too -- my first room had a connecting door (always a bad sign), through which I could hear the TV of my inconsiderate neighbor (loud but not quite bad enough to complain about) -- plus, in the middle of the night I was disturbed by distinctly audible loud conversation that went on for some time. Finally, on my third try, I got a room that faced Chestnut Street -- and was blessedly peaceful, if equally dowdy. Everywhere, though, wireless \"service\" was really, really, hopelessly bad. Eventually, I just gave up trying to get connected, since I couldn't get even the ghost of a signal. I'd rather pay for wireless and get better service than receive it free, only to find that it was completely useless. Oh yes, and the fitness center was about as minimal as it could possibly be -- one cross-trainer (with someone on it when I went up there so I had to hit the streets), one treadmill, and some basic weight lifting stuff. Disappointing. If you stay here, bring some earplugs, unless you can beg the front desk to put you on the Chestnut Street side!

The breakfast is a choice of 4 or five full breakfasts -- very good. I got a traditional American eggs, sausage, hash browns, juice, while my wife had a bowl of fruit and a bowl of oatmeal.

I recommend if you are staying in Chicago central for your whole trip, don't rent a car. Parking can exceed $50/day, depending on where you are at. Take the blue line on the train from the airport to the city and switch onto the red line going north. Get off at Chicago and walk 3 blocks to the hotel.

I had always heard wonderful things about this city so I couldn't wait to go. The Seneca is elegant and in a perfect location - close enough to the action but on a lovely, tree-lined street. The hotel has been here since 1924 and there is definitely an old-world feel. When you enter, you are greeted by a beautiful lobby featuring big puffy chairs and dark wood. After an easy check-in, we went up to our room on the 10th floor. To access the rooms- you need to pass through a secure door that requires your room key for entry, I always find that comforting. Our room was massive....a full kitchen, dining room, living room, 2 walk -in closets, one has a safe (love that !) as well as a coat closet by the front door and a good sized Master but ....what's with the DINKY bathrooms ??! I have been to New York and stayed in a small room/dinky bathroom combo but I have never seen a HUGE suite with such a tiny bathroom. It had the amenities you want and need, it was clean, it had storage ( a floor to ceiling pantry off to the side as well as a medicine cabinet and under-sink storage)- it was just so small ! Given the size of the suite and the obvious care they take of the place...I just found it hard to believe there hasn't been an update for the bathrooms BUT I am willing to forgive and forget when I stay in beautiful, historic hotels like this one The beds were really hard (some people love that- not us !) and as we booked rather last minute- we unfortunately had to take 2 queens instead of 1 king. The only other thing that may interrupt your sleep is the sound of sirens at night- you are 1 block away from a hospital. The Seneca also has Free Internet ( it's a little slow sometimes) and a desk for working as well as a business center downstairs. There is also a nail salon and a dry cleaners. TV is Direct TV so you get a decent amount of cable stations. I must say that I did really love this hotel, a few things weren't perfectly to my liking but I loved the location- just a block from Michigan Ave (Shopping Heaven! ) and across the street from The John Hancock Building ( don't miss seeing the city from the 94th Floor). The staff is friendly and helpful. There are 3 restaurants on site- although we only ate at The Chestnut Street Cafe for breakfast. The other 2 looked great but unfortunately, we had other plans due to business.

I stayed here from October 7th \u00e2\u20ac\u201cthe 12th so I could attempt to run the Chicago Marathon. I had never been to Chicago before so trying to find the hotel was a breeze from Midway. I took the Orange line to the Red line at Roosevelt. I got off at the Chicago stop on the Red line and made my way up to the street. From there you take Chicago East until you hit Michigan. Take a left onto Michigan and two blocks up you run into Chestnut and, there you are, in the middle of everything yet hidden away. From the moment I walked up to the front door the Door man held the door for me smiled and told me to have a wonderful day. The ladies at the front desk were nice and without me saying anything asked me if I was running the marathon that Sunday and they struck up a whole conversation with me. I also arrived a good 2 hours before check-in but my suite was ready and I was allowed to go up to my room (901). I had reserved the King Suite since there was a special when I booked the hotel in January. I took the elevator up to the 9th floor and walked to my room. I was impressed with how clean and how nice everything seemed in the hotel. Then I opened my door to my room, AMAZING!!! I was expecting a little suite with a King sized bed and a tiny little kitchen. I was so shocked with all of the room I had in the suite. The Kitchen is a full kitchen with a coffee maker, full size fridge/ freezer, 4 top oven, dish washer and dishes/ silverware. There was a dining table with 4 chairs and a large sitting area that was as big as the room I was expecting. I opened my bedroom door and the bedroom was just as big as the living area plus there was a very nice bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub. I had done my homework and thought that I had found a nice cheap place that would be ok for my wife and me to stay for 5 days, but I had come to find a gem. From the ladies at the front desk, the door men, maids, to the maintenance men every person we met or ran into was incredibly warm and nice to both my wife and I. The restaurant in the basement of the hotel was perfect with a large breakfast and kind servers. The room and the entire hotel were clean and it always seemed like someone was cleaning. The roof top deck was nice to go sit on and look out on the city or to stare at the John Hancock building; you can also see the lake from 2 different areas. The location is amazing! You are right off the magnificent mile/ shopping area, you are within 4 or 5 blocks of the L train (red line). There is a Restaurant also attached in the front of the building which always seemed to have nice cars parked outside of it and was packed nightly. When you are in Chicago you need to have a Deep Dish Pizza and the Seneca has a nice perk that allows you to jump to the front of the line at Giordanos which had a 60-90 minute wait when my wife and I arrived. After the week I had in Chicago it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be if I ever come back it is now When, I come back to Chicago the only place I will stay is at the Seneca Hotel.

It offers a 4 burner stove, full size fridge and MW + sink. Very handy. The area was very quiet and like a neighborhood. A quick walk to Michigan Avenue and you are at the Trolley stop (HOP ON-HOP OFF Tour, really informative) for tours or fabulous shopping and restaurants. The bed was comfy and the bathroom adequate but not updated. We're not picky about that sort of thing considering the great price for 4 nights. In the rear of the Macy's building, just across the street from the Seneca is a little convenience shop with chips and drinks. Also a newstand and another little cafe for tea, coffee,salads and pastries and chocolate. In the food court upstairs in this same building you can have a hot breakfast at a buffet before you start your day. While in Chicago we attended the Taste Of Chicago event at Millenium Park- Fabulous! Also went to Wrigley Field and Cubs game-a blast.. People of Chicgo are very friendly and made us feel at home (North Carolina). I cannot say enough about the great time we had in Chicago and the really great place we were lucky enough to stay in. We will likely return very soon and will stay no where else but the Seneca. It is not fancy but quaint and friendly and very spacious.

They're not cookie-cutter rooms like at a big chain hotel, so it's hard to describe them in general because the one in which we stayed might be a lot different than the one you end up in. We had two rooms in our party, and each had a large bedroom and a big sitting area. Each room had its own TV, and the sitting room had a sleeper sofa. Each room also contained a kitchen area with a fridge and small stove. It's hard to imagine doing any real cooking there (and given Chicago's great restaurant options, you probably wouldn't want to anyway), but it's a good place to store and reheat leftovers or fix a quick breakfast. True to the hotel's nature, the kitchen in one of our rooms was quite a bit bigger than the one in the other room. The bedroom in one of the rooms had a walk-in closet, and the amount of closet space in general was remarkable - way beyond what just about anyone would need. The bathroom was nothing special, but the shower was hot and the water pressure strong enough. In our room, the air conditioning wasn't working so well - the sitting room was much cooler than the bedroom. That's kind of a problem in the summertime. We had the thermostat set at 65, and the temperature in the room never got below 75 - tolerable, but a little uncomfortable. The hotel has a very nice rooftop sundeck, which you access by taking the elevator as far up as you can and then walking up one flight of stairs. There are tables and cushioned chairs and lounges on the roof where you can gaze up at the Hancock Building or out to the lake. It's a nice spot for a drink or relaxing, and it's cooler there than it is at street level. The exercise room is also on the top floor. It looked a little small and stuffy. Valet parking at the hotel is $50 a night, which is expensive but pretty standard for hotels in that area, unfortunately. It's worth noting, though, that there's a self-park right next door that's $32 for 24 hours and one a little further down the street (east) that was $29 and an easy walk to the hotel. So unless money isn't an issue or you want your car brought directly to you, you don't have to pay $50 to park. There are a couple restaurants in the hotel (my brother, who lives nearby, has been to the steakhouse and loved it), and the Water Tower shopping center nearby has a food court where you can grab some quick eats that are a lot better than fast-food quality. The hotel staff seemed nice enough, but when we discovered late at night that there was no bedding for the sofa bed, we had to go down to the front desk to get it ourselves because housekeeping was closed and the person downstairs couldn't leave the desk. The folks at the desk said they could also make tour reservations for you so you don't go for a tour and find it sold out. Location-wise, you're just a couple blocks from Michigan Avenue, but it's a fairly quiet and safe area. It's about a 25-minute walk down Michigan to the river, if that helps orient you. There are many more expensive hotels close by with more features, but the Seneca is worth a shot if you like places with character and rooms where you can really spread out, or if you need kitchen space. I chose it specifically because of its location, but even if I didn't need to stay in that exact area again, I wouldn't be disappointed to get the Seneca on a Priceline or Hotwire booking.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Centralia, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel within walking distance of lake.\u201d", "Author": "sgyorkos", "ReviewID": "UR70100683", "Content": "When we arrived and checked in, the man at the front desk was very nice.

Doormen who stand there and let you walk in with a bunch of stuff and don't do anything. People at the front desk who just chat with each other and neglect to notice you are standing there. And then, even worse, people who masquerade as knowledgeable about their terrible Internet service who are \"trying to help.\" I told them from the moment I walked in the door that they needed to reboot their wireless access point near my room because it was going on-again, off-again, and the guy said he would do it. He gave me some kind of goofy wireless-to-ethernet box and told me it would improve things, and an 800# for support. Two hours later, I find out from another front desk person that this fellow \"doesn't know anything about the Internet . . . we don't use those boxes any longer.\" Let's face it TripAdvisors . . . This is a nice room, but hey, if you can't do a lick of business because you have to invest hours in getting setup, it's not much of a hotel. Finally, on the last day, I asked for the manager. He needed to wait until an \"internet operations person\" came in hours later, but at least he got someone to reboot the access point. Sure enough, the last two hours of my four day stay worked great. In short, great hotel for tourists who don't need the Internet, a good buy, but NOT a business hotel in any stretch of the imagination. I lost money by staying here, something that wouldn't have happened if I had stayed in a place with a solid net connection.", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cSeneca Presidential Suite: Value and location, location, location\u201d", "Author": "roadtrippervoyageur", "ReviewID": "UR61381677", "Content": "Our family of 4 took a 3-night trip to Chicago during spring break and stayed in the spacious 1-bedroom Presidential Suite at the Seneca. Our rate was a \"stay 2 get the third night free\" rate booked online, and included breakfast for two daily. Wi-fi Internet access was included with the room rate, a nice perk that not every Chicago hotel includes without an additional daily fee. The suite was like having our own apartment in Chicago, an enjoyable home away from home, and very reasonably priced given the size, features, and location near the northern end of the Magnificent Mile. Our suite overlooked Chestnut Street and the Seneca's entrance. Occasional traffic noise carried up to our room and the garbage trucks sometimes were out fairly early in the morning making the rounds, but we didn't intend to sleep in anyway when there was so much to see and do in Chicago. The suite was clean and had a traditional decor with Queen Anne style furniture. The bedroom had 2 beds, supposedly queen size but they seemed smaller than queens, more on a par with full size beds. The bedroom also had 3 closets, safe, wing back chair, dresser, and flat screen TV. The master bath was small but not claustrophobic (unlike the suite's half bath - more on that in a moment), with a jetted tub/shower combo, marble tile, granite counter, linen closet and under sink storage cabinet. There also was a tiny half bath with pedestal sink and commode off the hall between the bedroom and living room. The half bath was a hoot in terms of maneuvering in and out without catching the door on the commode. The trick was to either leave the lid and seat up if you wanted to fully swing open the door, lol, or to maneuver oneself around the partially open door for clearance. The living room had a sofa (not a sofabed), love seat, and coordinating wingback chair, coffee table, and entertainment center with a second flat screen TV. The dining area opposite the living room area had a floor to ceiling mirrored wall and dining table with seating for 6. A galley style kitchen was equipped with top freezer style fridge, dishwasher under the sink, toaster, coffee maker, electric stove with bottom oven, basic pots and pans, dishes, glasses, and silverware. A desk and office chair and walk-in closet were immediately adjacent to the suite's entry door, and there even was a china display cabinet with blue and white porcelain along one wall to add to the suite's formal yet home away from home feeling. The Seneca's location was perfectly situated for our shopping and sightseeing intentions, just across a side street from the John Hancock building, kitty corner across the street from Water Tower Place and the American Girl Place (a big hit with our two daughters), and a block from North Michigan Avenue shopping. Public transit bus stops were also an easy walk from the Seneca, and included routes to the Museum campus among other bus routes. Taxis were readily available as well just steps from the Seneca's front door and easily flagged down by the doorman. The Seneca's front desk staff were friendly and courteous, and the same was true of the doormen at our every coming and going. We will definitely keep the Seneca at the top of our list for future trips to Chicago. Its winning combination of location, spacious suite, and value would be very hard to beat.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mishicot, WI", "Title": "\u201cSeneca Hotel treats you like a rock star!\u201d", "Author": "JananaBanana", "ReviewID": "UR61156313", "Content": "We stayed at the Seneca for a girls getaway weekend in April 2010.

A few months later, the room rate dropped for the same travel dates & we asked about an adjustment. The hotel refused to give us a credit or free breakfast but did offer us a newly renovated room. Since there were 4 adults in our group, this was attractive to us since a larger room/suite would give us more space. We arrived early since we had an AM flight & were delighted to be checked in immediately. After reading several reviews of late/delayed check-ins at the Seneca, this was a pleasant surprise! However, when I saw our room I was quite disappointed. This was definitely not a newly updated room--old, small bath & kitchenette, no table or chairs so you had to sit on bed to watch tv or eat. It was relatively clean although hot water was in short supply. Overall, the hotel lobby & common areas (hallways, elevators & dining) are charming and remind you of a hotel from the turn of the century. Call me old-fashioned but customer service is still #1 with me and having to call multiple times for towels (they brought pillows instead) and not receiving the room upgrade we were promised (or at least a rate adjustment) implies that the hotel management does not value its customers. There are many hotel choices in Chicago so attention to the 'fine points' means return business and customer loyalty.

First let me say, this hotel is in a great location! The rooftop deck is very nice and what a wonderful part of the hotel to sit and relax at a table or a comfy lounge chair. A lot of pretty flowers too are a nice touch. We got a great value on this room becaue I booked it in advance back in February with an internet rate for $105!! So we were not expecting obviously a fancy room by any means. Our room was roomy and the beds were comfortable. Not sure though if there were other rooms that were more renovated but ours could use a lot of updating. The light switches in the bathroom were pretty dirty and we had to wipe them off, the bathroom door was even grimy as well. Two days in a row we left our room by 10 a.m. and put our \"Please clean our room\" sign on the doorknob and when arriving back to our room at 4 p.m. (being gone the whole day sightseeing as most people do) our room was still not cleaned. I mean- why still be cleaning rooms til 5 at night when that is when you come back to your room to get ready for dinner? They really need to improve upon that. Our chair in the room was a bit torn, the paint could be updated, and they need to really put a comfy sofa chair in the double bed rooms when there are two people staying in there. There is just one uncomfortable office chair. One more small issue was, when we requested more towels one day, it took an hour for those to be sent up to the room. Not sure why that would take so long? All in all, we would maybe stay here again... it was clean enough, a good value, comfy beds.. but I really hope if we do , we can request possibly a more updated room if they are available, or even just a bit cleaner and a new paint job.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel with great location will stay here again\u201d", "Author": "turkey2009", "ReviewID": "UR36945752", "Content": "This was one of the better hotels I have stayed in while being on vacation.

It appears to me that the traveler's perception of this hotel entirely depends upon whether they receive a \"recently renovated\" room versus an \"un-renovated\" room. Despite requesting a \"renovated room\" my wife and I as well as another couple stayed in a room that has been \"renovated a couple of years ago\" according the front desk. The room as it turned out must have been renovated a decade ago due to the fact that it had many flaws including: an ill-fitting front door (which like one of the pictures uploaded on this site had a gap at the top), plaster missing on the walls, a very musty smell, beds that must have been filled with cinder blocks, bed sheets that must have been filled with dust mites or some other infectious substance that made my wife's eye infected and a bathroom a bit larger than that found on an airliner. On the positive side, the location of the hotel is outstanding, in that, it is in the shadow of the Hancock Building, across the street from Water Tower Place and a block away from the Museum of Contemporary Art. Also positive: the room was a suite with a full kitchen and dining area which was roomy for the four of us; the room had two walk-in closets which was more than enough space for four people's luggage; once I reminded housekeeping that we had four guests in our room they made sure that we had additional towels in our bathroom; the valet service (while very expensive at $48 per night) always had the vehicle sitting out front in a very timely manner; and the Wi-Fi was free and worked beautifully the entire time.

The family chose the Seneca. Instead of booking through the hotel, we found a rate on Travel Zoo for $99 a night. After reading the reviews, I was dreading the possibility that we had made a bad decision. As long as you are not expecting a world class hotel, The Seneca provides a great value. CHECK-IN---We had an early flight and arrived 4 hours prior to check-in. The front desk staff was a bit distant, but not rude. Surprisingly, we were given keys to our room and allowed to check in early. ROOM- The King Suite was huge (it was formerly an apartment as the hotel was built in the 1920's--Layout included a full-size, but narrow kitchen with a built in dinette, dining room with table for 4, living room with TV, seperate large bedroom with king bed and TV, coat closet, walk-in closet in living room, large walk-in closet with safe, small bathroom with small tub/shower. FLAWS--Don't expect the Hyatt Regency, the room did have cracks in the bottom of the sink, some chipped paint on the mirror on the medicine cabinet, missing molding under the sink, etc. However, I am a big stickler for a CLEAN ROOM and the shower, carpet, bedding, etc were all clean. For the value, I can overlook wear and tear if the room is kept up. Our keys did have to be reset after normal check-in hours the first day. The water temperature did change in the shower, but not too a scalding hot or freezing cold level. LOCATION--Especially for shopping, you are not going to get a better location for the value. The hotel is directly behind the Hancock Tower (new Best Buy flagship store in the works, Cheascake Factory as well), It is adjacent to the Water Tower Place which includes Macy's, American Girl, and an indoor mall. It is less than a block down Michigan to the 900 shops which include a mall and Bloomingdale's. The rest of Michigan Ave. is a short walk away. There is also a market for food purchases in the basement of a building one block away. The Museum of Contemporary Art and a small park are two blocks away and Lakeshore Drive and Lake Michigan are 4 blocks away. SAFETY--We never felt unsafe in the hotel. The area outside is friendly (There's a Ritz Carlton in the Water Tower Place and a Four Seasons on the other side of the Hancock Tower. There is a key card access required to access the elevators from the lobby area. Additionally, the in-room safe is a plus. OTHER--There is a small fitness center on the 18th floor with cardio machines, dumbbells and a universal machine. The rooftop patio was closed for the season. I enjoyed previous stays at the Hyatt Regency, Marriott, Hilton, and Hampton Inn in Chicago. However, if you are looking for a value, consider The Seneca.", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "tasmania", "Title": "\u201cgood location\u201d", "Author": "oztourist42", "ReviewID": "UR22308237", "Content": "hotel was in a good location, room was huge and for chicago hotels it was reasonably priced", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chino, CA", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "flynndodgers", "ReviewID": "UR22179227", "Content": "The Seneca Hotel was a good choice for a downtown Chicago hotel.

I have to admit that even though I got a great deal on a king suite ($109/night) and queen suite ($129/night) through a TravelZoo offer, I was a little hesitant about booking at this hotel after reading mixed reviews. Much to our delight, our fears were unfounded when we arrived. Although we had requested rooms on high floors, when we arrived the only space available with the two rooms we booked was on the second floor. However, we quickly got over that disappointmet when we saw the rooms. Both looked as if they had been fairly recently updated. The huge open living room/dining room space, with full kitchen and a bath and a half was perfect for our three girls who shared a queen suite with their grandmother. The king suite we had was superb! I think we may have received an upgraded room, since we requested both rooms on the same floor. Ours was a corner suite that in addition to the above listed amenities also had its own washer and dryer. Not that we really used the kitchen or laundry, but it was nice to have both. The one feature that prevented me from giving this hotel five stars was the fact that our room was directly over the bar/lounge area. And while live entertainment is probably appreciated by the bar patrons, it was a little noisy when trying to sleep at 1 a.m. However, we forgave that distraction quickly because we really did want to be part of the active Chicago scene :) Our location also afforded that feature, being steps away from the Hancock Center and Michigan Avenue. Our girls especially loved being just across the street from the American Girl Store, too! Overall, I would certainly recommend this hotel to friends and family and we will stay here again if/and when we return to Chicago. My advice to anyone who isn't satisfied with their room - request a different room. We found the hotel staff to be very pleasant and willing to accomodate our wishes when possible.

We were assigned a double suite on the 9th floor. Our suite was very spacious and clean.

The living/dining room was very spacious. The kitchen was clean and had everything we needed. The bedroom was huge and the suite had 3 closets with plenty of hangers. The bathroom was small but we didn't come to Chicago to spend alot of time in our hotel bathroom. The rooftop deck had great views. We asked the front desk for the visitors kit but were told they were no longer available.

Tenth floor, no kitchen (which wasn't an issue), just a dorm size refrigerator, a microwave, and a coffee maker. The carpet was worn through in several places. The worst part was the bathroom! It must have been a closet in a previous life as you had to almost back in to reach the toilet in the corner....and then sit sideways! It was wedged in between the sink and a closet. There was no light over the sink, and the light in the bath/shower consisted of a bare bulb. Not the safest thing to see over your head as you are washing your hair!

We also had them hold our luggage the day we were leaving (at 8:00pm), and when we came back to claim our luggage, they brought it directly to the taxi. LOCATION - Location is superb! It is literally located across the street from the John Hancock building. This was extremely convenient for several reasons: we had purchased the multi-day trolley/double decker bus pass, which one of the stops is at the John Hancock. We walked just 3 minutes to the bus stop and hopped on. Also, the morning we visited the John Hancock, we only had a short walk, got their at time of opening, and had absolutely no wait at all. (It was also cool to be able to see our actual hotel ROOM from the John Hancock Observatory.) The John Hancock also has the Cheesecake Factory, which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close until 11:30pm - great cheesecake to close out your night. The Seneca is also within walking distance to Navy Pier (about 1 mile). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice walk down Lake Shore Drive , you cross under the street with an underground walk-way (well lit, not scary or creepy). On the other side, you walk along the beach of Lake Michigan where plenty of people are swimming, biking, jogging, and having a good time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one block east from Michigan Ave. , you can walk right down the Magnificent Mile (and there are other bus stops on Michigan Ave. , too, which was convenient for us). HOTEL \u00e2\u20ac\u201c In the lobby, I saw an award the hotel had won for something like - Best renovations for a hotel built before 1920. So, apparently, the hotel is older, but the only way you can tell is in the classical design and details of the lobby and halls which gives this hotel a lot of charm!

Depending on which elevator you get on, you take the elevator to floor 17 or 17(a, I think it was), then walk up the stairs to the 18th floor. There is a small workout room and then a door to the sundeck. The sun deck was very clean with great buildings/architecture to the south and a view of the John Hancock to the west. There was also a soda machine on this floor. ROOM \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Our room was incredible! I booked a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One Bedroom Suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (for SUPER CHEAP) on Orbitz.com. You walked into a living room with large windows, couch, TV, coffee table, chair, and desk with chair. There was a full kitchen with full refrigerator/freezer (with ice cube trays), stove/oven, microwave, table/2 chairs, dishes/silverware, all very clean. There was a doorway that separated the living room from bedroom. The bedroom was very spacious with King size bed and plenty of room on both sides of bed, chair, armoire w/ another TV, dresser and walk-in closet with plenty of shelving, hanging space, safe, and additional pillows/blanket.

Another plus is the cafe in the basement, not much on ambiance, but they serve a really good breakfast menu all day long (I like to sleep late, so this was a MAJOR plus) and reasonable prices. I had a couple of drinks at the bar in the steakhouse in the lobby, but the place was so dark and depressing that I couldn't stay in there too long.

My wife, daughter and I have been coming to Chicago every year since 2001, and we've finally found the place we want to be when we're here. This hotel is a renovated apartment building (in fact, the top four floors are still conventional rentals) next to the Hancock Center just east of North Michigan and a couple of blocks to the lake. We paid $185 a night for a two-queen suite. For that, you get a small apartment: one bedroom with two queen beds and a TV, one bath, living room with a TV, parlor, dining room, and full kitchen. There's an in-room safe and literally enough closet space to sleep a few kids in. We also each got coupons good for $7.50 apiece every day at the hotel's basement Chestnut Cafe, which feels like the dining room at a British B&B but serves a pretty broad traditional breakfast and lunch menu. The coupons were part of the hotel's Breakfast Getaway package. You also get free WIFI. If you're here with a family, you can save huge dollars on food by shopping for groceries at nearby stores like the White Hen on Chicago Avenue, or by bringing in takeout. The apartment is by no means granite and glitz. The light switches are funky; flip the wrong one, and poof!, the TV goes off. The bathtub drain was a little slow, the electric can opener was broken, the fridge leaked a small bit of condensation, and, although the kitchen has dishes, glassware, stemware, flatware, and pots and pans, it had no bottle opener for the wine we brought in (numerous bottle shops nearby). But the place was clean, and you get to live a bit of an urban living fantasy by staying here. We're definitely going to book this place again for next summer. Fair warning: when you book, they charge the full amount of your stay on your credit card as a deposit. This is highly unusual, and if you're not up to giving them an interest-free loan of several hundred or even a few thousand dollars for several months, you might want to look elsewhere. The hotel has three restaurants. The only one we ate at was the Chestnut Cafe, which serves \"breakfast\" from 6 a.m.-3 p.m. You can catch buses to everywhere on the nearby Michigan Avenue. The closest CTA train stop is the Red Line at Chicago, five blocks away, a bit of a schlep if you're carrying luggage. So that means if you're connecting from the airports on the Blue or Orange CTA train lines, you have to transfer to the Red Line in the Loop, which is under construction and a bit unwieldy right now. This hotel is very convenient to Magnificent Mile shopping and eating. Got kids? Save tons of money by just walking to the beach for the day, or two days. The cost is zero. Finally, our daughter is 7 and she's a huge American Girl fan. The current store is a couple of blocks away on Chicago; the new one under construction is literally across the street from the Seneca at Water Tower Place.", "Date": "July 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and good value\u201d", "Author": "scaim", "ReviewID": "UR18034340", "Content": "We just returned from a four night stay at the The Seneca. I booked this trip through a Travelzoo promotion ($149/night for deluxe suite) before I read any Trip Advisor reviews. Since it was a non-refundable rate, there was no turning back. The exterior and interior of the hotel are full of charm and the staff is very polite and helpful. Though the elevators are small, they exude the character of the period and were always available when called. We arrived way before check-in and our luggage was safely stored and the hotel staff advised us of the best way to get to our desired locations. Our luggage was promptly delivered to our 15th floor room with a hotel provided baby bed upon check-in. The room was a deluxe suite which included a bedroom, bathroom, two walk-in closets, living room, dining area with table for four and full-size kitchen with everything you need if you want to cook. The space was just right for our family of five with the exception of the bathroom. It was very small. The overall decor was extremely dated but everything was clean. The two closets are a waste; however, one was so large that it served as bedroom for the baby. There were no black-out curtains in either room, so we were up with the sun. Our floor had a very clean, coin operated washer and dryer which ended up coming in handy after a couple of baby accidents. There is a small but efficient gym on the top floor with about 6 machines and free weights. Everyday I was in there, it was being cleaned. There were always fresh towels to use and a full water cooler as well as a flat screen TV. Also on the top floor is a beautiful and underused roof deck. I don't know if you can see the Navy Pier fireworks from there but it is worth trying. If I were to travel to Chicago again with my family, I would definitely stay here again. The location was perfect, the price was right and we had plenty of space in our room. If I were to go with just my husband, I would probably stay somewhere a little more luxurious.

Suzanne at the front desk could not have been nicer, storing our bags and sugesting that we check back in a while. After a couple of hours exploring, and a quick lunch, we came back and were told it would only be a little while longer. We had purchased some groceries, and Suzanne offered to store the perishables in the office fridge. Just a short time later we were checked in and on our way upstairs, and told that our bags would be right up. The room was on the third floor (lower than I prefer) but it was a recently renovated corner room and really, really nice. Good size bedroom with king bed, full bath off the bedroom, and a half bath across the corridor. Further inside the room was a huge living room area with a couch and wing back chair. To the left of that was a dining area, with the kitchen off of that. Full size fridge and everything we needed to cook with. The room was clean, but not new, so if you are looking for perfection, stay elsewhere. This is an older building, and it looks great for its age. The location is teriffic, the staff more than pleasant (I bet the people who complained about the rude staff may want to think about how they interacted with the staff.....) The good: Room size, minimal noise from the corridors. Location was good, housekeeping did a great job. Staff pleasant. The bad: Some slight blemishes on the door frame. Noise from outside loud at times (because of the lower floor). We could also hear a party one night, maybe in a ballroom or something on 2nd floor?? Overall, you can't beat the value.

Our daughter booked two rooms, one for her family of 5 and one for us and two other older grandchildren.

She had plenty of room to set up a pack and play for the 18 month old to sleep in. The free cable and movies kept her other two entertained so she could get organized for our busy days. Our room had a small bathroom which really wasn't a problem since there was also a huge walk-in closet (equipped with iron, ironing board, safe and lots of close hangers) which we used as a dressing room and a large foyer with a wall of mirrors that made getting ready outside the bathroom easy. We had a fridge, microwave and coffee pot. Ice machines were great after spending time in Europe where ice is a scarce commodity.

We were travelling with 2 adults and 4 kids, so this ruled out the possibility of \"naming our own price\" and only being guaranteed a room that sleeps 2 people. We needed a suite, and I was thrilled to find a \"presedential suite\" for $139 at the Seneca. I read the reviews of this being an older hotel, without keycards, and worn down furniture. I tried to expect the worst, so as to not be disappointed. We were pleasantly surprised to find a huge, spacious room, that we unlocked with a keycard...I'm guessing the hotel is being updated and we just happened to be on floors that have already been switched to keycards...so no problem there. We felt like we were staying in an apartment, with a china cabinet full of decorative items, and a living area with space to spread out. The room was very clean, and the only bathroom complaint is just that the hot water took quite a while to kick in...after the 1st day we decided to run the water right when we got up so it would be hot when we wanted to shower. There were 3 big closets in the bedroom, which worked out great so that at least 3 of our kids could each claim a closet to keep all of their belongings organized in....as a mom I loved that feature. The location was amazing...everything was easy to get to. The people working at the hotel were great...we had a slight \"hitch\" when we got there, because our room had been given away to a guest with almost the same last name as us (Mance instead of Nance). The manager ended up taking $80 off of our bill, and we were in the exact same room, just on a different floor. Obviously they are willing to go out of their way to make their clients happy, because this was realy a minor issue that we weren't really even complaining about...we certainly didn't ask for compensation because it wasn't a big deal...the front desk person just offered because they felt bad.

We were very worried about our booking, as we just got tickets to the Oprah Winfrey Show which are nearly impossible to come by, and had to make arrangements in less than 10 days. We are usually Marriott/Hyatt kind of people, but Chicago prices are not far from Manhattan, so I took the risk at booking here at Seneca for 4 days. Read lots and lots of Travelocity reviews from past 3 years, and our anxiety was risen dramatically. What a delight when our doorman greeted us outside under the beautiful awning and we walked into a very gorgeous lobby, complete with wingchairs and a roaring fireplace. Desk staff were about the friendliest I have ever encountered, welcoming us to Chicago and answering our stupid tourist questions. We wisked up to our room on nice, quiet, speedy new elevators and bravely opened the door, expecting something from Oliver Twist. Instead, we found a truly nice, clean, tastefully decoraged room with a full kitchen. Bathroom very clean as well, with ample storage and amenities. Good Lord, we knew that this was not a new hotel. This place was built 8 decades ago, so the character combined with the makeover really make it European bistro-like...and it really works. AND.....all of this with its ideal location....next to Hancock Bldg and upscale Water Tower Place across our street. Stayed at the Omni on the Magnificent Mile on last visit, paying over twice and much. Frankly, even if prices had been the same, I think I would prefer The Seneca.

We all went in with the attitude that we would expect the worst and that way we would not be disappointed and would probably be pleasantly surprised. We were, indeed, pleasantly surprised. We wanted to post this review to give a detailed, specific review and address issues brought up by previous reviewers. Four of us stayed for 3 nights and had plenty of room to spread out, 2 TVs, places to get away from one another when needed to do our individual things, etc. Stayed in 2 queen bed suite. Got an outstanding price, so my friend that booked it could not resist and jumped on it. The staff was all very friendly, helpful and good humored. Our belief is that a lot of this is in YOUR approach with staff and being polite, friendly and respectful. The lobby is beautiful. Check-in was quick and smooth, front desk staff friendly. The valet, doorman and bellhop were all wonderful and friendly. Security door to access elevators; elevators quick, no problems. ATM in area by elevators, behind security door so felt safer using it. Also have a terminal with info you can access such as weather, local attractions, shopping, etc. Guest room hallways - yucky, baby/sky blue walls; dark carpet; EXTREMELY warm. Odd smell. I had a friend who lived in an apartment complex with a similar hallway smell and she described it as \"beefy\". Room door - difficult to open. Door knob was very loose, probably because it does not actually turn and many guests have tried to force it to turn. I checked other doorknobs and they were loose as well. To enter room you have to turn the key to unlock door, then turn it the other way to unlatch and push open - a little tricky in the days of card keys and green lights telling you when to turn and push. Door had large gap at top where we could see the light from the room shining out. Another frequent complaint from previous reviews was that the deadbolts didn't work. Ours worked, but you had to grab the door knob and lift the door up a little bit for it to lock. Once we figured out these little tricks, it was fine. Upon entering, room was dingy and old looking with darker old-fashioned patterned furniture, dirty curtains, blah walls. Furniture in pretty good condition - couch had large support bar in center and hurt when I sat on it. Our coffee table had 4 glass inserts on top, 1 was very loose, one had a broken-off corner. Bathroom remodeled and attractive. Kitchen remodeled - beautiful. Room was hot when we arrived, had individual thermostat, able to turn off heat. Additional bonus for us - windows open wide, no limit to how far they open. This may by a concern for families with small children, however, but we loved it and had the windows open almost our entire stay to keep it cool in room (also helped with the weird smell). Very disappointed in jacuzzi tub - these are old apartments and so the tub was put into an existing bathroom and was smaller than traditional tub. We did not use it. Tub jets were also dirty. Beds - OK. Matresses firm, but still had sagging spot in middle, which I did not understand. Blankets and quilts did not work well with two people in bed if they didn't want to snuggle to be adequately covered - seemed small for bed. LOTS of storage, 2 walk-in closets which could actually sleep someone if needed. I used one as my personal changing room. Kitchen - more than adequate supplies for everything we wanted to do in the 3 nights we stayed here. They even had a whistling tea kettle, which I used the entire time. Ordered food from the Saloon Steakhouse - excellent food, a bit pricey due to being a steakhouse, but cheaper than traditional room service. Location is outstanding. Right next to John Hancock Building - our view was actually of the Hancock parking garage and side of the building. Across from Water Tower Place, 1 or 2 blocks from Mag Mile, very convenient. Check-out was smooth, no double-charges on credit card, staff friendly and helpful throughout stay. No concierge, but staff more than willing to answer questions. Overall, we were all pleased with our stay. We are used to staying in very nice hotels when we travel, so the appearance of the halls and rooms was off-putting, but the value, space and service more than made up for it. We will probably use this hotel for any future visits to Chicao when we just want a good room to stay in. If we want luxury, with cosmetic appeal, two-person jacuzzi tub and don't need tons of space, then we will pay A LOT more to stay somewhere else. But this will be our regular hotel from now on. Don't be scared of the Seneca, just go in with a realistic expectation and positive attitude and you will be fine. I can't say what the other rooms look like, and some of them may have bigger problems than ours did, but I wanted to give a detailed, honest account of our stay. I have included a lot of picures of both the good and bad things at the Seneca because I felt like this would have helped me.

For the price (and relative to what other hotels were charging during same time period) it was a good value. Its in a great location for tourists (right next to Hancock building and Mag Mile) and not far from red line 'Chicago' stop (about 5-10 min walk) to get to rest of city (like loop, Cubs or White Sox games or comedy shows). The area its in a very safe and we had no problems walking around in the evening. To quote my husband, the hotel was 'Functional but not fancy' which sums the place up. The room was clean, kitchen was stocked with plates, glasses, a few pans to cook in. But the hotel is old and furniture looks like its seen better days..Our room had 2 TVs in it (one in the bedroom and one in the living room). The living room one made you think you had glacuoma cause the picture was blurry and obviously the tube was going. Since we had the other TV which was OK, we didn't ask them to replace the other TV.. The bathroom was clean and well-stocked with toiletries but it was a pretty tight room and you couldn't have more than 1 person using it at a time. You did get a good amount of space and closets so if you are staying for a week or more, you would appreciate the room. The kitchen was one of the main reasons we picked it so we could cook breakfast ourselves and save some money (and not gain too much weight!). There is a supermarket 2-3 min walk away which is not bad and a WholeFoods 10 min walk away if you want more higher-end food or premade lunch/dinners to take back to the room. If we come back to Chicago, we would definately consider staying here if the price is good relative to other hotels. If you can get a room for $200/night or less, its worth it..Or if you are staying for a week or more and want to be able to cook some meals yourself or have more room.

For myself, it was a great experience and I will return. It is not a glitzy, high end, high tech hotel. You will not be surrounded by the young professional with briefcase and expensive clothes. You will not impress people with the price you paid, or the free hors d'oeuvres in the lobby. If that is what makes your stay, don't stay at the Senaca. It is quiet, and the cliente are casual and many times European. The rooms are neat, clean , spacious and decorated in Colonial. My room had a sitting area and a kitchen. It looked like it was painted and wall papered in the last two years. The free breakfast was bacon (ham or sausage) and eggs, french toast or pancakes. The best part of my experience was that I slept better here than any high end hotel I've been to. The sheets were soft and comfortable, the temperature upon entering was perfect and the \"air' quiet. Perhaps it was because this is an old building,I felt that the room was breathing, that is, a small amount of air exchange from the outside. It was not stuffy and did not smell of a cleaning solution. I did not feel trapped in a small, stuffy hotel room in a building with 1,000 other people (or more). I hit the bed and slept soundly. I was a single woman and did not fear for my privacy. Downfalls: The door knob was loose and once or twice I had to fidget with it; the hair dryer did not work, I was given a new one the next day, two pieces of furniture were old and scratched. If you need high tech, contemporary furniture, lots of young people exercising in the health center, and be surrounded by hundreds of career people in business attire and carrying computers, don't stay here. Highlights: Location the best, right behind the Hancock, good breakfast, good service, I had no problem getting a taxi. The two restaurants were excellent, the steak house is Zagut rated.

First off, my rate was $150 US/night so I am basing my review in relation to what I paid. Also, aside from the fact of its great convenient location, my rating of Neutral/Average is strictly rating the hotel and the price I paid. Room is average, nothing great, but served its purposes easily as I was in town for a convention. I stayed on the 4th floor and only had 1 bed. Was in town for 4 nights. GOOD THINGS : Tons of closet space, 2 closets, 1 having shelves which was great. Electronic safe in unit as well. Full size fridge/freezer which was very handy. Free wireless internet, though very slow connection. They change access codes on Monday, so take note if it stops working, you will need to call down and ask for new code. When searching for the connection, note it is NOT \"seneca\" as that is their in-house server. Choose the connection that has the strongest signal, I forget the name. Large washroom, wide bathtub, not the ones your bump your arms into the wall. Quiet hotel, even though its full-house, don't hear much noise. Thick light blocking curtain that closes, not the type that is fixed and can't close. Full stove, but never needed to use it. BAD THINGS : Microwave door latch was a bit broken. Light bulb in one light was broken. Old fashion door with key. Tons of kitchen cupboards that take up space. Warm to cold water. There is not hot water in the shower. Very small elevator, holds 5 people. If anyone has a suitcase, maybe holds 2 people and their luggage. Staff was average, not the most friendly and attentive, but not rude either. Bed was a bit old, a little lopsided, old springs I guess. Only 2 pillows, extra were in plastic in the closet. Still have old bed covers which I removed. Room had aircon and it was 85F when I went. Didn't matter which setting I had the fan on, it always seemed to be the same temp and velocity. But it was comfortable for me, maybe not for a couple or family. LOCATION : One of the best. Walked everywhere and it only took 5 to 10 minutes to get where I needed to go. Went to 2 shopping malls, 6 different restaurants, pharmacy, etc. Everything is close by and area is very safe. Never needed a taxi except to get to convention center and airport. Walked to Rush Street restaurants and clubs, 2 shopping malls, Apple Store, Niketown, Adidas, Puma, Giordano's pizza, Sephora, etc. I didn't have high expectations of the hotel.

When I turned over the clock read 6:00 am which I thought strange until I noted the same time on my pda. After a quick shower and a call to the valet I checked out at the front desk . I indicated that I did not receive the requested wake up call and requested he check for me. He confirmed that it was on the list but merely shrugged his shoulders as an explanation. I missed my flight to Los Angeles and I am now in the unique hell that is contemporary air travel.

They never told us that our keys had an electronic chip in them to open the main door to get to the rooms, and as we were trying to figure it out for several minutes how to get the door open, no one at the desk told us even though they were just sitting there. Other guests coming in told us and said that they had the same problem when they arrived and no one had told them. Then we got to our room, and the door was very difficult to open and shut. The bed sagged on one side, so if I rolled over too far, I would roll right out. The place was fairly clean and a nice size, but the bed wasn't comfortable at all. We stayed for 3 days, and on the 2nd day the toilet would not flush and was actually backing up from whatever was in the lines already. I went to the desk and told them the problem and said that we would be out all day. They promised the problem would be fixed by the time we got back. When we got back, our door was unlocked (we had definitely locked it before we left) and nothing was fixed. There was a message on our phone saying our door was double locked (which is impossible if you are not in the room) so they couldn't get in and it was our fault it wasn't fixed or cleaned. The toilet was absolutely disgusting. There was literally stuff backing up into it. So I went to the desk and complained. There were 2 people at the desk and they just looked at me and said, \"what do you want us to do about it?\" I told them that I wanted it to be fixed because we had no working toilet in our bathroom. They sent someone up, and he did fix it but used all of our clean towels to wipe his hands. But he told us he was going to personally see that a maid came to clean the bathroom and give us fresh towels, and no one ever showed up. Also, on the phones, they had no numbers or information to call the desk. And to use the internet, they never tell you what you need to do unless you go specifically ask for a password. Luckily, we assumed that we needed one. We had to walk downstairs every time we needed something, and we needed a lot since nothing would work the first time. Like other visitors have commented, the hot water only exists occasionally and water pressure is not good no matter what time of day you choose to shower. I'd suggest paying the extra $100 a night if you want to stay at a hotel close to Michigan Ave...at least then you will have working bathrooms and beds that aren't broken.", "Date": "June 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cA gem\u201d", "Author": "Otoh", "ReviewID": "UR7935679", "Content": "Great location (one block from the Magnificent Mile).

It isn't the newest hotel out there, and it isn't impeccibly clean. You won't feel like a superstar staying here, but unless you make that much money, you will no doubt appreciate the savings. That being said, I have never enjoyed a hotel more than The Seneca. Step out the door and within two minutes you're on Miracle Mile. It's right next to the John Hancock Center (you know - the second tallest building in Chicago). Cheesecake factory is in the base of JH Center, and a GREAT place to eat. There's a market around the corner if you want to make your own meals. Within a ten minute walk is the Water Tower, Chicago River, 100's of stores, Rush Street, and even the lake. At $100/night less than most hotels in the area, it is an excellent place to stay. There is a steak house in the hotel, which I've heard is good although I've never tried it. Some typical problems at the Seneca are the same as most hotels. There may not be much hot water during peak times, I wouldn't check the cleanliness with a white glove, and the front desk workers aren't naturally friendly; although just talk to them nicely and they will return the favor. You'll find from my other reviews that I enjoy spending less on the hotel and more on having fun elsewhere. I've stayed here by myself, with a business partner, and even with my family including five kids under 6. I'd recommend the suite with valet parking.

The morning after our first night we were contacted by the front desk @ 10:30 and informed that we needed to check out of the hotel because we were only booked for a 1 night stay. We had booked the room with their local sales manager, she had said there would be no problem with 2 nights when we made the reservation. Checkout time is 11am and their calling us @ 10:30 makes me suspect they must have overbooked the hotel. We asked them to help us find another place to stay and the manager printed out a list of hotels in Chicago which he gave to us and said that was help enough. Our situation was already stressful as we were in town to see a family member that is in the hospital. Mr. Corey Steinberg is the hotel manager, he didn't apologize, he didn't care about us being in Chicago with no place to stay nor did he seem to care about how he treated us. The staff appeared to be embarrassed and did try to help us once the manager had stepped away. Either way they basically kicked us out with no place to stay and it was insulting and frustrating to be treated in this manner. In our haste to pack up and get back to the hospital we ended up leaving our cell phone in the room. Which we didn't realize until several hours later while standing bedside at the hospital. The local hotel staff couldn't find our new razor phone and now somebody else is answering and hanging up when we call with the hope they will return the phone.

The kitchen has everything you could need for a trip, and the bathroom was recently remodeled. There were little things wrong, like tables not being completely wiped down, a small tear in the sheet, one TV remote need batteries etc, but nothing really major. Breakfast room service was awesome from the Deli, fast, cheap, and hot. The Saloon Steakhouse is ok, but given the 10 other steakhouses in downtown Chicago, you can do much better.

We understood that on the first day, when the temps were nearly 100 degrees in a city where it doesn't get that hot, but the temps dropped after that and our room never cooled below about 78 degrees. I heard several other guests with the same complaint. --We left a wake-up call for our second day there and never got it. Fortunately we had set another alarm. --The kitchen lacked some basic cooking utensils (it had pots and pans, but one kitchen knife and nothing like, say, a spatula); the handle on the oven door was missing; the reflectors were missing on two burners on the stove. --Maid service was so slow the first day that when the maid finally did show up at 4:30 p.m., we sent her away (this was on a weekday and the hotel appeared far from full).

The hotel is only about two short blocks from the FREE SHUTTLE that Chicago has to all of the museums and tourist attractions in town. It is immediately next door to the Hancock Tower, and also kitty-corner from a shopping mall which has inexpensive food stalls for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. In short, an excellent location. But the service is horrible, and the \"caring attitude\" is completely missing. We were told that as we booked through Orbitz, we were not \"entitled\" to the free continental breakfast (roll, coffee, and juice), and we were not \"entitled\" to ask for a room change. The room that we had was on the second floor, back, and it had a mini-kitchen, so we were not terribly disadvantaged, but the picture on the back of the door showed that it was the smallest room on the floor, and there was construction going on nearby so that we awoke one morning to jackhammers! Also, we reported that our coffee maker was missing a leg, and so it woobled, but nothing was done. The chambermaid, whom we never met, must have never had instructions. One day we had two towels left, and the next day: four. One day there were no washcloths, and the next day we had them. Three days she left every light in the room on and they were burning when we came in, and on the other days the place was pitch dark. Who knows?

Concierge/doorman very helpful in getting limos to airport and directing to public transportation. It was wonderful having a full kitchen! Cons: definitely more renovations needed. More deskhelp needed.

I may have figured out at least one reason: Travelers, especially those on business, choosing standard, deluxe, i.e., non-suite rooms visit a very different hotel than those staying in a suite, especially one on an upper floor. I can only support this theory with my experience below: I have stayed at this hotel two years ago on vacation in a queen suite on an the 10th floor and have been very satisfied. March 18, 2006 I went for two nights on business and requested a standard \"deluxe\" room. My experience was very different. I booked on Expedia months in advance. I had called the hotel directly two weeks beforehand requesting a quiet room since I was going on buiness and needed the room to work. I was told I could only get what was available when I arrived. I guess they felt they already had my money and I had to take what I could get. I checked in at 5:30 pm, the earliest I could get there. I was given a room on the second floor over the bar. I heard Sinatra recordings until 3am. I could even hear the lyrics. No joke. The room reeked of nauseating ancient cooking odors that seemed to permeate the walls and furnishings. The furniture (some of it broken) and window blinds were coated with grime, the floor buckled, the rug was frayed. I had to be careful where I stepped due to the tripping hazard. I was told they were booked and there was nothing they could do. This puts travelers from the West Coast at a disadvantage who cannot always arrive by noon when rooms open up. The hotel won't help them since they won't accommodate room requests in advance. There is not enough staff to accommodate guests. I don't fault the staff. They are simply swamped. I would recommend this hotel only because of its location - close to the Miracle Mile and many other attractions. The street is quiet too. The hotel is better for vacation travelers. I don't recommend getting a room that is not a higher floor suite. However, I don't know that you can get the hotel to accommodate such requests.

Here is the reason for the lower rating: CONS: We booked a Deluxe Queen room. Person that checked us in was not very friendly. Other staff were friendly. Room is very small, bathroom can only accomodate one person in front of mirror (smallest bathroom I have ever been in at any hotel); there was not a walk in kitchen like the website shows, but a kitchenette inside a small closet- it served our needs, but if we were of larger size, we couldn't squeeze into the closet to use the sink..the refrigerator had a loud buzzing noise, if you closed the doors you couldn't hear it; there were no dishtowels or hot pads, so we had to use the bathroom towels; the floor in the bedroom area is uneven; the furniture looks like it came from a rummage sale, and there is only 1 chair at a desk, so if you want to eat in your room (which we usually do at hotels we stay at), you have only the chair and the desk--sorry, but we took a chair from the hallway to use during our stay.we put it back when we were done; no VCRS like the website states; our room was on the 5th floor, and it faced the back of the buildings behind us, and included a garbage dumpster and a construction site. We were woken up both mornings to the sounds of pounding and drilling (7:30am).we just opened up the kitchenette door to hear the sound of the buzzing refrigerator instead of the noise outside!! WE also didn't have a drain in our bathtub, and had to call housekeeping to get one. So our recommendation would be to: 1.)look at the room first before you accept a room, 2.)ask for a room away from the construction site 3.)maybe upgrade to a king suite or other room if you don't like the one you get. 4.)ask lots of questions about your room, the websites are deceiving-I saw one website that says this hotel has a pool-it does not, only a fitness room 5,)if you plan on not using your car, think about parking at a public lot for less money instead of at the hotel. There is public parking on the same block. 6) book this hotel if you get a rate under $75 We would consider staying somewhere nicer next time we are in Chicago, however the rate was Awesome...maybe good for a group of people who just want a cheap sleep!!

The vents in the living room and bedroom were covered with mold and mildew (see photos). Even after telling the fron desk of this problem, nobody cleaned the vents.

I was very happy with the room, which was more like a small one-bedroom apartment. There were two televisions, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. The bed was very comfortable. The first night there was somebody in the next room talking very loudly on the phone while I was trying to sleep -- so I did have to use earplugs that one night. Otherwise, I slept very well and comfortably. The hotel has good security, as there is a locked door between the check-in desk and the elevators. Although the Seneca is located in a nice neighborhood, in a big city extra security is always welcome. There is a deli on the lower level of the hotel that serves excellent breakfasts.

For a special rate of $88 a night we had an actual suite complete with full (though narrow) kitchen, dining room, living room, bedroom and bathroom, along with two separate walk-in closets. We had more than enough space to spread out and make ourselves comfortable- and privacy enough so we each had opportunity to spend time alone if we wished. Our room was high enough above the street and the building was far enough away from the avenue to turn all the traffic sounds into white noise. The hotel served as a great \"home base\" during our downtown stay. The Seneca is literally steps away from the Hancock Tower (our room was directly across from it), Water Tower Place (where we went every morning for a terrific breakfast at the food court) and the rest of the upscale stores of Michigan Avenue. To get to all the Museums and other attractions, we caught a bus or went a couple blocks west to the Red Line of the subway- purchasing at least a 3-day transit pass is highly recommended- and whenever we needed directions, there was always a transit worker or helpful stranger to get us where we needed to go. And every night our room was clean and ready for us when we returned. The kitchen certainly came in handy, too, serving as a place to keep our soda pop, orange juice and other purchased sundries, as well as a great place to keep restaurant leftovers refrigerated until they could be warmed up in the microwave. In fact, the room service dinner sent up from the hotel's steakhouse was ample enough to feed us for three nights! We also liked the Seneca's intimate atmosphere, courteous and helpful staff, and sense of security- for example, no one can access the elevators without a special electronic \"tag\" attached to the room keys. Our problems with the hotel were minor and few- it took a couple days and a chat with the day-shift staff to finally get my mom an ice bucket, and the number of towels kept changing in an erratic fashion. I also found the beds to be hard and a bit uncomfortable to sleep on, but it's really more of a non-issue since I've found that seems to be the same with most hotel beds everywhere. It wasn't a large, luxurious, 5-star hotel or major chain to be sure, but we found the Seneca Hotel to be absolutely perfect for our stay in the Windy City- the location and amenities simply couldn't be beat for the same price anywhere else in the city.

I did not think to ask for a non-smoking room, but should have, because our room definitely had accomodated smokers in the past. Still, we were very pleased with the two queen beds in the bedroom PLUS the living room & kitchen. There is a Treasure Island grocery store at 666 Lake Shore Drive, so we stocked up on snacks and breakfast stuff. We weren't going to be lolling around in the room, anyway so the view didn't matter. Bathroom was OK but could use some repairs - nothing but normal wear & tear, though. Having lived in several vintage apartments in this city, it was par for the course in a vintage building, which I find charming. The bedroom closet was stocked with iron and ironing board, which was great. We did not use any of the services in the hotel, but one of my kids used the fitness room in the basement which was just fine. The Front desk staff/bellman were very nice and allowed us to check-out, but still leave our bags there for later pick-up on our way home. The location is about as stunning as you can get in Chicago for the price!

I recently stayed there four nights. It was alright, but if I go back to Chicago I'd probably look for another hotel. The Seneca handles all the basics well--it's quiet, dark (often a problem in urban hotels), has decent beds. It provides a small kitchen in each room, though in mine there was barely enough room to stand in front of the sink. The refrigerator buzzed off and on all night, so I had to shut the doors to the galley kitchen area (which in turn made the area rather warm). The Seneca doesn't have minibars, which to me are just an annoyance, not a service. I had a hassle with my credit card checking in. The desk staff insisted that my credit card wasn't working. To keep my rate--which I'd reserved through Hot Rooms (which seemed to get better deals)-I had to go out and find enough cash to cover it. I was very concerned because the first night was much more expensive than the other three. It turned out that the credit card was fine--that the hotel had incorrectly entered some of my information. Good points of the Seneca: It's across the street from the John Hancock Bldg. and close to the shopping malls of Michigan Ave. (like many Chicago hotels). Inside the hotel are a good steakhouse, a mediocre deli and an American restaurant I didn't try. There are laundry facilities on many floors--the building is partially residential, which I like (makes me feel more like I'm really in the city). There were places where my room was shabby around the edges--it didn't feel like much work, for good or for ill, had been done since I was last there 10 years. I wound up on the 5th floor but you're unlikely to get a room, almost every building in the area is as tall or taller. The Seneca also had the best rate (through Hot Rooms) of any AAA approved hotel in downtown Chicago, except for a few chain motels.

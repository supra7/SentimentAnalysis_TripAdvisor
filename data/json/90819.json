I was not disappointed! The lobby was very clean, and the check-in process was efficient. The clerk was very friendly. It was so refreshing to open the door to my room on the third floor, and it had no stale odors, odd odors, or deodorizer smells. I am sensitive to odors and get headaches easily from deodorizer smells. My room smelled wonderfully clean and fresh! I felt comfortable immediately and knew I would rest well here. The room was very clean and well maintained. The bed was extremely comfortable. Towels and lighting were sufficient. There is a little store next to the check-in desk where you can buy sodas, candy, snacks, etc. The location is great--right near the Market Place Mall and other strip malls and big box stores. It is easily accessible from Interstate 74. The checkout process was also smooth. The clerk was very accommodating and held my luggage behind the desk for a couple of hours so that my things would not get hot in the car (The temperature was in the 90s) while I went down to the campus of the University of Illinois. I will definitely be staying here again when I go back to Champaign.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Myers, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGood Location - Hotel being renovated but not a problem\u201d", "Author": "miffie98", "ReviewID": "UR115733169", "Content": "We stayed here for just one night on our drive to Minnesota.

Have you ever been to a good hotel that had a manual door? Bed and Breakfast, yes, mainstay hotel, no. This door was not only manual but had a large piece of metal fringing from the bottom. It looked like it should of been replaced, but it stood there in glory. The room was pretty lame. There were no extra blankets or pillows, so that helped with the arctic air temps. The TV was old and needed replacement. The bathroom did have an operational fan. Good. The breakfast was pretty modest, I am sure across the parking lot at the Hilton Garden, that breakfast would of been better. The room did have a great view of the Hilton Garden. So, just to rub it in your face that your room and hotel were lame already, it really gave you the additional notice when you saw the building across the parking lot. The other hotel had a new lobby, ours did not. The cost of the room on a Sunday Night was still 99 bucks. The pool door had a sign that read something like , \"no one alone can use the pool room/pool\". Wow, that is great. This hotel is Lame, although most in Champaign probably are similar (cannot confirm, nor want to).", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fargo, North Dakota", "Title": "\u201cNot as good as it looks--but it does look very good\u201d", "Author": "NodakTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR32214127", "Content": "We stayed in Champaign partly as a stopping place for the night on a long driving trip, and partly because we are U of I alums. The Fairfield Inn had a pretty good price for advance reservations and it met our needs. The hotel was good, though not as good as it seems, if that makes sense: there were six pillows on each of two queen beds, but I used the pillows as cushions to sit on after my wife and sons had gone to sleep because there was no easy chair in the room (just two straight-back desk chairs). Each bed had a fancy-looking, 3-foot wide quilt strip stretched across the foot of the bed, but it was pretty useless for anything but appearances. That's what I mean by \"not as good as it seems\": it's trying to be fancy but once you look past the surface it's not really exceptional. It seemed to be a place where people going to conferences in town stayed, or folks in town to do business. For those purposes, and for our own, it was more than adequate and even quite good: comfortable beds, good breakfast (with waffles!), good internet connection. The staffer at the front desk was friendly and helpful. The pool worked well for our boys. The rooms are in good shape and thing seem relatively new or well kept up. It was quiet, but then again we were there on a Tuesday evening. It's a little out of the way, in a small street tucked around and back behind Prospect Ave. a couple of blocks. You can easily see it from the freeway, but getting there is a bit convoluted (again, not as good as it looks?). The largest shopping mall in town is just a couple blocks to the north.

We did not have any noise from either. It was a typical hotel room - nothing too fancy. It was clean and comfortable.

This hotel is located on the north end of Champaign and is an easy drive to the U of Illinois campus but you need at car to go anywhere from this location. The hotel was clean, looked to be fairly new and the room was fine but nothing special. The light blocking drapes were off the track and would not close completely but that was not really a big deal although it showed a little less than top level care of the facility. The two things that made me give this hotel a lower rating are small but they did differentiate this Fairfield from the Hampton we stayed at the previous night: 1) The breakfast closes at 9 am - and it was cleaned up by 9:15 so if you even wanted a glass of juice after 9, you were out of luck. (The Hampton had breakfast hours til 10.) 2) There is no fitness center at all in the hotel. I have come to expect at least a treadmill and a few weight machines but this hotel has NOTHING and there is no good place nearby for an outdoors walk or run. Overall, it was okay but if I go back to Champaign, I'll check some other properties before booking here again.

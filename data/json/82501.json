Santa Monica was the first choice but hotels there are very costly so I decided for Venice beach. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It is right on the beach front and major attractions at Venice. It is also close to Santa Monica. I chose the half seaview studio and it was ok. It had everything and the small kitchenette and utensils provide is a nice touch. The bath room is on the small side and bath amenities are basic, So best bring your own. The room was clean and bright. I had some problems with the TV though. I did not seem to get it to work. There is no car park at the hotel so you will need to park at the open car parks near by. There are a few and the charge around 20 dollars for overnight parking. A good option is you want to experience Venice Beach stay and something different.

If you don't have at least five body piercings, four tattoos and a crystal meth habit you will feel out of place here. It's a very grubby resort. The suites here are quite well appointed and the first impression of the rooms is that they are much nicer than the common parts of the hotel would suggest. However, there are a number of drawbacks that become evident! 1. The standard of the housekeeping is very poor. Don't be surprised if a few of your predecessors hairs remain in the basin and shower to greet you on your arrival. I recommend re-washing up any cup or utensile before you use it. 2. The bedding is old and grubby, don't look under the sheets at the matress if you want to sleep soundly. I was bitten by bedbugs on my first night and retreived two large blood swollen creatures from the bed the next morning. Manangement were very apologetic and offered to refund my remaining stay. It was President's Day weekend and I was very jet-lagged so I took up their offer to clean de-louse the room and I stayed. I was bitten again on my third and last night so the proceedure was clearly ineffective. 3. The walls are paper thin and the amourous activities of your neighbours across the corridor are clearly audible as are the fights down below between the homeless drug addicts who live on the streets of Venice. Although the hotel has a no smoking policy don't be surprised if the coridoors are perfumed with smell of residents enjoying the prescriptions of the many 'Medical Marajuana Doctors' who have set up shop along the broadwalk. I don't know if there is better to be had in Venice, but I would recommend moving up to Marina del Rey and finding something slightly cleaner and more conventional unless you have a strong need to be here, especially as this hotel is not that cheap given the drawbacks listed above.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBest location & best service\u201d", "Author": "Shanearn", "ReviewID": "UR123616381", "Content": "OK, like everyone else has written, you can't beat the location of this hotel - it's right on the boardwalk! This means you can walk out of your hotel and straight into the action that provides Venice Beach its attraction. My wife & I stayed here for 4 nights in January and at times found ourselves just sitting at the front of the building watching all the characters passing by. There are some great characters on the boardwalk. The rooms are quite small by comparison to almost any other hotel but nontheless well appointed with complete kitchen including fridge, coffee maker, cooking facilities and even the kitchen sink. The bed was very comfortable and the room provides quite a lot of storage space for hanging-up your clothes. Be aware that this is a boutique hotel, meaning that daily room cleaning is not provided so you need to ask receiption for new towels each day. The TV was ancient but provided more channels than you will ever need. If you're watching TV you're wasting time and missing out on the real attractions of Venice Beach! Above all else, including the location, is the excellent service provided by all the staff. From the time you arrive Andy (and the rest of the staff) make you feel like you've arrived home. I can honestly state that the genuine hospitality of everyone was the most generous we have received anywhere. The hotels goal is \"to exceed our guests' expectations at every opportunity\", and they certainly do. It's probably the only place we've ever stayed where you feel like giving the staff a hug, not just a handshake, when leaving. This was not our first visit to Venice Beach over the years but was our first stay at this hotel. We would now not stay anywhere else in L.A. and look forward to visiting again sometime soon.

A great guy to talk to about the history of the place. Also, the hotel really embraces its roots with great historic pictures all over the hotel. Bed`s could have been better, but they weren't bad.

I also seemed to have some wifi hic-cups and rather than blame my computer (which was probably the problem) they simply gave me the password to their office wifi so I could get on to that as it was less busy. I thought they were completely fantastic. The room was comfortable and homey and clean. I had everything I needed. They've made an attempt to funkify the bathroom and the kitchen was well stocked. I booked an Ocean Front room and had a 2nd floor perfect view of the beach. I was brilliant. To top it off they told me next time I come and stay to ensure that I tell them I am coming from Australia as they always try to organise early check in for Aussie's and Kiwi's coming straight from the plane.

Best in LA!\u201d", "Author": "Danthewrestler", "ReviewID": "UR119836111", "Content": "I write this review a couple of months after my trip. I've been busy. I'm sitting at home in the dull British Weather, feeling a little down, so what do I do to cheer myself up? I take my mind back to my recent trip to Venice Beach. Suddenly I'm smiling and sighing that I'm not there right now. I wrote a glowing review on Venice Beach Suites a few years ago. Will my third stay warrant another positive review or has the place lost it's magic? Lost its magic? It's mastered the book of spells! I've been staying here since 2005 and from Heart can say the place has gotten better with every trip. When I booked this trip I actually got a deal on a nother hotel just down the Boardwalk. It was a great deal so I booked that hotel. Uneasy and not content with that decision though a couple of days later I cancelled and booked with Venice Beach Suites. Suddenly I was content again and amped for my trip. Venice Beach Suites had never let me down on being THE place to stay in Venice and this visit was no different. Can you tell I love the place? The past two times I had stayed I had the same room, as I have a soft spot for that room I emailed the guys before leaving requesting the same room. When I arrived after the extremely warm welcome you receive in walking into the office, I was given the bad news. They could not accommodate my request for that particular room as the person in the room extended their stay. The bad news was cushioned though...a complimentary upgrade to their huge Ocean Front suite. When I walked in to the suite I had to go back downstairs to thank the guys again. All the rooms are great, but this one was phenomenal. Gestures like this aren't grounds to build a review around because it was a one off luxury...but wow was the one of luxury appreciated. The suite was huge, beautifully decorated, clean and the view out of this World. It's an old building...very old, but Andy and his team keep everything looking good and worthy of being in 2011. The staff, from the owner (Andy) all the way through to his Janitorial people are just great. Genuinely friendly, helpful, professional, talented and overall cool people to be around. You couldn't be made to feel more welcome and whatever you need is never too much trouble. Whilst a well oiled machine, the place really has a family feel to it unlike a more standard hotel chain. Location is very important when choosing somewhere to stay and it doesn't get much better than the location here. Venice Beach Suites is right on the Boardwalk and is positioned at a really good part of the Boardwalk, very central and right next to the Side Walk Cafe, which is a good landmark when meeting people etc. Once darkness falls on Venice, that Baywatch feel does disappear and for many the area may seem a little intimidating with homeless people and youths walking the boardwalk. That said though, in all the time I've stayed on Venice Beach I have never seen notable trouble, let alone been the victim of it. If you are the type to be a little spooked by the beach crazies at night then you'll be pleased to hear you feel very secure inside the hotel. Never is security even been the hint of an issue to me. Cost. It's hard to word this right. Is Venice Beach Suites so cheap you could find some change on the boardwalk and book a room for the night? No. There are cheaper hotels in the area. That said though there are far more expensive hotels that offer a lot less than Venice Beach Suites in the area too. Considering the location, the fact you get a suite rather just a room the cost is actually very reasonable for the area. You get what you pay for and in truth you get a great bang for your buck. I genuinely would not stay anywhere else when visiting Venice. The people, the rooms, the location, it all adds up to this hotel being a big part of amazing trips. The biggest compliment I can give is the fact I keep spending my hard earned money to return here. Could I find a critism? The only thing I could say is that this time there seemed to be less channels available on the TV. Previously it seemed the rooms were subscribed to a huge TV package. Is this a deal breaker? I think not, but going up a TV package again would be great. Maybe I need to get a life and not travel thousands of miles to watch TV?

Expect to walk at least 6 blocks from where you end up finding parking back to the hotel and possibly getting up at dawn to move your car depending on street sweeping schedules.

Just minutes from LAX airport and easy to find if you are driving. Very close to Santa Monica and handy for Hollywood and downtown. It is safe and relatively inexpensive.

Again on departure, we had a gap between check-out time and our flight, so they cheerfully watched our baggage for us again so we could spend a little more time on the beach.

I wanted to inform you of our dissatisfaction with the room we rented. The positives: The room was spacious and had a wonderful view of the ocean. The bathroom worked well, with a nice shower. The TV and the refridgerator were working. Our complaints stem from the facts which I will list: 1. I was charged over $700 for the three-night stay. 2. We had no parking at the lot I understood was used by your hotel for sending customers to; we were bluntly told, \"I have no parking for you. Come back in an hour.\" This was after traveling from Sacramento from the airport to check into a hotel. Come back in an hour? That was ridiculous. Needless to say, with the guy's attitude and smug arrogance, I didn't give him a dime, during our stay, for parking when there was room. I parked at the lot adjacent to it. 3. There was not a system for garbage disposal, despite there being a kitchenette. We had to call for our garbage to be taken out. 4. The burners did not work on the stove. 5. The water glasses had a rank odor from being left on a rubber mat for so long, they took on the mat's smell. 6. Our room's floor was covered with sand and being there was no maid service the entire time we were there, stayed there until I used a hand towel to mop with (there was no broom or mop available.) We only strolled briefly on the beach and there wasn't sand on our shoes. 7. We had to call for new towels, washcloths for each day we stayed there. We are clean people and we bathe every day. We expected to have daily bath linens provided without having to call for them. 8. The venetian blind on the ocean-vew window would not close completely to allow sleeping in without bright sunshine. I had to insist the caretaker fix it, based on the cost of the room, because he originally told me that was the way it was. 9. Frankly, I am amazed you are still in business, because, we have stayed in Motel 6 hotels, and other economy motels and they provide daily maid service. And, I haven't paid over $700 to stay in their room! I have not recommended your hotel to anyone who asks, unless they do not care about no maid service and a minimum of services provided.

We discovered it (actually our friends did) about 2 years ago. If we had the time and money, we would make the 6 hour trek from Phoenix more often! The hotel's location could not be better. It is right on the boardwalk (promenade) -- in fact, right in the heart of the action. The rooms overlooking the boardwalk (and beach/ocean) are more expensive, but worth the splurge in my opinion. (I have to admit there is a selfish side to me that wants to keep this a secret, so the rooms will more likely be available next time I want to book them!) The rooms are sufficiently clean and the kitchens are well-stocked. A couple of years ago, there were some minor repair issues, but the owners seem to be on top of things now. Besides the ideal location, the other wonderful thing about Venice Beach Suites is (are) the proprietors, or office staff or whatever they are. I just know that I have repeatedly interfaced with the same three people in person or on the phone, and all have been great. They go out of their way to accommodate their guests. Plus there are nice little perks, such as a bottle of wine in the room. We even got a follow-up thank you card after our first visit. I notice the vast majority of the reviews of this place have been very positive. There were a couple of negative reviews also, and I cannot help but wonder whether the reviewers knew what they were in for. I should point out that Venice (and the hotel) are probably not for everyone. This will not be your pristine Sheraton-on-a-quiet-family-oriented-beach experience. This is Venice Beach. It is crowded, especially on weekends, and parking spaces are at a premium. (The lot won't accommodate big vehicles, and you may have to drive a while before you find street parking. But once you park your car, you can relax and enjoy the rest of your stay on foot.) There are bums and loonies on the boardwalk and beach. Also entertainers, vendors, and people who dress funny. The stores are quirky, and sometimes risqu\u00c3\u00a9. Venice Beach is a little less clean than neighboring Santa Monica, and a lot less commercialized. (You'll find very few chain restaurants in Venice.) This is its appeal. I have not known it to be unsafe (I think the police crack down on locals who bother the tourists). But it's also not a sheltered slice of Leave-It-To-Beaver America. To summarize, Venice Beach is a funky, crowded, noisy adventure (at least from late morning to sunset).

Room 108 was large and had a more modern shower, but was inside the back door and had a lot of noise of people coming in and out the door. There was no view from this room. Room 207 was an OK size room with a ball-and-claw bathtub. It also had no view. They could improve this hotel significantly just by replacing the sheets, towels and bedspreads and adding a few coats of paint. Bigger bathroom sinks would also be a plus.

And while I usually find Tripadvisor to be completely accurate, I don't understand how this dingy place could get such great reviews. On the plus side: the management is truly very nice, and the location is right by the beach. But that's about it. Someone here mentioned how the building was recently renovated. We couldn't find a trace of that. The walls had the paint of the last 60 years stuck to them, the floors in the bathrooms were old and crusty (although cleaned by the staff, but that only helps so much), the tub in our room was ancient, the sinks are the size of a deck of cards, so water splashes everywhere when you wash. The dishes in the kitchen are clean, but the appliances are old and look beaten up. And not all rooms are equal, as we noticed when we peeked into someone else's. Some have nice views, it seems. It's not that things are dirty. The staff clearly cleans the place. But everything is so old and worn, every second it reminds you of the thousands of people who must have been there before you. Example: while our sheets were clean and smelled fresh, they had stains on them that hadn't some out. Of what, I can only guess. If it hadn't been for the very nice management (yes, they give you a bottle of wine when you check in and have a personal note waiting for you in your room), I would categorize this \"hotel\" as a very budget place. The location is also in a more dangerous part of Venice, for which the hotel cannot be faulted, but that's something to think about when booking.

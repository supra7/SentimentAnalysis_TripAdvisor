If you've eaten at HIE before, the cinnamon rolls are hot and ready. Plenty of coffee at breakfast and 24/7 by the front desk. Priority members receive a small gift bag upon arrival. The free coffee 24/7 was nice since I wake up much earlier than breakfast serving time (6am). Two newspapers are available first come first serve, USA Today and the local paper. Food items include the juice bar, pancake maker (flat, no taste), eggs (avoid), biscuits were okay, the gravy helps a little. Includes sausage and egg omelet (tasty, not bad at all), milk and cereals, boiled eggs, amd yogurt. Nothing really impressive to write home about except the coffee with favored creamers and the warm cinnamon rolls. The king bed room was huge, the bathroom was the largest of all HIEs we've been in. The jacuzzi was a nice touch, including the TV on the wall. The refrigerator came in handy for cold drinks and leftovers.

I was curious and went to inspect what she had left there only to find out it was a marijuana pipe, lighter, and a contact case...very strange.

The rooms are smallish but very nicely furnished with new carpet. The heating and cooling is very good and you can set it to your comfort on the individual unit. There is a good breakfast which is more than a continental offering and free WiFi. The staff were nice to work with but the check in staff when I arrived around 1 PM seemed frazzled and a bit frantic. My room was not available when I checked in and I had to wait about an hour. Communication between the front desk and the housekeeping supervisor seems poor. This was an OK Holiday Inn Express to stay at and the condition of the facility was nice and clean, but this hotel has little ambiance and feels very cramped.

She emailed us one of the room info with the reservation # given by the hotel and our names under the reservation. When I got there right around 3pm, the check-in time, I gave them my name, my friend's name, and the reservation #. They looked it up and told me it's already being occupied by someone else, who's name I recognize as one of the people in our party. She tells me that since the reservation # is already used and that our name wasn't even on their system, she can't assign me another room because not everyone has checked in yet. This was all done next to whom I found out was their manager, who could care less what was going on. The two women had no desire to help or offer another option. It was one of the worst attitudes I've ever encountered when it comes to the hotel check-in process. Luckily, my friend who made all the reservations arrived 15 minutes later so she had all the printed confirmation with her. It turned out the hotel screwed up on the reservation and assigned the same, exact reservation # to two sets of different people! Of course by then, the manager already left so there was no accountability. Anyway, on to the hotel itself. It's not bad, but it is located next to the freeway so it can be a little noisy if your room is on the side of the freeway (which ours was). The room is actually a good size with comfortable beds and linen. The TV wasn't plugged in all the way so we had to figure out what was wrong with it for a few minutes. They have a nice size mini-frig and microwave. The shower had good water pressure although the toilet takes forever to flush. They gave three bath towels and three face towels, but no hand towels though. This is the first hotel I've ever been to that doesn't have all three sizes of towels. Standard soaps and shampoo and conditioner. The free breakfast was nice, had yogurts, bananas, juice, cereal, biscuits, gravy, sausage patty, and egg with melted cheese in it already. Also bagels/other breads and a machine to make pancakes. They also have a 24-hour snack shop that's pretty convenient. We didn't use the internet or wireless access but that's also available. Their pool is sort of small and their jacuzzi smaller but they open late. The workout room also has some nice machines to get a good workout. Parking is kind of odd especially when first parking to register. Since it's one way, you have to leave the hotel and make a u-turn to turn back into the driveway to park underground. The elevator to the rooms are accessed by the room keys but since the doors to the inside hallway aren't locked, you can still walk up the stairs to get inside. It's not a bad value (we paid $99 pretax) per night since it comes with breakfast but the horrible check-in episode totally soured the whole thing for me.

One of the lovely things about staying in a hotel is drawing the drapes and shutting out the light and there is no way to shut it out here. I ended up stacking my pillows up on one side of the bed to kind of block some of the light from the bed but it didn't really work. Stupidest window dressing I've ever seen in a hotel.

Upon returning to our room, I noticed that our desk was covered with ants. I thought perhaps something was spilled, but when I went over to our nightstand, that too was crawling with ants. We called the front desk immediately and they did tell us to pack our things and come right down to the front desk. However, they put us in a room right next door to where we had been (where we actually found 3 more ants) and weren't exactly apologetic about the situation. The gentleman at the front desk only apologized after we actually showed him pictures we took. We felt that could have been handled a bit better. -Both the first room and our new room smelled old and musty. We tried to open our windows and turn on the air conditioning, but every time we returned to our room it still smelled pretty gross. -The shower heads were extremely low making for an uncomfortable shower. I am 5'7 and the shower head hit me at mid-forehead. I did not have it as bad as my 6'3 husband however! -I tried out the fitness center one day, hoping to run a bit on the treadmill. However, there was a big dip right in the middle of the running belt, which not only made it impossible to run, but also quite dangerous for anyone who tried. -We did have the continental breakfast every morning. Two complaints about this: 1. The toaster was extremely SLOW and didn't function very well. It literally took 8 minutes to toast a piece of toast. 2. To add to this, one morning a woman in a Comfort Inn uniform was using the toaster to make her own breakfast, so all of the guests had to wait until she was done to use it.

We were on a strict budget, but didn't want to sacrifice safety or location. This hotel is a great compromise for those who want a lower priced room and a decent location. It's not in the heart of the city, but pretty darn close and a great price. At first glance we were a little hesitant about the hotel. It is in an old neighborhood, there was a good amount of construction, and it's literally right next to the freeway. However, even when walking many blocks to Old Town at night, we felt safe. The underground parking was secure and FREE which is a plus in San Diego. Also, the elevator and all hotel entrances required a room key to access which made us feel secure.The windows overlooking the freeway were thick and there was little noise. I can't say much for the view, but we didn't come to San Diego to look out of our hotel window, so we didn't care. The fridge and microwave were great since we brought snacks and were able to store leftovers. The hot tub was wonderful and deserted (at least when we were there). The room and premises were very clean and the breakfast was adequate but nothing special. The 24-hr \"store\" was a great help when my husband got sick in the middle of the night, though the prices are about as high as any convenience store. The staff was very friendly, and the business center, although small, came in handy when we wanted to research local activities. The walk to Old Town may be daunting for some (about 15-20 min) but was ok for us since we're pretty active people. The drive to downtown and the oceanfront was VERY quick and easy. Balboa park was also only a 10min drive. We had a corner room and so the noise level in the hotel did not bother us.

The patio area outside the entrance overlooked Pacific Highway, which was a bit noisy, but there was a great view of the airport and the downtown area. The rooms on the freeway side of the building were relatively quiet. I only heard the train whistles from time to time during the night. Parking was enclosed and free. The price was right. Overall, it was a nice, well-maintained place in a convenient location with helpful people, a nice view, and free parking.

We had the 2 bedroom, 2 queen bed suite. The pics on the website are a little different than the actual room. You walk in the door and are you in a bedroom. There is a small living area to your left and another bed just steps from that. This area really looks like one big bedroom with a couch in it. Two very large doors close this area off, which is nice, but the bathroom is to your right, so everyone has to pass by the 1st bedroom area to get to it. It is huge, with a large glass shower with a place to sit and a Jacuzzi tub. The counter is quite long with 2 sinks. Each bedroom area has a closet, one with a full size ironing board and iron. There's a TV in each bedroom( only one has a flat panel) and a nice balcony with a small table and 2 chairs outside. Unfortunately, the freeway right outside makes the outdoors very noisy. The hotel is right across from the airport and MCRD. You can see them from the balcony. Once we figured out the streets, getting to the airport, MCRD, the harbor, and Mission Beach, was a piece of cake. They have an airport shuttle and a shuttle to MCRD. We did not use the shuttles, as we had rented a car. MCRD is literally around the corner, under the freeway, probably 1.5 miles from the hotel. The street you turn down to MCRD takes you right to gate #5, which is the entrance you have to go through. It couldn't be simpler. Old Town, which is just a small neighborhood, is straight down the road that the hotel is on. You could walk down to it, as we saw some people doing. As I stated, this hotel backs to the freeway and it is quite noisy outside. They have a nice outdoor patio, but again, the noisy freeway puts a damper on sitting outside. We were not bothered by the noise in our room. The front staff was very friendly and helpful. Ask for directions to things and they will give you a written sheet with directions to the beaches, harbor, MCRD, Sea World, ect.. The hotel has a nice little store inside with food, drinks, personal items, not badly priced. The pool was small and we didn't use it. They have a nice outdoor hot tub. The hotel is convenient to the I-5 Freeway onramp, which you will use to go to Mission Beach and DT San Diego. It really is conveniently located. Everything in San Diego is pretty easy to get to and everything is close together. You can drive down to the beach in about 15 minutes. Of course, we were there sort of off season. In Old Town, eat at the Rocking Baja Coastal Cantina. It was fabulous. Not much from outside, but excellent inside. The Old Town Mexican Cafe was no better than what we get here in CO. If you go to the harbor, have change for the parking meters. I highly recommend this hotel. It was very clean and open and felt very tropical. Our AC worked great. As I said, the desk people were great. We asked for extra soap and towels everyday and got them without a fuss.

We found that it was a brilliant place to stay. As our trip was based around staying at budget accomadation where possible(hostels, campgrounds) we found that the extra we paid to stay here was well worth it. First of all a great plus for us was the fact tht they had free internet on 2 computers in the lobby. Though there were only 2 computers but i found they were barely ever occupied and could get on it when ever i wanted. Second was free continental breakfast with wafles if you could be bothered making them in the wafle machines(i dont fancy them so i stuck to cereal, toast and bagels). Coupled to this was the fact there was a little general food and amenities store in the lobby that had everything from beer, sandwiches, soap, crisps, etc. It was open at all hours as you took the items and paid for them at the front desk of the hotel. There is also a laundry and clothes dryers that you can use for a few quarters. The location was definitly the best thing about the place. Oldtown was only about an 800m walk to the west, were there was an assortment of bars/restaurants(mainly mexican) and shops. By far we found the Coyote Cafe our favourite and went there 3 nights for Tea. Also in Oldtown was the bus terminal where we could get on a bus and go to Seaworld, Ocean Beach, Mission and Pacific Beach, or jump on the trolley(train) to get into downtown Sandiego. From downtown San Diego it was then just a bus trip to the San Diego Zoo or a walk down to the foreshore area where all the ship museams and the USS Midway is. If you didnt want to walk into Oldtown to get the trolly into downtown S.D, there is a closer station to the Comfort Inn called Washington. The people at the front desk can provide you with a print out on directions to get to pretty much all the touristy places and public transport routes. As for the room we found them to be great. Had a fridge, a/c, microwave, cable t.v and really comfotable bed. There was also a pool and a spa/jaccuzi if you feel like having a swim.

Our room faced the freeway and we weren't bothered at all by the slight noise that came in - the hotel has renovated the windows with extra inserts to shield the noise, and we both had no trouble at all sleeping. The free wireless internet in the room was great, as was the plasma screen tv on the wall with a large selection of channels plus HBO. The king size bed was more comfortable than our own bed at home! I've never been able to say that about a hotel bed, but this one was springy and had a plush top - very nice. Our room had an in-room safe that was shoulder level - all other places put them on the floor so you have to bend way down to get at them, or don't have them at all in the rooms. The refrigerator allowed me to keep my special milk cold so that I could bring it down to have at breakfast each day. We used the microwave to heat some leftovers when we got hungry one night. While we were there, we could see maintenance people working on some rooms doing some minor repair/improvements during the day, so there is ongoing care given to maintaining this hotel. There's a 24 hour store in the lobby that has just about anything you could want in a pinch. The breakfast was great and had a large variety of food available which was kept well stocked. We were able to get a table every morning, but at crowded times you may have to bring up your food to your room on a tray. The hot tub was clean and nice and hot - and open 24 hours. The pool was heated so well that we were able to swim comfortably even though the outside temps were in the 50's, and it was open until 10 pm which allowed us to sightsee all day and then finish the day with a relaxing swim. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly, including the drivers we had (Alex and Rocky) for the van that shuttled us to and from the airport. Some of the staff would converse a little more with us than others, but they were still all helpful. We didn't rent a car; we took advantage of the public transportation system and found it worked very, very well. It was a 7 minute walk to a trolley stop and a 15 minute walk to the Transit Center in Old Town from the hotel. Just a note that the walk from the trolley stop back to the hotel at night was kind of creepy, as one of the roads wasn't well lit, so we avoided that area at night.

With a push of a button on the remote it becomes a 32\" plasma computer monitor. There is free wireless & wired high speed internet access, a 24 hour deli/shop in the hotel, a free all you can eat breakfast buffet and a trolley stop just a few blocks away. And this free breakfast isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a muffin and warm orange juice like other places. They had everything you could want. They even had a waffle maker set up so you could make your own fresh waffles. The room and bathroom looked recently remodeled. They both were very modern, nice, and big. The staff were all very friendly. When I asked how to get to the trolley stop they pulled a big color map out and gave it to me. It showed all the tourist spots and they even drew a path on it to show me how to get from the hotel to the trolley station. Above and beyond what most hotels would do. Most would just point and say \"Go down that way and turn right\". For complaints mentioned in other reviews about the noise: my window was so close to I-5 I could almost touch the cars, and I had no noise issues. The windows must be soundproof. I also had the A/C on all the time. If you have it on, even just on the low or the fan setting, you should not have any problems either. The hotel isn't in the best neighborhood in San Diego, but I never felt unsafe walking around. I had a great view of the San Diego skyline from my window and of the airport right across I-5. You are just 1 trolley stop away from the very nice Old Town area done up to look like the old west, and just a few trolley stops away from the San Diego waterfront with all the historic ships to visit and shopping at Seaport Village. I recommend this hotel if you are looking for an inexpensive, clean place to stay which is close to a trolley stop. This provides you easy access to all the other places in San Diego you might want to visit. You can even get on the trolley and go all the way down to the US-Mexico border and walk into Tijuana.

It's long, but you get a bunch of facts when you're new to this location and really want to know as much as you can! I'll try to keep this brief and at the same time, informative. We'd never stayed here before and basically chose this hotel because of price, location, and an average of the previous reviews. The biggest standout of those 3 is definitely the location. You'll find yourself very near everything that San Diego has to offer. However, in our opinion, not close enough that \"walking\" is always an option. Have car...will need it to travel. The area around the hotel as you arrive doesn't look great, but rebuilding is taking place. Enjoy \"riding\" the nearby steep roads as a thrill if you're not used to it. Some have criticized the parking...the re-marking of the main floor parking lot confuses the real spots. They're fine! Sheesh...don't be so fussy! And decent parking below with sufficient room for even this \"larger than average\" fella. The hotel looks fine, grounds are clean, building appears freshly painted and well maintained. Lobby is bright and welcoming. Dave at the front desk was EXTREMELY helpful switching us rooms. Problem with the first one? No...we just wanted to be closer to the central area of the hotel. Even provided an early morning \"check-in\" as we arrived during \"check-out\" time. They say the windows have been upgraded to deal with the highway noise issue. At first...the noise is noticeable. But pretend it doesn't really bother you, turn the a/c fan on, and it really isn't that awful. If you're a light sleeper or internally affected by highway noise, ask for a hill-side room or keep on truckin'. Breakfast was decent...fresh, varied items from breads, to pastries, to fruit, juices, milk, cereals, waffles and so on. The other guests generally seem pleasant. You'll find that in the cruisers that are staying a night pre-sail-off. Not enough tables in the breakfast area creates new friends and shared spaces. The rooms are decently sized for short stays, and functional. Some items like out-dated furniture or appointments, are starkly contrasted by the massive HDTV and computer system INCLUDED! Whoa! Wireless throughout the hotel and in the room is complimentary! And so what if the room isn't chi-chi. You're not on vacation to stay IN the room, are you?! Get over it...it's a Comfort Inn, you're not spending a whole lot of money, and you're probably not staying all that long. \"Deli\" is more like an emergency hunger saver, and there's definitely enough sundries and snacks in the lil store. Just expect to pay a slightly higher premium for that kind of convenience. The only real negative thing I have to say is...and this is even worse than the occasional spot of cracked grout or other-than-purely-white cocking in the bathroom...and that is...ants. Weird as weird...there seems to be a few more ants than I'm comfortable with. I'll mention something in the morning, but it's not the worst thing I've ever dealt with. So, overall, I'd give this short-stay-rest-your-weary-eyes place, a 3.5...strong 3.5. We'd definitely stay here again, so long as the price is right...and today, it was.

I basically had to unload all their luggage for the evening myself, although there were bell hops around. That was fine. However, after unloading all the luggage from the motorhome, which was around 6:00ish, I came back to the room to find a flood in the bathroom of our room downstairs. By this time, I had already plugged in all my electronic equipment, i.e. Blue Tooth earpiece, Treo 650, Sony camcorder, etc. These things were placed on the floor and wherever I can find an extra plug -- which was right outside the bathroom and in the bathroom. When I asked for help, all that I was told was that they were short-handed and we would have to wait for someone to come up and apply towels to dry up the spill. OH, BUT FIRST, not after I had to stand by to hear all the accusations -- \"someone must have put too much paper down the toilet\", \"someone put something that didn't belong\", \"this happens to people in their own homes\", \"what do you want us to do about it?\" and so on . . . After having to remind myself that I didn't need to explain or apologize for something we did not do (after careful investigation), I requested another room, which should have just been offered in the first place, without any accusations. The next morning I asked to speak with the Supervisor, which I did, and she also was very defensive and stated \"We put you in another room! There is nothing else we can do.\" I reminded her that I had to request another room it was not offered, only after hearing all the accusations and how they didn't have time to help out. I don't know who sets the tone there at this location, but it was the worst experience I ever had at a Comfort Inn. I have traveled since I was 15 years old and I am 45 years old, I thought your staff was lazy and they sure have a chip on their shoulder. I was told afterwards, by the \"Supervisor\" that she would discount my room by 20%, which I haven't seen on my credit card as of yet. Not only am I posting this review on TripAdvisor, but I will also send out this negative information to all my 2,000 data-based clients. Truly a horrible experience.

But the drapes dampened the noise quite a bit and having the air conditioner on high speed helped even more. It didn't disturb our sleep at all, and we're not heavy sleepers. Other than that, there was absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel, at least for our purposes. We weren't there to swim or spend time in the hotel, so we were there only in the evenings and to sleep. Room was very comfortable with both a small fridge and microwave. The \"continental\" breakfast was better than most other Comfort Inns we've stayed at. They had the standard waffle machines, but their large selection of pastries and fruits was wonderful. I thought maybe they had a special breakfast for Sundays (which was our first morning there), but it was just their standard fare. There was a slight glitch in the room charge at first, because I had received a different rate than what was showing up on their computer. But they called the home office, which verified my rate and it was cleared up quickly. The two gals on duty when we checked in were very friendly and helpful and joked around with us. Our room was ready when we arrived. By the way, the large bowl of apples that they always have at the front desk for their guests is a nice touch. They also have a well-stocked convenience store there in the lobby which is open 24 hours. Since there is no restaurant on the premises, it was nice to have when the munchies hit later in the evening. Guests charge \"reasonably priced\" purchases to their room. Since we always travel with a lap top, the free wi-fi in the room was appreciated. The hotel, although not in the upscale part of town, was conveniently located to most of the attractions. We had a rental car, so proximity to public transportation was not a factor for us. The parking garage was under the hotel, well lit and reasonably secure. Neither of us felt unsafe at any time. If you're looking for a posh hotel, go downtown to the Hyatt. But if you're looking for a comfortable, affordable hotel, I'd recommend this one.

Stayed at this hotel, as many others have, as it was close to Marine graduation. Big deal. I would have rather traveled 50 miles that morning, than to have experienced this hotel. Number 1: We had to wait over an hour for our room to be ready, in spite of them having our reservation for weeks (in other words, they knew we were coming.) Then, we were informed very rudely that \"well, you know these rooms take 2 hours to clean!!\") They offered NO compensation whatsoever...no discount, no future stay at a Comfort Inn, no complimentary anything, not even an apology. 2. The clerks - every single one of them - had major attitudes. As if THEY were doing us a favor by \"giving\" us a room we had paid for!! The three girls that morning - very rude and not apologetic whatsoever for the fact that our room was not ready, and that we had to wait over an hour. My son arrived a little later, and was also treated rudely when he merely asked for a copy of his key to the room. The following morning when we checked out, more rudeness by the two front desk personnel. Obviously, NO customer service training whatsoever (Note: I worked for Hyatt Hotels for over 8 years, and have also been an avid traveler all my life, so this is not acceptable behavior from ANY hotel personnel, I am fully aware what customer service looks and feels like.) The sad thing is, my entire family - total of 6 rooms - were booked at this hotel, and not one of my 12 family members had a positive word to say about this hotel and its personnel and/or rooms. 3. The room was absolutely horrible. Cigarette butts visible on the ledges outside; cigarette burns in the carpet; Even the note pads were used and had water stains and were warped - such an easy thing to remedy. But the WORST thing was the EXTREME NOISE. Right on top of the very heavily traveled freeway, impossible to sleep, really impossible. So, unless you want to stay up and party all night and get no sleep at all, go ahead and book your room at this undesirable (understatement) establishment.

The desk clerk who had denied my reservation was middle eastern and named Said. He was fully aware that I was in town for my son's graduation and his attitude and conversation indicated his hostility towards military and Americans. He also knew that most hotels in the area were full due to the graduation and my finding another room would be difficult. After this event I confronted the staff at the hotel about this and talked to Said in person where he denied ever talking to me at all - then in another conversation he claimed he had told me he had my reservation and the room was waiting.

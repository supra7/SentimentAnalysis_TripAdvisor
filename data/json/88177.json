Rachel Miller, the night manager on duty, had left a message telling me someone had turned in a \"lost and found\" item, and to please return her call. Instantly, I thought \"impossible.., no way.\" When I called Rachel, she politely asked me a series of questions to assure the lost \"item\" indeed belonged to me. Honestly, I'm still dumbstruck by the entire thing. A person who turns in cash is, without question, someone with incredible integrity. Sylvia is a true credit to the Sheraton corporation and is to be commended in the highest possible way.

Again, a true credit to the company. As to the hotel facilities... I've found the rooms to be completely comfortable, attractive and well-appointed. The beds are VERY comfortable. As a fitness buff, something very important to me is exercise facilities. The one here is among the best I've ever experienced anywhere. Nice number of machines, roomy, good temp. A+.

The lobby is great with plenty of areas to hang out and lots of computers with free internet. Went to desk and the front desk agent was not very personable.

After living in the south for 14 years I never understood the term \"southern charm\" as many people are transplants.

Anyway back to the hotel. The front desk person didn't speak much and usually they like to explain all the hotel has to offer (heated pool, fitness area, connected to a mall) but it seems he didn't feel the need to do that. Had a room on 4th floor and the elevator and 4th floor both smelled like vomit. When we mentioned it the next day it was met with that noone else mentioned it. How about coming with us and seeing if we might just be crazy but when my own kids are covering their noses we knew were sane. The rooms were nice and met our needs. Having used priceline we could not complain. Parking was free which is a huge plus.The surrounding area is nice with lots of shopping and lots of big name chain restaurants (good small local breakfast one next to hotel called Patachou). Indy is comprised of some nice neighborhoods and areas to visit (Broad Ripple, Massachusetts Ave, Zoo and White River Park area) but they are all incovenient to get to. A 10 mile drive takes 30 minutes. So if you are here to visit the town best bet is stay downtown.

My wife and I arrived very late on a night in early May - after 1am - due to a long drive from Tennessee on our way home. When checking in, the lobby is amazing. Shiny, new, modern. Good feelings happening. The guy running the front desk, I think his name tag said he was the front desk leader/supervisor to that effect told us he \"upgraded\" us to a suite. Our suite was located in the 2nd tower, the tower the lobby is not located in. As we were dragging our luggage clear across town to get to the other tower, we noticed the change in decor. Gone was the shiny modern look and in came an average, somewhat dated looking atmosphere. When we got to our room, we could see that it was technically a suite, however, this tower was apparantly not part of the \"$17 million renovation\" the hotel boasts on its website. This room was tired. Old worn-out 1980's furniture, CRT televisions - heck, even the mini-fridge had fake wood paneling on the front. Now you know you haven't seen that since 1987! Now I will concede that the room was spacious and clean, which says a lot when you are going for the cheap. There was a living room, which included a sofa, some chairs, a desk, and a bar area with bar sink and the mini-fridge. The bed was in a separate bedroom and was comfortable. I was a bit worried the bed was as old as everything else, but it seemed the mattress had to have been replaced at some point. The room was cold so we had to turn on the heat in the bedroom, which smelled for awhile. Maybe it hadn't been used recently. Perhaps they reserve these rooms for people who Priceline a 3.5 star hotel at the last minute for $60 a night. But this really feels like two different hotels - one 3.5 stars and one 2.5 stars. If you find yourself booked in this hotel, whether by choice or by chance, do yourself a favor and turn down the \"upgrade\" and specifically ask for a remodeled non-upgraded room. Hopefully you'll be luckier than we were. Parking is free in a garage next door, but is is no where near the front desk for checking in and out.

I called the front desk and was \"upgraded\" to a jr. suite - although a million times better than the last room (hooray - no stains!), it still had the peeling wallpaper and gross carpet. I didn't want to touch anything for fear I'd get some kind of disease. I know the hotel is going through a massive renovation, but really? it can't be that difficult to touch it up - it honestly looked like nothing had been done in a good 20 years. stay far away until the hotel is finished - after that, I'm sure it will be very nice. the one positive is that it's directly attached to a mall so I could just walk to shopping/restaurants. but that still doesn't make up for the disgusting room(s).", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Ramon, California", "Title": "\u201cSeriously unimpressive . . . and I'm usually fairly easy to please\u201d", "Author": "kwa829", "ReviewID": "UR88107514", "Content": "I was disappointed in this property. If you read other tripadvisor reviews I have submitted, you see I tend to be fairly positive and easy-to-please, so my review is NOT the case of some overly picky nitpicker who gives 1 star because the shampoo is not to their liking. * The public areas looked very dated and worn. * The elevators resembled freight elevators, with abundant scratches and dents all over the woodwork and railings. * Carpeting in the hallways and elevators in atrocious condition, not unlike a carpeted subway car. * The lower levels present an utterly confusing maze , inclusive of a massive amount of convention and conference space (through which one must navigate from parking garage to registration, and again from registration to room) laid out in strange triangular patterns - i.e., hallways not at right angles - that causes one to utterly lose one's sense of place and direction. There are maps posted, but they do NOT have \"you are here\" indicators and it was impossible to tell how the maps were oriented vis-a-vis the direction I was looking. I'm a pretty good navigator with a pretty good \"internal sense of direction\", and I was baffled. * It took me about 15 minutes to locate my room. I was unaware that there were multiple \"towers\". There is no signage that directs guests from registration to their tower by room number. One of the tower elevator banks indicated something like \"rooms 250-1299\" (or something like that); I had room 503 (or whatever it was). 503 is between 250 and 1299, but this was the wrong tower. I guess one of the towers must have been for rooms with last two digits 50 or higher. Management, could you make this more clear? * The first time I left my room to go downstairs, I got on the elevator and pushed \"1\". The elevator went down to 1 and then did not open (Later I was able to surmise that this may have been due to construction on \"1\"). I then realized that you have to go to \"2\" to get out (and then subsequently go down to 1 by means of a stairway or separate elevator bank). But it is somewhat disconcerting to have an elevator door not open as expected. You'd think they could put up a sign to this effect and disable the \"1\" button. * The remote control for my TV was completely dead. After I called the front desk, it took 45 minutes for someone to deliver a replacement (perhaps they could have told me it would take 45 minutes, but invite me to come down to the desk myself if I wanted it sooner). On the plus side: * Once I was in the room, I found the room to be fairly decent . . . fresh clean bedding and linens, spacious bathroom, comfortable bed. * The in-room internet conection ($9.95 per day) is NOT wireless, but they supply the ethernet cable and was actually a fairly good, fast connection by hotel standards. * Other than the worn carpeting and dings and dents everywhere, the hotel did NOT seem \"dirty\" . . . i.e., no dust, no gross stains. IN other words, the poor condition was of a physical, not sanitary nature. * The hotel is connected by indoor passageway to a sizable adjacent shopping mall, providing a nice climate-controlled, safe means of getting out for a little evening leg-stretching. * The hotel provides free parking. * There is a fitness center (but it will take some work to find it as there is no directional signage leading to it).

It is extremely outdated and doesn't belong in the area that it represents. My family spent the last 3 days at this hotel and after our visit will never stay at another Sheraton property unless it is new. We were very disappointed. If we weren't a part of a group for our family reunion we definitely would have relocated to another hotel. It was a disaster from the moment we walked into our first room and downhill from there. The first room that we had was full of gnats as well as terribly worn carpeting and furniture. The bathroom toilet didn't have a handle on it and the toilet was dirty. These issues were immediately corrected so I must give them credit for this. We attempted to stay in this room even going to the local store to buy some Raid to get rid of the bugs. After spraying the room and leaving for a few hours upon our return the gnats had gotten worse. We finally had to get another room. The next room was better however the carpeting and furniture was worn. The bathroom was not clean and when we pulled out the sleeper couch the comforter was extremely soiled. The bathroom sink developed a slow drain towards the end of our stay and we began to see gnats in this room as well. I did see a hole in the roof near the sprinkler head - this may be the culprit for the gnats. During the first night of sleeping the air conditioning system made loud clanging noises and a high pitched hissing sound. We had to turn the system off in the main bedroom for the remainder of our stay so that we could get a good night's sleep. Fortunately it was cool enough outside during our visit that we didn't really need the air. Another one of our reunion participants had to change their room due to water leaking from the floor above into their shower. This water actually got onto the guest as she was showering. They were moved o another room as well. In the lobby they had a section showing their impending renovations - this can't happen soon enough. Until the renovations happen, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worse enemy. I must say however the front desk supervisor was very polite and helpful in trying to resolve issues. She didn't offer a discount on the rooms or any type of voucher for all of the inconveniencies.

As always, before I go anywhere I review the Hotel / Resort because I don't like surprises. Let me clarify that, I don't like BAD surprises and that's what I expected after reading all of the previous reviews. I must say that this hotel exceeded my expectations in every category. I had a suite on the 5th floor facing the Fashion Mall. The room was restocked and cleaned every day and everything was in perfect working order. There was plenty of hot water when I needed it, with plenty of water pressure. The bed was very comfortable having a thick quilted mattress cover and a thick but not too heavy comforter. Bedding was crisp and clean. TV selections, at least for me, left something to be desired, but with the extracurricular activities scheduled by Roche, and spending time with colleagues it really didn't matter much. FOOD: The food at the Sheraton was very good. The breakfast buffet had fresh fruit, eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes and pancakes. I enjoyed a hearty breakfast every morning with a couple of really good cups of coffee. I also had dinner at the lobby bar two nights and ordered room service the another two nights. Some of the items I really enjoyed were the fried calamari, Cobb salad with ahi tuna and grilled shrimp, various types of sliders, an excellent burger and a very nice New York strip steaks perfectly cooked. Some of these items were room service including the steak and all arrived in less than 20 min. and all were fresh and hot. STAFF: Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful. The front desk was efficient and was able to make my stay trouble free. Restaurant personnel were attentive and very polite and bent over backwards to grant your requests. At this point I need to mention two of the restaurant staff who deserve a pat on the back. First there was Chelsea in the lobby bar who made me feel at home my first night, with suggestions from the menu and Krissy who was our server during our Roche sponsored evening get together dinner. All of the nice Latina waitresses who delivered room service were efficient and polite and never failed to ask if there was any thing that needed attention. The hotel is attached to the Fashion Mall at Keystone Crossing in case you need something during your stay. There are several restaurants in the mall. Roche treated us to a dinner at Maggiano's Little Italy, where we enjoyed a family style Italian dinner. I must thank my host, Roche Diagnostics for making the training session and the stay in Indy as pleasant as it could be. Hello to the c311 instructors, Todd, Lori and Lauren, thanks for everything.

We got checked in, went to the 3rd floor and when we got off the elevator, there were ceiling tiles missing, debris had fallen on the carpet, the hallway carpet was stained, cut and rolled in places. There were lightbulbs leaning up on the doors and no one changing them. It smelled badly.. of mildew! So keeping an open mind, we walked into our room and it was like a blast of hot fire. The \"air\" was stuck on 87 degrees... we played with the thermostat to no avail. We called the front desk, they sent a staff person with a key to a new room next door. We walked in and it smelled so badly of mildew, he quickly escorted us out to the third room next door... the walls has sticky \"debris\" on them, it stunk and we were outta there! So he called down and we were promptly \"upgraded\" to the suite tower. Well this was not a lot better, but it was liveable. The furniture is badly beat up, the refrigerator had leaked all over the carpet and it was soaked and the room just plain STUNK. It was a cross between smoke ( this is supposed to be a non smoking hotel), mildew and dirt. I am sorry to say that this hotel has an apparent lack of TLC. It is a shame as it is a super location ( attached to the Keystone Fashion Mall) and was a gem of a hotel in it's prime.

There were no chairs in the room. When I called downstairs, the person was surprised, and said she would have someone bring some furntiure up. We left to go to dinner and notified the front desk, on the way out, that the carpet looked filthy and was horribly stained. The woman acted like she had no idea why I would tell her this information. I was hoping after two complaints, although I was very nice about it, that they would put us in a different room, but not so much. I complained to Hotwire folks, who refunded our money and tried to find us another place. It was too late at night and we decided to just drive the three hours on home. When we went to pick up our luggage and check out, after dinner, my husband noted that the staff had brought up two folding chairs to the room and left them inside the door. We couldn't believe that a Sheraton would be like this. We don't routinely stay at Sheraton and in fact, I've not stayed in one since the 80's in London, but we were very disappointed. Even the furniture in the hallways, carpet, wallpaper, etc. was frayed, worn and stained. The worst was they absolutely didn't seem to really care that much. Maybe they were used to getting complaints. I certainly won't stay there again, and I will let everyone I know about it.

I reserved a car service for transportation since it was work travel and I did not want to rent a car on district business - 40minutes from the airport/$42.00 roundtrip (Above and Beyond car service). We (a collegue traveled with me) arrived at the hotel - great lobby! I entered the FIRST room, there was clean, standing water in the tub!!!! Oh, no!!! I went to the front desk, explained the situation and was given another room. The SECOND room, no standing water...YET! The hotel is an older building - the lobby has received upgrades as well as the restaurant/bar area - NOT the rooms! It's not a dump...but close. NO room upgrades - stained carpet, stained sofa, stained curtains...dingy. The bathroom was an acceptable size...but very old - and the standing water appeared when I took a shower...several inches high!!!!!! UNACCEPTABLE!!! The first night, I tried to \"suck it up and take it like a champ\" - the second night, the slow flush, standing water in the tub...too much to suck up! I spoke to the General Manager...he lacked appropriate interpersonal communication skills - HOWEVER, he was responsive to my concerns as he sent maintenance to the room. I return to the room after dinner to notice the tip that I left for housekeeping was gone...the room was not cleaned...but there was evidence that maintenance had been in the room because the MONEY was gone, the toliet seat cover was down, and the bath mat on the floor was dirty with shoe prints!!!! AND, long hair, that was NOT MINE, was in the toilet!!!!!!!! WOW!!!!! Furious, I went back to the General Manager and he referred me to the Room Manager/Director, Andy. Andy exhibited the appropriate communication skills and was very apologetic. After taking a walk, I returned to the room which had been cleaned by Houskeeping and the drain problems in the tub/toilet were repaired. Room service delivered a tray with fresh fruit, snacks, and bottled water - a personal note of apology from Andy... Andy called me to offer points for a 1 night stay at a Starwood hotel. Of course, Andy did a phenominal job to redeem this Sheraton location and I sincerely appreciated his commendable effort. However, I will not return. The fact still remains that the hotel rooms are in substandard condition. Great job Andy...poor performance Sheraton! The hotel is connected to a fashion mall (with a small movie theater and foodcourt) with the anchor stores Nordstrom and Saks...restaurants are close and in walking distrance. However, NO CVS/Walgreens/Wal-Mart-type stores are in walking distance...bring EVERYTHING with you!!! An option: There is a Marriott in walking distance and again, based on the lobby, it looks great. We visited the Marriott restaurant/patio - nice view of a small lake. Great walking trail around the lake that connects the Marriott to office building, a very nice residential community and Champps Resturant (by the way, a great Champps location with an outside deck and live entertainment...at least on Wednesday nights). On one occasion, there was a gentleman and young lady in the Sheraton elevator commiserating about their Sheraton experince - both \"regular business travelers\" to the Keystone Crossing area but not traveling together - when I asked, they BOTH agreed that the Mariott was much better than the Sheraton.

We were seeing a concert in nearby Noblesville. All of the hotels in Noblesville, Fishers, etc were booked (as they normally are when there is a concert going on at the Verizon Music Theater). This hotel is in a really nice area. It has a very nice parking garage which is easily accessible and FREE. Yes, I said FREE. We felt safe as well. The area of town where the hotel was situated made it easy to get to Noblesville, so that was a big PLUS. No traffic and very easy to get there coming from this direction. It also had a nice lounge where you can chill out in the lobby. Also had a dining area which we did not go to. But the lounge was nice and we enjoyed having a couple of beers there. The front desk people were very nice and polite. The lobby was spacious and beautiful. There is an indoor walkway that takes you to the Fashion Mall which houses tons of stores. I did not go there, but they have stores such as Crate & Barrell, Coldwater Creek, Sacs 5th Avenue, and more. The bad....there is not any eating establishments right in that area (within walking distance). There is a Mexican restaurant that is not far. There's also a TGIFridays and an Italian restaurant fairly close. We chose to go down Route 69 a little ways where we found Scotty's Brewhouse. It had an awesome atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, reasonably priced and great food. T.V.s are at each table which was totally awesome! The rooms in the hotel were clean for the most part. The carpet needs upgraded, as they were terribly stained with God only knows what. They were a dark striped carpet and were pretty worn. The beds looked crisp and clean, but the next morning, we noticed there was some gooky stuff on the side of the bottom sheet on both beds. Looked like sticky yellow stuff. We left a note for the maid service to replace the linens and they did. After inspection, the second set appeared spotless, crisp, and clean. The tables and such are a little outdated but were clean. You cannot connect to wireless internet, and they charge $9.95 per day to connect to internet in the room. I am glad that I went through Hotwire as the rooms on the Sheratin website were $159.00 per night. Got them for $79.00 per nite on Hotwire which was quite a savings.

The amenities in the bathroom were especially nice (\"Bliss\" brand products). The meeting facilities were alright, but the temp in the room was difficult to control so we had to open the doors out to the hallway... however, the \"muzak\" playing out there was rather loud and distracting. The catering staff was very nice, however, and the lunches which were catered were fine. Breakfasts were pretty skimpy, but then I'm not really a fan of \"Continental\" breakfasts like that. The bar in the hotel is just off the lobby area and was just okay.

I went with my colleagues, though, and it was fine... just a personal thing, I guess. However, one evening a group of us went there and several bought drinks. Another colleague joined us and tried to bring a cup of coffee he had just bought at Starbucks (in the mall) but the bartender was downright nasty about it and wouldn't let him bring it in. I could understand that if the bar served coffee drinks (as far as I could tell they did not) or if he was by himself, but our group bought quite a few drinks so no one could argue that they were losing money on us. Other staff were fine, friendly and very helpful... just this one bartender sucked.

There was a cheerleading competition going on, so the hotel was overrun with girls and their mothers. Not exacly a peaceful atmosphere! The room was ok - a little shabby. We could smell smoke (i.e. marijuana) through the vent in the bathroom. We didn't have time to change rooms though because we were meeting friends for dinner. We left with the hopes that our dog would not be high when we returned! The bed was very uncomfortable and my husband and I were both awakened at 1:30 am to the laughing and screaming of girls. We had the breakfast buffet in the morning. It was decent but they didn't seem to restock the items and many people were getting angry. All in all it was a very average hotel. Would probably not stay here again.", "Date": "February 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cToo expensive\u201d", "Author": "tjtravels37", "ReviewID": "UR13525522", "Content": "Conditions of the hotel and rooms were similar to what other patrons described.....in all, an average hotel.

The whole place feels in need up updating -- shabby carpets, dim hallways, scratches and dents. Just slightly shabby all-around for a Sheraton. The bed was good, though. They charge to use the wireless in the rooms, but it's free in the lobby, whch meant that the lobby and bar were often full of people with laptops in their laps. The \"restaurant\" is just a bare-bones open area near the lobby where they serve food. Drinks are expensive. Burger was good. Don't order the fish and chips -- the fish was inedible. Parking is free in a covered garage. If you park on level three, you can walk straight into the second level of the hotel via a covered walkway. There is a mall attached to the property by an elevated covered walkway, plus a lot of upscale chain restaurants nearby. I had to check out a day early, and they charged me $50 for this.

We had 4 people in our room and even with the airconditioner running non-stop we couldn't keep the room cool at night. The walls must be paper thin because they won't block noise from people talking or tv's from other rooms... if the person next door snores even moderately, you won't be able to sleep. On the possitive side, the hotel is in a really nice upscale area and is attached directly to mall. Also, there is free parking in an adjacent parking garage that is also attached.

The water pressure was fine, and it was nice to have a circle shower curtain rod, so your not always touching the curtain. One nice thing about the hotel is that is attached to a nice shopping center. You can also walk or drive over to the strip mall that is less than a block away. There is also free parking, you can pay for valet, but the parking garage is right next to the hotel and we found it very easy to get in and out. We would definilty stay here again.

The San Diego Central is in a great location, only minutes from anywhere we wanted to go. The rooms are comfortable and clean; the stoves might be a little dated, but we were on vacation - I wasn't doing any cooking. Breakfast is great with a good selection to meet anyone's needs. Several evenings a week they also have a \"manager's reception\" which is basically a light dinner buffet. We had dinner plans the nights we were there, but we happened to notice that they served meat lasagna & veggie lasagna one night and veggie and meat chili another night. They also serve salad, bread, veggies, beer and wine.

All doors are outside and we had to go up stairs to our front door. Our room was in a center building so there was no parking nearby. I required walking into the interior walkways. No big deal, but something that does make getting luggage in an out a bit more difficult. Our room (apartment) had a living room with a TV and a couch with a fold out bed, kitchen area with frig, stove, oven and microwave, a master bedroom with a king size bed, TV, desk and a bathroom, and an upstairs loft bedroom with a queen size bed, TV and a bathroom. Obviously plenty of room for the four of us. Both kids had their own room and TV. Everything looked real clean. The beds were a little hard, but not bad. No wireless internet in the rooms, only a wired connection. A little limiting, but okay. Each day, if would bring up a screen where you had to sign up. You can pay for multiple day access or just select the one day free option. The only bad thing is you have to do that every day if you want the free access. The laundry room is up in the main office building. Machines worked well. Seems cost was $1.25 per cycle. They have a miniature tennis court and a basketball goal. The pool seemed well used, but we did not have a chance to use it. Breakfast was okay. Not too much variety, but the quality was pretty good. Three or four hot items along with normal bagels, toast and two waffle makers. They have orange and apple juice as well as a soft drink dispenser. Breakfast can get pretty crowded. We had to sit outside at tables a couple of days. Seems the later you go, the more crowded. The location is not bad at all. It is only about 15 minutes from downtown and most major attractions.

Nothing wrong with that really, and I suspect that information was available to me if I knew to look for it. It was just less than I expected. The other issue I had with the hotel was that our room smelled of cigarette smoke, something unexpected in a non-smoking property. We should have complained immediately and changed rooms, so I don't hold it against the staff at all. It seemed that the smell was actually coming in from outside - I suspect the air inlet for the room vent was placed near some common location where people liked to smoke outside. Tough to police your customers smoking outdoors. Regardless, the end result was a bad smelling room. The final issue I had was with the location of the hotel. While less than ten miles from many tourist destinations, it was not near any, and it was not near the ocean, one of the major draws of San Diego. The neighborhood was okay but not great - a number of cheap restaurants (most of which were closed on a Sunday night), plus a Food-4-Less discount grocery store, Walmart, and 99 Ranch Market - stores that you won't find in upscale neighborhoods (although 99 Ranch is a great place to go for unusual Asian items). For all that, the price was good, the area seemed safe and clean, the property was very nice (essentially an attractive condo complex), there was a good selection for breakfast, free parking, free Internet, and the staff was excellent.

Probably among the most helpful and pleasant staff we have ever come across. The rooms are quite nice, clean and spacious though it might be time to update the bathrooms and the bathroom amenities. Food is not great but its free- well it was when we were there. The hotel offers free drinks and internet access which was nice.

Hi-speed internet connections in King BR (with desk). \"Kitchenette\" was effectively a full kitchen with diswasher, oven, stove, refrig, microwave. Eating area was a marble countertop with seating for 2-4. Living room had TV, phone, small desk, sofa & two chairs. The suite was new, super clean, and well-maintained.

Didn't check out the fitness center, but there was also a heated pool and a hot tub on premises that were in good shape. Free breakfast in the morning was well-stocked with a wide range of food and drinks. Nice lobby area, but bot enough seating for breakfast. There is additional seating near the pool deck.

We had a two-bedroom suite, #122, right next to the pool which was very convenient. Our room was ready upon arrival. It's challenging lugging a 40-pound suitcase up the stairs, so be prepared if that's not something you want to do. You'll have to do it again to get to the second floor. The unit was nice - the downstairs bathroom fan didn't work so it was a little steamy after a shower. The beds were comfortable and the unit was furnished to make your stay convenient. One day our kids left the do not disturb magnet on the door so housekeeping didn't make up the room, but they did leave a bag of clean towels outside the door which was a nice gesture. The pool was cleaned daily and the water was incredibly warm, great for those of us who aren't into a freezing pool in the summer - it felt fabulous. An adequate number of lounge chairs and tables with umbrellas made a place for everyone. A hot tub is also available. The breakfast was not bad - we typically stay at Embassy Suites so we're spoiled by their made-to-order items and huge selection. All in all, however, the Residence Inn was pretty good. It can get busy in the morning but the staff does their best to keep up. Free papers and the Today Show in the lobby give the place a homey touch. The convenience store off the lobby was great when the kids wanted a small Ben and Jerry's ice cream snack. The afternoon snacks are fine - popcorn is good but don't expect mixed drinks, just beer, wine and sodas. As most reviewers write, this location is very convenient to a number of places and is easy to find right off of 163.

Worst stay ever!\u201d", "Author": "MinnieMouse71", "ReviewID": "UR8394853", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 9 nights in June and we had a really bad experience. I had read the reviews and it seemed fine, but we were unfortunate and the staff had a bad attitude and didn't care. Surprisingly many of them seemed to be new to the place since they had to ask others, even make phone calls about basic matters. Checking in went fairly well and I mentioned that it was my husband's 50th birthday, but that was nothing that they seemed to care about, but that's ok, we didn't expect anything extra, but a congratulation would have been nice. I had requested a suite with a quiet location and a cot, but they were not aware of this, apparently not checking requests. We made the reservation through their own homepage. We got suite No 16 and it was quiet, a 2 bedroom suite on the upper level. The place is big so you need to drive to your room with the luggage, but there were spaces available close to our room at all times. Later they brought a foldable cot but nothing more. Fortunately we had brought our own pillow and blanket. The sofa bed wasn't made up and we found sheets in a plastic bag in one of the closets. The suite had good beds, but the stairs were not good for families with children, very steep and broadening at the bottom making them impossible to block off. Kitchen was good and well equipped. The first night there was a blockage in the toilet upstairs and at the same time a leakage, so that water was filling up constantly, until it filled up the toilet and ran out on the floror, the bathroom was flooded and it even dripped through the ceiling drenching all our stuff in the bathroom downstairs. I called the front desk and after quite a while there was a man who came and looked, but we couldn't explain what had happened to him since he didn't understand English, none of the staff did, except those by the front desk, and they hadn't passed on my explanation to them. We tried to tell them that the room had to be dried, the toilet fixed and the bathrooms thoroughly cleaned, but they didn't get it. I had to make inumerable calls to the front desk and it took 2 hours before they had fixed the toilet. I asked for the general manager and a young man turned up, he was most of all interested in how long it had taken buntil his men had come to help and he told us that they had told him that we had been flushing the whole night, a complete lie, which I explained. He wasn't very nice at all, didn't occur to him to apologize for the inconvenience or anything! We have 2 children, one of them only 1 year old, and we hadn't been able to use the bathroom since the night before, it took very much energy to deal with the flooding making all those calls and we couldn't leave our room without using the bathroom or our stuff and we couldn't since we had to check what happened. We missed breakfast and the manager said he'll credit $30 to our room , but he never did. To be sure I checked the bill the day before we were to check out, but there was no credit and the staff couldn't do anything and there was no manager on duty. I was told that \"Melissa\" was going to come at 5.30 and we had to leave early to catch a plane, but at 7 o'clock next morning she hadn't come yet, but there was another guy who I spoke to on the phone and he corrected the bill, but he said I had to walk there in person to straighten it out, which I did (more waste of time). The flooding would have been no big deal if the staff had shown the least interest and if anyone had apologized, but no one did, and if they had been able to deal with it efficiently. The front staff didn't care a bit and wasn't interested in listening, didn't even answer and no one offered anything, except for the $30 at the end, but only after an argue with the manager. Then there was the problem with our stuff that had been drenched. I didn't mention our toothbrushes and things because they were so unhelpful, I knew it was no use, but our laundry lay there in a big wet pile and I asked if they could wash it for us, nothing being offered. The manager agreed after a while to wash it and took the laundry, but after he left I suddenly realized that he'll probably wash it all together ruining the colors, so I had to make another phone call to make sure but he refused to wash the bright green, red and so on, T-shirts in different washes, only one dark and one light colors!!! So I had to ask to have our clothes back and deal with it myself, but then he even started arguing about the number of washes he wanted to pay for, because he was supposed to give me 1 dollar per wash!!! I told him to never mind, but there was an envelope enclosed with the dirty wet clothes with 5 bucks after all, that's peanuts to argue ver really. We had expected much more from a hotel, being part of this hotel chain. We lost many hours that day and the staff was really rude to us, this has never happened to us anywhere, we're normal nice people. Another thing that they failed on doing was delivering the telegram which my parents had sent to my husband's birthday. A special ld fashined expensive telegram, personally delivered. wrldwide. We stayed for 9 nights but they never gave us that telegram. On returning home we saw the copy which the telegram company always send, and the address was correct and complete, so why they didn't give it to us is really lousy. The staff was very inexperienced. Every time that I needed to get something from my safe deposit box, they looked like question marks, didn't even know that there were such boxes and certainly didn't know the routine, so they had to ask and make phone calls. Upon surrendering the box I had to argue to get a receipt that I had given them the key back. The woman didn't even know where the papers were kept, so I knew she hadn't dealt with it and you're responsible for the key and have to pay if you lose them. After a phone call she found my paper and I was to sign, but that line had already been signed, since I signed it when I first got the box, the man behind the desk not knowing the routine either, as always! The complimentary food was good and the cleaning of the room was good, the beds comfortable. There was complimentary papers to pick up by the front desk. Our memories of this hotel is really bad and all becuase of useless staff! If they at least had been friendly and polite to make up for all their mistakes, a smile and a nice way changes so much, but they didn't, nobody cared about us, despite me being nice all the time. The only one who was nice was a beginner who was on training. I guess this hotel is ok as long as you don't have any problems and don't use the safe deposit boxes and never has to deal with the staff in any way other than absolute basic business.

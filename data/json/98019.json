The beds were extremely comfortable and seemed to be new, plenty of fluffy bathtowels, decent lighting, coffee/tea in-room, mini-fridge and microwave, hairdryer, free wi-fi, etc... The furnishings and carpet were a little on the tired side, but in this price category, the hotel delivered way more than I expected as far as what the room was equipped with and had to offer. There is an outdoor pool, but it was not yet open for business at the end of April. The area around the hotel is desolate and industrial, but the other hotels nearby are in the same situation. Free breakfast was OK, biscuits and gravy very good, as was the coffee. Otherwise, there was some fresh fruit pieces and toast and cereal. The waffle maker was cold, so not sure if it was faulty or only used at certain times of the year. The one drawback, and it was a huge drawback, is that the hotel walls were terribly thin. I rang the front desk in the night about the room next door as I could hear the whole conversation and I thought they were being too loud. However, in the morning I could hear TV's, other conversations, etc. So I think it is just thin walls. My Mom slept fine, I did not, so this was a huge issue for me.

The Location is under a flight path which some may find difficult to deal with but it is in the title of the place. You can't expect to be that close to the airport and not hear planes! Also, as the name suggests, it is situated close to Graceland and Elvis Presley Boulevard which is the road to everywhere in the city. The reason I have rated this place as excellent is primarily because of the charachters of the staff within. It is a family run hotel with staff that are understanding. There was a group of 11 of us in all that were all there to have a good time. The staff realised this and on more than one occasion joined in on our gatherings.

This one is in the bottom half of the list so far. This is an ok motel for a nights sleep and a shower, but nothing special. My sink drain didn't work until I crawled underneath to raise the stopper. The room was moderately clean but was showing its age. I was in Memphis for Memphis in May, and an employee set me up with a driver to go downtown. The driver said it was 15.00 one way or 25.00 round trip and he would pick me up when I was ready to come home. So I paid him 25.00 and he took me down just fine, but when it was time to come home, the jerk didn't answer his phone. The cabs cost around 17.00 to go to Beale Street and I recommend them. The employees were professional and friendly enough and the breakfast was typical Quality Inn waffles and biscuits and gravy. The airport transportation was fairly prompt and was very handy. I wouldn't have stayed at this motel without it. I talked them into giving me a free lift to Graceland which is only a few blocks away and worth the 2-4 hours it takes to go on the tour. There is then a free shuttle to Sun Studios. This is worth the time also. If you go to Mempis and can fit in these two tours, take them. This motel is located between 2 strip joints, while it really didn't bother me, it may some people.

I woke up with my room invoice slipped under the door with a complimentary breakfast voucher to apologize for the inconvenience. It was so much more than an inconvenience!

HOWEVER There is a $6/night \"Resort\" fee. Nothing about this Holiday Inn says \"Resort\"; however that was NOT nor IS my issue. The hotel is old and has not been updated. The room, 2 queen beds: smelled musty, two lamps didn\u2019t work (1 had no bulb). Carpet was filthy; my husband and I wore socks in the room the entire time inside. Curtains had mold and stains throughout! A/C Unit cord had been spliced and wire-nutt'ed together, totally exposed. I saw it when I dropped my glasses, picked them up and saw it. We did bring it to the Managers attention who promised to have it taken care of. After we came back later in the day, we looked and was amazed on how it was fixed. I went to the front desk, saw the manager and asked him to tell me how it was fix... because I could not believe my eyes as they pulled up the carpet and covered the spliced cords and wire nuts. The manager said that's how they fix it. Talk about a fire hazard. Immigration - Visa - Passport renewal day was held at the hotel where hundreds of people came to complete paper work or be interviewed... they were all lined up down the hall, in front of the elevators and allowed to roam around freely in the pool area, etc. Again it's a \"RESORT\"? No privacy. Housekeeping - arguing, yelling and fighting on our floor. Dirty towels left in the hall way by laundry. We refused service the day before we left because we found that housekeepers go through and open all rooms to be cleaned, flip the latch to keep them unlocked all day even when housekeeping is NOT on the floor. Security found one room left open over night across the hall from us. Parking - you are going to walk to get to the door. Tour Buses - stinky and loud. Woke us up in the morning. If they offer you the \"pond view\" room, don\u2019t take it. It's like a ditch and a parking lot - very ugly. Customer Service person next to Alamo counter in the hotel SELLS TIME SHARE!

We recieved an upgrade to a Kid Suite (Queen and set of bunk beds) because I am a platinum priority club member. Thank you hotel and these rooms were great! OK - things we loved. Really nice pool area. Great if you have little kids because there is a wading pool about 1.5 feet deep. The larger pool was cool because the sun doesn't hit it for very long this time of the year. Could have been warmer, but oh well. Kudos to the hotel for promptly fixing a light that needed repair, actually 2 lights. There is an A&W and Pizza Hit Express inside the hotel. We only used the restaurant for breakfast and not lunch or dinner, but it is a nice feature if you just want to hang by the pool. The location is fantastic, especially if you are doing Disney. We didn't this trip, but there is a shuttle service too. (Sorry, we didn't use this either this time.) Tons of excellent restaurants in the immediate area!!! This is a big bonus! Walgreens and Publix also very close by. Staff was also excellent and very friendly. Let's face it - this makes or breaks your stay! (Loved Stephen at Front Desk!) Loved having the fridge in our room. Needed it anyway for medicine and we got one included with our kid suite. Things just OK - Parking is fair. The lady that writes about 2 football fields is exagerating. It's not that far. The walk does us all good. Parking lot does fill up late at night, but it's Orlando. You'll get that anywhere! It's really not that bad. We were on the front side of the hotel (Route 192 Side) We didn't have a balcony we could sit outside on where everyone else does. Didn't really matter to us, but if you want one...don't pick that front side. You do not hear noise from the main road either as long as you keep your sliding door closed! No problems there!

After reading the reviews prior to my trip yesterday, I still went ahead hoping for the best. The plus was they did let us check in around 1:30 p.m. when they said the room wasn't going to be ready until 4 p.m. As we walked off the elevator on the 8th floor the ice maker noise was very loud and the hallway was very warm. We entered our room that we were so excited for because we reserved a kids suite - and sadly disappointed. It looked like they tried but things like stains in the carpet and a mound of dust on the lamp shades made the experience not as good. The kids were so excited for their bunk beds which I have no complaints about. The AC was so loud and incredibly insane that it blew right onto the queen size bed directly. My husband wouldn't sleep on that side so I had to and thankfully I brought my kids' blanket to wrap around me head so the cold air wouldn't go straight on me. A plus for it being loud though was it drowned out the noise of the street in front of the hotel every time it went on. And since the ac was located in the window - the kids complained it was hot since there was a half wall in between them and the ac. We tried to spend the day at the pool yesterday but the pool is right behind the main building which gets no sun so it was too cold for the kids even though it was advertised to be a heated pool. So my kids had to hang out in the kiddie pool which was warm since it was in the sun's path. We had reserved 2 nights but after not getting any sleep the first night we cancelled the second night. Everyone was super nice there but that's not enough when you are hoping for the best vacation. I would not recommend this hotel.

Two nights in a row, there were trailers taking up more than 6 spots each, further adding to the parking issues. Parking is essentially free (unless you consider it part of the reasonable resort fee) so you get what you pay for. 2-the size of the bathroom in the double deluxe queen room overlooking the pool. Your knee should not be hitting the bathroom door when using the toilet. There was not enough room in the bathroom to get dressed. 3-food seemed pricey, the Pizza Hut was much more expensive than walking across the street to the actual location. With the McDonalds practically in the hotel, we mostly ate there. 4-the business center was pay per use (of computer per minute, printer per page, and fax per page). We have stayed at many other hotels where this was free. As for positives, the hotel was clean and quiet. My family loved the pool although we wished the architects had thought it out better to allow the pool to actually be in the sun. Game room was nice for older kids and the workout was well equipped. Great free wi-fi. Be aware tht if you check in on Sunday but don't connect your device until Monday after 12 pm, that you will need to get a new password from the front desk.

We asked at check in for a quiet room , and they delivered. Free WiFi worked well in our room and in public areas, and the fitness center was adequately equipped and very clean. Our \"standard\" room did not come with a micro or fridge, although a micro can be rented. Some other rooms, presumably, are so equipped. A pleasant surprise was the high quality of the food. While Pizza Hut has a small operation in the food service area, the restaurant itself is part of the hotel, and puts out three quite ample buffets per day with a good range of offerings. Not your ordinary hotel/motel food by any means, and thereb is an apparent willingness to at least try to take care of some individual needs, if someone has a dietary restriction. The servers in our dedicated dining area could not have been more pleasant or helpful. We were participating in a week-long adult continuing education program, taking our included meals in the hotel.

We had been on the road since 5:00a and arrived at the hotel about 2:30p. The lobby looked decent, no one was waiting in line but there were a few people stretched out on the couches and in hind sight they were probably waiting for their rooms to become available. The girl at the front desk had the most unhelpful attitude. We gave her our name and stated that we were checking in and before she even checked the computer to see if our room was available she promptly informed us that check-in wasn't until 4p. When I said \"oh, I thought it was 3p\" she retorted with \"well, we give you until noon to check out\". I'm just thinking check-out is the least of my concerns right now and check-in is my greatest. Of course, as you may well expect, after looking in the computer her suspicions were verified. There were, in fact, no rooms available at that time. She offered to take our number and call us AS SOON as a room came available. We never got a phone call and around 4:30p we came back to the hotel to try to check in again. We were waited on my Frank P. the manager on duty. When I booked my room I did request a high floor - that request clearly wasn't accommodated as we were placed on the 2nd floor. The room was spacious but sparsely furnished and dark. Turns out the 2nd floor room we were in overlooked the roof that covered the indoor pool. We had no balcony and our windows were about 4' off the floor and only about 3' tall. We went' back to the lobby and requested another room. The only other room they had was a ground floor room across from the arcade. We actually took this room - which only goes to show how bad the first room was. Our room was a handicapped accessible room. The bathroom was dark with only one light over the sink and no counter space, They provide you with a full lengh mirror in the middle of a dark hall that has no overhead light (gee thanks). The rooms furnishings were ok, the bed was comfortable, the pillows were a joke ... they were smaller than a standard pillow ... they reminded me of a small throw pillow you might find on your couch. There was no comforter just a sheet and a thin blanket - not enough - even in florida. The air conditioning unit sounded like a jet engine when it turned on and when it was off you could hear your neighbors coughing. During the night when you could finally fall asleep you were awakened everytime the air conditioninig turned on with its deafing roar. They offer a breakfast for $9.95/person or you could just walk to McDonalds which is in their parking lot. The location was great for Old Town - just across the street.

The Holiday Inn Main Gate East was literally an answer to my prayers! This hotel is obviously conveniently located extremely close to all of the Disney entertainment, but we were among the rare few who were NOT there for that reason. Anyway, the hotel staff was wonderful, the rates were quite fair, the facility had more features than we could have hoped for. Example- there is an outdoor heated pool, a children's pool , a jacuzzi, a playground, lovely outdoor patio, a mini \"food court\" they call their restaurant, a game room, a rental car desk, a gift shop- and that's just the stuff within the hotel itself!! The rooms are very nicely furnished. The beds were clean and comfortable ( 4 pillows on each queen size). Plenty of space to move around, spread out or whatever you like. Each room is equipped with a safe for valuables, at no extra cost, which I thought was a nice feature. Microwaves and refrigerators are available if needed, but not standard. I agree with some of the other reviews that I've read about the bathroom area (toilet and tub/shower) being a bit small. The sink area is separate, which proves to be helpful when more than one person is trying to get ready. The bathrooms are set up nicely though. Plenty of clean towels, soap & shampoo. I felt very secure and safe in this location. The rooms are well insulated, so sounds are not a problem if you're a \"light\" sleeper. Again, the staff, whether it be those at the front desk, the restaurant workers, the cleaning ladies, the bellmen, the maintenance people, the gift shop attendant, the rental car counter, whomever- they were ALL genuinely friendly, very courteous, quite helpful, just an all around \"blessing\" in a day and age where real customer service seems to have faded into obscurity.

If you are visiting Disney during an off season and can get a room for around the same price as here I would reccomend the Disney option hands down. When you stay here you have to drive to the parks and pay the $14.00 parking fee each day otherwise you are stuck with the bus hours at the hotel which we didnt use because they were inconvenient with the times we wanted to go to the parks. When you add up that cost with the other resort fees here you really wont save a whole lot. Rooms at the value resorts will be a bit smaller but if your like us you really wont be staying in the room alot anyway. I can say that this hotel served its purpose for our trip but overall I get a much more enjoyable experience staying on Disney property. For me the disney hotels really keep you feeling the disney spirirt even when you leave the parks, when you stay off property you really feel like your disney experience ends every night.

If they fix the elevators and clean the hallways this will be a pretty good value. Also when booking this hotel please be advised of a resort fee that they spring on you when checking out.

So here is the story about our marvelous stay at the Holiday Inn. It all started when we originally booked a room at the Celebration Suites across the street. When arrived there we found ourselves a nasty and super muggy hot room with a couch that had what looked to have blood on it. We immediately left that crap hole and decided hey lets go to McDonalds and use their WiFi to find a nicer hotel. When we get to the McDonalds we look up and see the words \"Holiday Inn\". So immediately we are like heck yeah lets check these digs out. So I we chalet over to the Holiday Inn and ask how much a room was. The totally awesome receptionist writes down this G16 ultra top secret rate down on a piece of paper ($49.99 + Tax) and tells us we can get either a room with two full beds or a room with a queen and two bunk beds. So we ask to check out the rooms. So she hooks us up with some room keys for us to check the rooms out. Well we walk into the bunk bed room (which was literally 64837648263x nicer then the Celebration Suites) and decide thats the room for us without even looking at the other one. So we head back down to tell the awesome receptionist that we will take the room. So she then asks us if any of use have a military ID. Well my buddy Brett has one and shows her and we get $5 off our room making it $44.99 + Tax a night now. Then he is like \"yo I got AAA too do you have a discount for that too?\"... Well what do you know they do so we get our already low rate knocked down another $5 and end up paying $39.99 + Tax a night opposed to the $60 + Tax we almost spent at the Celebration Suites. So were happy campers now. Well we then go grab some dinner and head back to the hotel. Well this dinner is making its way through me quickly so I decide to make the first of many journeys to the bathroom in our room. Well here is where my only complaint is... After releasing the bombs into the toilet I go to wipe and what do I face. SINGLE PLY TOILET PAPER. The Horrors! I immediately yell to my fellow companions \"This Place Is Cheap! THEY ONLY HAVE SINGLE PLY TOILET PAPER GEEESH!\"... Other then that this hotel was awesome. They even have a sweet pool...

We stayed for 5 nights on our first trip to Disney. Very convenient to all the Disney parks, all within about 3 miles. We didn't utilize the shuttle, as we wanted the flexibility of our own transportation since the shuttle generally only ran once in the morning & once in the evening for each park. But it was nice to know we had that option. We arrived to find an unexpected comp upgrade from a standard room to a KidSuite, which was fabulous- our son loved the bunk bed & having his own TV, & the partition gave us a little extra privacy. (Just keep in mind the 2 TVs are only about 5 feet from each other, so there will likely be a 'battle' for the volume if you're not each watching the same thing.) The hotel itself was very quiet despite a full parking lot, barely heard a peep from other guests in our hallway. The in-house Pizza Hut & A&W were a nice touch, we got pizzas our first night in & took it right to our room. And the gift shop was also nice if you forgot to pack something, want a quick souvenir, or have the munchies after the cafes are closed. Naturally it's overpriced, but to us that's expected that you would pay for the convenience of not having to leave the hotel. Our son loved the indoor pool, although at only 72 degrees it's claims of being 'heated' seem odd. I've found that other heated hotel pools generally range around 80 degrees. The only negatives (if you could call them that): My initial contact with the front desk staff & reservation staff by phone before our stay was disappointing & unnerving, found several of them extremely irritable, rushed & rude by phone. But we had no problems with the staff during our stay, although most of the front desk staff seemed very 'detached' & gave the impression they didn't really enjoy their job or people, they were still cordial. And we found the front desk girl upon checkout to be extremely nice- she even printed out our boarding passes for us (I wish I could remember her name). The bathroom was VERY tiny- the door nearly rubs the tub when it opens & even as a very petite person I had to scoot to the side of the toilet just to close the door. The room carpets could use a good shampoo. In the main building facing the street, it was disappointing that the balconies were for show only, the sliding glass doors were screwed shut. But these things in no way really diminished the overall enjoyment of our stay. Just things that stood out to us a bit.

The building is off the main road and right next to a McDonalds, not my gig but probably great for families. There was ample parking in between and in front of the two buildings.

They had Bath and Body works coconut lime shampoo and body products which were nice. The bed was super comfy and the bankets were soft...we slept very well and normally sleep on memory foam. Our room overlooked the pool area and the main road with a mini amusement park, The room had a balcony which we didn't use but was nice with chairs an a small table. We did use room service for breakfast one morning but they lost our order and we had to call 35 minutes later to get it delivered quickly which they did. Nothing special but the eggs were real which was nice as scrambled eggs cab be egg substitute sometimes. We did use the pool and were laughing at how tiny the pool towels were that they had availalable...seriously it takes at least two towels to cover a sun lounger which definitely needed covering as they weren't very comfortable.

Furthermore, the lock on the door to her room was broken, and she had to wait while someone tried to fix the door lock. Unable to fix the lock, the hotel decided to assign a new room to my mother, which she accepted. But when she got to her room, there were obvious signs that the room was still dirty. There was other people's hair on the bathroom floor, counters, beds, etc. My mother brought this to the attention of the front desk, and they said the manager would be there in 5 minutes. 15 minutes later, my mother went to the front desk as no one had come to the room. She proceeded to explain that she just wanted a clean room, and that she didn't want to cause any problems. The manager finally arrived at the front desk, and at this point, my mother was quite frustrated with the whole ordeal. The manager claimed that he had looked at the room and there was nothing wrong with it (he obviously didn't look too hard). And what's worse, he even had the audacity to retort lines such as \"do I look like someone who cleans rooms\" at my mother. This is completely unacceptable. She was not able to deal with this situation without becoming upset, and her voice did raise in the lobby (with good reason, as she had been waiting for quite some time now, and the front desk staff was greatly unsupportive and not helpful). The manager had the audacity to call the police and kick my mother out of the hotel. She is a priority club member, and her only request was a clean room to stay in. How can you call yourself a hospitality service when you reject customers in this manner? This all could have been avoided if there had simply been a clean room for my mother to stay in as she had reserved in advance. End of story.

Overall this is a good hotel, did seem to be recently renovated, the pool was very clean & the employees seemed to really go out of their way to be friendly & helpful. They were also really working hard to keep the place well maintained - were cleaning & sealing the brickwork out front & also installing a new terra cotta roof in the pool area while we were there; these ongoing projects did not effect our stay at all but was good to see that they strive to make this a well maintained facility. The main pros were the price - felt it was very affordable & also the good proximity to Disney. after reading the reviews here, we knew not to rely on the shuttle & rented a car, but had no problem with the drive to Disney. We have small children & were easily able to come home mid day, rest & then go back later in the day without feeling like we wasted much time driving. We have spoken to others who have stayed on Disney property & the time it took for us to return to our hotel was comparable to theirs. Also felt there was reasonable availability & variety of restaurants nearby, good for families & not being held \"captive\" to Disney high prices for meals. We went to Pacino's Italian ( a bit pricey but good food) next door, the Ponderosa Steak House, Cracker Barrell & Chick Fil A were good choices for us. Target & Publix are also close by for groceries. The staff was also very prompt about bringing up a crib to our room when we asked for one, no charge for this either. The main negatives: the Kid Suite room that we had was very small & confining with the bunk bed set up. I know we probably could have been moved to the other building with a bigger room (based on reviews here) but since we arrived late in the evening & wanted to get to the parks the next day earlier, just wasn't worth the effort for us. Also, the bathroom was very small & really smelled of mildew. There were lots of groups of teenagers there when we were, making a much noisier environment than we would have liked & the pool was always very crowded & loud in the evenings. There is very little that the hotel could do about this & understand that they need to fill rooms, so if you are looking for a place more quiet & tranquil, then this would not be a good place to stay during the summer months when kids are out of school. Overall this was fine for our trip to Disney & really helped to make a trip on a budget, but will probably look elsewhere for our next trip.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange Park, FL", "Title": "\u201cAwesome \"Mom-cation\"\u201d", "Author": "JCaravello", "ReviewID": "UR114873664", "Content": "My family asked me where I'd like to spend my birthday/mother's day celebration and I could thlink of no other place but at the Holiday Inn Main Gate East in Kissimmee.

It turned out to be a spacious, clean and welcoming hotel, a stone throw away from Old Town which is literally across the road (the old car cruise on a sautrday is great) It was also located in walking distance from a variety of restaurants. we flew with Virgin, our resort fee and florida state tax fee were waivered which was a lovely surprise since this usually catches you out! There was a free of charge safe in the room, hair dryer, iron and ironing board as well as a mini kitchen and full size refrigerator. The rooms were cleaned every day - and if we woke up late and missed the cleaners, they would check later and clean the room later on in the day. The pool was clean and so was the jaccuzzi. There is a pizza hut inside the hotel , and they also offer a breakfast, but with IHOP, Dennys and a load more resutarants down the road it isnt really worth having it in the hotel for the price of quality. Although we didnt use the free shuttle service to the Disney parks I did enquire and they had two departure times 0810 and 1000 and two pick up times 1800 and 2200 for Epcot and Magic Kingdom.

We arrived and stayed in the kids suite which was supposed to provide some privacy with a divider wall in between childrens side, however the wall did not go all the way to the ceiling, my son stayed on the top bunk and would talk to us from there.(Not very private), The room appeared to be somewhat upgraded but the bathroom was gross! It had a horrible musty smell and the caulking was nasty on the floor(Wear your sandles) beds were good but we had to ask immediately the first day to have all of the bedding changed as our sheets were dirty with ketchup, or bbq sauce spilled, they did so immediately and the room was nicely cleaned for us every day It can be loud at night especially if you are staying in the first tower which is directly beside macdonalds, lots of loud people at all hourse. the gym was ok, it does the trick for short stays, no weights just bike, eliptical and tread mill, which there are children coming in and out at all times playing on the equipment. The pool is good, large for adults and little one for children. Our only complaint was that unfortunately there were a number of underage teenagers as some were still on spring break who were drinking at the pool, and speaking very inappropriately in front of children, my husband spoke up to a stumbling teenage boy who was swearing!! I reported it to pool security so hopefully something was done for any other following nights as we were ususally too busy to get to the pool on time before closing 11pm. Long story short, it worked for us as we were only there to sleep at night, it was cheap and decent. Staff was nice, it was close to most of the parks! My advice is its not too bad of a place, just make sure your sheets are cleaned before you stay, and dont go during spring break if you can avoid it,seems the states have a really long span of spring breakers...teenagers everywhere mouthing off and line ups are ridiculous at every park.

Went down & complained ... again nothing they could do, that adjoining rooms weren't guaranteed & they would do their best to accommodate. Then when asked if we could get a break on the room prices, because somebody obviously screwed up, we were told no, then given free breakfast buffets in the morning. This was extremely inconvenient for us, as we were traveling with 3 small children & grandpa & grandma. The adjoining room situation was the reason we chose this hotel - we did book last minute & finally found adjoining situation available....or so we thought.

Todd said \"what do you have\" i said what I had, which was about 6 dollars less than he did per ticket ... he immediately put his price sheet in my face & told me how he needs to charge FL sales tax & how nobody believes him.

My room key did not work and maintenance were called. The maintnenance man could not open the door and his supervisor called. He managed to open the door (with force) and made me feel like an idiot (not good customer service) even though his employee had same problem. If you after healthy food - dont go here. The restaurant/\"breakfast\" bar is basically a fast food shop - fried food or pizza or soggy fruit is about it. The bar did not have any draft beer working (for which I had a token) so they charged me for bottle beer. Dont expect a beer at lunch time - doesnt open til 3pm I had ants in my room, and the shower water smelt stagnent. To clinch the dreadful review. I had a late flight so checked out on time and left baggage with the hotel - sitting by the pool for the day. Guess what - they messed up and gave my bag to another guest who had left for a hotel 10 miles away. To cut a long story short - I missed my (much needed) flight home to UK, due to how they handled the situation. Whilst they have agreed compensation and cost coverage for an overnight stay and flight transfer - the inconvenience caused by lack of care or concern over my baggage is not acceptable.

The first (and only) shuttle does not leave until well after the parks open. Then there is not another shuttle to bring you back until 5:45 p.m. So going back in the afternoon to take a nap is out of the question unless your arrange your own transportation. Then, the last shuttle of the night is 10:15 p.m. which is way before the parks close, and if you do not get there early, you dont get a seat, There were LOTS of tourists pushing and shoving their way on to the bus!! The first night we arranged a taxi through the front desk, so we could arrive at the park at opening. It cost us $27! So we did our homework, and discovered that the city bus (the Link) has a stop right infront of the hotel, and costs only $2, with kids under & free! And...the bus leaves every 20 min! So, this is the way we got around most of the time. We did take a taxi at night a few times, but do not use the hotel recommended one...call Mears taxi!

There is a customer service desk on the opposite side of the front desk, they will try to sell you discount tickets to disneyworld. Don't waste your time, they are trying to sell the resort. In order to get the discount ticket and you have to spend several hours to listen with them....unless you are interested or have time to do it. I had a complain about the guy who worked at the cafe being ruded. I spoke with the front desk manager. He is no help at all. Next day I talked with the cafe manager and he was super nice and handle it in the professional way. He makes me feel much better after I spoke with him. Here is more information about this hotel. Taxi price to/from airport: $55 one way Restaurant: McDonald next door, two door down is a good Italian restaurant (about $12-15 per dinner) Gift Shop: pently of gift shop down the street(good walk).", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cUncomfortable bed causing itchiness\u201d", "Author": "twinturbo911", "ReviewID": "UR90173841", "Content": "I got this hotel on priceline as a 3 1/2 star.

I informed the hotel staff and they came and changed all the linens. After that we still experienced the same issue. The moment we moved to the other bed in the same room, we were fine.

The hotel staff were very good and patient about the room they allocated us. Insist on a room either overlooking the front or at the back of the rear tower. The rooms that are facing each other in the middle, no they don't over look each other, can get a bit noisy with the air conditioning units on the roof of the ground floor building in between. The advantage of a room high up at the back is that you can keep an eye on your car as it overlooks the car park and you can sit with a glass of wine and watch the nightly firework display at WDW Epcot. OK you can only see the higher ones but that is quite a lot. The rooms are very good and most seem to have adjoining doors which will be good for families. Can't comment on the food or breakfast as we didn't have it. If you didn't know its about 5 miles from Main Gate East which is a few more miles to EPCOT and MGM.

I decided to bid $50 a night on Priceline, and this is what I got. We were unsure what we were in for until we arrived. We were very surprised (pleasantly so!). When we arrived, we were quite early and were still allowed to check in right away. One thing we noticed was lack of air conditioning in the lobby and hallways. It was 95 degrees outside, so that was rather uncomfortable. Once we got to our room, we were able to control the temp and made it nice and cool. Things were in fantastic condition. Things were clean, there was plenty of room to move around, and there was a nice space to set up our baby daughter's pack n play. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the pillows weren't too fluffy. We opened our window and found a nice balcony with a view of the pool. We actually delayed our plans 'til the next morning so we could enjoy the pool that evening. We ate Pizza Hut at the cafe in the lobby that also features an A&W root beer pub. It was very convenient, if a little pricey, but the pizza was very good. The cafe seemed a bit disorganized and they seemed to have no cups for the drink machines. It was also very hot because of the lack of air in the corridors. Otherwise, we were very pleased with the experience. I have one serious complaint. The housekeeper left an envelope next to the bed with a request for us to drop a tip for her at the front desk. I understand that housekeeping is hard work, and I would be more than happy to tip a housekeeper who went above and beyond for us. However, I don't enjoy the feeling that I'm being pressured into it. That being said, everything is very clean in this hotel, it seems very safe and they were even hosting a wedding reception while we were there. Very nice place to stay. Priceline really helped us out here.

We are not \"travel snobs\" nor do we have any problems forgiving mistakes, they happen, but what seemed to be the norm here on our vacation was concerning. Of note after our stay, I do not believe one positive review written about this establishment--I truly believe they are written by somebody associated with Holiday Inn. Yes, I did book our accommodations through Priceline, however, I was reimbursed for a portion of our prepaid trip which is unheard of--that is something that never happens. My opinion of this establishment is based on the following: had to have maintenance come up and fix safe on the first day (wouldn't lock), our room went uncleaned an entire day (we were not on the property from 8:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m.), there was a turantula in our room (yes -- a huge spider of which I took pictures) which required two horrified men at 11:00 pm to kill, fire alarms going off during the night (yes, evacuations to tower one -- oddly enough, tower two never even knew), small over-crowed pool of which we never saw anybody tending to, bar/lounge that didn't open until 3:00 p.m. and, the killer one, we left the property for a day only to return and find our prepaid room had been rented out to somebody else who actually was kind enough to return some of our personal possessions--several items, however, mysteriously disappeared \"it was a housekeeping error\" was all we got from the manager. I felt really bad for the traveler who they rented our room to -- poor thing actually apologized to us. I remember Holiday Inn being known for setting a Standard for an acceptable travel experience-- yes, not a Hilton, Marriott or Hyatt, but we did not pay or expect that. It's unfortunate that I believed they would still have the same qualities they used to have. I would not have even expected all we experienced at a \"fly-trap, no-tell, motel.\" I'm embarrassed to say I stayed at this hotel and would never, never recommend it to anybody else.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cYou Must Stay Here!

On a comical note the TV was on the same circuit as the hallway light so if you turned off the hallway light the TV would turn off. Not a big deal since we didn't spend too much time in the room.

One evening we wanted to leave the parks early and so took the Public bus LYNX #56 from the Magic Kingdom ($2). The public bus stopped directly across the street from the hotel at Old Towne which was super convenient! I found the room to be very clean and attractive. The beds were very comfortable (I had the best sleep I probably have ever had at any hotel). The room was well appointed and had two huge queen size beds. Each bed had a nice selection of pillows. The bathroom area was a little cramped, but it didnt bother me at all. I had no problem accessing the free wifi internet. The room provided a basic television which included HBO.

The front desk was always attentive and responsive, including follow-up to ensure satisfaction. In particular, \u201cMaria\u201d was a gem when I asked to be relocated due to two extremely late night hallway parties with back and forth door slamming by 4 rooms of unsupervised youth on my floor. The hotel is a buzz of activity and not particularly quiet or tranquil but most patrons are there for the Disney parks and crash by 10PM. Travel desk provided good information as to fair ticket prices. My first room was in tower 1 with a balcony and faced the rooftop air conditioners with side pool view. My 2nd room faced the front street with a Juliet balcony. I was informed much later that the patio doors should not be opened due to safety regulations. Signage would have been nice. Traffic street noise is prominent as well as the noisy room ventilation units. Yes, on the 8th floor it takes quite some time to get hot water. Observation: Disney = kids = sticky door knobs, TV remotes, elevator buttons and carpet stains. For families, a suite is well worth the money because not only is it larger in size but you have a small fridge & microwave. (Bring/buy kitchen utensils as none are provided) If you come across a Super Target in your travels, stock up as prices are significantly better than the nearest Publix.

My wife booked this hotel through Priceline for $35/night, and after reading some of the reviews here...well, I was scared. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised with the room and friendliness of the staff. Being a frequent Holiday Inn traveler, I have earned a good deal of points with the Intercontinental Hotel chain. A few days before our stay, I called the hotel and asked to speak to a manager. I gave him my ID number and asked if it would be possible to get an upgraded room or at least a room with a mini-fridge in it. After looking up my information, he informed me that he had changed my reservation and put us in a \"Kids Suite.\" Upon arrival, we were quickly and politely checked in. The Kids Suite had a mini-fridge, bunkbeds for the little one, a seperate TV for the little one, and a nice and very comfortable queen size bed seperated from the bunk beds by a wall. The room was not extravagent, but it was nice for the 4 year old to have her own side of the room to play in and watch cartoons. Restaurant - Breakfast was OK. We had tickets for free continental (aka cold) breakfasts during our stay, and we could upgrade to the full hot breakfast for an extra $2.00 It was worth it. We didn't eat dinner there, but the little one had a hot dog and fries from there one night...fries were good! Resort Fee - Yes, they charge a resort fee of $5/day. Yes, I think it's a ripoff, but for what we paid for the room and the complimentary upgrade we got, I wasn't about to complain. Wireless internet was free. At least they stopped charging for that. Friendliness - We never encountered a grumpy/rude employee. I called one night to see if I could get a microwave in the room, and they had one delivered within an hour at no charge. Maybe this was because I'm a \"Points Person\" but who cares! Pool - The little one wanted to swim so we did use the pool and hot tub. Both were clean. The Negatives - Not a whole lot to complain about. Yes, it is an older hotel that has a nice exterior with so-so rooms. Our room was updated, but it did feel a little old. Our room faced the highway so traffic noise was a little noticeable, but the sound of the AC drowned out most of the noise. The bathroom was tiny (real small) but clean. They normally charge $10/day for mini-fridge and/or microwave rental. I dodged this fee b/c of my Points status. Overall, I would stay here again if I were given the upgraded room for free. You are conveniently located to the Disney Parks, and there is plenty of places to eat around the hotel.

The bathroom looked clean at first but the shower was filthy. Black mold growing in the corners on and spot on the way all curtain. It was gross. The worst part was the curtains however. The room has sheer white curtains that close and heavier striped ones that are purely decorative and do not close. And yes, you could see through them. I could see the lady in the next tower laying on her bed in her robe. To make it worse, there is a balcony light that shines into the room and since you can't close the curtains, your room is flooded in bright light all night long.

The hotel is located within a short walking distance of The Old Town attraction and to an array of fast food joints, restaurants and shops.

Within the hotel complex, there are two good-sized pools, one for adults and one for kiddies. However, due to bad planning, the adult pool sees very little sun during the daylight hours because it is in almost constant shade.

Go to their tripadvisor page and look at the pictures. You will not be disappointed. Regardless... I needed to stay somewhere less expensive. And this hotel had great reviews, was well priced, near the Gaylord Palms, and was chain hotel that I like--Holiday Inn. Overall, I paid $68 a night with an advanced rate and AAA discount. Not bad. If you are driving up, they also have discount coupons in the roomsaver hotel books at reststops. I was quickly checked in and skipped the coupon desk because I wasn't going to Disney land nor did I want to be sold a timeshare as discussed by other travelers.

I'm picky and enjoyed it immensely. The room had old boob tubes TVs...which I'm sure will get replaced soon. The bathroom was clean but looked a bit dark and dull. It needed better lighting and some more cheerful color. But most importantly it was clean and had nice towels. I used the hot tub which was clean and proper temperature. Plenty of towels surrounding the pool as well. My only disappointment was how many take out menus were on the floor inside the room. I don't know if the hotel allows this or not? But either way... it needs to stop. I understand Orlando is filled with families looking for cheap eats. But to walk into a room with five or six menus slipped under the door isn't great.

Err why ????????? We were supposed to have a paper delivered daily, didnt happen and when we told the desk staff on checkout they managed to give lack of interest a new meaning. They could not have cared less. Resort charge is another name for how can we get a few more dollars out of visitors. Highway 192 is the Irlo Bronson memorial highway. Old Irlo would be horrified if he could see it..............Just about the worst road I ve ever seen. It makes Internation Drive look elegant . There really are no words to adequately describe it!!!!!!! The hotel is about 4 miles from disney and they do offer a \"complementary shuttle\" which you pay for in the \"resort charge\" so how can it be complementary I ask myself ????. We drove to Disney every day, it only took about 10 minutes but we were somewhat miffed at $12 per day parking there, especially given the costs of their tickets.... We didnt eat in the hotel, there are many restaurants nearby but one to avoid at all costs is one called \"\"Pacinos\"\" I will be commenting on this under a separate heading.

But, it was only for an overnight Disney trip so I figured we could tolerate it. The hotel is in a really nice location- one exit from Animal Kingdom and those areas, and only a few exits from the other Disney Parks and attractions. There are a ton of restaurants near by, including a Mc Donalds right next door. The hotel also has a couple of restaurants (Pizza and something else) in it, but we didn't try them out. The lobby was very clean and nice, and the hotel appeared to be very clean and looked a lot nicer inside than some I have seen. There's an arcade for children, and also a \"childrens theatre\" where they have emptied out a room and put a bunch of kid sized chairs in there (with a few adults ones too), and they have a big flat screen mounted to the wall that was playing Nickelodeon when we looked in there. It was a really cute concept! There's a Disney ticket counter, and a gift shop (I think it was a $10minimum purchase) My only complaint about the lobby is that there is a man standing who at first appeared to be working for the hotel. He had a portable small device in his hand, and asked if we were checking in, so we thought that maybe he had a device to help with wait lines and offer a faster check in (not a bad idea), but he was not. He asked my husband a couple of questions and wanted his email address, claiming it was for a satisfaction survey, but that the emails would come from \"marketing research\". So we declined on that. We were not approached directly about time shares, and since we FL residents, we didn't try to buy Disney tickets there either, just got them at the park. The pool and playground area looked really nice, we didn't have time to try it out. The hotel is also a ton bigger inside than it appears from the outside. There are two towers. Our room was in the first set of towers, facing the main road. We didn't hear any traffic noise, other than set of several fire trucks really late at night- nothing that any hotel window could have drown out. Didn't hear any traffic noise or anything like that. There's also an amusement type park right across the street, they had ferris wheels, bungee jump, skycoaster, etc. Again, a short trip for us and we didn't try that out either. The rooms-- I must say I was pleasantly suprised when we got into our room. It was tastefully decorated and had granite countertops and everything. The bed was comfortable, which is sometimes another issue for me since I sleep on a tempurpedic at home. My husband got us a family room which had bunk beds for the kids- not a good idea for us because our 2 year old was all over them. The top bunk is not \"sealed off\", so he could have climbed over the wall at the top and flipped into the floor on the other side where our bed was. I think this could be a design flaw, just because a kid of any age could have fallen over the top. We definitely kept him off of the top though. The bunk beds were a nice sturdy set, and the ladder was anchored into it so that we didn't have to worry about it falling. I think in general, the rooms are a great size, but the rooms with the bunk beds do feel like pretty close quarters. I would never try to fit more than 4 people in a room like that, and I think for any extended period of time it could start to feel really cramped. Next time we will most likely opt for the regular room, but that's just because we couldn't keep our 2 yr old off of the ladder. The bathrooms are a different story- it takes quite a bit of manipulation to get in there and shut the door, the door barely skims past the toilet as it closes. Not a big issue, because hopefully no one spends too much time in there, but for larger people it may be an actual problem-- it is a very tight fit. We didn't have any issues with parking when we returned about 10pm, not sure if it would be an issue in the busy tourist months of summer. There was also a rental car place on site. Overall I have no complaints about this hotel. We did come home and notice a $25.00 charge to our debit card from them, even though we used Holiday Inn points and got the room for free. We had no clue what the charge was- and still don't- but my husband called them and they took it off that evening.

The room decor was nice and the room was clean. The down sides where the AC unit was very loud and ran all night (the noise never stops). Also the entry door to the room has a large gap under it, that allows a lot of light to come in. The hotel has a pool and hot tub area. We did not use these but could see them from our hotel window. They are just your average pool area, nothing exciting. The location was close to Disney, off 192, right across the street from Old Town. There are many restaurants close by. You would want to have a car if you are staying here has your vacation hotel. My wife read the schedule for the Disney shuttle, and it is not great(two drop off and pick up times).

I booked a kids suite. The check in process was fairly smooth. The desk staff seemed to be very helpful or at least the girl I dealt with at check in was. This level of service was hit or miss later. The hotel, while billed as a Holiday Inn, is actually not a Holiday Inn owned property. It is leased for rights to be a Holiday Inn. This was on a sign in the lobby (small sign). Still no big deal. The place was packed. It was a busy week, so the staff was taxed to some degree. The hotel has good facilities. We only stayed one night so I cannot say much about the hotel as a whole. We did not use the pool. We did not eat at the restaurant. We did not use the bar. We did look at these areas. The lobby also has an area that seems to sell Disney stuff...tickets etc. Here is my take on the hotel facility. We got on the elevator after check in. The elevators are old and seemingly in need of service. They are slow and make a great deal of noise while riding in them. You know the type. Everyone in the elevator looks at each other with a sort of shocked and \"uh oh\" look on their face. The hallway on our floor looked as if the carpet had been laid about 10 years ago. Since that time many things had spilled or been ground into it. It was in bad need of replacement. The room was clean and adequate. It was big enough for us and comfortable. The kids suite was basically no more than a bunk bed with a partition wall. It was not enclosed in any way and opened to the bathroom. The kids had their own TV. The \"bedroom\" for us adults was a queen bed and TV of our own more toward the window in the room. The bathroom was fairly clean but not as clean as I would have liked. The room was also fairly clean. We needed more towels than were provided as they had not left enough for four people in the room. We called the front desk and asked for more towels. They never arrived. We called several times. We were told a few times that we would be sent towels. At one point we were told that they were out of towels and we could not get any!!! This aggravated my wife so badly that she called the front desk and insisted that we get more towels or we needed to move to another hotel. The desk finally agreed to get us more towels if we came downstairs to get them. I went down to the desk as requested and advised that my wife had been told that we could get more towels there. I was then told that they did not have any more towels and they would try to get them to us later...about an hour later. It was nearly 9:30pm at this point. I simply decided not to shower that night and grab a shower in the morning if we had towels. Of course we had better have them at that point!!. A maid arrived at our door just 10 minutes after my return to the room with a few towels in her arms. She advised that she had just been told of our request and that she had plenty of towels. She could not understand why the desk had told us what they had told us. The overall experience was okay at best. I would not stay here again. I know of better places to stay that afford better service and have better, cleaner rooms. The location was not bad. It is close to many things. There are many more places with better location in this price range.

Our rooms were cleaned daily but certainly not to an high standard, we could write our name in the dust under the table and across the wooden headboards. I had to ask for toilet roll twice and the tissue box didnt get replaced on the last 3 days although i asked twice, i also had to find the maid on our floor 3 times to ask for coffee as she never left any and when i did find her she was busy chatting on her mobile sat on a bed in another room. The bedding (valance) on the bed next to the air con was mouldy and this never got replaced in the 2 weeks we stayed. Also we booked our holiday with a travel agent in the UK but the hotel still charged us \u00a356 service charge whilst we were there and when we asked what that was for they said it covered the cost of the hotels facilities re: the pool, internet etc, total rip off when we had paid a full amount to our travel agent, and whilst there i needed to check my emails and they charged me $5 for access to the net. Most of the reception staff were helpful and polite apart from the blonde curly haired young lady who never smiles and needs to go on a customer service course. We have always stayed at this hotel for the last 15 yrs but i have to say this will probably be my last stay as there are others in the area that are similar in price and the staff are more professional. When your staying somewhere for 2 weeks holiday you expect it to be home from home and clean and comfortable but i cannot say this hotel offered that and several people i spoke to agreed and felt the same after all it isnt a motel and we wernt there for a night. Two years ago this hotel was amazing we even got a pillow menu, suprised how much its changed. Very disappointed as this was a well planned family holiday and the hotel let us down.

You are confirmed for the Kidsuite.\" It was important to us that for an 8 night stay the kids had their own beds, etc. After driving 13 hours I arrive at the hotel at 7:30 and what am I told....we're in a room with two double beds. I explained that I had specifically been told during the reservation process that I was booked in the Kidsuite and even had a confirmation email which stated \"KIdsuite\" and there was no \"legalize\" stating that the room type was not confirmed as they tried to tell me on site. I was then told that I could stay the night and then look for alternative accomodations....Are you kidding me? \"Sorry....stay someplace else.\" After demanding to see the manager, another clerk was able to do some typing and magically find us a Kidsuite. Not an experience anyone needs after being on the road for two days. After getting this resolved we were happy with the room, the cleanliness, and the location. Be aware...it is right across the street from a small amusement park which generates a lot of noise and we were treated nightly to the sounds of motorcycle engines whining outside the hotel. For some reason, they also decided to do some landscaping at 5:00 a.m. and we were treated to the sound of a gas powered trimmer seemingly right outside our window even though we were on a mid-level floor. Kids Eat Free was a bit misleading. This hotel has a food court with Pizza Hut and A&W which the deal does not apply at. You must eat in a sit-down dining area and order an \"entree\" off a menu for a minimum $10.99 to qualify for a free item off the kid's menu.

These were our only disappointments as the only real time we spent at the hotel was sleeping. The pool was adequate with a small playground off the side for little ones.

Anyway.... I arrived at The Holiday Inn and right from the start the front desk staff were very helpful at getting me a room, even though I did not have a reservation with them. The room was spacious and VERY clean. No hairs in the tub from previous guests. No hairs or stains on the bedding. And most of all, I could not find a speck of dust anywhere in the room. My only complaints would be that the air conditioning did not work that well. The knobs were broken, and it just wouldn't get cold. Luckily I had a balcony door that I was able to open to let some cooler air in. I was also a bit surprised that as nice as the room was, there was no refridgerator or microwave. Costwise, comparable hotels in the area provide these amenities in the rooms. I guess they have excluded these due to the fact that they offer room service..... So they probably don't want you bringing outside food back to the room to eat later on in hopes of the guests ordering room service instead. A note to the hotel.... Your guests would appreciate not having to keep baby formula or diabetic medications in the ice bucket throughout their stay. I can forgive the lack of a microwave, but for the price you are charging, there should be a fridge in every room. One last note about the room..... The balcony overlooking the pool area is a nice addition. However, be sure to watch small children when out there because the bars on the railing are spaced rather wide. It is also not a very high railing. I'm only pointing that out because tourists and vacationers tend to have a very laxed attitude while on vacation, and common sense is often neglected as a result. As for the location..... Old Town is directly across the street and McDonalds is literally right next door. There are many other restaurants along the strip as well. If you like lobster and crab legs, check out Angels Buffet which is about 10 minutes down the road. Unlike other buffets this buffet never runs out of those two main items. Most of the other items on their buffet are mediocre, but it's good if you like lobster and crab. DINING WARNING - - - Stay away from Captain Nemo's Buffet. It's GROSS!!!! I would compare it to the buffet in the National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation movie where Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) tells the server.... \"I'll have some of the yella\". UGH!!! You're better off eating out of the garbage cans at the McDonalds. Be sure to visit Old Town. Check out the gem shop.... Get some popcorn from the specialty popcorn place...... Grab an A&W root beer float from A&W..... And Ride the bull if you're up for it. Don't bother with the haunted house or the wax museum as they are tourists traps and are REALLY not worth the money. That's about it I guess. I visit Orlando at least once a month. I've stayed at many of the area hotels and have dined at just about every restaurant.

I would not reccomend it to anyone. The first issue we had was with the room itself. The bathroom was so tiny that you could not close the door if you were using the restroom. It was very cramped. We found hairs in the sheets on the bed, and they were not ours. The hotel states that it has a business center where internet can be used. This was not the case. The machines in the business center where you must purchase cards to use the internet were not even functioning. The hotel dining area was also terribly overpriced. My biggest complaint about the hotel was the area in the lobby where you can purchase tickets for the theme parks. My husband and I thought it would be a good idea to purchase tickets before we went to the park. We went to see the gentlemen who was busy helping a woman and completely ignored us for a good ten minutes. Then he quoted us a price for the tickets which was higher than the price that we would have been charged at the gate. We did not purchse our tickets at the hotel and went to the park and ended up saving 15.00 by purchasing our tickets at the gate, this was for a Disney theme park. I find that this was highly unethical and reported a complaint with Disney as they are a Disney partner hotel.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Midlands", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel...can't wait to stay again\u201d", "Author": "jayniecakes", "ReviewID": "UR20990556", "Content": "What a fantastic hotel...we had to re-book our holiday to Florida as we were one of the XL customers where our original booking got cancelled...we booked this through expedia and we were not disappointed.

I know it changed companies and has been refurbished but it was still the same hotel we loved back then.

After travelling to Georgia and S Carolina we returned to Kissimmee and managed to get the last 8 nights of our holiday at the hotel. The new bride was so terified there would be no vacancies she did not get out of the car until it was confirmed they had two suites for us. The hotel is in a great area with the Old Town just across the road and the parks also so near. The staff were all so friendly especially Vanessa the receptionist, who gave us a lesson on how to get our eyebrows perfect, Thomas and Xiomara in the restuarant who served us every day and always had time for a chat. (PS if you are fed up with the buffet breakfast the hotel had nice and cheap breakfast items you can order separately). We paid only 60 dollars plus taxes for each room which contained a queen bed, usual shower/bathroom, hairdryer, microwave, fridge and coffee machine, only down side was no breakfast included.

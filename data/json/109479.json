We chose to stay here because we were on our way back to Lawrence, Kansas from a week down in Port Aransas, Texas. Dallas/Ft. Worth was the halfway point home and this particular area was really close to one of our favorite restaurants, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen. Basically, after traveling from the beach for 7 hours we just wanted to have a good meal, rest our heads, and head out early the next day.However, our plans were rudely interrupted the next morning when we awoke. I parked my car right next to the managers office/check-in under a very bright light that night after we finished eating, but apparently, someone decided that they wanted my car stereo and other items (including my 7year old son's suitcase) and broke out a window to take these items. The night manager said he didn't hear a thing, although there was glass all over the parking lot from my window.Don't stay there, there is no security or monitoring on the premises. The hotel posts a sign in the parking lot, stating ...Not responsible for lost or stolen items. How inviting for a thief.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR786162845", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "tkofford"}, {"Content": "In need of repairs I was attending a Gift Market in Dallas and booked five nights stay in the Days Inn on Northwest Highway beginning on June 23rd. I entered the lobby about 8:30 p.m. behind another market attendee from Kansas who was told at the desk that his room that he had reserved a month earlier was not quite ready. He was told that the maid should have it ready in about an hour. He asked why maids were cleaning rooms at 8:30 at night and left very upset to look for another motel. My reserved room was ready and my wife and I unloaded and headed for our room. We had to pass a maid and cart in the hall to get to our room. When we checked out our room we found the bathroom vanity top to be loose and leaning about one inch from back to front. My wife inspected the bath towels and found them to be extremely small and worn. There was actually a hole the size of a quarter in one of them. They should have been thrown away a long time ago. I went to the front desk to ask for better towels and there were two other couples complaining about the condition of their rooms. I informed the clerk that we would only be staying for one night instead of five. We located another motel farther out on Northwest Highway and had a very enjoyable stay.", "Date": "Jul 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR725892929", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d109479-r14858471-Days_Inn_Suites-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "109479", "Price": "$79"}}

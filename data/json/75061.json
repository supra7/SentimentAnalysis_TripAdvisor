For the past 7-8 years we've stayed in condos or houses using vacation rental websites. To be honest we've enjoyed staying in props like that and have shunned hotels/motels. HOWEVER, lately I've had a change in perspective. After a recent inquiry from a vacation home rental site, their quote included a: $39 booking fee, $40 non-refundable damage waiver, a $100 cleaning fee and 12.5% sales tax. OUTRAGEOUS! A $100/night prop ends up being $160/night. Unacceptable. That brings me to the Dream Inn. After doing a cursory web search on Trip Advisor I located this little jewel. This is a small motel right on the beach. Current marketing specialists would probably categorize this as a \"boutique\" property. With less than 50 rooms. We had two other friends coming with us to stay and another couple that lived in nearby New Smyrna Beach that would day visit. The property is clean, comfortable and conveniently located. With a private pool overlooking the ocean, two grilles (charcoal fired), and a separate lounging area oceanfront. We booked the 3 bedroom \"villa\" that came with 2 complete bathrooms. It is not oceanfront but has an oceanview. 2 bedrooms had king beds and the 3rd room had 2 queens. While the two king rooms are separate, the room with the queens is not private. So if you had 3 adult couples, there may be a privacy issue, great if you had kids though. The room with Queens serves as the living room in this configuration with a 4-seat table, another small table with two chairs is in the kitchen. There is another 'lockout' door that could you add a 4th bedroom and full bath to a make a 4/3 configuration. There was a 2 burner cooktop, two microwaves and two mini-fridges in our configuration. We like to cook some meals so the cooktop was a must have feature for our trip. As indicated earlier, all our rooms were clean, the furnishings were in good condition and the decor is quite 'tropical' As indicated in another review, the sheets were pink! Wow! Let me assure you, as a man, I was more concerned with if the bed was comfortable and that the sheets were of good quality, soft and smooth. I was not offended by all that pink. Give me a break. We had no issues with the Wi-Fi, for our laptop or phone. They actually have two gateways to access it, one on each end of the building. The staff was friendly, efficient and helpful, telling us about local dining deals, discounts and such. There is a pizza joint directly across the street, a IHOP in the next building, a Subway next to them and a Denny's a block away; all offering a discount (show your room key) A full grocery store (Publix) is less than a mile away and most importantly, an ABC liquor store is also less than a mile away.

The fellow at the front desk (don't know name - dark hair) friendly and helpful. Second plus is a plus with some reservations - the location directly on the beach. I say with reservations because the access to the beach is shared with a public entrance for cars to and from the beach - cars are coming and going as you are walking down or up the ramp. I would be wary if I had small children with me. Third plus - the room was relatively clean. Now the downsides. We had a garden view room; more a parking lot view than garden. The room was very small. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen - smaller than the \"standard\" on cruise ships and that means really small. When using the toilet I rammed into something at every turn - sitting down I hit my leg on the toilet itself. The towel rack was so close to the toilet I hit my shoulder on that. When I went to flush the toilet I hit my butt on the handle going into the bathroom. I am not very tall or extremely fat, nor am I clumsy. Hate to think what it would be like for a 6 foot 200 pound large guy. The A/C was at the back wall of the room. It did not cool the entire room very well (towards the front small table) but it sure gave you a blast of arctic air when you were at the frig or entering the bathroom. Very uneven cooling because of where the A/C unit was located. Also the room was musty and both me and my husband experienced allergy symptoms while in the room. Now the following is I'm sure a matter of personal taste but there was way too much pink. The sheets were pink as well as the pillow cases. The bedspread had an awful lot of pink. Even the blanket was pink. I'm female and all that pink was bothering me - don't know what some macho guy might think of it. The TV reception was awful for the first 25 channels or so - mostly snow. After about channel 25 the reception got better. Had no one to complain to since the front office closes at 6:00 p.m. Now, I have never stayed at any hotel or motel that did not have an ice machine (unless it was a suite or condo that had a full size frig with automatic ice maker). There is no ice machine here. Be prepared to have to walk across the street to the Seven Eleven and pay about $3.00 for a bag of ice. I don't know, maybe the ocean front rooms are much better (not available when we booked). I just know that me and my husband were very uncomfortable in the room and could not wait to leave. For the money there are much better options in the Daytona Beach area. After our stay here we went to the Days Inn about a half a mile away. That was lovely and about the same price range.

They were around everyday. I ALWAYS saw them doing some sort of work or walking around checking on stuff. They would strike up a conversation with you like you had known them for awhile, but they were still super professional. The room always looked nice once she got done in there and we had no problems. I could go on and on about how nice and wonderful this place was. Honestly, if you are not wanting to stay in a super expensive hotel then you need to stay here. Don't go to holiday inn or wherever else is a little more expensive than Dream Inn because you will not get the same curtesy or welcomed feeling as if you were here. I cannot recommend it enough!

We were able to get courtyard rooms for $49.95/night. This is a nice mom and pop motel located right on the beach about 5 miles south of the Daytona Boardwalk. We didn't really need the ocean front room because we could see the ocean as soon as we walked out of our room door. I did get to see the oceanfront rooms and it does appear that they have been updated more recently then the courtyard rooms and appear a little nicer. The property that the Dream Inn sits on kind of small lot but it is beautifully landscaped. Steve was working on the landscaping everyday we were there. There were several charcoal grills available for guests to use as well as several concrete patio tables. We ate at these several times during our stay. The pool was excellent. It was heated and very clean! The lounge chairs were a little worn but still comfortable. One room with a kingsize bed (rm 130) and the other room with a queen size bed and a kitchenette (rm129). The rooms had a small door adjoining the rooms together; the door isn't even big enough to move a chair from one room to another but was able to allow access for us to move from room to room. The rooms were clean and had tropical bedspreads. The bathrooms were clean but dated. They had a watersaver type of showerhead in the showers (our rooms had large showers, no bathtub). My girls really liked it as it increased the water pressure giving a more forceful shower. The airconditioning worked extremely well in both rooms. The only problem was the location of the air unit. In room 129 the a/c unit is in the kitchenette area so you either had to turn it off while cooking or feel it blowng directly against you. Same thing in room 130 except it was in the area of the blow dryer. The rooms had a safe in them to secure your valuables. I liked the fact that I was able to set my password to a number that I could remember. Room 129 had a flatscreen tv with a dvd player attached. That was an extra special treat. We made all of our meals in our room using the kitchenette. The stove worked great. The oven got hotter than the actual temperature on the dial. It only took one time to find that out. I also followed the advice of others and brought some of my favorite cookware. (I know Steve would have gotten me what I needed if I asked however it was easier just to bring what I know I needed and liked). The sink in the kitchenette is the size of a bar sink. I would have liked it to be a little larger or at least provide a strainer so that food particles wouldn't get stuck in the top of the drain. The worst part of the kitchenette was the size of the fridgerator. It was the size of a bar fridge. I believe that most guests stay at the Dream Inn for longer than two days. We used the refridgerators in both of our rooms and still needed to use a cooler for drinks. Hopefully when, and if, they do more renovations it will include a larger fridge, even an apartment size fridge would have been appreciated. The hotel does offer free wifi but isn't very accessible in the room because of the concrete walls. It would be better for them to offer wired internet access then wifi. We didn't usually use the internet until evening time and would have been nice to use the internet inside the room instead of having to go outside into the courtyard. Steve was helpful and did offer to reset the system if we were having problems with the wifi. Parking is included but is very limited. Steve was good about making sure that cars were towed if there weren't spaces available for guests. Guests could have done a better job of parking between the lines but obviously not a hotel issue. Public transit is available and you could get an unlimited pass for pretty cheap. 7/11, Ihop, and pizza place are conveniently across the street from the hotel. Cross at your own risk as drivers don't seem to care for pedestrians. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and is definately a deal for the money.

Its not much of a courtyard, but all you have to do is turn your head to the left and you see the beach. So I was not disappointed about that or the location of our room. For the price, I was very pleased however there were a few things that could have been better. The electrical outlets are too big for plugs. I'm not sure if its because they have been used to so much but it was difficult to keep the plug in the outlet. It kept falling out. The TV had no RCA hookup.

Through the causeway one passes the ocean front rooms, and steps out to the terraced area above the beach with more palms, umbrella tables, chaises and, of course, the ocean beyond.

How romantic, instead of an ocean coastal view we had a huge secutity light to sit under, I suppose that was a substitute for a romantic full moon. The photos also show extra towels on the edge of the jacuzzi. None exisited in our room. The window in the sliding balcony door had not been washed in ages, the morning dew hightlighted the dirt specks instead of the sun coming up over the horizon.

She was rude, short tempered, and at times condescending. If this is their \"brand of charm and personal attention offered...I DON'T WANT IT. I came very close to picking another hotel but thought I would give the Dream Inn a try. The gentleman that checked us in was cordial, but not overly inviting or friendly. We got to our room, on the surface things looked fairly clean so we immediately got dressed to go to the pool. Once at the pool I was very disappointed. The water in the pool was so cloudy that I refused to get in. I would not have been able to see my feet in that water.....gross. We stayed on the beach for a while then returned to the room. Once I returned and began really looking at the cleanliness I was disgusted. Their website says this about their rooms.... We are a unique small property with the luxuries of a large resort. Dream Inn is located in Daytona Beach Shores Florida. The use of the word luxuries is laughable. I understand that this is a small property, I have stayed at family owned, small places before and they were not at nasty as this one. The shower was old, cracked and moldy. They tried to make it look newer but they just painted over the mold and stains. I wore my flip flops in the shower and in the room at all times. The window unit air conditioner was not strong enough to cool the room appropriately so my husband had to purchase a fan to help with cooling the room down. The bathroom linens were old, tattered, and mismatched. Even the toilet paper sucked, thank God I have learned over the years to bring my own when I travel, which I did in this case. We went to dinner and then got ready for bed. I pulled the covers back only to discover HAIR everywhere. Long black hairs, pubic hair, etc. The sheets were stained....I don't want to imagine what the stains were. Needless to say I stood for much of the night. Had we not had plans for breakfast in the morning with friends I would have driven home that night for sure. I was not able to ask for a different room or that the sheets be changed because after 5:00 pm there is no one in the office. If you call them and ask them to come back because of a problem there is a $50 FEE and it could take up to an hour !! If you have friends who are coming to visit you at the hotel there is a fee for them per person. In the morning I wanted to check out immediately however, there was no one in the office until 9:00 am. We left our keys in the room and left anyway.

So after carefully reading the reviews for Daytona Beach, I chose Dream Inn . I reserved a room well in advance, requesting a second floor kitchen room with private balcony and two queen beds. I called the day before we arrived and confirmed that request as well and was assured that is what we were getting. Upon check in, we were told we had a first floor unit and the second floor with private balcony wasn't available, only for one night and we needed three. The \"balcony\" we had on the first floor had a big glass window in front of it which was filthy and there were tables/chairs just on the other side of it, so when people were sitting there they could see directly into our room. We kept our blinds closed most of the time! The man checking us in (son?) was very unfriendly and was quite rude. Of course we couldn't cancel at that point, we would have been charged anyway. And by the way, there are signs EVERYWHERE about all the extra charges for everything, from early check in charges, to late check out charges, to charges for not washing the dishes upon checkout, internet charges, for charges if you needed to call them to come open your room if you lost your room key after hours. Yes, the hotel is old, which would have been OK if had been CLEAN. I kept flip flops on the whole time because I didn't want to walk on the carpeting; there was mold in the bathroom tiles in the shower/tub; I had to ask the housekeeper to actually come vacuum my room and I asked her to do the change the sheets, which she did NOT do. You need to wash dishes before you leave, which means the dishes you provide DO NOT get washed again by the housekeeper and when we pulled out some dishes to use when we got there, they were SLIMY and not clean. So whoever was there before us just basically put them in the cabinets to look like they washed them. YUCK! We didn't even use the pool, as the water was the temperature of a HOT TUB and had no desire to be HOT in the 95 degree summer temperatures - they could probably save alot of money if they DIDN'T heat their pool in the summer! I asked for beach towels and had to go to the office to get them, and they were even unfriendly about that! Anyway, I'm not usually one to complain about things, but this terrible place doesn't deserve a good review from our visit and hopefully someone else may think twice about staying there. I knew it wasn't the \"Hilton\" when I reserved a room, but I certainly didn't expect it to be as awful as it was.

The jacuzzi in the jacuzzi suite was clean and looked as it did in the magazine pictures. Our suite was right in front of the beach, which was a beautiful oceanfront view. The desk people were rather pleasant and they took care of a couple minor problems within minutes, day or night. Plus, this hotel is perfectly positioned between the craziness of downtown and the serenity of Port Orange and Ponce Inlet. Last 2 nights we did stay in courtyard room (reg. room). That was pretty plain, but still good air conditioning and nice seating area right outside our door. Definite vacation spot, planning to return soon.", "Date": "June 18, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Dream Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34172-d75061-Reviews-Dream_Inn-Daytona_Beach_Florida.html", "Price": "$59 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3217 South Atlantic Avenue</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Daytona Beach Shores</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Daytona Beach</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32118</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "75061", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/8a/f0/ba/view-from-oceanfront.jpg"}}

I was in the 900 building on the third floor. I honestly thought the resort was very nice. It was clean and very well kept. The location is excellent and makes getting to the Disney parks or Rt 192 very easy. The pools are all heated and were very nice. In fact while we were there they were building a new gazebo like structure made out of solid cedar. The rooms were very nice and well maintained. It was well stocked with everything you could need. The TV's were not of name brand and the picture quality was less than stellar, but we did not watch tv that much. The one in the bedroom was NOT a flat screen and a little old. With that said, it was very nice to have a full kitchen, and a washer and dryer. MY ONLY COMPLAINT, was that you DID NOT have wireless access without buying some sort of activity card that was 25.00 for the week. They masked it by offering some discounts on services, etc...but COME ON...give everyone wireless. Motel 6 has wireless. Honestly that was kinda cheesy I thought. If you want to sell an activity card, then do it, but give me wireless. To be fair, they did have two computers that you could use if they were not busy, but were limited by time and depending on who was waiting in line.. Front desk, and personnel were very friendly. Yes it is a Time share, but we told them we were not interested, and we were not hassled at ALL. They told me that the owner would not allow high pressure sales.

We stayed in a recently renovated room and it was quite large and nicely decorated. We had a 1 bedroom and it was plenty of room for my husband, myself, 19 year old daughter and 6 year old son. We stayed here for 1 reason . . . to go to Disney. We were in the room very little and did not use any of the amenities except for the pool on 2 afternoons. The kitchen was stocked with plenty of items to cook with. We went to the grocery store the first day and stocked up on essentials. It was nice to have a full size fridge. We only cooked breakfast a few days so we did not use the oven or microwave, just the stove top to cook eggs. We did notice grills available to cooking, but did not use any. There is no real restaurant on site but did see people ordering pizza by the pool and having drinks. I would recommend eating at nearby places such a Sweet Tomatoes, Chevy's, Carrabba's, etc. I went online to each of those restaurants websites and was able to sign up for coupons which were a great money saver. We also used the back gate to travel back and forth from Disney. Very convenient and easy to navigate. The closest park is Animal Kingdom. There is a McDonalds that you pass on the way to Disney through the back gate that made for a quick breakfast but also allowed us to stock up on packets of salt, pepper, spenda, ketchup, jelly, etc. Saved us from having to buy this at the store. Parking was the only issue we had. We were never able to park in front of our building. We usually had to park around the corner, which is not a huge deal, but at Midnight you wish you were able to park in front. If you are looking for a resort, I don't feel this is the place to stay. If you are looking for a clean, spacious, condo then I would recommend it. I was the perfect place to fit our needs for this trip, which really was just a clean place to sleep.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beavercreek, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cnice price and location!\u201d", "Author": "creekmom2", "ReviewID": "UR127751470", "Content": "We stayed here a week at the end of March in room 523. There were 5 of us. Our room was a 1 bedroom with a King sized bed and there were two pull-out couches out in the living room areas. The couch beds were uncomfortable- that's why I gave Sleep Quality the lower ranking. The condo itself was clean and huge. Full kitchen with dishwasher, dining room, two living room areas and a two full bathrooms. We had a washer/dryer in the closet too. The back patio balcony was fully screened with a table and 4 chairs. The bathroom off the living room area was smaller - just enough room for a shower/tub, toilet and sink. The bathroom off the 1 bedroom was huge! Huge jacuzzi tub (which we didn't get a chance to try), a huge walk in shower, long vanity with two sinks, a closet, and a separate toilet room. We arrived at 3pm, but they would not check us in until 4pm. So we went grocery shopping while we waited - two grocery places close by! The main pool was huge but it was a little dirty on the bottom. We only had time to go twice during evening hours and it wasn't crowded then. They had movies and activities planned but we didn't try those as we were out and about most of the time. Animal Kingdom is a 5 minute drive away - go the back way to the parks! We only called down to housekeeping once to get more laundry detergent. They brought it to us within the 1/2 hour. They don't clean rooms daily, so hang up your towels for reuse. You also have to take out your own trash. They came in once during the week to replace all our towels and took the trash, but didn't do any other cleaning. Some pros: Huge condo nice price convenient to Disney parks security lots of pool space Some cons: couch beds are uncomfortable you have to pay for wi-fi/internet access that is slow the tv in the main bedroom was old and the cable would go in and out not many places to eat close by. places seemed to have been closed down. you can hear your neighbors (but it wasn't bad enough to bother us) observation: the girls behind the check-in desk I think were more interested in talking to each other than wanting to help you check in. I felt like I was \"bothering\" them for showing up! Also they didn't mention anything to me during check-in about the wi-fi/activity card - if I didn't know about it ahead of time from these reviews I would have had to make another trip to their counter!

My wife asked for the supervisor then she finally found our reservation. Upon arrival at 10pm, I spoke to Nina, everything was going well until she asked me to write the names of people who will be checked in so I wrote my name, my wife, and my 4 yr old daughters name..that's when it all went downwards. Her response....we have a problem, I can't check you in. You reservation is only for 2 persons. I told her this was a timeshare gift from my dad. She responded well you can get an upgrade for 150 bucks good for 4 people with kitchen and that depends if there is a room available or else you have to call RCI. At this point I was already frustrated so I told her do I have a choice? And she never responded. She finally got us a room and I paid the additional 150. When we got into the room 524C to my surprise there is only a full bed so I had my wife called Nina asking why there is only one bed. She explained the room is good for 4 people. The other 2 can sleep on the rollaway couch. My wife asked if there are other rooms available and Nina said all RCI rooms are the same. At this point we are both frustrated it's almost midnight so I told her we'll just deal with it. How can you have a room for 4 people when there's only one bed good for 2 persons? I had to sleep in a rollaway couch for 6 nights. Springs are so uncomfortable. My back hurts until now. The room itself has an adjoining door to another room and we can hear the kids in the other room. We can also hear the footsteps above our room. We saw 2 cockroaches on the outdoor stairs to the parking lot (left in the morning and when we got back in the evening it's still there) The rooms are very clean, pool is heated. Well maintained grass. It's secured and the security people always smiles everty time we get back from the parks. This could have been a very good resort except the front desk lack basic customer service. Nina I'm sorry if I gave your name but a simple \"SORRY\" would have been nice. Even if it's our fault for not confirming our rooms it would be nice to hear \"sorry if there has been confusion\" words like that makes customers feel at ease. You want to leave a lasting impression to customers and our experience talking to you wasn't pleasing at all. My comments hopefully can be taken with a grain of salt. By the way my dad called RCI and complained about our experience in Silverlake..when he reserved it he mentioned we have a kid so RCI will give us a 150 credit on our next vacation.

The entry door actually opened to a foryer shared with another room. We opened our room door and was pleasently surprised at the layout of the room, and the accomodations. The furniture was better than adequate, the kitchen was well equipped, the bath was large and had the washer/dryer unit hid away in a closet-like room. It was veary clean and (considering it was Florida, not a bug to be found... wife looked closely). The ground has 3 pools (1 adult pool just outside of building 900) and a large pool area with a snake/bar area at the main pool location. Also a great fitness room and a just so-so arcade for kids (older video game machines and a couple of fun pin ball machines... remember those?). Security was not an issues as there are only 2 ways to get in and they are monitored 24/7 with gate guards. The resort was about 3-4 miles from Disney and/or Universal Studio theme parks and easy to get to. They offered discount vouchers to local golf courses and tours... We didn't take those so I cannot comment on them, but we saw many folks in the main lobby waiting for the buses. Many stores, resturants close by and grocery stores as well. For the money, this was a great stay and we will be going back again next year.

I only stayed overnight, and only experienced one of the small hotel-style rooms, but since first impressions are always critical, I will most likely not be back. The check-in process was relatively smooth and the young ladies at the front counter were very pleasant and friendly. The first two things that annoyed me for a resort of this alleged caliber was an additional mandatory $16 housekeeping fee and WiFi you had to pay for ($10/night or $40 a week, with limited devices allowed to connect - are you kidding me? There are $40/night motels that offer free, unlimited WiFi). The young lady apparently detected my displeasure at this revelation and since I was only staying overnight and had one laptop, gave me the access codes gratis. We were then directed to another desk to get our parking passes and directions to the building. On the plus side, there was no attempt or mention of a timeshare pitch, probably since we were guests of a club member. Oddly enough, when I asked this young lady where was a good place to eat, she directed us out into town, never mentioning the very nice bar/grill right there on the property, poolside! Although it was a bit pricy (as to be expected) the food was very good and the service was quick and very pleasant. The pool complex was very impressive and was probably the nicest part of the whole resort (there was also a theater, game room, golfing simulator, and other value added features, but I didn\u2019t try any of them). There were 3 of us traveling together so at booking time (on the website) we had requested one room with two doubles and one with a queen. It wasn't until we dragged all our stuff up to the rooms (on the 5th floor of the 7000 building - at least they had 3 elevators) that we discovered A) there was only one queen bed in the rooms and B) the key for the other room did not work. Thinking there was a mistake, we hauled everything back down to the car and went back to the front desk. This is when we were introduced to a young man who appeared to be some sort of shift supervisor. The shortness of his temper appeared to match his stature, as the young ladies were all taller then he was. His attitude quickly grated on me, as he explained that our request for double beds at booking meant nothing, and there were no such rooms available, but that we could upgrade to a suite for $400+ dollars a night. Looking at the other reviews, do you see a recurring bait-and-switch to a more costly room thing appearing here? We finally decided to book a 3rd single room and they recoded the key for the ones that did not work. These new keys also did not work, so we had to make a 3rd trip to the front desk. Finally in our very small rooms, the first thing that struck me was the beat up furniture (the night stands had chunks of lamination missing off the top), the tiny TVs (I think my laptop screen was almost as big), and the over all cheap look of the cabinetry. There was a microwave, a mini-fridge (empty), and an odd assortment of dishes and cups, yet no coffee maker or ice bucket. The only apparent ice machine was on the ground floor outside, near the pool, and I had to use a soup bowl to take some back to the room. The WiFi login/password given to me at check-in did not work so I decided to call the front desk. There was nothing resembling a facilities phone book to be found so I took a chance and dialed 0. Good guess, as the altitudinally and attitudinally challenged young man answered. After explaining my troubles, I was put on hold for a few seconds and when he returned, I was given a new login and password. On a whim, I tried the old login name and the new password and viola, they worked. Signal was weak and not very fast, but it was enough to check email, Facebook, etc. Overall the room was clean, the bathroom was large and well provided (although the only horizontal shelf in the tub was barely big enough to hold the complimentary bar of soap \u2013 I paid a $16 extra housekeeping fee so yes, I used the complimentary toiletries). The bed was firm, clean and comfortable. On the very small balcony was two chairs and a small table, perfect for a couple to relax (although on the backside of the building the only view consisted of the parking lot and undeveloped scrub land \u2013 sort of fitting for my visit up to that point). The guard at the front gate provides a increased feeling of security, like a gated community (the one on duty when we arrived had a heavy Scottish accent and was very pleasant) First impression summary for the \u201csingle bed, hotel-style rooms\u201d and short term exposure to the facilities: Great potential, less than adequate execution, lack of attention to detail. And give that shift supervisor an attitude adjustment or reassign him to a position that doesn\u2019t involve guest interaction.

I have stayed at the following timeshare properties: Vistana, Westgate, Orange Lake, Mystic Dunes & now Silver Lake so I know what I am talking about! :o) I will start w/ customer service! As potential owners (and Silver Lake must know that every single guest walking through the door is a potential owner!). We completed check in for our 2 bedroom room and were sent to get a time for our 90 min. timeshare presentation at 5:02pm. As we approached a women starts literally flipping out saying \"I close at 5pm, I close at 5pm ... \" \"I can't help you, I close at 5pm\" she then angry tells the people at the front desk she can't help us. Again \"it's 5pm, I close at 5pm\" OKAY we get it you close at 5pm! To us it's no big deal and we can come back but really you have to throw a fit and that is our 1st impression of Silver Lake. We are excited to be there after a long day of traveling. We get to our room. We are a family of 6 ... mom, dad & 4 children ages 2-14. According to the Silver Lake website and to our booking agent we booked a 2 bedroom ... one King bed in master bedroom and 2 double beds in 2nd bedroom which is standard in almost all timeshare resorts!!! Well we get 1 king bed and 1 queen bed (+ sleeper sofa) well that isn't going to work for us! My 13 year old son & 14 year old daughter are not going to share a bed! The other two are little girls and are fine in one bed. So we call down and this is where it gets horrible! Get the run around w/ the girl at the front desk. If we want two beds in the 2nd bedroom then we have to pay $175 for the other bed! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? Searched high and low and nothing on their website says such a thing! She promises a manager will call us back. 45 min. later we get a call from a very cocky male manager. After arguing with us says that our 6 person that fits in the room like the website states says that we can upgrade to an 8 person room for the $175 more. 0_0 Then says and I quote \"you didn't find the need to call back and verify your reservation and the bed situation\" Ummmm no. We vacation all the time and never once have called back the hotel, after they stated we would have two beds in 2nd bedroom, to verify that fact. I mean who would? They had no 2 beds available (so they say) and we could call back the next day. We decided at this point we would not change rooms. We needed to grocery shop that evening and repacking it all and moving was more then a hassle at this point. So our vacation started off bad. :( The 3 girls shared a bed for 7 nights! I will add that another manager did call us a few days later to apologize for our problems we encountered. Of course b/c of this we in no way intended to buy with this company! We did do the timeshare and our representive said this manager was in trouble for the way he treated several guests! The tour was 90 min. as promised and they did not hastle us in any way to purchase. As for the room .... it was nice and clean. We were in the 1000 building. Things I did not care for that may or may not influence you: no counter space in kitchen. We stored most dry goods in microwave. My biggest peave is there is NO table on patio! We love eating breakfast at the table on our previous visits to Disney! They have to two chairs a snack table out there. The kids like sitting out there also but with only 2 chairs you can't really do that! Bed soft enough, pillows comfortable enough. Master bathroom shower was kind of inconveniant. There was no space to put anything but a small bar of soap! I think they would be able to put one small shelf in the corner to put shampoo's etc. They do have Bath & Body Work products which was nice! Bathroom big and roomy though. Pools nice and big and warm. They have fun activities, live singers etc. A very nice ice cream bar at 2pm. We enjoyed that. The property was very small and in my opinion aimed for the older crowd.

This was our first return to Silver Lake and were surprised when the room we were staying in, hadn't changed. But lets start at the beginning. Check-in was a very lengthy process. As part of a timeshare sales pitch, you first have to sign in with the RCI sales people. Then with the front desk. Took a good 20 plus minutes to get through it all and I was the only one there. We had requested a crib in advance. Called a few days before to confirm. And arrived to our room with no crib. Called down to dispatch who sent security. They couldn't help and contacted housekeeping. After 20 minutes, called the front desk again. And then waited another 20 minutes. Called the front desk again before finally getting someone. The gentleman who came to set up the crib was very polite. But he brought the wrong frame. Needless to say, after several attempts and trips back to housekeeping, almost an hour and a half after check-in, we had a crib. The room, as I said, was dated. Apparently, some have been upgraded, but not the one they gave us. Funny that they want to make a sale and they don't put their best foot forward. Spacious main room, with decent size and equiped kitchen. TV could use an upgrade, especially the second one in the bedroom. The bedroom has very little room left since the bed takes up most of the space. Had trouble fitting the crib in and took out some of the furniture from the room. The bed was comfy but we slept on the pull-out couch so my son could sleep in the bedroom. Very old couch and not comfortable at all as a sleeper. Bathroom was nice but also dated. The jacuzzi jets needed some cleaning and they had done some damage control to the jets. The shower head was at about 5'8\" level so I had to duck down just to wash my hair (I'm only 5'10\"). The pool area is nice and somewhat heated. The Europeans and British guests seemed to enjoy the water. It was a little cold for us Canucks. We had a room facing the pool and it could get a little noisy at times. They run some activities like a Caribbean resort, even in the evening. Not so good with a little one that goes to bed by 7:30. But it didn't seem to bother him. Carpet in the hallway was nasty and needs to be redone. We were in 1800 building, which is older, and could use a lot of work. The timeshare pitch was horrible. They hadn't even changed their pitch from the previous visit. Even with my 1 year old being cranky, they \"had\" to keep us the full 90 minutes. The salesperson had the nerve to tell us, \"don't do a timeshare again if you have no intention of buying\". I wasn't the one offering the promotion. I understand you work off commision but if I'm wasting your time, give me the tickets I was offered and send me on my way. She said she closes 30-40% of her pitches. I don't see how. The resort is located near Animal Kingdom and is great if you are going to Disney. At Xmas however, traffic is horrible in Orlando. Going anywhere else, especially to the other side of the city where Mall at Millenia or The Florida Mall are, is atrocious.

I can also comment without a doubt in my mind that getting involved in this resort was the worst decisions ever. It was unmistakably a bait-and-switch! This resort no only has this ruin several days in my live, but it also ruined many family vacations. In the beginning everything seems ok, ok services, ok location, but never a 5 start resort as they claim to be. In my last visit, this past December 2011, we were staying for seven days by the six days we left the resort. When we first arrived, we were excited. The website (and other travel websites) shows new furniture, elegant cabinets and granite counters in the kitchens and luxurious baths - they actually read \"luxurious\" on the website. Of course, why not after paying thousand and thousand of dollar in maintenance fee over the years, just to be \u201cOwner of a 5 Star resort\u201d and only able to use the resort about 4 times in the past 14 years, I was ready to enjoy my so call \u201cInvestment\u201d. I could not be more wrong. The Resort looks just like always. The same furniture, the same cabinets nothing is new, like they show on the website not even the new buildings. To make matters worse! They charged for almost everything if you used more than their rationed amount of toilet tissue, paper towels etc. you will be charge. For example, .95 cents for every additional roll of toilet tissue. We were given 2 rolls for 1 week. The master bath shower door (sliding) was unclean. The cleaning items seems like they bough it from the general dollar store (everything cheap). The fact that we when to the front desk in an effort to get a simple mop to clean the floor and were told that the sponge mop for wholesale dollar store was the only thing available. Should give you an idea of how this place operate. I still have the pictures with my wife cleaning the floor with a dirty towel using her feets \u201cold school\u201d. What a fantastic memories for family vacations. There were no housekeeping offered, fresh/clean towels every 4 days, and not even change the dirty ones. They just enter the room put the towel on the kitchen counter; that is it. Ha! Ha! As an Owner, I get to carry out my own garbage - I might as well have stayed home with all the house work we had to do. Oh! and honestly had to pay $31.25 to use Wi-Fi for the week, even at the cheapest hotels it's free! This resort has become a huge joke. I requested a 2/2 unit that hold at least 8 persons as I am entitled to on my contract and when I arrive I was informed that I was going to get a 2/2 unit, but I was only allowed to accommodate 6. They could explain this when I made my reservation, but NO! The waited until I showed up on the front desk to tell me, even when I called a week prior to confirm my reservation. So, here I was, in the front desk force to rent an extra room in a nearby hotel to accommodate the rest of the family. You can imagine how upset (for lack of better words) I was. In top of all that, the unit was not a real 2/2, it was 2 connecting rooms. Of course, we made a complaint to the so call \u201cmanager\u201d in the front desk, which was non-responsive and could not care less about costumer service protocol. The manager at the front desk was extremely rude, and in my opinion, she needs to rethink her occupation. They all seemed to HATE their jobs! Bottom line, Service is non-existent from the front desk, management and housekeeping. I was extremely disappointed with just about everything in this resort. If you have read the testimonials, you will notice that I am telling the truth and that not much has changed at this resort in the last 14 years. You will also, notice that the \u201cexcellent\u201d reviews are from peoples that just visited this resort once, probably spend more than anybody else, because they did not know any better. The Silver Lake Resort in Orlando, Florida had become something more akin to a decaying Cheap Motel; and I wish I were exaggerating here, after all I am an owner, but sadly, I\u2019m not! This resort had never been a Gold Crown Resort not even 15 years ago, now is just an hack and run-down eyesore. I am warning anyone considering doing business with in this place please, Please, PLEASE, STAY AWAY FROM THEM. After this last episode, I will never stay here again and will never recommend this as a place to stay for even my worst enemy. I would rather stay in a $30 dollar a night hotel than this JUNK of a \"resort\" again. DON'T LET IT HAPPEN TO YOU. Nothing neat I can say about this \"resort\".... would not recommend to anyone.

It was wonderful! Roomy, clean, amazing. Exceeded my expectations! We were in the 500 building with a view of the fountain pond, which is low due to minimal rain, but it was nice to sit out on the screened patio and listen to the water in the morning with my coffee. Kids got a hide-a-bed in the livingroom which wasn't too comfy, but for a 4 and 1 year old it was perfectly fine! Downside of our condo-no pizza pan or pizza cutter--so hopefully we didn't leave too much of a mess in the oven! And knives worked fine for cutting! Loved the huge tub--able to soak 2 times with the wonderful jets for sore feet after walking all day. My 1 year old loved the mirrors on the doors. Very close to dining and stores like Target and Publix for supplies. We used the pool one morning. The kiddie pool was great fun and heated so the water was excellent too. I used the computer room--they have 2 computers for use just sign in and out. I waited one of the three times I used them otherwise was able to get right on. My wait was less than 10 minutes-which I took to lounge next to the pool. We used the game room once too--lots of variety. Would have attended one of the movies, but the ones geared toward our kids were on during dinner time or we hadn't returned from Disney yet. Speaking of Disney-seriously less than 5 minutes to Animal Kingdom and for December it was less than 20 minutes to even Magic Kingdom! Staff we encountered were all very friendly and helpful. Small store at the resort was well stocked with items we needed and prices were comparable for the Souvenir items to other places (cheaper than the airport). We sometimes could hear a chair move or noise from a TV as we were falling asleep, but I am sure people could also hear our children scream at bedtime too.

After reviewing all the bad experiences of others staying in the so-called \"resorts\" in the Disney area, I was a bit nervous about staying in one. The Silver Lake Resort turned out to be wonderful. Firstly, the traveler photos posted on TripAdvisor are accurate. I didn't take any (sorry!) but if you look for the photos from user namer \"godzpeach\", our unit looked identical to this. It was in building 900, one of the newly renovated units. (Thanks to the reviewer who had suggested to call in advance to request a newly renovated unit -- I did, and they gave us one. It was great!) Our one bedroom consisted of a bedroom with king size bed and flat screen TV; a large bathroom with shower and tub, and a washer and dryer; a full kitchen kitted out with all the basic cooking supplies (pots, pans, cooking utensils, flatware for eating, plates, coffee maker and some very mediocre coffee (but no tea!), paper towels, garbage bags, dishwashing detergent, etc); and a living room/dining room area with comfortable sofas and another flat screen TV. The apartment was clean and very comfortable. The Resort asked us only twice if we wanted to participate in their sales pitch, which seems to be a relatively low number of requests as compared to other Resorts in the area (according to Trip Advisor reviews I read). Both times we were asked, a polite \"no thanks\" from us was graciously accepted and respected. This Resort is very close to Disney properties and is about 10-15 minute drive to I-4 and International Drive. So if you want to be in the thick of the activities, restaurants, etc that is International Drive, this may not be the place for you. For me, as a native Floridian, staying 15 minutes away from that area is perfect. Silver Lake Resort is near the Disney properties and is 2 minutes from a supermarket and several good restaurants. The other thing I really liked about this place -- besides being great value for money (was cheaper than most hotels!) -- is that there were no hidden fees as there were in nearly all other resorts in the area. (Read the fine print closely on all the booking advertisements!!) Wi-Fi was $10 for first day, then $5 per day after, but only for one device (i.e. laptop). You have to pay again for a second laptop. But this was not a big deal to me. If you are looking for a relaxing, clean, and affordable place to call home for a few days in the Kissimmee area, you should come to the Silver Lake Resort.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Advance, NC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!\u201d", "Author": "Formyjoy", "ReviewID": "UR119685840", "Content": "This resort is very close to Disney and all the new restaurants along 192.

I must say that a smile and a friendly tone goes a long way with people! We had a one bedroom unit in the 500 section that slept 6. It was WAY roomy, nicely decorated, and filled with everything I needed for the week! The screened patio was a VERY nice touch for evening drinks with my hubby while the kids watched movies. The Bath and Body Works products were also a nice touch! I was cautioned not to keep my room keys next to cell phones or credit cards or they could get deactivated so I was careful, and they all worked just fine the entire time! The bed was extra comfy and the sofa sleepers were just fine for my kids (no complaints!). The kitchen was immaculate and had every cooking utensil I could have ever needed! I was offered a presentation once upon check in (we declined), but was never bugged about it again! The front desk staff (Tara checked us in :)) was exceptionally nice and even helped me print boarding passes for our return home. There was live music on a few nights which was nice when hanging out at the pool. My kids did not participate in the activities because we were busy most days. I didn't mind the pool towel card, because clearly it has been an issue of people stealing them in the past (why???? no clue!). It just made me aware of turning them in instead of just leaving them all over. I already was prepared for the WIFI fee, so it didn't bug me, and not being a slave to my computer was welcome since we WERE on vacation after all, plus I could use my smart phone whenever I wanted to! The resort was close (10-20 min. drive) to grocery shopping, restaurants, downtown Orlando, and every sightseeing place you wanted! I loved the security there and felt very safe. The pools were very clean, and the playground was very much enjoyed by my 4 year old! We can't WAIT to return and my little guy cried when we had to check out!

This is more points than I'd typically pay for a week for a 2BR at most resorts. I assume their $ pricing is similarly on the high end for condos in Orlando, which tend to be cheap and plentiful, especially in low season. The 1BR unit has a small LR with sofabed and a BR with king bed, and a small kitchen +w/d. The 2BR unit has 2 BR each with 1 King bed, 2 baths, and a mid sized LR with sofabed and a larger kitchen +w/d. We thought we'd have more people coming - with the sofabeds this place can hold up to 10 - so we have plenty o room with the 5 people that we brought. The unit is furnished nicely and the countertops are all granite. Beds are comfortable and there are tvs in all the bedrooms + LRs. The 2BR unit also has a DVD player. The units have a locking outerdoor that goes to a tiny foyer with locking doors into each unit. We had to get furniture to prop the 2 inner doors open so that we could move freely back and forth across our 3BR. Each unit has a small screened porch with 2 chairs, and really no more room than that. We were very pleased with the unit once we got our doors propped open. The units come with the standard accessory pack for a condo of coffee packets, a couple diswashing detergents, and such. They have upscale soap/shampoo/lotion/conditioner from bath&body works. There are no coffee filters, so if you want to brew something besides their maxwell house packets, bring them. Check-in was not a problem. We were offered a sales tour ($80 cash or similar value to various venues), but declined. They seem to have a very large condo sales operation going on with a HUGE room dedicated to this activity and a side room for kids, plus golf carts going to and fro. We were glad they let us through with minimum hassle on the check-in and no follow-up phone calls. There are 3 pools - the main one is awesome and has a little snack shop there. The pool seemed to be very highly chlorinated. My husband suffered with eye drops the whole evening after we went there and he said the chemicals were off. There is an arcade with video games, pool tables, etc. My only complaint here is that I felt nickel and dimed. After exchanging for so many points, I was surprised at how many other things they try to get money out of you for. There was an extra \"cleaning fee\" of something like $75, and we had to pay $27 or so for getting wifi access the 4 days. (and even then, it only worked on 1 device). We asked at the activities center to use a volleyball for the pool, but they required $5 cash deposit and would not take the hotel card for that - we had not brought cash over to the pool so the kids couldn't play. Even little things like popcorn with the movie were for extra charges, the video game room required 2 25c tokens for each game - nothing is included. They bring out big buckets of cheap ice cream by the pool and charge kids $3 to get some. Others have mentioned the towel card - you exchange the card for the number of towels your room sleeps, and then exchange the towels back for the card. If you are unfortunate enough to misplace either the card or any of the towels, the charge is $20 per towel or $20xoccupancy for the card. These pool towels are nothing special and would not cost $20 new, and this is just another example of giving you some stress or hassle where you don't need it. I just felt that all these extra charges were unnecessary and a hassle when they are already a high charging resort. I'm still giving it 4 stars because the units and pools are really nice. I wish I could have given it 3 1/2 however, because I think they could go further to make us feel welcome and not treat us like towel-stealing deadbeats at this high end resort.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cA few flaws, but not bad overall\u201d", "Author": "seeking_seashells", "ReviewID": "UR118970641", "Content": "I chose this resort because we were traveling as two couples and each wanted their own bedroom with a minimum queen size bed. You would be surprised how many Orlando condos have twin beds in the second bedroom to accommodate families. We arrived at midnight from Seattle and the front desk was very cheerful and attentive at check in. We went up to our unit and after the first three key cards failed, the fourth finally worked \u2013 not a good start. We stayed in the 1000 building on the top floor. The condo was spacious with modern finishes and furniture (mostly \u2013 but old box TV sets in the bedrooms). The living area was in the center, with a bedroom/bath suite on either side providing privacy to both couples. Kitchen was furnished with essential dishes but as I started to cook more and more I wished I had brought some spices. We had a small screened in balcony overlooking the \u201cLake\u201d which is actually more like a swamp, but at least it isn\u2019t a parking lot. Both couples agreed the beds were super comfy. Good air conditioning kept us comfortable, especially when temps outside were in the 90\u2019s. We continued to have problems with our keycards. After 3 complete replacements in 24 hours someone from security took pity on us and issued us \u201cspecial\u201d keycards that worked about 75% of the time. At one point the front desk told us to keep our keycards above 70 degrees in order to keep them working. What a joke in air-conditioned Orlando! I don\u2019t know why management doesn\u2019t just step up and replace the door locks. We used two pools at the resort and enjoyed both. The pool next to our building was \u2018self-serve\u2019 with towels and fairly quiet. We went to the main pool and enjoyed drinks from the bar and canned music. Watch out for the bar \u2013 we ordered Happy Hour drinks and were charged full price until my husband pointed out that their clocks were set 10 minutes slow. One couple ordered food and said it was just okay. The towel card others have mentioned is annoying \u2013 puts a little damper on your day for sure. We were asked twice to participate in a time share presentation. The first was when we were issued our parking passes, which I declined. The second was during a phone call to check up on our stay. By then two of our three phones weren\u2019t working and the hallway leading to our unit hadn\u2019t been vacuumed in four days\u2026on top of the keycard drama. I declined and explained that I wasn\u2019t interested in purchasing a property that had these maintenance problems. I wasn\u2019t asked again. Our condo had a lock-out unit which meant that the door from the hallway entered a very small box with two doors \u2013 one to our unit and one to a separate unit. There were guests staying in the lock-out two nights of our visit. They had problems with their keycards (no surprise) and they spent a lot of time outside of our door trying to figure it out. It was very loud. I\u2019m not a fan of the lock-out format. The best part about this resort was the location. We were minutes from Disney parks using the back gate which links directly to Disney roads. You need a car here \u2013 it isn\u2019t safe to walk to the nearby stores and restaurants. Go out the front gate, turn right, then turn right again on 92 and drive about a mile to get to a large Publix grocery store, Super Target and yummy restaurants like Bahama Breeze. Bottom line - I would stay here again, especially as the price for a two bedroom condo was cheaper than one night at a Disney resort traditional room. We didn't miss not having maid service.

I would rather stay in a $30 dollar a night hotel than this JUNK of a \"resort\" agian! They charge u for breathing, we also had to pay an additional $30 because of some housekeeing fee or something to clean our room after we leave.

The check in process was swift and painless and we made our way to our apartment, in block 600. We opened the door and were absolutely delighted by the size, layout and decor of the 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment. We had used RCI points for this trip and chose Silver Lakes as our base for 2 weeks visiting the theme parks. I was little apprehensive about being asked to give up our time to attend a RCI event but I needn't have worried. We were invited to a short breakfast meeting which I declined and that was it, no pressure to attend whatsoever which makes a pleasant change. The resort has everything a family needs and one great thing is that the massive swimming pools were open until 11 p.m. each evening so it was great to spend all day trudging around a theme park and still having time to relax in the pools and (very) hot outdoor jacuzzi when we arrived \"home\". The staff were always friendly and our only problems were with our electronic apartment keys which failed a couple of times but each time, someone arrived to help within minutes.

We stayed at Silver Lake through an RCI trade, and with a few tips, you can have a great stay there too. I did my research on Tripadvisor ahead of time and learned that some buildings were renovated and some were not. One of the few criticisms that I have of Silver Lake is that when I called a few weeks ahead of time to see if I could put a note on our reservation for one of the renovated buildings, the employee I talked told me that was not possible and I would have to ask RCI. Luckily, a few days before our scheduled visit, a very helpful employee called us to confirm our reservation and answer any questions and helped me to figure out which buildings were available for our check in day and we were able to request a renovated unit! At Silver Lake, buildings 100-600 are the originals, I believe, and have the largest units. Of those, only 300, 400 and 500 have renovated units (I think! I'm not entirely sure on 600 and 700), while anything above 700 are renovated but smaller. Our unit in the 300 building was great! Very close to the main pool, perfectly cool and shaded well from the hot Florida sun with all tile floors and granite counter tops in the kitchen and bathrooms. The main pool complex is huge and well maintained and a great place to relax after all of your crazy Disney adventures. This location is especially great if you are intending to go to Animal Kingdom as it is only a 5 minute drive at most. I loved that we were so close to all of the Disney attractions (Magic Kingdom was the farthest away, and I think it only took us 15 minutes to get there), but I also enjoyed that it was easy to do things offsite, especially grocery shopping and offsite restaurants. However, you really should have a car to stay at Silver Lake, as they don't have much in the way of transportation for non-Disney destinations, and it costs extras for the Disney shuttles they have. We didn't use them, so I really don't know all that much about the shuttle options.

Took the promised 90 mins and when we said we weren't in a position to purchase now they accepted this without a problem. The manager came over and double-checked that our salesperson had 'done his job' and offered us a couple of 'sweeter deals' which we also declined. This was it - we were treated well. Nice breakfast beforehand as well and if you take your kids with you they'll get fed and can then go off and swim or be entertained! Perfectly located for Disney - right on the back boundary!!

Negatives include a lack of walkways to the local facilities under a mile away, so a car really is needed (although we did eventually discover a cut through the car park of Congo Golf which would have made a much safer walkway); the entertainment provided was aimed almost entirely at children, with hardly anything in the evening for adults; there are no balconies or patios to sit and relax outside each apartment; there is no daily or twice-weekly apartment cleaning - just a towel change half way through the week.

Its location is close to the main Kissimmee drag - Publix (supermarket), Super Target, Olive Garden, Chick-Fil-A, and other restaurants.

We didn't see any bugs at all. The Master Suite had a large closet and dresser, as well as a large whirlpool spa tub and huge shower. The King bed was comfy as well. The 2nd bedroom was quite small, with a single queen bed. There were no twin bed options. The 2nd bedroom didn't have a dresser, so our kids had to use the closet shelf. Each room had a smallish TV, and the living area had a large 32 inch CRT television - a throwback (what with the cheap available LCDs out there), but serviceable. The kitchen was well-appointed and clean - it had everything we needed except for a non-stick pan. The in-room washer/dryer was a nice feature, so we didn't have too many dirty clothes to haul home. The main pool is quite large and meandering, and the cabana played pleasant music (none of the typical \"rap-crap\" you may hear elsewhere). We liked the game room and took in a movie at the theater.

It was overall pretty clean other than that, but the dusty was a weird thing because how can a hotel room get dusty? Anyway, they also require you to take out the trash when you leave which i thought was a little weird. They let you rent movies at their small clubhouse which was a little pricey, but okay if you're on vacation and really just want to hang out.

I'm thinking they might have left us a message in our room too - though since we have a 1 year old, I always unplug the hotel phones. The room was so nice, the bed was comfortable. It was very clean, nice decor, had a screen room to enjoy the cool nights/smoke. It had an arcade room, which was nice and several pools. The movie nights were free too - with the exception of the pizza/movie kids night which was only $6. They had several activiites going on for children throughout the day too. We didn't end up participating in them, since we had a pretty full schedule anyway. We stayed in the 10000 building on the first floor.

I will be as honest as possible as I am an owner, proud at that. I will do the PROS and CONS. PROS - Location - First of all, the location is absolutely spectacular. I am not just talking about Disney but the fact that you are in the heart of everything from supermarkets, convemience stores, gift shops,, Super Target, Chain and non chain restaurants,..all literally across the street and right off highway 192. One of my luggage pieces ripped and we literally jumped in the car and drove 2 minutes to target. Also as you may or may not know, the location of the parks is tremendous and that is literally the biggest advantage you have staying at Silver lake. I am familiar with some oif the other igh rated timeshares and Silver Lake stands out. This is one major advantage Silver Lake has over resorts such as Wyndham Bonnet Creek and even so over the Sheraton Lake Buena Vistas. Rooms - If you are looking for a three bedroon lockout, Silver Lake has them and they are nice, some other resorts do not such as the condo resorts. I saw th 2 bedrooms as well and they are very nice, especially in the 300-600 buildings Peaceful - If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing get away and do not care much for loud music, festive pool activities, big crowds,...Then Silver Lake is the place for you. Now this can be viewed as a PRO or CON as some folks may enjoy the festive activities and more of a live atmosphere. Customer Service- I thought the customer service was pretty good. We never had to call twices for anything and unlike many resorts, they actually answer the phone without having to walk all the way to the front desk...very accommodating. Front desk folks were pretty nice Security - Very good and not psycho like some places. They are reasonable and will let you through without fighting them if your guest forgets their parking pass. Timeshare presentation - Very bearable and was not bad at all, got out in 90 minutes and only had to say NO a few times. My guests did a timeshare at the Sheraton Lake Buena Vistana resort and the sales rep literally would not let them leave as he was super aggressive and unprofessional. CONS - I believe as an owner, they need to do a little better job with some of their amentities on their grounds. Silver lake is a small resort with not many amentities on their grounds so in my opinion, things need to sparkle and be put together well. For example, they have only two basketball rims and one was missing a net. The tenis court looks like it could use some polishing. Grounds - I was not too overly impressed with their grounds. They have two basketball rims as mentioned above however they are on their only tennis court. So if someone is renting the tennis court out, you can not play basketball since they share the same court. Also, the business center only has two computers and they are occupied most of the time. Their are only 3 pools, one small whirl pool and a small baby pool. Their activities are OK, not very festive, music is dull, only one tennis court, two basketball rims, playground is exceptionally small, same as market gift shop,... Housekeeping - They are very stingy on towels, they claim they give you enough for your guests at check in and you get more when they do thir mid week cleaning. I had to beg for extra towels a few days before our mid week housekeeping which they were fine with. Also, when they did their mid week housekeeping, they did not change our sheets. When my wife called and asked why they did not, they said that \"you have to ask for it\". This seems sort of silly as it should be normal practice to change sheets when housekeeping. I mean it does seem pretty filthy for them to expect you to sleep with the same sheets for the whole week. Cabana Bar and Grill - was average and i also noticed they are pretty stingy on their portions but overall good service. I hope this review helps as i did my best to be non biased and honest. My bro in law owns at Sheraton Lake Buena Vistana and we were back and forth between the two during our week. If you are looking for a more festive atmosphere with a TON of grounds which are VERY impressive, then Sheraton is your place. Very fetsive, respected, lots of activities, good location,... If you are looking for a nice, relaxing vacation and not worried about the grounds and amentities, then Silver Lake is the place. If ou are contempt with a few nice pools to relax, average amentities and ground with a superb location, then you are OK. I bought here because it was an absolute steal which i got pretty lucky as i stated plus I need and prefer a 3 bedroom lockout which Lake HSeraton Buena Vistana does not have. if you have any further questions or looking to buy a property at Silver lake for a tremendous price, you can email me at shamama75@aol.com. I have a fantastic 3 bedroom lockout for sale.

He asked why I was there, and I explained I was bribed, had no intention of buying, but would do my best to understand his offer and debate it's merits. I happen to work in finance, and honestly believe the timeshare is a terrible deal. We had fun with it, and he let me off the hook after 2 short hours. Bob is experienced, and knew early on he was probably wasting his time that morning, and kind of said so. It was he who was marking time more so than I. Meanwhile, I enjoyed the coffee, tried to shoot holes in his product, and together we had some laughs.

WOW!!! Just the Disney tickets ALONE were worth almost $500!! When we arrived after a long 2 day drive into Orlando, I was so pleased with the staff at the front counter at the Welcome Center...very friendly, glad you were there! Checked in, drove to our Bldg. #10, went to the 3rd floor and opened the door to our beautiful 2 BR condo!! All three of us (myself, husband & 6 yr old boy) said \"***WOW!!!***\" It was so clean, nicely decorated and just plain WONDERFUL!!! :) The bedding was beautiful, the full kitchen was great and the master BR had a great sliding door to the screened balcony as well as a large bathroom with jet tub! It was a wonderful feeling knowing we would be there for 6 nights!! My husband was thrilled with the 48\" (?) plasma TV on the wall too!! I can't say enough about the fantastic condo!! It was just beyond my expectations! :) We did have to do a 90 min. Vacation Ownership presentation the next morning at 8:30am where they served us a little continental breakfast and introduced us to our sales person. We felt SO lucky to get CAROLINE!!! She was the sweetest, kindest woman and we actually enjoyed our time with her! She was never pushy or aggressive, she just laid out all the facts and showed us how we could enjoy wonderful vacations. The whole presentation was so low-key and NOT high pressured (like some we've been to!).....it was fantastic! Spent our time with Caroline, said \"no thank you\" and off we went to gather our DISNEY TICKETS!! Wooooooo Hooooooo! :) The lagoon style pool was great and the location of the property was a huge asset!! The only thing I could say I didn't care for was the cafe/eatery off the pool...they do not have a restaurant there but that's no problem because there's plenty very close by on 191. We did decide to get an easy dinner one night after swimming, I got the burger and hubby got the philly cheese steak....it was mildly OK... wouldn't order from there again.

They told me that they do not and they could send someone to clean it. I figured I could do a better job. So I cleaned it with dish detergent and thought it would work. It was sparkling. So I filled up the tub and turned on the jets again. More dirt came out. I just gave up. Then I requested to have it cleaned and they never should up. Please note that the towel policy is absurd. After I cleaned the tub, I requested some additional washcloths because I used then to clean the tub. They had someone bring me two washcloths and I had to sign for them. Also at the pool you have to sign your towels out. This is crazy. I travel about 10 plus times a year and had never seen such a policy.

I purchased one week from July 16th through July 23rd, 2010 as an RCI \"Extra Vacation.\" Overall, my niece and I had a good time but having traveled a lot, it is my opinion that the resort could definitely use some improvement and provide a tad more customer service, especially in the most basic areas. Briefly repeating what others have said, the resort is a large and older place that is gradually being updated. DEFINITELY a FAMILY RESORT, this is a \"no frills place\" with lots and lots and lots of children (hey, it IS DISNEY WORLD in July). Currently, there are nearly 500 units with plans to expand the resort to over 600 units (cannot imagine). My niece and I stayed in a \"renovated\" studio, which was quite small... you will see this from my photos. We stayed on the fourth floor of the 900 building, which is the last building near the rear entrance gate. Throughout the week, our key card never worked at the rear gate, so we abandoned that option as an entry point to the resort. The resort location is great, as it is approximately 3 miles or so to Disney's Magic Kingdom. The resort is about 4.5 miles to Interstate 4, which gets one to Sea World, Universal Studios, The Orlando Premium Outlets, all Disney attractions and other Florida points, east-to-west. The resort is also located on Rte 192, Bronson Hwy, a major commercial throughway to Disney with many resorts, restaurants, stores, shops, hotels, etc on it. This is good and bad because everything one could want is within minutes from the resort. On the down side, traffic on Rte.192 can be horrific, especially between 10:45 pm and 11:20 pm when Disney World closes for the night. It's weird 'cause after 11:20 pm-11:30 pm or so, Rte. 192 is empty except for all the neon store lights & occasional lone pedestrian...doesn't look like the same road. While pleasant enough, IMHO this resort seems to lack any character or true charm, definitely lacks even basic customer service. The reception area at this resort is a bit odd, as it resembles the lobby of a Motel 6. Check-in lines grew long and folks seemed to get impatient although our check-in went smoothly. The \"main reception lobby\" completely shuts down by 11:00 pm...so, if you need anything after 11:00 pm, you are out-of-luck, as my niece and I soon discovered! The common areas like the Club House are okay but stark and a bit dated, just like the rest of the resort. The spa essentially gives manicures & neck massages. The two computers in the \"Business Room\" never seemed to work properly. The three swimming pools were clean enough and despite being a HUGE resort, my niece and I never had a hard time finding lounge chairs by any of the three pools. On one occasion, we were given pool towels that smelled really dank and moldy...probably were rolled up when damp. On another occasion, the towel room was out of towels. On a third occasion, we were only given small bath towels as pool towels...no biggie. On a fourth occasion, there was no one at the pool post to hand out towels. The little Tiki restaurant by the main pool was alright but accepted cash or credit cards only...nothing could be billed directly to the room, which was a bit inconvenient. Our renovated unit was alright but still seemed oddly dated. The \"partial kitchen\" was nothing more than a 2 ft x 4 ft granite slab placed into an alcove, atop a mini fridge. We washed our coffee pot, dishes & cups in the bathroom sink (YUCK). There was zero room for storage (we stored snacks and boxed food items in dresser drawers, another YUCK). Cups, dishes and glasses were placed in a high cabinet above the little kitchen alcove, which neither my niece or I could reach. The nicest touch was having a coffee pot in the room for morning coffee on the screened-in porch, although coffee pots are pretty standard in most 3-Star hotels these days. Although minor only, a few additional annoyances made our stay unpleasant at times. My niece and I laughed but several things never seemed to work properly and it seems that something in our room or at the resort \"broke\" every day. Forget trying to get \"24 hour maintenance or housekeeping\" late at night. Our toilet didn't flush properly one night, I fixed it. Vertical blinds were stuck and two fell off the track one night, I fixed them. Ceiling fan didn't operate properly, I climbed up and fiddled with it. My niece and I never figured out how to use the in-room safe, our table lamps flickered on and off occasionally, the screen door to our porch didn't lock. Nothing huge by no means. Funny most of the time but occasionally a bit annoying. The main upset for me was on our second-to-last evening when I accidentally dropped coffee and coffee grinds onto our bed (trying to manage my way around our super-large room and that super-large kitchen). Everything seeped all the way through to the mattress cover and there was no way we could reach housekeeping to request a sheet change despite trying to do so for over 1 hour. My niece and I rinsed out and rolled up the top blanket, the sheets, the mattress cover, etc and we slept on a blanket that we fetched from my car...not good. While we received a TOWEL EXCHANGE on our 5th day at Silver Lakes, there is absolutely NO HOUSEKEEPING offered throughout a 7-day stay. Forget housekeeping (or anything) after hours. My niece and I got our biggest laugh when we did laundry one day in the very old and out-dated, in need of repair \"common\" laundry room. The laundry room had a total of three washer/dryer combo machines, TWO operating (one broken) at all times. Several of my niece's panties \"caught fire\"--well they were burnt black--in an apparent dryer meltdown in our absence. Laugh we did...happy no one got hurt. I could go on and on but others have stated it all...the good and the bad. While an okay place with a good location, nice enough grounds, pleasant people and hey, it IS SUNNY FLORIDA, this resort could use a bit of TLC and some attention to detail, especially regarding simple customer needs. I doubt I would ever return to Silver Lake Resorts if traveling again to Central Florida 'cause there are so many wonderful places to stay in the Central Florida area.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful last minute trip\u201d", "Author": "sunnygirl4u", "ReviewID": "UR72486112", "Content": "My husband and I found a great deal through Paradise Escapes last minute vacations and booked a hotel unit at Silver Lake Resort and found it to be very nice.

We stayed in the Silver Points building 900 which is one of the fairly recent remodeled buildings of the whole resort. The location was disappointing as we were quite a drive from a lot of the places we like to visit in the Orlando area, but it was a quiet area with pretty landscaping. Great location if you are taking the family to Disney and don't much care about the views. My in-laws stayed in building 1000 which was identical to ours. I travel all over the US for work as a specialty contractor and my husband and I have traveled many places as well for leisure. I have stayed in a wide variety of hotels and motels in a landscape of locations across the country. From Washington to Florida to Oklahoma and New York. Also, please note that I have 13 years experience as a professional housekeeper. Attention to details... This review is not based on emotion or shaped around one bad experience. I will state the facts, the cons and pros for your information purposes. Reasons this resort is not recommended are as follows: 1.)VERY limited parking ESPECIALLY close to any building entrances so expect to walk. 2.) Only 1 elevator per building which gets immediately tied up by housekeeping on Friday morning when you're supposed to check out (with a Friday to Friday stay, see number 10). 3.) Aside from the standard bathroom amenities such as soap and shampoo, don't expect many amenities or room features with a hotel style room. Think Red Roof Inn. There isn't even an iron or ironing board in the room. They only provided 2 people with 2 towels each for 5 days. We ran out of washcloths by Sunday morning. 4.) The wall dividing the hotel style room from a larger 2 bedroom condo is paper thin and you share the same main entrance off the long hallway. This caused problems when a loud family with young children roomed next store and kept weird hours. If it tells you anything, the doors aren't sealed properly and you can see a good inch under each others doors so no nose reduction there. The floors are tiled around the doors also so the sound echoed big time. It made for a few miserable nights and mornings. It's like you're all sharing one unit with your bedroom door closed for privacy. 5.) When you have an issue such as nosy neighbors, you have no one to help you. The main staff for the resort (probably all employed by the property management service) does not take care of issues for people who book through a company like RCI. RCI apparently either 'owns' the units or has time shares there and then leases the individual units to tenants such as us on behalf of the owners. A LOT of middle men. Also, some of the bad neighbors may actually be owners as well so there is nothing that can be done. Not at all like a hotel which is what we expected. Lesson learned. We didn't book a room as a time share, we booked a room just like you would make a reservation at any standard hotel chain through Wyndham. We'll be careful next time to stick with the major resort or hotel names next visit. 6.) The bathrooms are VERY small and have little counter space as well as a shower like in a trailer home. Imagine a bathroom from a Motel 6 with smaller counters and newer fixtures and there you go! For the ladies, don't plan to shave in the shower once you get down there. Nearly impossible in the tiny, narrow shower stall with no ledges. They still have the old standard shower curtain rods and not the arc style that are in most hotels now. 7.) The pools suck. The pool near the Silver Point area is only about 3 1/2 feet deep. Plenty of space to lay out and tan, but lame for taking a cool swim if you're older than 5 years. Also, the main pool area near the lobby is larger, but just as shallow. Not what we expected from a huge resort. It's a bit too kid friendly for adults. What happened to a shallow AND deep end? Or a standard pool and a kiddie pool? The shallow water got VERY hot in the FL summer days thus another reason lameness. A little deeper and it would have been refreshing. 8.) They have 2 entrance gates for the resort. Both secured. This is a perk for safety, but the gate next to our building was never guarded so we always had to enter on the other side of the resort from a different road or call the main gate to let us in at our entrance. It got to be a pain when you just wanted to zip in and out. 9.) Although not 100% certain, it seemed they turned the boilers or hot water heaters down at night. After 11 pm, the water was only tepid. During the day it was plenty hot. Understand the need to save to cut costs, but this sucked if you checked in late on Friday or got in late from a park/event and needed to shower up or wash your face before bed. 10.) Check out time is listed as 10 am (a little earlier than standard hotel chains) but housekeeping will show up as early as 8 am. Be ready to go. While the mass exodus occurred between 9-10 am with many guests leaving, housekeeping was in everyone's way trying to get into the rooms before we were even gone. Along with tying up the elevators, it seemed like they were super eager to boot you out. The cleaning staff seemed large enough and the next check in time isn't until 4 pm, so I'm not sure why the rush. They had plenty of time to clean and replace the shampoo. It was annoying to say the least. Reasons this place was worth the $33 a night we paid: 1.) The linens were clean and bed was overall nice. As you see in many pictures, the decor is modern tropical in most units. This was the case with our room. The bathroom towels aren't up to par with say Hampton Inn, but they were at the least very clean. 2.) Although there was not kitchen in our small room, we did have a mini fridge and microwave, kitchen towels, hot pads and a few basic dishes. 3.) Laundry facility use is free for guests. We didn't have a washer/dryer unit in our room so we made use of the laundry room available near the game room. 4.) There is a bar and the pool stays open until 10 am. At least you can relax after 9 pm. 5.) We didn't see the first sign of an insect or critter anywhere inside. Just a cool gecko that hung around outside every night. Even for a classier hotel, you still see the odd bug buzzing around somewhere or laying dead in the corner of the bathroom floor. Sounds silly, but I notice a lot. 6.) We had a flat screen TV (just no HDTV) in our room on the wall. 7.) Though shallow as a puddle, the pools and pool area was very clean and well kept. The bar area was nice also. Side notes: The property managers will try to offer you a time share deal. They aren't pushy about it. We never called to express a desire to set up a meeting, so they never pushed the issue after the initial expression at check in. Our room did have a note warning against outside people pushing time shares and advised us to call the desk or security if we were bothered. This may be where some people state in the reviews about the pushy time share people. We had no problems with this. All in all our stay wasn't terrible. But we won't be back. It wasn't the place for 2 adults celebrating their anniversary and if the nightly rate worked out to be higher than what we paid, we would have been upset and disappointed. For the money, it was ok. If you're looking to book a hotel style room at Silver Lake, be wary of paying more than $40 a night. You're better off at the Econolodge on Universal. At least they have larger rooms and a deep and larger swimming pool.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blue Ridge Mountains, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNice stay with a few minor issues.\u201d", "Author": "sunflower35", "ReviewID": "UR67993614", "Content": "My husband and I got a fantastic deal on a hotel room at Silver Lake (through RCI). The property is divided up into several buildings, some are timeshare condos that are bigger than the hotel units. We booked a hotel room due to the very low price for 7 nights. The unit was very clean and had a comfortable king bed, small sitting area with a table, flat screen TV, microwave, coffeemaker, and small fridge. The bathroom was sufficient in size and very clean. Our balcony was screened-in and was big enough to be considered our \"living room\" for the week. There were lots of drawers for clothing and a big closet with a safe inside to store valuables. We were very pleased with the room. It even had a few dishes, glassware and silverware. We were able to look at the timeshare unit next to us, and it was much bigger with a dining room and separate bedrooms/living room. For the 2 of us, the hotel unit was just fine. The only big problem we had was there was no ice machine!! You had to walk all the way to the cabana to get ice. This was a pain since it was over 100 degrees and the ice practically melted on the way back to our room. Basically, we had to plan when to get ice (ex. on our way back from dinner when we had our car). We just had to remember to bring the ice bucket with us every time. Smaller problems included housekeeping. They were very noisy in the morning and apparently didn't realize that people may still be sleeping at 8am while on vacation. There was also a small child in the unit above us who enjoying bouncing a ball for about an hour early on the weekend. Otherwise, the night time hours were quiet and peaceful. Our balcony overlooked an awesome wetland and the frogs sounded really cool at night. Every morning there were a couple of cranes (big birds) who would show up and hunt for small fish in the wetland area. Basically, we had a great view. Also, around 10pm nightly, we could see Disney's fireworks from our balcony (in the 900 building). Every morning, there was a skywriter who would write in the sky with his plane (I think he was from the Holy Land Park b/c the phrases were basically all religious) Disney is very close by and there is a shuttle available for 8.00 per person round trip. It was timely, quick, and very easy to use. I was impressed with this service and how much time it saved us in parking. The cabana was fun. It served lots of great \"pub grub\" that was fattening, but eating greasy food on vacation is okay. You could work out the extra fat and calories in the great fitness center. There were 5 or 6 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, free weights, weight equipment, as well as bicycles. Overall, one of the best fitness centers in a hotel I've seen. (And all of the equipment worked with no \"out of order\" signs to be seen anywhere). The pools were very well maintained and spotless. The one thing to be careful of are the \"sheer\" pool umbrellas. I ended up getting a bit more sun than desired due to the sheer nature of the umbrellas around the pool areas. Other than that - the 3 pools were awesome! There is a movie theater at Silver Lake Resort, but it played mostly kids films when we were there, so we passed. There is also a cool game room with air hockey, ping pong, and video games. There are also daily activities by the pool daily, we hung out for some of them and had a blast. The activities staff are fun and very energetic! There are tons of chain restaurants nearby, so food is easy to obtain. If you want some really cool food choices, you should go to Celebration. There are neat pubs and wine bars there that provide different options for those who don't have kids. Good shopping there as well. We had no problems with the Wi-Fi, however it was a bit slow at times. The Activities Card available for purchase is worth buying (I think it was 25.00?). Especially if you plan to use Wi-fi in your room. In a nutshell, Silver Lake Resort was clean, friendly, and fun.

I only have a few complaints about the hotel, first the wireless was not working in the rooms. We bought an activities card so we could have wireless and a few other things, like a paper monday to friday, 15% off food at the Cabana restaurant, and some other things. We spent a lot of time trying to get the wireless working, and in the end it never was fixed, they took the card back and gave us our money. I think they should have let us keep the other discounts for our time. The rooms are close together, you go through one door and then there is an \"A\" and a \"B\" room, the people staying in the room beside us would walk through the doors and slam them, and a lot of the time wouldn't shut the outside door at all.

We were literally a stones throw from Animal Kingdom and found the rooms to be extremely comfortable - almost homelike.

The only clock they had was a small alarm clock on the night stand next to the bed. Our room was quite. We never heard anyone.

It was good to hear about the facilities from their standpoint and we were offered cash for the time- so it was a win - win for all. I will definately go back to Silver Lake Resort with out a doubt.

The main Disney entrance for all parks is about a 10 min drive. the Pool area is large as is the pool itself, clean and the bar is nice with music and good ambience.

Living room and kitchen are combined with small table and chairs, couch with additional chair. TV is in an odd spot in the kitchen but a raised level. The bathroom is a good size with sink and mirror in separate rooms which is a good choice for more than one person getting ready. The area where the place fails badly is the walls are paper thin - our bedroon adjoined the kitchen of a two bedroom and there was not one word you could not hear coming from their unit and I am sure vice verse..... I am not talking about raised voices in anyway. You could even clearly hear individual items being loaded into the dishwasher as if it was in our unit. There was also no window in the bedroom which just feels wrong in design providing not exit except the main door. We were not in the room much so it served its purpose of sleeping and showering but if somebody from Silver Lake is reading these design flaws are the main reason for not attending the timeshare request (which we are in the market for). Maybe give some people your targeting an upgrade to a two bedroom on the condition they attend the talk on timeshare and the result may be better.

We had a two bedroom, 2 bath condo with a full kitchen (brand new stove), washer and dryer (stackables), pull out couch in the living room and a dining room. The table and end tables were made of glass and the floors, except in the bedrooms were tile. My grandson thought this was great because he could slide the furniture across the floor. We went to Orlando to go to the Disney Parks and we booked our condo throught the Armed Forces Vacation Club. We arrived at Silver Lakes Resort at 2:00 on Saturday and after going through the security gate, we stooped in the main office to see if we could check in a little early. Carmen helped us out and she was very nice and pleasant. She told us we could check in right away into a two bedroom without a screened in porch or wait until 4:00. We chose to wait til four and my husband and grandson went swimming while the rest of us went to the nearby Super Target to get groceries. When we checked in at four we were asked if we would be interested in a time share sales pitch (offered $80) for tickets to a park. We declined and there was no pressure to attend. Just told us that if we changed our mind to let them know. This is a private time share group so they are going to try and get you to attend. But since we already had our park attendance planned out we declined. They called and left a message at midweek, very pleasantly, and we declined again. We chose a condo so we could cook some meals and have snacks and just have more room. We had 5 adults and 2 children - 2 1/2 and 5 months. The master bedroom had a king bed that was very comfortable and plenty of room. The master bath was huge with a walk in shower and a tub with a jacuzzi (which we never used). The second bedroom was a little smaller with two double beds but the baby's pack and play fit easily at the end of one bed and the door still closed. My daughter slept on the pull out couch and said it wasn't all that comfortable. It would have probably been fine for a child, but not an adult. In the middle of the week they have a towel exchange and a trash pickup. But, we just took out the trash each day and washed the towels. This is why we wanted a condo. This was an awesome deal for us. Plenty of room, plenty of parking. We had to walk to the pool but it was really nice - heated, not croweded, with a nice hot tub. If you are looking for someone to make your bed everyday, and room service so you don't have to do anything, then this is not the place for you. Also, we didn't see any bugs. We saw a few frogs outside the door but this is Florida and it is warm most of the year, so there will be lizards and frogs outside. Also, they had a great activity center which you won't get at a hotel. For internet service you can either pay $10 a day or we paid about $25 for the week for two users and that came with some discount coupons. They also have activities for kids even though we did not try these. If you have a family and you want a close place to Disney then this is a great place. The Super Target near the condos has all kinds of T shirts and souvenirs for half the price of the stuff inside the parks. The only place we did not like near the resort was the Golden Corral. It was the filthiest place I have ever eaten in. Avoid it if at all possible. Very dirty and crowded. It was like playing football to get to any food.

We had a 2 bed/2 bath unit with a full kitchen, which in theory would have been great for my family (husband, 3 year old and 18 month twins) and my in-laws. However, the second bedroom wasn't even big enough to put a pack n' play, let alone 2 of them.... in fact, you could barely walk around the bed. The tv was mounted on one of those hospital style tv thingys (don't believe the pics they show with flat-screens- they were nowhere to be found). So, we had to boot my in'laws out of the master bedroom (slightly bigger) so we could set up the cribs. Which brings me to another issue- they wanted to charge us $35 per crib and $35 just to bring a booster seat to the room. I have NEVER stayed anywhere that charged for a crib. When we first arrived, I was excited. The website (and other travel websites) show new furniture, nice cabinets and granite counters in the kitchens and luxurious baths - they actually say \"luxurious\" on the website. DON'T beleive it!! This is a bait-and-switch! When we got to our unit- through musty hallways that smelled like an old pool storage closet- we were seriously disappointed. First, our air conditioner was broken and it was 85 degrees in there... not fun in the Florida heat. When we called maintenence they sent 2 very nice gentlemen to fix it (and that was the best part about the resort- the maintenence guys). However, it was hot in our unit for the rest of the evening. Everything here was dated, it looked like the Golden Girls living room with all of the bamboo furniture. The tile was gross, our feet were filthy just from walking on it barefoot. The kitchen was dirty and old; the appliances were old and very very loud. It was the kind of place where you feel dirty the minute you get out of the shower (which had no water pressure, by the way). Other than the nice guys that came to fix our air conditioning, the only other good things about this resort were the comfortable beds and its proximity to Disney. As for the beds, I'm not sure if they were actually that comfortable, or if they just felt that way after 14 hours at Disney World! If you leave out of the back gate, make a left on Sherberth Road, then a right on Osceola Pkwy and you are on Disney property in 2 minutes. We could even see Animal Kingdom from our room.

We had a *huge* 1400 SF 2BR/2BA with a comfortable queen sofa sleeper I could open and close easily. The unit was stocked with \"starters\" of laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, coffee, etc., a nice convenience. Both bedrooms had screened porches. The larger bedroom had a jacuzzi. The smaller one was part of a \"lock-off\" and had its own microwave, small refrigerator, kitchen sink, and dishes. There were small flat screen TV's in the bedrooms and a very large one in the living room. Since we were there a whole week, having a washer and dryer in the unit was very convenient. I was favorably impressed with the list of daily activities, including poolside music and ice cream sundaes, and a weekly casino cruise. The teens on premises (and the young men accompanying me) seemed to really enjoy the game room. One of the young men worked out every day in the spacious fitness facility. I loved having the computers available for daily e-mail. An in-room Internet service package is available. Additional towels were available immediately upon request and a free towel exchange was offered on Wednesday. Pool towels were free and could be easily exchanged at the pool office. There were plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas pool side. The poolside snack shop had tasty and reasonable food (only ate there once, though) and a Happy Hour. I was told there is a children's pool and that one pool is heated, but I didn't check them out. I did see a tot lot with a climbing apparatus and a slide. All of the employees I dealt with were friendly. Two problems (needing more dishes and a leak from the air conditioner into a closet) were dealt with quickly. I attended a timeshare purchase presentation but did not feel too pressured. Silver Lake's \"back exit\" abuts Animal Kingdom [we saw the \"auditions\" sign] and drops you on the Disney portion of Oceola Parkway in two minutes. Both entrances are gated and staffed. This location is just generally so convenient. In addition to being in Disney's backyard, it's a mile from Publix, 7-8 minutes from a SuperWalmart and 3-4 minutes from I-4, which takes you up to International Drive in 5-15 minutes, depending on which part you need. West [of I-4] SR 192 (W. Irlo Bronson Hwy), one minute from Silver Lake, has a slew of restaurants, both inexpensive and nicer ones, gift shops, a FunSpot (bungee jumping, etc.), and miniature golf, so we found plenty to do for variety. I would choose this Orlando resort over others for location, facilities, and service. Price, of course, varies on your particular deal.

The pools were pristine and both the pools and hot tub are all salt water so no yucky chemical smell. The Cabana by the pool was open every day. They not only serve finger food but also have a great variety of \"tropical alchoholic drinks\" and fancy smoothies with whip cream and a cherry which my 5 year old daughter loved! If you have young adults they had a karoke evening by the pool one night and bingo in the afternoon that every age group (even the \"way too cool teens') enjoyed. They have music playing by the main pool most of the afternoon and evening and a quieter pool not far away if you'd rather spend a quiet evening. There is a small store onsight that sells everything from bread to Disney tickets and of course Ice Cream Cones (accessible from the pool area). There is a towel service where you can exchange your wet towels for dry towels which eliminates wet towels hanging all over the bathrooms (this is a free service), the gym is well equipped, and the games room for the kids/teens/adults is lots of fun (includes ping pong, pool tables video games (even classics like pacman) price is reasonable (25 cents per token and most games are 1 or 2 tokens). There is a full week of planned activities for children if you aren't spending all you time at Disney (tie dyeing tshirts, and other crafts, drama evening and show, etc). They had a Casino cruise the first night for adults (didn't go but heard it was good). The staff are very friendly and helpful (helped us up with our luggage) you have an activities coordinator that you are introduced too when you check in (gives you her contact information) that can not only give you directions to something other than \"Taco bell\" (In fact if you can't find somewhere to eat near this resort you must be driving with your eyes closed!

We had read some of the bad review and were very afraid to stay here, so I called the resort directly and told of my concerns. They bent over backwards for us and recommended which unit and building to stay in. I changed my mind several times after booking and they changed it for us each time with no problem.

Our bathroom floor and floorboards were dirty with hair and dirt, the toilet wouldn't work from the moment we checked in, the coffee table was broken and had been taped together, the whole place looked like it just hasn't been upkept very well if often at all.

To top it all off I left something in the room, my fault but not the point, i called immediately after we checked out, we would still be in town a few days, and they said it had not been turned in to give it a few days.

The room was a throw back to the 70's. I heard the theme to \"Three is Company\" as soon as I walked in. I expected Mrs. Roper to knock on the door and ask us to the Regal Beagle for drinks! There were full wall mirrors in the \"livingroom/dining room\" and in the bedroom. The kitchen and bathroom were seriously out dated with formica counter tops and old fixtures. The bedroom was tiny. They squeezed a king sized bed into the room leaving almost no room to walk around. There was about 1 foot clearance on 1 side, about 2 1/2 feet at the foot of the bed, and about 2 feet on the side closest to the closet. Everytime we sat upon or got into the bed, the head board banged against the mirrored wall! The unit is marketed as accomodating 4 adults. No way! There was only 1 closet in the entire unit--it was in the bedroom. There was only 1 towel rack in the bathroom. Me, my husband, our 12 year old and 17 month old barely had room to spare. The washer and dryer were stacked in the bathroom--they had to be at least 20 years old. Wait, there's more. The bathroom had mold on the ceiling and in the shower stall. When our 12 year old took a bath in the jacuzzi tub black mold started shooting out of the jets! Yuck! We complained--no action. We told the property manager, who was non-responsive. Then they had to nerve to try to sell is a time share! Are you kidding me?! Also, they charged us $5 per day for a crib. And they charged if you used more than their rationed amount of toilet tissue, paper towels etc. For example, .95 cents for every additional roll of toilet tissue. They gave us 2 rolls for 1 week.

This was truly the cleanest resort we have ever stayed in!!!! -no DVD player. We asked at the front desk and they said that they would be able to bring one to our room. We didn't want to impose so we declined the offer. What we liked about the resort -something to do everyday! The resort has activities just about every hour for both kids and adults. I really enjoyed the $10 spa package!! We ended up staying a day longer because we were having fun! -shuttle to Disney for $10 pp round trip. Shuttle to Univeral/Sea World is $14. We didn't have a car so this was great! You can then take free buses within Disney to get to the other Disney parks. -tennis/basketball court. You can rent the equipment and the fee is returned once the equipment is returned. -NICE FITNESS CENTER. I am an avid runner and this was one of the nicer resort fitness centers I have used. Sauna in the fitness center -Huge arcade room with pool tables. -HUGE movie theatre! They usually play a G rated movie for the kids at 5pm and something more mature at 7pm. They also have popcorn! -Pools were huge, pool towels can be obtained at the activities center, cabana at the poolside! -There was a convenience store on site but it was very expensive. -Maid service for a fee.

The big plus is the pools stay open until 12 am(sometimes, Later(1 am) but don't tell). It was a real treat to take a night swim after a long day in the park.

A giant Kitchen with every thing from a wine opener to blender. The rooms are large and spacious enough that no one is bumping into one another. The dining room area has a wet bar , a washer/ dryer, a dishwasher, which was great since while I don't mind cooking a meal I hate doing dishes. The bathroom was almost as large as the Master bedroom with it own jacuzzi. The girls had there own small bathroom.

I wanted to get refreshed not the other way around, but that is just me and some other people seemed to enjoyed it..

However, when we got into our room we were pleasantly surprised it was spacious and airy and the bathroom was huge and it was all very clean. The only down side was no maid service unless requested but as we were only staying for 3 nights it didn`t really bother us. The location is excellent for disney, sea world etc and it feels secluded even though it is right off US192. As its not far from I-4 its also good for travelling across florida.

The resort is on a quiet road off Hwy 192 - \"the main drag\" in Kissimmee where all the restaurants and souvenir shops are and it's right by Disney 's Animal Kingdom. I like how there is a security guard at the entrance and they do a good job checking your guest pass, etc. The lobby is large and has a convenience store in it. There's also a counter to buy attraction tickets but she's there early in the morning and leaves early in the afternoon. The grounds are very well kept and quite pretty. From reading the reviews here I requested a newly updated room and they gave us one in the 1700 bldg which is right next to the beautiful main pool, movie theater and golf simulator. The 1800 building is also next to the main pool which has the arcade/game room, gym and internet room on the ground floor. We got a beautiful 2 bedroom, 2 bath condo with a nice size kitchen (full fridge, microwave, dishwasher, plates, etc), very nice living room/ dining room combo with a big flat screen TV and a pull out sofa bed. In the large main bathroom was a spa tub with a separate shower and a washer/dryer, and in the bedrooms were 2 ultra comfy king size beds and smaller flat screen TV's and both bedrooms had their own screened in porch. The main pool is very large, almost shaped like a giant 8, it goes from 3'6\" to 5' deep and is open from 8am to 11pm. There is also a smaller 4' pool next to the main pool which is never too busy. One part of the main pool has a volleyball net and my kids had a great time playing with us or other guests. You do have to provide your own ball but you can buy a ball in the store in the lobby. There's a bar by the pool which also sells ice cream and appetizers which aren't that good but it's convenient. The resort has daily activities - lots of stuff for the kids like tye dying shirts, ice cream parties, movies, ping pong tournaments, etc. There's also scuba lessons and I did the $10 spa treatment but the lady does have \"the products available to purchase\" but there's no pressure and it was quite enjoyable. We did have to do the typical timeshare presentation which wasn't too bad. We sent the kids to the arcade while we did it.

This is in no way a Wyndham slam. Wyndham resorts are outstanding, I just wish there were more of them in Florida. Had there been more Wyndham resorts, I would not have landed in what I will refer to as \"Motel Hell\" aka Silver Lake Resort in Orlando. The only good thing I can remotely come forward with this resort, is that is the location to Disney, but hey....take a look, there are alot of NICE resorts in that area so not such a great or outstanding feature right? You do not need to settle with this type of chaos if you are looking to have a peaceful and relaxing experience. Mine was SO totaly not that. My check in was terrible, the folks at the desk were curt and rude as if I was infringing on their break time. I was cast away like a red headed step child when my reservation was less that what I anticipated or was described to me by RCI. The check in was extremely busy and they did not have enough rep's to cover the need. Can you say WAIT? I had to wait a long time to get the mishap resolved. Ohhhhh if only RCI would have been honest and up front with me regarding this room or lack there of, all of this could have been avoided. But RCI was not. After all who is gonna sell you on a dump? But it's a really great deal! DO NOT FOLLOW THEIR ADVICE! RCI was not forth coming with the fine print right off the bat, thus leading to my check in troubles....It SO could have been avoided if RCI were to have been looking out for it's members. I was told it was a very nice resort and was a great deal to boot and that I should take it now while it was available as it would not last the hour. I SOOOOOO wished I had passed on this \"deal\" as it was a vacation nightmare. Had they told me we have occupancy in a lower rated facility, I would have thanked them and stayed home. Look at the testimonials, not much has changed at this resort in the last year. If you are an RCI member take their description of resorts with a grain of salt.....do your own research...they have not stayed there themselves, I would bet. in fact I told Matt, manager of RCI customer service that if Silver Lake were to offer me a complimentary week stay I would give it to some one I hate. I offered it to him even. I had 2 br/2ba accomodations and upon first inspection it did look relatively nice. The grounds were almost decent and the rooms looked adequately furnished but worn. The mirrors definately told the age, or lack of a qualified interior decorator. The lack of a disco ball left me wondering and what exactly was that stain on the comforter? The amenities were less than that of a Motel 8 or La Quinta and that is not saying much for a \"star\" rated resort. Starting with the room.....is it electrical or do they just not take the time to check the light bulbs? My \"light\" went out at that point and I shook my head in disgust. What are they paying the hired help for any way, atleast those that could actually speak english? Did they not understand \" NO LIGHT....LIGHT OUT?\" Or can they not see? The elevator went out conveniently as I returned with groceries. While talking to the elveator repair technician he indicated that this is routine for this resort. I am thinking in the back of my mind....Gosh what if? What if I was on the 4th floor for heavens sake, and the elevator was out for who knows how long. My son who is diagnosed with autism, freaks out on stairwells and heaven forbid the building cought on fire for faulty wiring. I felt extremely concerned and unsafe in a relatively new building. Would I be trapped in an elevator with my disabled son at any moments notice? Well you might have guessed that I was not only concerned but very scared. I hardly slept the nights I was there. The card keys may have worked 1 out of every 30 attemps which would not have been all that bad but the halls are not air conditioned and in Florida, it was a feels like temp of 150 degrees. I was told the room included certain things that were half true. Did the person in charge of lights check this as well? There was no DVD/ VCR player at all. The TV did have a few reconizable channels you could actually tolerate watching and the rest were full of static and snow or I was left with a blue screen of death. That is only of course considering I received any TV service at all. The Toilets scared me as they flushed with such force I was afraid not to put the lid down or I may very well be covered with Pooh! EWWWW! They did have a small game room that ran on tokens which would have been almost medioker but the token machine did not work so that was a HUGE bust. We ended up going to Orange Lake ( a light up the road) to participate in activites and have some actual fun) I am a week owner there so I have full acccess year round. The activities at Silver Lake were a joke. The walls were paper thin and I could hear the young family next door like they were in my lap. The baby screaming and crying at all hours only to be muffelled by the electric guitar and all the vibrations the woofer brought on. What did I hear from the staff or RCI about all this? NOTHING! and we are only on day #2 here. It went south from there at a rapid speed. And you were thinking it could not get worse right? Well I called RCI yet again to complain as the resort obviously did not care and I was told by RCI management that if I was so unhappy with the resort that they would be happy to have Silver Lake Resort Security escort me off the property....yeah folks you got that right. My my son who heard the phone converstation was convinced the resort police were \"coming to get him\" because he acted up to the constant screaming of the neighbors and their lovely electric guirtars. I spent the next few hours trying to calm him down and coax him out from under the bed. Despite my attemps to satisfaction, I turned to my son at day 3 and asked him if we could return home. like many other Silver Lake guests we doing. He told me not to give up.

I know review late just joined TA March 2008. The stay was not part of a timeshare deal and we were NEVER bothered once by anyone trying to sell us a timeshare. In fact the word timeshare was never even mentioned to us we never would have known if we didn\u2019t already read their website. We had a 1 bedroom 1 bath with a studio lock out. There is the main common hallway then unlock door to a little entryway with studio door to right and 1 bedroom door in front of you. Room: 1 bedroom was great, big full kitchen, giant bathroom with really big Jacuzzi tub and washer/dryer in bathroom. Very roomy actually for a family of 5, but we also had the studio lock out but could have easily been comfortable without it. Living room/dining room combo, living room had queen sleeper sofa and 42\" plasma or LCD (can't remember whatever they had in 2004) screen T.V., flat screen 35\" in bedroom, DVD players in both rooms. Nice furniture marble floors throughout, clean, paid extra for housekeeping to come daily. Good size balcony. Pool: Big. Kids loved it, plenty of room, little kids pool for tiny to splash around too, 2 feet deep with palm tree in middle. Bar that serves basic food next to pool. Gated play ground next to pool also. \u00bd price drinks at certain times of happy hour like 4pm - 6/7pm Arcade and kids activities, staff were great with my 3 boys, made tied dyed t-shirts, and other crafts and activities. Popcorn machine next to pool inside arcade, bags .25, root beer float Tuesdays $1.00 and other special things like that. Kids love that stuff. I hope they still have things like that (higher prices now of course). Big Sundries store on property, had a little of everything you might need. Resort has room service of basic food (burgers, fries, pizza, pancakes, and other breakfast, lunch and dinner items) it was good but not consistently good, sometimes only OK. We really enjoyed the resort very much. We had no issues with anything at all during our stay, everything worked, rooms both 1 bedroom and studio looked newly redone, so can't give opinion to service requests, the entire resort was very clean, comfortable, and would stay there again with out any hesitation based on our last stay. When we needed a break from Disney World a couple of days just to unwind and relax we really came to appreciate the resort even more and the kids had such a good time they never even asked when we could go back to the theme parks. Very convenient to Disney World too I think just 1-2 exits at the most to the entrance of Disney World. You really don\u2019t even need a car, we had one, but could do with out if only going to the theme parks, use the shuttle. Silver Lakes is walking distance to all sorts of shops too. Go down the road to Target for your souvenirs and save a BUNCH on stuffed Disney animals, t-shirts, you name it. Target is way better, cheaper and better quality of souvenir items then all those cheesy souvenirs stores off the road too. Go there even before the theme parks that way you\u2019ll know what you can get there for a lot less and compare what you can and can not buy at the theme parks that you or your kids just have to have. We bought so much Disney stuff for our boys and saved a ton. If your like us you\u2019ll still end up buying bags and bags at Disney theme parks too, check them at Disney store you bought them from in the park and pick them up at the end of the day at a central pick-up station or have them delivered to your hotel if your staying in Disney resort properties. Weather in October the best, warm, humidity not bothersome at all. Was not bothered by bugs at all and we were all expecting this, very pleasant surprise!! It's been nearly 4 years since we stayed there and I have read on their web site so many additional upgrades to the property we are looking into fitting another vacation in this year to go to Disney World and will stay at Silver Lakes. We already know it and had a great time. You'll have a great time. I have found the only people who don't have a good time on vacation are the ones who spend their time crawling around bathroom floors to take pictures behind the toilet, dirty window sills and anything else they can find wrong LOL The pictures I\u2019ll post with this don\u2019t forget are nearly 4 years old.

Also, we could get wireless internet access from the balcony of our poolview room, but not the other side of the building. Our initial impression was that the rooms were a little dated, we had previously stayed at Vacation Village at Parkway in one of their newer units. Our unit at SLR had older appliances, the bathroom jacuzzi tub, shower and vanity were old and ugly compared to Vacation Village. But everything was clean and the bed was quite comfortable, so we were ok with it.

All I had to do was ask. Ended up in the 1000 building/4th floor. I guess I would request a room facing the parking lot/pool.

My daughter is a real water rat. The main pool is kept at a perfect temp, and isn't over juiced with chemicals. The poolside tiki bar is a nice touch. Decent drinks and food. The gameroom was well equipped with modern video games, pool tables, and ping pong. There is also alot for kids in terms of crafts and activities.

Parents own a Timeshare here, hence going so often, and Im glad they bought it, cos this place was/is fantastic. Firstly as others have mentioned, the customer service is fantastic. From the reception/helpdesk, even just random staff you see when walking around the resort, ALWAYS friendly, i've never seen a miserable member of staff there. Maintenance etc. is on hand if there are any problems, and nothing's perfect, so if you are unlucky to have a problem, then at least youve got friendly helpful people on site to assist with issues, which are usually dealt with very quickly. Room-wise, (and I've not stayed in any of the newest apartments, newest was the big block behind the main pool when I went), they are very modern and very well furnished with alot of the essentials and some nice luxiries. I know some people on here complain about the smaller rooms, but you pay alot less for those and theyre more intended for short stays. Yes those kitchens etc. are cramped, you dont get as many nice features, smaller TVs etc. I've not even stayed in the newest rooms with the LCD/Plasma TVs etc. but the large semi-newish rooms I'd stayed in were excellent. Beds were very comfortable, good kitchen, very nicely furnished. Unless youre used to staying in 5-star resorts (in which case you'd probably be in one already) then you should find the accomodation very nice. I think my only criticism would be what others have mentioned, which is the air conditioning sometimes making the rooms cold, especially at night. BUT if youve been on the tennis courts or even just out for the day in the HOT florida weather, its such a nice relief to come back to the A/C lol :) So definete thumbs up there from me. On-site, theres alot to do, youve got tennis courts, a Gym, Internet Access (Rubbish PCs when I was there though, could barely load MSN and a few IE windows up :P hopefully improved since then), a games room (quite old games though when I was there, we're talking 1990s style Arcades in 2004 -.- bit sucky but eh you go on holiday to get away from those things, and the kids will be entertained anyway. Im a bit too old to be spending $50 in there now haha). But anyway, youve got the pools (from the photos/other reviews, more pools now), the cabana which is nice for a casual drink/snack, the entertainment is great, always things going on, for all ages, which I think is good. TBH theyve probably added alot more since then, I've been there from when they were like..a quarter of the size of what they are now, and theyve always improved on the stuff available on-site. Location is great as others have mentioned, as youre right next to Disney Parks, still very close to things like Universal etc. and youre right next to the.... bleh cant remember the \"Highway\" (Bronsen highway maybe), which has alot of nice shops there, not high-street equivalent ofc, you go to Florida Mall for that, but nice restaurants (Bennigans, please, go there, basically a TGI Friday grade-restaurant, VERY VERY friendly staff, who actually understand what customer service is, great food, great value for money), various flea markets, all sorts of souvenir shops to visit etc. etc. Honestly I couldnt explain whats all there, because theres so much. Water Mania is even further along (Basically a less-grand version of Wet and Wild, but its cheaper and less crowded too, as well as easier to access). As i mentioned youre not too far from things like the Florida Mall or the Sand Lake Road Area (lots of good shops, Wet and Wild etc. etc. if memory serves me correctly) Wow I keep writing, hopefully if youre interested in visiting this place, then you've read this far. Alot of good reviews, but I wonder how many people here have visited this resort over ten times :P But also, theres just so much good stuff. This resort is fantastic, I hope it doesnt grow too much, because it'll turn into an Orange Lake type resort, which doesnt seem as \"personal\", as its just endless waves of villas leading to the main area, this is much more closely-knit, and the staff are awesome. The location is perfect, youre near everything, always alot to do. Honestly can't recommend this place enough, I think the only people this wouldnt be suitable for is someone looking for a very serious Honeymoon, but tbh i'd go to this place, I mean i suppose with all the kids running around its not ideal for some, but you can go to so many nice places with a partner or whatever. Its not really the place you'd go for a \"Lads' Holiday\" either, but then you go to Mediterranean for that, not Florida, so its a moot point. In summary, I loved Silverlake when I went when I was 10 or so, I loved it when I was 16, and I loved it when I was 21. It is the nicest resort I've been to (and Ive stayed at the Meridian Hotel in New York from a Company Incentive, which was obviously much more upmarket and posher, but very soul-less, but still nice), especially given the audience its aimed at (i.e. its not a 5-star, but its the equivalent of, for people who maybe dont have tens of thousands of pounds to throw at one holiday... It really is that good. The people who had negative experiences here, that really does suck, especially the one who had their credit card/\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 stolen, althoguh that is an isolated incident. This is a very prestigious resort with a very good track record, and Ive been 11 or 12 times and not had any problem like that. Definetely DEFINETELY worth going to. You will NOT be disappointed. All my most memorable vacations have been here. If I could right now, i'd leave the rubbish that is England and live in one of their apartment blocks :P", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cDon't ever go there Employees that steal\u201d", "Author": "cmburke2005", "ReviewID": "UR12397825", "Content": "While on vacation the resort seemed wonderful and had a great time.

Stayed with my parents and my wife. Our stay was very positive. Our unit was a 2 bedroom villa on first floor (don't have to worry about stairs) in the 200 building. The villa was very spacious, clean and well kept. The pool area was well kept and we never had a problem finding a chair, then again, this was low season. We enjoyed the outdoor hot tub, though did have concerns with unaccompanied young minors in there alone. Did encounter some noisy teenagers at the pool, but no big deal. My mother enjoyed the heated pools and the exercise facilities and sauna. I made use of the free internet daily. Thanks to previous reviewer who suggested bringing own laptop- I was able to connect (though it was slow) for free as opposed to using in-room connection for a fee. There were a few minor issues. The water pressure was great but the hot water setting is much too hot. Almost got burnt a few times. Also, the clothes dryer in our unit left stains on clothing -not sure if it was rust or baked on crud from previous users who put something in it that shouldn't have been there. In any event, the stains washed out, but I was afraid to use the dryer for white clothing. The ensuite bathroom off the master bedroom was very nice and spacious also, but found the location of the toilet to be awkward. It was literally enclosed in a small closet-type space with it's own light and fan and I felt claustophobic when in it . A broom and sponge mop were provided, but no dustpan or pail. We had 2 large TV's in our units but the quality of reception was not too good. There was an LCD TV in the 2nd bedroom and it worked fine. This location is excellent for families who intend to go to Disney, although that was not the purpose of our trip. Guest services were thoughtful enough to provide written driving instructions to popular attractions, but perhaps the return instructions could have been included as well as street names. Eg. instructions for Publix grocery store simply says \"...turn right at next light\", but doesn't say what the name of the street was. Plenty of restaurants and shopping near by but definitely not walking distance. We attended the timeshare presentation just to see what the condos looked like (newer but slightly smaller) and the money involved. It was not a high pressure sales presentation so we were happy with that. They offered tickets to attractions or $100 US cash for attending. The breakfast was nothing to write home about. Other than that, no regrets about attending. Staff at Silver Lake Resort were very nice and friendly; maintence workers were always busy working on the grounds, guest services were friendly and helpful. Some Helpful Tips: We really made use of our kitchen, so I would suggest bringing coffee and filters (as well as any other dry goods you can bring) because you only get 1 bag (4 cup serving) or you could purchase through them for a lot more money. Teabags were provided but it tasted awful. Bring your own sugar and creamer, too. Really, the only thing they gave you is salt and pepper, 1 laundromat-size box of Tide, dishwasher detergent, and dish detergent , shampoo and conditioner ,and hotel-sized soap. If you need more, resort will SELL to you. Supply of paper towels, tissue, toilet paper and garbage bags were adequate. Bring a nightlight and plastic hangers for those wet swim suits. I also brought along a hook on a suction cup-it was useful in our shower stall.", "Date": "December 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NorthCarolina", "Title": "\u201cSilver Lake Was Excellent!\u201d", "Author": "sjaem01", "ReviewID": "UR10928297", "Content": "We were at Silver Lake on Oct 21-27,2007.

That itself is worth a lot, and apparently what Silver Lake is using as their main draw. A+ The buildings were okay, decent enough accommodations, though if you like a firm bed, beware, the mattresses have extra thick pillow top that made my back ache (much too soft). Our spa/whirlpool, like others have noted, kept going off randomly (a known bug, annoying when it woke the kids from sleep). Furniture was fine, kitchen well equipped if somewhat cheap accessories (to be expected in timeshare type place). Nice big pool (though only small kiddie one heated, despite claims on website). Washer and Dryer a bit disappointing (small aging stack type), small and dryer could dry 6 shirts at a time at most. Supposedly has wireless throughout for $10/day, but my laptop couldn't detect any signal. Wired connection did work for the most part (intermittently went down). B The staff were very pleasant, cordial, did their best to appear helpful, but very poor follow through. For instance, called and confirmed \"mid-week tidy\" twice, no one ever showed up despite scheduled time! You would think they would make up for it by coming the next day... nope. Called couple of other times for things like fresh towels, toilet paper, etc.., they followed through about 50% of the time. C+ Cleanliness perhaps related to staff, but I thought worth a mention. I wonder if they miss the \"mid-week tidy\" all the time, they probably need to do them more often. The floor was filthy, white socks became dark grey/black socks on the bottom after about 15 minutes of walking around. Ants and other insects were abundant (probably didn't help we were on the ground floor), but bearable. Some of the walls had a half hearted patch job (not sanded or painted). Spa/whirlpool had water in it when we got in (hopefully from being cleaned, but who knows). D So, all in all, ok. Certainly not a terrible miserable place, but wouldn't go back to it given so many other choices in the area (location isn't *that* good).

First off, the resort was recommended to me by my aunt who had spent time there last year. So I used that info to leverage that I needed a good room. I also said that my fiance and I were interested in possibly purchasing in the coming years, and my aunt's postive review made us more interested in Silver Lake. IT WORKED! By the way, my boyfriend and I are NOT engaged, not living together..and this helped us when straying from the sales pitch. We stayed in the 1700 building, which in my opinion is the best location. You're RIGHT next to the main pool and the cabana. Adjacent is the 1800 building which houses the gym (yeah, never made it there) the arcade, the business center, etc. PLUS, there's TONS of parking there. The main pool was great, though must admit we only swam once. The cabana was a bit pricey for what they served, but it's right at the pool and we realized the serve Coronas in a bottle (for all you cruisers who are used to no glass around the pool, this is great!) So we threw some coronas in my beach bag and sat by the pool with them. The back entrance is great. You LITERALLY make a left and you go around 2 bends and you see Disney's purple signs. They give you towels, two packs of dishwasher detergent, a mini dishwash soap, a small box of tide, and some Bath & Body Works products. We went to the Super Walmart and stocked up on some more stuff once we got there (Coming from NJ, Florida groceries are so cheap! We didn't worry about throwing out some stuff). Our ONLY issue s and this is BEYOND minor is that whenever we used the jacuzzi, it would randomly start up again like 30 minutes after it was drained. We merely had to push a button (which one time was the \"Light\" button for some odd reason) to shut it off, and it didn't do it again. The other issue was the iron they gave us leaked a lot of water when in use. We could have called the front desk, but it was more just a situation of iron it, let it hang on the chair while it's drying, and then get dressed before you leave... Again, VERY minor! They apparently do housekeeping midweek for a week's stay, as well as a towel exchange. Personally, for us, since I had to buy laundry detergent anyway, I just washed our towels everyday as part of a daily routine. Was no biggie. Threw them in before leaving for Disney, came home for lunch, and threw them in the dryer. We also didn't have them clean up either..we just kept it neat ourselves. I personally prefered this due to the fact that I didn't want people in the room w/o us there (just a pet-peeve I have). When checking out, if you're leaving early in the morning, you can check out the night before and just give your key cards to the security guys when you leave. They'll also print out your boarding pass for you when you check out. Great place! Great location!

Anyway, more about the suite, we were 10 - 20 yards to the private movie theater, golf simulator, computer room, game room/arcade and 3 pools including the large free form pool, the kiddies pool, 1 other pool and even the hot tub/spa. Con: the movie theater only plays a year old movies and is always empty due to this fact. The hotel staffs were friendly from the front desk people to the pool girls to the cabana guys, all of them were pleasant. My 2 year old toddler got air sick from flying in and I called the front desk to let them know that I'm calling an ambulance at 5am, and the gentleman name Carl was very nice; he sent security over to close the doors and he even called me the following night to see if all went well. This is how sweet the people who work here was. However, they did try to entice me with the timeshare meeting once when I checked in and then again via phone call, but I simply decline and they leave me a lone. If I ever return to the Kissimmee area, I'll surely stay here again. However, there were 2 major set back to let you all know and that is there are no restaurant on the premises, so please eat out or cook because the cabana has limited amount of food, like chicken wings and hamburger and if you don't eat this; make sure and plan for your meals ahead because the pool closes at 11pm and so is the cabana. The other set back is the entire suite is tiled and very cold except for the bedrooms which have commercial carpet. Hope this review is helpful and the photos give you a better idea. I write this review because somebody else was kind enough to do the same for all of us so we can make better decision of where to stay. Thank you and I hope you enjoy your stay.", "Date": "September 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201cWe Loved This Place!!!\u201d", "Author": "lisa_noe", "ReviewID": "UR8495976", "Content": "Purchased a 7 night stay in a 2 bedroom condo from Bigdog vacations on E-BAy.

We were in the larger one-bedroom condo (sleeps 6) and we were in the 300 building. We were in Orlando on family vacation to Disney World, Universal and a day trip to Cocoa Beach. With all that we had planned during our vacation we didn't spend time enjoying the resort amenities including the pools. All seemed to be clean and enjoyed by those we saw. We arrived two hours early for the 4PM check in on Saturday. I told Marc at the front desk that we were tired from our drive and anything he could do to get us in early would be appreciated. That's all it took. He got us into our condo right away. He was friendly and very helpful. After receiving our keys we were directed to a desk where the obligatory \"would you like a tour\" question came. All I had to say was we are there using the RCI points and no more was said about that. Again the staff person was friendly and said that if there was anything they could do to make our stay more enjoyable please let them know. The 300 building is a walk up (no elevator) but this was no problem at all. We entered to a clean, large one-bedroom condo. Having read previous posts here I was not surprised at all to find the numerous floor-to-ceiling mirrors. We had the dishwasher and the stacked washer-dryer and those were well used during our stay. The kitchen comes with all glass/silverwarre and dishware that you might need during your stay. We brought dish-machine liquid, Tide & Bounce (they only provide small one use samples). There is a Publix grocery store very close (>2 miles) and we were able to get enought groceries for breakfast and lunch for the week. The King-size bed in the master was wonderfully comfortable; my kids reported that the fold-out full-sized beds were fine. We did not have any plasma TVs. The Living Room TV was large (52\" or bigger). There was also a 26-32\" in the master and a small TV in the kitchen. All had cable. There were no DVD or VHS players. The master bedroom also comes with a safe (no charge) with electronic key that you set . We had to call maintanance to set this up for us so that we could set our own key number; we used it all week with no problems. There were two bathrooms; they were clean and well stocked with towels. We didn't take advantage of the free mid-week cleanup and towel exchange. There was only carpeting in the bedroom and tile everywhere else. I think the tile in the entry hall and dining area could've been cleaner but it wasn't so dirty that I felt the need to complain. Pros: Location, location location! I know it's been said on this website before but if you stay at Silver Lake you are as close to Disney as if you were staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge (which you can see from the resort property). There's a back gate onto Sherbreth Road that, as you exit and turn left, puts you right onto the Disney property. We NEVER had any problems with traffic into or out of any of the Disney parks. I would like to warn all about Sherbeth Road -- it seems to have become the preferred cut-through to Disney and so can have heavy traffic. And most driving seem to be tourists (like us) who aren't familiar with where the turns are. We were rear-ended as we were stopped for a car in front of us turning (into the Disney security office no less). We are still dealing with this mess. It has nothing to do with Silver Lake of course.. I just want to warn others to be very cautious while driving on Sherbeth Road. CONS: 1) Not enough towel racks in the bathrooms! If our condo is for 6 people where in the world are they all to hang their wet bath towels? There was one small towel bar in the master bath and a towel ring in the other bathroom, and that was it. 2) The outside stairwells were filthly. When we arrived there was actually old, dried food on the stairs to our condo. I left it there, thinking that housekeeping would get to it after they cleaned the rooms nextdoor. After stepping over it more than a few times I eventually swept it up for them. I'm sure if I'd reported it they would've cleaned it up, but I don't think I should ask them to keep their stairs free of trash! 3) The Master bedroom and bath are seperated by glass-paneled french doors.. that had NO covering on them whatsoever! And one whole wall in the large masterbath was mirrors. So if anyone's in the bedroom there's no privacy in the bathroom! Some might like that I suppose (wink). Me... not so much. Parking was fine. The times we returned after 11PM we weren't able to park directly in front of our condo, but were no more than yards away. We would definitely recommend Silver Lake Resort to any families coming to Orlando, especially those going to Disney World because it's so very close and easy to get to from Silver Lake.", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CANADA", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Resort --- Would stay there again !!! :-)\u201d", "Author": "BELLAVEGAS", "ReviewID": "UR8405186", "Content": "We stay at this resort for 16 nights in July 2007- Building 900 Unit 9410!!!

The resort offers various activites for kids, adults, and families. My kids loved the poolside dancing and games. They also enjoyed the game room. Silver Lake is in a great location! Minutes from Disney...and right off of RT 192, which has everything you need (places to eat and shop). Summary: POSITIVES: Spacious room, awesome pool and sun deck, great location, clean, and nice front deck staff.

We checked in early, around 3:00 because our room was ready. We were in the 1700 building, on the 4th floor. We had a two bedroom condo, with the second bedroom in a lockout. Upon entering our condo, I was very impressed. It was much nicer than I expected. It was very modern and nice. There were little imperfections, such as grout stuck on tiles and loose tiles around the jacuzzi in the master bathroom but all in all, it was great. The beds were VERY comfortable, as were the pillows and bedding. Silver Lake also provides Bath and Body Works soaps and lotions which is a brand I frequently use so it was a nice addition. We did a deal to listen to the timespare session for two Disney tickets. My husband and I travel often about three times a year. We were paired up with Robin, who was very nice but new at the job. We would have definitely been done in the 90 alotted minutes but we basically learned about Robin's whole life. We are a young couple and take time to make serious purchases. When Robin's manager, George met with us to discuss purchasing a timeshare, he was very rude and curt. When we said that a timeshare was something we were interested in but needed to have some private time to talk about it, he became very rude and walked away. He basically sealed the deal that we would not purchase a timeshare. We did the Magic Kingdom and Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios so we did spend as much time in the rooms as we would have liked. We did use the main pool. Very nice, vary warm. We went in the pool late afternoon and it was not very crowded. All in all, Silver Lake Resort was a nice part of our two week vacation in Florida.

My husband and I spent our 1 year anniversary there. Our vacation was flawless. Silver Lake is gorgeous, clean, and friendly. The resort is 1.6 miles from Disney property, you can't get any closer. Make a left out of the back entrance to Silver Lake onto Sherbearth Rd, make a right onto Disney property. No highways! No traffic! You're there! Check in/ check out was simple, front desk staff was professional and courteous. The lobby is very inviting; it has a small, convenient store, gift shop, atm, comfortable seating, clean restrooms, tons of travel information and resort representatives are everywhere to help. Visit the tour desk and ticket sales to buy tickets to Disney and area attractions, we saved a lot of money purchasing the tickets at Silver Lake Resort. The main pool area is spectacular! It is in front of the 1800 building and next to the 1700 building. There is a smaller, quiet pool near the 1700 building. The main pool is huge, clean, not crowded and has enough beach chairs and towels for everyone. The cabana bar at the main pool provides music and entertainment, serves food and great drinks. There is a nice size hot tub at the main pool area. The rooms at Silver Lake are amazing. We stayed in the 900 building in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit. The room was very, very clean. No odors, no bugs! Air conditioning worked well. Beautiful, new furniture and comfortable, clean mattressess and bedding. The master bathroom is huge and has a jacuzzi tub for two! The kitchen has all appliances and everything you need including a dishwasher and the washer and dryer is a perfect convenience. The balcony area off of the unit is screened in. There is a nice size pool, beautifully landscaped at the 900 building. Plenty of parking close to the building. The trash room on each floor of the building is clean, and emptied often so there are no trash smells! The elevators were great and you can take the stairs. There are no ice machines, so buy a bag of ice and keep it in your fridge! Silver Lake Resort also has a movie theater and golf simulator. The golf simulator was very fun and helps to improve your game. You can play 18 holes, rain or shine, in air conditioning and watch each swing you take! Silver Lake Resort has a well equipped, and well maintained, gym and work out center with an awesome weight room, cardio machines and saunna. There is an activities center with a huge arcade and gameroom! A computer room with internet access. The resort provides a list of organized and directed activities for kids and families to participate in each day. Best of all, you can walk to everything I decribed at the resort from your room! No driving and parking! Don't be afraid to take the tour to get information about timeshares at Silver Lake Resort. It is worth it to get the discount on tickets to Disney and area attractions. The sales representatives are informative and not at all pushy. We didn't purchase a timeshare and no one bothered us about it. The sales tour takes an hour or more. Depends upon you. In addition to being on top of Disney property the resort is just seconds from highway 192 which has tons of shopping centers, stores, restaurants, hotels, attractions and service centers. The Orlando airport is about 18 miles away, an easy drive, takes about 30 minutes. Sea World and Universal studios are just past Disney, very close to Siler Lake.

I was very nervous, not knowing what to expect at Silver Lake but we just returned from our trip and I must say that it was sooo much better than I expected. We (myself, boyfriend & 2 kids; ages 10 & 13) stayed in room 8301B in the 800 building. The resort itself is a beautiful place. We checked-in around 3am in the morning and we were done in about 5 minutes. The guy behind the counter was very courteous and helpful. When we were walking down the hall towards our room, I got nervous because the carpet was badly stained throughout the hallway. I couldn't help thinking about some of the pictures here on tripadvisor and the bad experiences people had. I held my breath and opened the door. There was a smaller hallway/foyer inside with the other door to the \"A\" unit. We walked inside and I was amazed to how beautiful the room was. It was spacious and clean. The kitchen had all the necessary things that you could possibly need to prepare a meal, but it didn't have a dishwasher. There was a washer/dryer in the unit. I layed on the pullout sofa to make sure it was comfy for the kids and it passed the test. The master bedroom was very nice. The bed was so, so comfortable that I didn't want to get out of it. The bathroom had a regular DEEP tub and it was very clean. They even made decorations out of the towels. I have to complain about the shower head, though. It wasn't all that great, but it gets you clean. From our balcony, we had a view of the pond and the playground. We could see the main pool and the 1800 building in the distance. Our building was directly across from one of the pools, nice size and was never crowded. I have a few other complaints..............our unit had tiny ants everywhere but a can of raid solved that. Also, there was NO plasma TV. According to the floor plan that was emailed to me, a plasma TV should have been in the unit. We overlooked that since the kids had a TV to watch and my boyfriend and I had one in our room. Since we were harldy at the resort because of Disney, we really didn't get a chance to see what the resort had to offer. We did go swimming at the main pool and had a nice time. We checked out the arcade room and the kids loved it. FYI, because we were staying at the resort for 1 full week, we were offered a \"free\" middle of the week maid service.

I had been researching a nice place and deal on a resort stay in Orlando. What I found was a \"Luxurious\" 2 Bedroom Condo via Carson Travel on Ebay. Lets just say that Luxurious was definately NOT what we got. \"Dump\" would be a much better description word which they should have used. Heres my story start to finish as to my experience here: We arrived Friday the 13th of July expecting a wonderful stay in this \"Luxurious\" room at this Five Star Resort. We were greeted quickly because it was late when we arrived and given a room in the 900 building. I had checked here via Travel advisor and saw someone elses stay in the 900 building was very good so I assumed to myself at that point....ok....we did good. We should have no problem and that we got \"lucky\" getting a room in one of the newer buildings and all should be good. NOT!! I probably should have known better than to book a vacation stay starting on Friday the 13th....but hey I was never suspicious until NOW! We headed up to our room in the 900 building. We used one of those luggage carts and got all of our stuff together and went up to the room. We walked into this \"Luxurious 2 bedroom Condo\" described on Ebay to find the Dump of Dumps! The room had black scuff marks all over the walls in the living room area when you first walked into the place. In the second bedroom which was suppose to be for the kids had the air conditioned vent exposed and falling down. The bathroom in which the \"jacuzzi\" tub was in the Master had black marks all over it as if someone had walked all around in there with dirty feet or shoes. The \"Jacuzzi\" tub itself was a complete joke in size. We've stayed at Westgate Vacation Villas b4 and was expecting the Jacuzzi tub like they offer there....which is a huge mini pool size Jacuzzi tub. This one was a regular size bathtub (maybe a touch bigger) with Jacuzzi jets. Blah! NOT what I expected at all. I had read up on the resort prior to going there and on their website they explain that there is DVDs in the rooms. NOPE! There was a VHS player in that one! 5 star??? Hmmmmm.... LOL! Kinda made me mad too cause I had rented some DVDs for the trip which we never could use. Ok..going off subject let me get back to the room. The furniture in the living room was OLD and WORE. Definately NOT what I was expecting. The bed in the Master looked as if someone had jumped up and down on it. Needless to say I sat down on the old chair in that living room and just started crying. My husband called down to the front desk and explained to them our disgust over the room they had given us. We were told that they would send someone up to check out the place. They sent up a security guard and the man in charge of housekeeping and they both said how they couldnt believe that they could give someone a room in that bad of shape and disarray. They said they would go down and tell them at the front desk and that they were sure something would be done. We waited 45 minutes in that \"dump\" of a room with no calls from the front desk. Finally my husband called down there again and was met with \"Im sorry there are no other rooms\". Can you believe that??????!!!!! They were not going to do ANYTHING to fix this situation and expected that we were just going to sit back and stay in that place. NOPE...not me. We hadnt unpacked anything and still had all of our stuff on the luggage rack. We just rolled it back downstairs and packed everything back into the van. We then proceeded down to the front desk where my husband went in and tried again to get this worked out because we were not going to stay in that room. The 2 girls at front desk were both rude and explained there were no other rooms and that there was nothing they could do. We tried to call Carson Travel on the \"Emergency\" number and nobody answered or called us back. We were just stuck. I was extremely angry at this point and moved all of our things into the lobby there at Silver Lake and proceeded to camp out there until something was done to fix this. The kids made a bed out of the couch there in the lobby. They put on their pajamas via the bathroom there in the lobby. My husband went to McDonalds and got the kids dinner which they sat and ate prior to laying down to sleep. They had their DVD players out watching them and just completely makeing themselves at home in the lobby. While it was a bit embarrassing, I didnt care...those people needed to know that we were not going to take this from them and that they had better give us another room. Our original check in time was approx 9:30pm that night....by the time all was said and done....it was now approx 3am in the morning and my family was still camped out in the lobby there at the resort. Finally a shift change of sorts happened and they had a new guy at the front desk who had no clue what was going on. My husband went to him and told him how the other girls would not offer us another room. He checked his computer and BAMMO guess what -- there WAS another room. He was kind enough to get us into that room which we inspected prior to dragging the kids up there who btw at this point were sleeping on the sofa there in the lobby. The room was acceptable. It was in the 800 building. It was a lock off 1 bedroom room with the other section we could use as well for the kids. Not very good considering they were two 11yr olds and were in the other lock off away from us. Sure they liked it, but not really something that should have been offered. My husband said we would take it for no other reason than the kids needed a place besides a sofa in the lobby to rest their heads and it was around 3am. That room was clean, but no DVD player, not even a VHS player in this one. Minor detail I know, but they advertise on their website that they have them in the rooms. They even go further to say that there is a place there in which you can rent DVDs. No such place exists there, so dont expect it. The first girl who was so rude told us that there were no DVD players at the resort at all...which I knew was a lie because of reading right here in Trip Advisor of some people mentioning them who very recently had gone to the resort. I really hate being lied to. We stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights. Things did seem to get somewhat better after that first night in the lobby, but I was still really upset over the way I was treated and lied to. We let the kids check out the ammenitys around the resort, they liked them. There were several pools and all were pretty accessible. They checked out the game room, which was a place they enjoyed however the website from this resort makes it seem that air hockey and pool were free for guests..its not. Make sure ya bring plenty o' money. The kids wanted to use the work out room and were met with a NO your too young. My husband had to specifically go down there with them to use it. They have a sauna useable from that area. The kids did like that...but again, a parent must be with them to use that area of the resort. The Computer area was free for guests but very small and you had to get on a waiting list to use it and kids were not allowed to use without an adult with them. Let me tell you, my kids can use a computer better than I can...but ok...we went with the rules there. You have to put your name on a list for a time you want to use the puter, and come back at that time to use it. They limit you to half hour at a time...so you sure better use it fast! They offered Karaoke on Friday night by the pool which sounded like alot of fun but we were camped in the lobby at the time and missed out on all that. The resort website mentions a Theatre for the kids. Saw the theatre but it was being used by the Timeshare people....not for what it was intended. Didnt see any time that a movie was offered for the kids. They tell you there are alot of activities for the kids and even have an activities center, but dont give you a list or call or anything telling you what they have for the kids. We had to call down ourselves to find out and were met with ....I think this is what they have available. Bah! Whatever. They had ice cream sundaes for 2.00 down at the main pool at 2pm daily. They did have that. They had a scavenger hunt Sunday night at the main pool but our kids were just a couple minutes late and there was nobody there that could tell them how to get involved in it. Overall once we were moved FINALLY to a new room, the resort stay was ok....but honestly it was the worst vacation I have ever had. The staff was mostly rude but the manager that next morning was nice...Ill give them at least that. The man giving the timeshare presentation was nice and he didnt try to pressure us at all considering the time we had the night b4. I told him right off the bat I wouldnt buy at that place EVER because of what I went through the night b4. He understood and explained to us that the first room we had is one owned by Carson Travel and that it only looked bad because it was one of their rooms. I dont know how much to believe of that considering each owner in the resort pays maintanace fees on the condo's/villas...but hey...I let the man talk. He explained to us that Carson Travel would no longer be allowed to have Silver Lake access...but Im willing to bet if I checked ebay right this second they would still be offering vacations there. In closeing.......your takeing a gamble in setting up a vacation at this resort. My advice is to ONLY get a Villa. They seem to be the newest and the nicest from my checking around while there. Dont pay attention to the pictures on the websites because those are ONLY the villas...they are NOT the condos. The condos are pretty generic overall.

We were orginally placed in the 800 building in a B unit which was an 1 bedroom lockout unit meaning that it was suppose to be part of a three bedroom. We had a small master bedroom the pullout sofa was awful the children could barely sleep on it and w did not have a plasma tv, or dishwasher or a full-size kitchen our patio set only had one chair. On that Sunday we went on a tour of the resort and the sales people were really mean when we told them we already owned through RCI and we had just bought at Westgate Palace resort the day before (which by the way is beautiful, if you are interested in doing a 4 day 3 night visit for $99 at westgate please contact me) anyway we did the tour and was shown this beautiful model room. We immediately went to the manager and she changed our room that evening to the 1000 building we stayed in room 10106G which had all of the amenties on the website. Other then that the pool was nice.

Check-in We were already in the area that morning so we called ahead to see about what time we could check in. They said the earlier we get there puts us on priority list, which we did. Check-in was a snap, very friendly service reps, and a quick stop at the time-share coordinator desk to get some coupons, our parking pass and get signed up for a time-share presentation. It was 10AM, and our room was not ready, but 2PM the room was ready. Check-in is 4pm so we got in a little early, which was great. Initial room tour Wow, huge 2 bedroom, we called it the \"house of mirrors\". Every vertical surface is covered in full floor to ceiling mirrors, and I mean everywhere. Somewhat dated decor, wicker chairs, simple counter tops and cabinets in kitchen, wicker entertainment center. Missing was a DVD or VHS player, don't know if it was just omitted or not available in the 200 building. Our patio, as all are, was screened in with a big ceiling fan, and the back of the unit looked out upon a nice greenbelt with a shared BBQ downstairs. We were on the 2nd floor, (stairs only) of a 3 story building. Kitchen was fully stocked and well appointed. This is a fully non-smoking resort, not voluntary, definitely non-smoking, not even an ashtray in sight!!! Unit was very clean. Master bedroom is huge with a pool like whirlpool tub, with more and more mirrors, and a separate walk-in shower. There was also a doored toilet, very private. Plenty of counter space in the master bedroom. The 2nd bathroom was a tub-shower combo with a toilet and vanity in one room. Good water pressure throughout!! No low flow shower heads! 2nd bedroom was a little small with 2 full beds. Very comfortable, pillow top mattresses, and more mirrors. We had a small flat screen TV in the 2nd bedroom, another TV in the master bedroom, and a 3rd in the living room. The 2nd bedroom lacked a decent night stand but had a 4 drawer chest that was old wicker but was functional. Combo laundry machines were just outside the 2nd bedroom and were in their own closeted/lighted area. The entire unit had no carpet, so watch out on slippery floors. The bedrooms had some rugs. The dining room table is glass as is the coffee table. A lot of space to spread out!! The patio was nice as well. No WI-FI available, but you can get in-room internet for $50 for the week, or $10 per day. No DVD or VHS! Cable TV had HBO, and the Disney Closed Network loop showing all resort stuff to do. Pool area Huge, free form pool. Actually the unit has 3. One big one with an island, a smaller one adjacent to it, and a 3rd pool a short walk across the parking lot to another building. There is just one rather small hot tub, which was way too hot. It felt hotter than 104'!!! Lots of chairs, tables and chaises. Karaoke was going on a few nights, there is a bar, pool side. Inside the main building there is a well equipped work out room, no kids under 16 were allowed. There is no restaurant at the resort, however at the poolside bar you can get burgers, salads and sandwiches. Pool says closed at 11pm, but I was swimming with other people at 1145 some nights. Location Its just a stone's throw to WDW. Just out the secondary exit/entrance, its about 1 minute to the Disney World property, and 2 minutes to Animal Kingdom entrance. We rented a car but shuttle service is available for a hefty $10 pp. The Silver Lake has very good security. 2 gates, both controlled and I saw roving patrols at all hours. Quiet at night. I-192 is just out the other gate. A winn-dixie type grocery store is right outside on I-192 and a Publix just a mile or so away on 192. Plenty of eateries on 192. The location could not be beat, unless you were actually on the property itself!! Notes on the week. The business center was quite small and not very useful. Maid service is available mid-week for a fee. They provide 1 trial box of laundry soap and dishwashing powder and additional will cost you $.75, buy some at Winn Dixie for the week. We went to the timeshare presentation which was about 1.5 hours, with provided breakfast which was good. Very low pressure, and since we already had our WDW tickets, they gave us $80 cash. Staff was very friendly and professional. The 200 building is showing its age, on the inside but outside was bright and cheery. I hope Florida recycles, we put many many plastics and cardboard out in the trash and hopefully it wasnt just dumped. Overall Overall a very nice timeshare resort. Clean units, worked well for us and we had not a single complaint. Older in some buildings. The staff said the buildings we were in were due for renovation sometime soon. They are 16 years old now. Other buildings are newer or have been recently renovated.

The room was excellent. I was doubtful after reading the reviews, but our room had been updated in March of 2007. We had new carpet, ceramic tile, a nice clean bathroom and all new furniture. I did not see any bugs/roaches as I had read on a few reviews. As a matter of fact I did not see any creepy crawlers! I was very satisfied. If you are anything like me, I took bug spray just in case! I also took antibacterial items to clean a little myself just in case they did not wipe down certain items in the room. The pools were nice and that was the highlight for my children because they are swimmers. We stayed in the 1700 building. As a matter of fact we stayed in 1740 B to be exact. Had no problem with guest services, they were very nice/helpful. I had a few post cards to be sent to family members and they took care of sending them out for us. We called for new towels and they brought them immediately. I am not sure how the other rooms looked around me, but the unit we were in was great. Also, the parks were not too far from the site, approximately 20 minutes. We went to Island of Adventure and Universal Studios, however the traffic the first day was heavy on 192 and I-4 so leave a little early to avoid heavy traffic.

Although technically not a lockout (as both units enter through a common foyer with no direct door between A & B units), it didn't have the complete amenities of the big room (large flat screen TV, dishwasher) and as someone else posted, the layout is awkward (the kitchen is basically a hallway and bathroom door opening both into bedroom and directly into small living room means absolutely no privacy for more than 2 people). We had three adults and the space wasn't laid out in a way that worked well. Having said that, the room was clean and maintenance quickly fixed a burned-out light bulb. The grounds are well-kept and the pool areas appeared clean. I was surprised to see a washer/dryer in this small a unit, but it was definitely welcome. We are theme-park commandos so spent very little time in the room or at the resort. One poster commented on the availability of wireless, but it is $10/day. The \"business center\" had three PC's running basically in a large closet (not terribly pleasant), but for goodness sake, it's the 21st-century. If you're going to offer online access, do it right and offer free in-room wireless. For visiting the Disney parks, the location is fantastic. My only other beef with the property is that we reserved by exchanging through RCI Points. I already own vacation property. So why do I get badgered about coming to a sales presentation? After quick checkin, got directed to an 'associate' who made small talk for FIFTEEN minutes before asking us about attending a breakfast 'tour' of the resort. Perfectly pleasant, but it took several refusals before he would stop. We received two phone calls during the week again inviting us to breakfast, each time with a more lucrative offer. I didn't book this resort off EBay and I didn't get a 'special' rate for attending a sales presentation.

Both the kitchen table and coffee table were glass which wasn't kid friendly and there just wasn't enough room to walk around comfortably. We also didn't have a dishwasher which is something I have come to expect with gold crown resort. The kitchen and living room was tile, which isn't bad, but it was filthy.

I have never heard of this before and we weren't informed of this when we called to request a crib in our room. The resort did refund us this charge but blamed the timeshare company for not informing us even though we spoke directly with the resort. The pool near the 900 building was beautiful. It was warm, clean and not crowded at all. The towels were horrible but they dried you off. We only went to the main pool once because the other pool was so nice.

I actually had booked the initial vacation through a company that solicits using E.Bay, so as I'm sure many can well imagine, I was quite nervous. I do consider myself to be a fairly seasoned traveller, and have experienced both wonderful and horrific vacations. Before actually leaving, we read several reviews on this resort both positive and negative. After experiencing the resort for ourselves, we both felt compelled to share our experiences. When we booked, we were under an agreement that required my Fiancee and I to attend a timeshare presentation. We had attended one before in Mexico and it was terrible, the sales associates were forceful and rude. This was quite the opposite. We actually enjoyed the timeshare presentation, it taught us a lot about timeshares and all representatives were friendly and helpful. We felt neither pressured nor insulted. The resort itself is quite pretty, it's in Florida, so of course if you're expecting a beachfront property with beautiful sunsets, you won't get it in Kissimmee. It did, however, offer many of the features that are normally at beach resorts. (i.e. swim up bar, daily activities, etc.) Our room was absolutely beautiful, there were zero insects, which is unheard of in Florida, ceramic tiles, fully equipped kitchen, clean and newly renovated bathroom, screened patio, and huge windows. All pools were clean and big, and sturdy lawn chairs were scattered everywhere. Towels were easily accessible both in pool areas and at the front desk, and all staff was friendly, polite, and helpful. We never struggled for a parking spot or for a spot by the pool. It seemed that because there were several pools, children seemed to stick to one and adults to another, which was perfect. The only thing that we could think of that was negative was that it was very difficult to get some time on the internet in their public computer area, however, that being said, wireless internet was available in the room, we just did not bring our laptop. The drive to Disney was so easy, it was basically one street and one exit and the signs are everywhere. We had read several negative reviews for Silver Lake before leaving, and all I can say is that it's not the Hilton, or the Hyatt. It was 100% to our satisfaction and exceeded the expectation for what we paid. I have paid more than double in the past for less than half the experience.

My husband & I booked through Carson Travel and would do it again in a second. We got to the resort late and the front staff were pleasant and friendly. Had a little bit of key trouble and they were there to service us in minutes. We had requested a newer building and had been given our request. WE stayed in the 800 building, I highly recommend this building. we had unit 8203, it was a one bedroom unit and it was breath taking. We came in to the unit and were so impressed, it was not like any of the pictures on here, the owners of this resort really should update their photos of the resort because it far exceeded our expectations after readings the reviews on this website. It was very very clean, well supplied and very trendy and new decor. We had a plasma tv that was a delight to watch, a gorgeous bathroom that was wonderful to relax in, and the best bedroom I've ever seen for a hotel room, it was so spacious, it wasn't huge but the 12 foot (maybe) ceilings really took away from any crampyness. The liani was great, it was nice to leave the doors open at night an feel the breeze and hear the water fountain in the little lake it backed out onto. now of course every place if you want to be petty, has a negative so lets get to it. THe Toilets sounded like a jet engine, their was no keeping your hubby sleeping while you flushed, the couch was a little hard to relax on, the hall outside our room smelled of urine one of the days we were there, but it was only a short lived time of it so it may have been resolved. A swim up bar woud be great :) the buffet meal for the timeshare was very lacking. don't hold out and miss a meal becasue you think your gonna have something good there, becasue it won't happen. they could stand to have an individual basketball court and an individual tennis court instead of it sharing the same area, hard to play a good game otherwise.

Yes, it required I spend 90 minutes in a timeshare presentation - but I wasn't pressured AT ALL. In fact, it was kind of interesting...but my husband and I already knew the whole timeshare thing wasn't right for us. We brought along my mother and 2 1/2 year old daughter and stayed in a two bedroom, two bath unit. And although I took the advise of other reviewers here and requested a newer building, we were placed in the 100 building - the original. As it turns out, I was SO PLEASED...and I'll tell you why: we had a 1st floor unit, which was a blessing due to the fact my daughter loved to run around the place - had we been on the 2nd or 3rd floor, neighbors would have definately complained; and we had the most wonderful views of a beautiful nature/tree area that was so peaceful - we enjoyed a couple of meals and quiet reading time in the veranda area off the living room. Many other units have \"views\" of the pool area or, worse yet, the parking. After the first few nights, I returned to the front desk and shared my delight about the 100 building with the staff. Unfortunately three days into our stay, other guests were placed in the unit above us. There must have been six or so college-aged young men in the unit and I'm not being sarcastic when I say it was LOUD! Every footstep could be heard (likely due to the ceramic tile flooring) I did complain directly to the guys after a couple of days and they immediately turned down the music/noise level. However, there seems to be very little noise insulation between the floors - so you may want to take this into consideration and request the upper level. My only other \"complaint' is the noise level from the pool area. On many afternoons and evenings they conduct various activities - which is a big plus for a lot of people - not those of us with a child who needs to nap or who you try to get to sleep by 8:30 p.m. The 2nd bedroom faced the parking area, adjacent to the main pool. The stereo blasted a lot of music that was wasn't so pleasant...but like I said, this might be something others don't mind and actually enjoy! We were there the first week of March, 2007. Weather in Orlando was lovely, mid 80's the first part of the week and a bit cooler in the lower 70's the last part of our week. Both the air conditioning and heating (yes, we did turn on the heat one night) worked just fine, as did all the very new appliances and washer/dryer. The unit was well stocked with all the needed utencils/pots/pans, etc. The pools were very nice, but not as heated as perhaps I would have preferred. The kids activities were a nice touch, though mostly geared toward kids above the age of five. Other good features include the nightly movies in the theater and the gift shop - well stocked and reasonably priced last-minute items. I couldn't agree more with other reviewers about the location of SLR...literally in the back yard of Animal Kingdom! It was so convenient to visit all the Disney parks and be able to come back for lunch and an afternoon break. We saved a ton of $ by cooking our own meals in the unit - but you will need a car. We shopped at Publix just a mile away (or less) and only ate out once - lots of choices of chain restaurants on highway 192. All in all, I'd definately come back again (especially given that we had a GREAT rate through eBay). I would not hesitate to stay in one of the older units, though probably in an upper floor.

My husband and I booked our stay through E-bay and Carson Travel after doing much research. I had read the reviews of Silver Lake before purchasing the trip through Ebay. I had seen mixed reviews, but figured we would give it a shot. We were really enticed by the closeness of the place to Disney. We traveled with our 3 yr old son and 4 1/2 mth old daughter. I must say overall, the stay was very pleasant. We stayed in the 1800 unit right next to the very large pool that our son LOVED to swim in. Though while there, the heater in the large pool was not working, the water was still warm (though on the chilly side) to swim in. The other pools were nicely heated. The 1 bedroom/1 bath condo was nicely decorated. All the appliances worked. The stackable washer/dryer was very useful. There was a screened in patio that was especially nice given our 3 yr old son. The bed was VERY comfortable! We did not have a DVD player in our room but I think I was told some rooms have them and some rooms do not....no biggie as we had no time to watch movies as we were too busy going swimming and to Disney. Speaking of Disney, this place is soooo close to Disney it is unbeliveable. We literaly made it to the different theme parks within 5 min! Plus the way you come in, you beat allot of the traffic. Location of this place is a HUGE plus....and it is on the West side of 192/Irlo Bronson so it is not as busy. There is pleanty of shopping and food options. Actually it is off of Sheberth Rd which is the road between the end of Disney property/Orange County and Osecola County. In fact, Disney casting and wardrobe across the street. While we were there, they were doing refurbishment to the 1700 buidling....lots of workers around and huge semis that took up part of the parking lot....again no biggie as we were on vacation. They did not bother us and we were able to get a good parking spot. My husband and son enjoyed the game room. They have a computer room that you can use for internet by the game room. If you want to use the wireless if you have a laptop, you have to pay a fee. This was a little annoying as we did bring our laptop and I don't understand why hotels just provide it, but would not prevent me from staying there. We attended a time share presentation as a part of our package. For the most part is was low-key, though the manager had 'access' to inventory that our salesman did not and the price came down dramatically. We did not buy the timeshare and after saying no a couple of times we were let go. We were t here about 2 hrs, but we did not push the 90 min time limit either. They provide a supervised playroom for kids 3 and up which was very helpful as we have a very active 3 yr old. We kept our dauther with us and it was not a problem at all. Though the timeshare offer they have based is on a point system through RCI is interesting, just not a good fit for our family. Overall, we will keep this place in mind for future travel to Disney due to its location. The place was clean and people were friendly. It is not a 5 star resort, so do not expect that.

Negatives- 1) We saw two giant roaches and one waterbug the first day, We called the front desk and reported the problem,granted they sent someone up to spray right away and we didnt see anymore, and this was after the rain storm, but the thought lingered,they need a much better extermination contract. 2) They have some kind of keyboard with wireless service but there is no manual to explain how to use it and what its for, calls to the front desk found them totally clueless. In addition, i was charged for a movie i didnt watch (like i would spend 12.95 for Garfield)and a day of internet use that i never used (prob from playing with the impossible to understand wireless internet trying to understand it.) Despite calling the front desk and being told someone would get back to me about the overcharge, they went ahead and charged me and i never heard from them. The front desk people need to be more accountable. 3) The Jacuzzi in the newer units is very small compared to the older units. 4) The pillows are as hard as rocks. 5) They have 3 pools, but no adults only pool.which is good if you have kids, if you dont. they are all over the pools. An adults only pool is desperately needed 6) Internet access is expensive 9.95 day or $49.99 for the week. should be free or much cheaper. especially since they have only 2 computers working in the business center. Positives 1) It has the biggest and best pool in all of Florida ,and its open until 11 pm every night. There are also 2 other smaller, quieter pools 2) The resort is very quiet and convenient to disney world. 3) Staff is very friendly 4) Plasma television in the newer units is a nice touch, but other 2 TVs in unit were tiny.

I would give it a 4 1/2 star rating. We were a bit nervous about staying here after reading some of the reviews posted on this website. In order to avoid some of the complaints (old decor, cockroaches, dirty carpets), we requested a newer building via email to the reservations department (there were no complaints about the rooms in the newer buildings (800, 900, 1000). I received a response within 24 hours of my initial request from Kristi, the reservation manager (she was so friendly and accomodating), stating that I would need to \"downgrade\" to a different floor plan in order to make the change to a newer building. We were originally assigned a room in building 500 (2 bdrm), which had 2 full beds, queen sofa, and king bed. The floor plan differed only slightly and we lost the 2 full for a king, so we went for it, based on the reviews here. I was glad we did, although I never got to see the 500 building to compare. I did see some photos online of the older buildings and thought we'd go for the newer. We were placed in the 900 building, which I understand is a newer building. We were a family of 6 (2 small children and 4 adults). The unit was a \"lock-off\" unit, which was great since we were traveling with my husband's parents. This gave us the extra privacy, but we left the door open so that they could use the kitchen when necessary. The smaller part of the unit (H, I think) had a microwave and refrigerator, king bed, bathroom and screened in porch (much like a regular hotel room, with a little extra). The rest of the unit had a full size kitchen (fully stocked with all we needed), bathroom w/jacuzzi bath/shower, bedroom (king), living room w/pullout queen size sofa and plasma tv (nice), and screened in porch. Here are the positives: 1--EXTREMELY close to Disney (you're right in Animal Kingdom's backyard, practically). If you follow the hotel's directions, it's the best, going through the back gate. 2--Nice decor--tiled floors throughout, except in the bedrooms, where it's carpeted. 3--awesome pool--they just opened one right next to the 900 building and it is zero entry (like a beach) on one end w/spray fountains--great for the kids. This one is much less crowded and more low key than the main pool. The main pool is nice too, but it's a bit noisy (there's a bar there and they play loud music) and more crowded. 4--FRIENDLY staff. We had the nicest staff check us in and help us w/reservations. We were part of the RCI reservations and were never pestered for a time share presentation, which was a plus! Our room was missing the cookie sheets and they delivered them right away. 5--All the comforts of home. We were able to cook dinner in the room each night and pack lunches for days in the park (they never stopped us from bringing lunch in each day at Disney--a great money saver). We were able to do laundry as we needed to, so we always had fresh towels and clothes to wear. I don't mind doing these things if it saves us money. NEGATIVES: 1--Although the unit overall was clean, the carpet did have some rubber bands on them (like the kind you use in braces), which means they didn't vacuum very well, in my mind. They should have a vacuum or carpet sweeper available for guests, because waiting a week without maid service, the dirt on the carpet accumulates. 2--The jacuzzi tub was a bit nasty. We let the kids take a bath in it and as the bubbles were running, clumps of mold shot out into the bath. We didn't use it again after that. Gross. I did report this to the front desk at check out and she said they would have someone look at it. 3--The unit needed to be painted in a few places. There were scratches and chips out the paint in the closet in the master bdrm and livingroom; but this isn't that big of a deal. It still looked beautiful overall. I would stay here again and you can't beat the price! We stayed at Vacation Village at Parkway last year, which was a definite 5 stars, but this was was a close second.

I emailed guest services prior to the trip to request the 800 building and I guess it worked - they did not email me back, but upon check-in I was given a room in that building. POSITIVES *This resort is COMPLETELY kid friendly. So, if you're traveling with the kids, there are activities scheduled daily to entertain them. There is a great game room and the staff in the activities center seemed nice for what we could tell. *The room we had was HUGE, we had more than enough space for the 4 of us. Room amenities were GREAT, we had all we needed to feel like home. TV's in all rooms and the living room had a plasma screen. *Resort has a great ticket desk to buy tickets (though shop around because we got a better deal for Universal tickets at another vendor) to any park, show, museum, etc. *Location to Disney is phenomenal and the access to highways, shops, and restaurants is great. *Check-in and check-out are smooth and the front desk staff was quite attentive. *Pool side bar serves snacks and the drinks were really good. IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD BE NICE *Better staffing at pool - we saw a number of children pulling down the volleyball net (which is broken/lop-sided because of this) and no one approached them about this. Also, the basketball court is also the tennis court - SO, if someone is playing basketball, others will not be able to play tennis or vice-versa. Separate courts need to be made. *The room we had had bugs (quite a few gnats and we saw 2 waterbugs/roaches). We did call for extermination service and didn't see anymore, but the thought lingered. They need a MUCH better extermination contract. *The TV remote controls had non-working batteries in all of them, which caused us to feel that they are not completely checking all aspects of the rooms before people check-in. Once we called about the problem, a technician came immediately and replaced the batteries. *The resort only had 1 pool available during our stay - GRANTED it IS a HUGE pool, they needed to have the other one open, which is right next to the big pool. A third pool is being build in another location of the complex, which is great because the complex is big enough to need another pool location instead of having people walk further than necessary to the one. *Carpets in the bedrooms needed to be desparately changed. The carpet was unraveling at the ends and was an out-dated brown color. All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend the Silver Lake Resort for those traveling in a group with kids who need space, resort activities, and amenities of home.

We were there from May 15-19 and it was awesome. I have been following reviews on this website for 2 months and have read absolute horror stories. I just don't see how those stories could have been possible. We arrived after hours (7:00pm) on a sunday to a very friendly host. A security guard drove us and our bags to our condo in the 800 building. (yes, after reading some stories about the older buildings i sent an e-mail to silver lake resort [----------------------]) here is a copy of my message and there reply which i received the same day: To Whom It Concerns, Hello! My name is Autumn Ahlers. I have a confirmed stay at your resort from May 14-19, 2006. (Confirmation #896560) My family and I are very excited as this will be our first vacation. However, I due have one concern regarding the condo in which we will be staying. It seems there has been a great deal of negative feedback left by people who have stayed in buildings 1700 & 1800 which i gather are the oldest buildings. If there is any way we can stay in a newer building it would be greatly appreciated.There has been nothing but wonderful feedback left by those who have stayed in buildings 800 & 900. I am aware of the fact that the newest rooms are reserved for timeshare owners and it is on a first come first serve basis. My fiance and myself will be attending a timeshare presentation, as we are interested in purchasing. We would like to see what your resort truly has to offer. Your response will be appreciated and will relieve me of a lot of pre-vacation anxiety. Thank you in advanced. Sincerely, ~Autumn Ahlers and Silver Lake Resort's Reply: Good morning, I have received your request and moved your reservation to the 800 building which shows available at this time for the dates you are traveling. I will do my best to keep you in that building. I cannot guarantee any specific unit number, but have noted your record to please keep this reservation in the 800 building. Frank Mathews, Marketing Fulfillment Manager Silver Lake Resort as you can see they are very hospitable. Our condo was just as described and was very clean and beautiful. We overlooked a pond with a water fountain. We got a 2 bedroom, 2 bath even though it was supposed to be a 1 bedroom, 1 bath.(master bedroom had the oversized jacuzzi hot tub as described and the living room had a flat screen plasma TV. kitchen had all the amenities described including dish washer and washer and dryer) I walked to the Winn Dixie grocery store (.07 miles) and took a cab back ($5.00) with all the groceries we needed for the week. Now for the dreaded time share presentation. We had agreed to a time share presentation for a discounted stay at the resort (6 days 5 nights plus 2, 1 day adult Disney Passes for $189). I've heard horror stories about time share presentations and was expecting the worse. THIS WAS A PIECE OF CAKE. I was whole heartedly interested in the presentation but told the guy flat out we wouldn't be buying today under any circumstance. He went through the presentation in 45 minutes and left us alone to look through the brochure for the remaining 45 minutes. (he isn't allowed to let you leave before 90 minutes although i checked my watch and our meeting was 75 minutes). We then grabbed our 2 free Disney Tickets, grabbed the kids and took a 7 minute cab ride to Animal Kingdom (the closest park) and upgraded or free tickets to a 3 Day Park Hopper ($120 credit for the free tickets). Once at Disney World, with the Hopper Tickets, we got free shuttle to all 4 theme parks, downtown disney (disney quest and pleasure island) and 2 water parks. Ate breakfast and dinner at our condo and had the most affordable time our lives. Hope this was helpful. I think in the future I WILL be purchasing a timeshare at Silver Lake Resort. Oh did i mention the pool side bar that is open from 10:00am to 11:00pm daily ??

We do not own a timeshare. We were simply staying there after a friend stayed there 2 years ago and had a good experience. So, we went on the internet and checked into it and made a reservation. THEN, After reading the reviews, I was very nervous about what we were getting into, but everything worked out great. Here are the pros and cons of what we experienced. First, the pros: We were given a bigger room than we had reserved. We were thrilled to be in a 2 bedroom instead of the one bedroom that we had booked, with 2 full baths. It was immaculately clean. The beds were firm, which is what we prefer. Everything worked -- jacuzzi tub, washer/dryer, appliances, tv, etc. Best of all, the location was absolutely perfect because we were doing Disney all week. The back exit of the resort onto Sherberth Road put us literally 5 minutes from our door to the Animal Kingdom. That was GREAT. It was very easy to navigate Hwy 192 for restaurants and an unexpected trip to buy athletic shoes (SOMEONE forgot to pack theirs....) There was one of everything on 192. The staff was pleasant and helpful. We had to listen to the timeshare presentation and the salesman was very nice and not pushy at all. We were out of there in 90 minutes with no pressure. The pool was beautiful and it was warm enough to swim the last night there. There were towels provided for the pool so we didn't have to use room towels. There were ample diversions at the resort, if we would have wanted to take advantage of them (such as a small movie theatre and a game room) but we were too busy at theme parks to use these amenities. Security seemed to be on the ball. These are the cons: Our room's air conditioner did not work. We called about it and it was checked out, and they said someone would fix it the following morning. The following evening when we returned from our day out, we were told that they could not repair the unit but we could move to another room. So we packed up everything and moved to a room with AC 5 floors up at 10:00 at night. That was a big inconvenience, but no harm done. Also, there was one problem with the keys. Our \"neighbor\" couldn't get his key to work, so security had to reprogram all the keys in a certain area, including ours. Again, just an inconvenience. All the rooms we saw (4 in all) were all solid white walls, white tile, mauve blinds, and slightly dated tropical print furniture. But it was all very clean and very comfy, and we weren't there to look at the pretty pictures on the wall or admire fabric on the couch. There is construction on site, but it appears the work is going on inside the new building, so there was no noise from that. It just looks a little messy on that side of the resort. No Big deal. The back gate onto Sherberth road was a bit tricky to get back in, but only once did we have to give up and go all the way down to Black Lake Road to get back on property. Again, not a big deal. Although the washer/dryer worked and I was very grateful for them, we apparently had the world's slowest dryer -- I had to dry even small loads for a very long time. So, if you're a family going to the area primarily for the theme parks (especially Disney), I would recommend Silver Lake resort. It's clean, spacious, friendly, comfortable, and close to the action.

We have seen a steady decline in the upkeep of Silver Lakes. When we stayed here Sept 2005 it all started going wrong as soon as we tried to check in at 4pm our allocated room was not ready. The room was still not ready by 5pm we decided we would just go for it and let ourselves in as the door had been left open. The room still was not ready - unmade beds, all the drawers in the bedroom were on the floor, also the drawers in the kitchen had been removed and they had been put on the work tops. So okay they may be giving it a clean but they should also think about cleaning the floors and the entrance door as they were just caked in dirt.The windows at the back of the apartment were filthy (we reported dirty windows when we stayed here in 2003so they still have not got their act together on the dirty windows, the shower in the master suite was not too clean and the shower head was hanging off the wall. The whole unit needed re-furbishing. So it happens to people who own here as well as people who rent the week. The security safe had been left locked so we had to call security to come and open it, the guy who came over just did not have a clue how to open it. Eventually after about 2hrs of different guys trying to open the safe hey presto one of them managed to do it. I personally feel that Silver Lakes just does not live up to its Gold Crown status, although I am an owner here. Silver Lakes just does not look well kept at all.

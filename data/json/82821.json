The hotel desk staff could not have been friendlier. Check-in was no longer than 2 minutes. All the pictures you see online are very close to the look and feel of this location. The only handicap room available was located on the first floor and at the back of the hotel. Breakfast was great! All food was either hot or cold as appropriate. Prior to night coming, I would give this location a 10. With all that said, here comes the bad news! The hotel backs to both the train and trolly tracks! Readers take heed, this hotel could not have a nicer staff, cleaner facility or be more accomodating... but if you are needing a good nights sleep... that will just not happen. Yes the front desk staff tried their best to be comforting such as providing as many ear plugs as needed. But that just was not enough. Every 10 to 30 minutes some sort of train or trolly came by. What do I mean some sort of train? There were a variety of forms such as Metro line, Amtrack and the worst culprit, the working trains. Metro and Amtrack stopped sometime near 11 PM, but the cargo trains work all night. The final straw was when I woke to the room trembling. I yelled \"Earthquake\" then as the trembling stopped, the rumbling began and I yelled \"Tornado\" but then remembered oh we are in San Diego, then don't have tornados. Just about that time and RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR HOTEL WINDOW, the train whistles began. What time did all this happen? 2:30 AM! No getting back to sleep for us and all this with a full day of work ahead of us. I went to the front desk and notified them about this at 3:00 am. They were gracious and attempted to find a different room for the next night, but also stated the entire hotel can hear and feel the trains. When I said that would not do, they offered to call a different Residence Inn. They did, and found us a perfect one, quite and we left later in the morning. All in all over the top in nice people, way below in ability to get rest.

The room was clean, spacious, and easily suited our larger group. There were two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a pull-out bed in the living room. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was above average and hot portion (e.g., eggs, fried potatoes) especially good. The hotel is next to Little Italy and a 30 minute walk (or $10 cab) to the gaslamp area and the convention center. As others have mentioned, it's near trains but they didn't keep us awake or anything. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. We had three surprises that were bad, good, and neutral: 1. The hotel website lists a manager's reception but it's actually only Monday to Wednesday. This was a disappointment because (in part) we chose the hotel because of that. Staying Wed-Sun meant we missed it. 2. A welcome surprise was the hotel's free shuttle that will take you anywhere within three miles and pick you up too. The drivers were friendly and prompt. This saved us a lot of cab money and certainly made up for item #1. A very special thanks to the front desk staff and shuttle driver who were working the morning of January 29, who retrieved a lost cell phone from our room and shuttled it to the airport. Above and beyond! 3. I asked the front desk to call a taxi, but after getting in the car we realized it was actually much more expensive than a normal cab ($35 to the beach vs. a $20 taxi ride home). When we complained to the front desk (i.e., we had asked for a normal taxi not a luxury car) they said the hotel was trying out a new cab service that claims \"luxury cabs at regular taxi prices\" but they were quickly finding out that claim wasn't true. So, the hotel refunded the difference in fares! Great customer service there, and special thanks to Ian at the front desk who took my complaint and was very understanding.

Its so difficult to find pet friendly hotels these days. Although I didnt bring my pets on this trip, its nice to know I can! The only suggestion I have would be to offer king size beds & ceiling fans in some rooms. It was hard to sleep comfortably with my fiance in our bed. Just wasnt enough room to stretch out.

We were very impressed with the size of the 2 bedroom suite. Full kitchen and 2 bathrooms. We booked in advance and requested a room not facing the train tracks and we did get this. We did not hear any noise in our rooms of trains. The staff were very friendly and helpfull. Complimentary breakfast daily and light dinners mon-thurs were quite a treat.(beer and wine included) They had a cozy fireplace by the pool where you could relax. WE had the pool to ourselves as no one else was using it on the nights we were there. The trains do come by behind the pool and we sure got a chuckle of the noise it was like a movie lol What we really liked about this hotel is they offer a free shuttle within 3 miles of the hotel. We could leave our car behind and avoid finding locations or parking. Every afternoon they had fresh baked cookies at the front desk for guests. The shuttle drivers were very friendly (Mark and Gerardo) who made our trip special. WE got a good rate by booking 8 mths in advance with AAA but If I had to pay $299 a night like some were I would be disappointed as this was too much for a hotel room. We would definatly return as the location suited us very well. The Saturday farmers market to walk to in Little Italy was fabulous. The trolley train is only a block away if you wanted to take it to go shopping or other attractions. One negative was that I saw a dog out on a balcony and if I had allergies I would be making sure I requested a room that is pet free!

My son and I were there for Comic Con. We had been placed on a wait list for a hotel that was nonsmoking and this was the only that had any space. The room was spacious and very clean. The accommodations were as represented in the website photos. The staff was very nice and courteous and responded quickly to any of our requests. Unfortunately the hotel is close to the train route. I am a very light sleeper and have insomnia so it was near impossible for me to get any more than a few hours of sleep. The first few nights I heard the train at 6:19 am and then 20 minutes after that well in advance of when I really wanted to wake up. On Saturday night in addition to the 6:19 am noise from the train, I heard the train at around 1 am. So I can not in all honesty recommend this hotel to anyone who has any issues with noise for sleeping. Even my 11 year old son who is a very heavy sleeper woke up due to the noise. I would not have booked with them had I known about the proximity to the trains. Another issue was the lack of wifi access to the internet. (Not a big deal and they did have instructions on how to connect). One recommendation would be to also include instructions for Apple systems (instructions only were for Windows). The only option was to use a ibahn cord located on the desk. The internet connection was not high speed at all. The average download speed at best was around 0.58 Mb/s for download and average 0.40Mb/s upload speed.

Yes, I am here in San Diego for Comic-Con. I am one of hundreds that stayed in this sold-out Residence Inn during Comic-Con 2010. While most will be basing their reviews on a $200+ per night room I am basing mine on a $149 per night room as I got in right before rates were raised. Most of you reading this review will be booking this hotel at the streamlined rate. I came into San Diego a day early and stayed one night at the Courtyard Marriot located across the harbor at the Airport/Liberty Station. It is a spectacular Marriot and you can read my review of it on TripAdvisor. I was very concerned when upon my second night in the city I came to the Residence Inn. It doesn't look nearly as nice from the outside, and when I saw an Amtrack train running directly behind it, I thought I was going to be miserable for the rest of the week. Looks can be deceiving. This was my first time at a Residence Inn so I didn't know quite what to expect. When I opened my room door, my jaw dropped. Here was what amounts to a mini apartment. You have a kitchen with microwave and refrigerator, a living room and a bedroom that is separated by a wall in some rooms, and in some others is not. I was fortunate to get a bedroom with a wall separation. Bed was very, very comfortable. I slept soundly. I have never been in a hotel room like this, and really, it's a wonderfully roomy little suite. Where this hotel really exceeds is the little extras that you get. In the morning there is a free hot breakfast that is quite good. There's eggs, breakfast potatoes, french toast or pancakes, oatmeal, waffles, muffins, cereal and doughnuts. There's coffee and a soda machine that also has apple and orange juice. It really is a nice little spread. On Mondays - Thursdays from 5:30-7:30pm there's free food in the lobby. I only was there one night during at that time and they were serving up hamburgers, hotdogs, beans, potato salad and potato chips. It was pretty much as much as you wanted though I am sure the hotel would appreciate no-one making a pig of themselves. Oh, did I mention there was free beer on tap as well? ...and, yes, free high-speed Internet in the rooms! The clerks as the front desk were always very friendly and helpful with our questions about the area. In fact, they were most helpful in holding a room for my colleagues and I as we got into town very early in the morning and were driving to LA. They blocked out three rooms for us and when we got back late that night those rooms were available to us. There is a nicely sized pool on the premises and a fire pit that is lit at night to provide warmth to the couch chairs that surround it. Very nice touch. Now here is the big question that all of you have on the forefront of your mind.... How bad is the train situation? The answer is, very bad. There is an Amtrack train and Trolley that runs seemingly non-stop directly behind the hotel. The Amtrack is blowing its horn throughout the day. At night the train seems to blow shorter/quicker horns in an effort to be less annoying at those hours, but it still must run its horn to warn anyone at the crossing gate nearby. To be honest, it never woke me. Then again, my room was the other side of the hotel. But you know what? It doesn't matter where in the hotel you are, the train is right there. If you slept during the day I could see the noise being a problem because it's like Grand Central Station behind the hotel. At night, not as busy. The hotel does supply you with a set of earphones. You can talk about how bad the train situation is at this hotel, but from all the reviews I read about the Hilton and the Marriott down by the Convention center, they both have the same train problems. In fact, it would be very hard to find a hotel close to the water that doesn't have train service nearby. If anyone looking to save a few bucks and stay at this hotel during a convention such as Comic-Con, I have great news for you. The Trolley station is right around the corner. The walk is under 5 minutes and you simply take the blue line to Americana Place and then switch to the Orange line to the convention center. During big events like Comic-Con there is express train service that goes directly to the convention center without transfers. So, all in all, I found this to be a wonderful hotel. I mean, you get free breakfast which is a real plus. Certainly, they don't have to put out free food in the evening...but they do. It's those little added touches that have already made up my mind that this will be the first place I look to book next year when I return to San Diego for Comic-Con 2011.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunnyvale", "Title": "\u201cThe Residence Inn Marriott is like staying with Family\u201d", "Author": "3ofusLoveSanDiego", "ReviewID": "UR70687339", "Content": "The service is always excellent, employees are friendly and strive to meet our needs.

Two bedroom suites 2. We are Marriott reward members 3. Location (according to the website and reviews) 4. Free shuttle service within a 3 mile radius 5. Free hot breakfast 6. Free high speed Internet 7. Heated outdoor pool Arrival: The purpose of our trip was primarily because my husband was attending a conference at the convention center but we decided to bring a long our two children, ages 13 and 3, along with my mother so that we could make a family vacation out of it. The hotel shuttle service picked us up within 30 minutes of us calling them from the airport. We arrived at the hotel (which is only about a 3 minute drive from the airport). The shuttle man put our bags on the bell cart and walked us into the lobby. The front desk person was very friendly and welcoming. Although it is not a fancy four star hotel the outside is very pretty and well kept up as was the somewhat small lobby area. We went up to our room on the third floor at the back of the hotel. The hotel is shaped like a square but with the middle cut out. The courtyard holds the heated pool, a fairly large hot tub, as well as a comfortable sitting area with a gas fire pit table. They also have two gas grills for the guests to use. Room: Back to the room: it was very clean, nicely decorated, and surprisingly spacious. The kitchen had a full size fridge/freezer, stove top, microwave, coffee pot, dishwasher, along with all the utensils. They also give you coffee, tea, flavored creamers, and my kids favorite POPCORN. The living area had a couch and an armchair along with a console and tv. There is also a sliding glass door that opens up to a balcony which is very small. I guess for those guests who smoke. The bedrooms are on opposite sides of the living area. One bedroom is slighty bigger than the next and it has a desk which the other one does not. Each bedroom has a queen size bed which is firm but comfortable. Each bedroom also has a sliding glass closet and drawers to put your clothes in. Each bedroom also has its own bathroom which is simple but clean. The one thing that I was worried about was the reviewers who said the trains run behind the hotel and they are loud. The ear plugs on the nightstand made me think the worst and the Amtrack line is RIGHT behind the hotel and so is the trolly line but maybe it was the fact I was so exhausted but they didn't bother me one bit. The trains stop around 11 and start back up around 7 I think but I couldn't tell you for sure because it was not a problem for any of us and we were right at the back of the hotel. If you were staying in the front or even the interior part of the hotel you probably wouldn't hear them. Our room was cleaned everyday perfectly and even when we forgot to take of the \"later please\" sign, they still cleaned it. On our last full day, we even got a handwritten thank you note along with some Hershey Kisses. Breakfast/Social evenings: Breakfast was good especially for free! We had breakfast burritos one morning and buscuits and gravy another. They also had pancakes, french toast, sausage, cereals, waffles, yogurt and granola, mixed pastries, ect.. During the week they have complimentary social evenings. Wednesdays we hear they have great BBQ. We were sad we missed it. During social evenings they serve different things different nights and the also have Firehouse beer on tap along with wine and fountain sodas. We got to enjoy it one night and we had a great time hanging out in the hot tub drinking beer! Shuttle: The shuttle takes you to San Diego Zoo but it leaves at 10:00 and picks up at 4:00 so make sure you make prior arrangements with them in case there are a lot of people. We found out that picking us up at 4:00 was not going to happen because the ZOO is so big we didn't make it out of there until it closed at 6:30 and we couldn't find a taxi or a shuttle service back to the hotel. We were essentially stranded but we called the hotel and they sent the shuttle for us and we ended up giving the driver a big tip. Why didn't we rent a car? Parking downtown is not only hard to find it is expensive. In fact it is expensive everywhere! My TIP to you is: TIP the shuttle driver. He will be more willing to go out of his way to assist you. Okay here is my only con: It is a LONG walk to the convention center which is right across the street from the Gaslamp quarter and a long walk to Horton Plaza. You could take the shuttle but for my husband it was a hassle getting to his conference. He said he would have rather stayed much closer to the \"main\" part of downtown. Other than that and the rate we got, I can't say anything bad about this hotel.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cOverall was ok\u201d", "Author": "PR_Refugee", "ReviewID": "UR25922014", "Content": "Compared to other Residence, room were very small and I had a Jr Suite (two rooms).

I knew about the train and was prepared to deal with a few passings. I guess seeing the ear plugs on the bedside table set me up to expect the worse. I remember reading that the trains stopped in the night. I didn't think that. I remember hearing trains passing as late as 11pm. My husband, my 5 year old and I rented a studio suite and were for the most part happy with the set up. The color scheme was fresh looking and we had an ocean view opposite of the train tracks. The best part was that we arrived early and called the hotel and they let us check in early. This was even during the labor day weekend. Upon entering the room my husband was really impressed ( i think it was the blue and yellow color scheme). I liked the set up of the kitchenette along with the pull out sofa, desk and chair. There was also a double door that lead to a \"balcony\". I use that word loosely because I would not feel safe standing out there on the iron railing. But having the door open with the ocean breeze blowing in was a long forgotten fairytale. Now the problems....I couldn't get the feeling that I was in a really olddd place with a new paint job out of my mine. I felt as if the room was screaming at me to please like it. I could see chips and cracks and bad patches peeking throught the vibrant blue and yellow paint. The bathroom was sanitary but the walls seemed slightly discolored. The pull out sofa seemed dingy to me and left me wandering who sat there the night before. So much that I really didn't want to sit on it. After pulling it out and putting on fresh clean sheets that thought left my mind. The kitchen and dishes were clean and I would've had no problem using them. Sleeping at night was pretty bad for me. The bed was way too hard for my comfort which is probably why i was so sensitive to the train at 11pm. I asked my husband about it and he said he liked the bed. 'Upon waking,we had breakfast which was pretty hotel standard (and great) and then we walked the boardwalk and really enjoyed our time including the USS Midway. While walking the boardwalk I was contemplating what ifs....what if we stayed at a different hotel downtown? We'd still have the same problem with the trains and the airplanes so it was not the Marriotts fault. The downtown place is a great place to stay for night owls and partyers. There were people hanging out on balconys on other hotels as well that night. I could not bare the thought of spending another night at that location so we checked out and stayed at a different hotel further inland.

We needed to stay at a hotel which accepts pets and was close to Chula Vista - without being in Tijuana. Through the hotel's website, I booked a two bedroom suite (one room for the adults, one for the daughter, and one for the son with dogs in one room). I could've done two rooms next to each other but the teenagers don't want to share a room, much less a bed. After a late arrival - we got started driving late - I was greeted by \"we were overbooked and sold out of two bedroom suites.\" This meant the boys took one room and the girls another, not a totally acceptable choice but on a Friday night in the San Diego area with pets you've either booked ahead or you sleep on the beach.. The rooms are actually quite clean and well appointed, with each having a dining area, full (ish) kitchen, and a queen size bed and pullout couch. Be warned, however! They provide ear plugs for a reason. You cannot get closer to the railroad tracks without getting run over, and it's not just city trains or cross-country trains, it's both. There's only so much you can do to block out every-few-minuts train noise and horns. The next day, we were moved to the suite (not the most convenient activity but better than the arrangement we had). The suite was equally clean with the same decor. There were two queen beds and a pullout in the common room, which was again outfitted with full kitchen. Earplugs had to be retrieved this time from the front desk - facing away from the trains and towards the bay did not help much. The bathrooms were decent sized but the vanity in one room was large enough for two sinks (though it contained only one) and the other vanity was barely wide enough for one person (though the room had more closet space). Showers were effective and shower heads were high enough (I'm 6'1\" and they usually clean my chest but not my head without ducking down). Towels were smallish but still a little soft. The complimentary breakfast buffet was not the usual carbo-only feast, featuring not only the usual doughnut/bagel/bread/ceral choices (add pancakes to the carb side of the equation) but also had sausage patties and eggs. These were, unfortunately, almost inedible. The sausage was peppery, a little greasy, and (odd for ground meat) tough. The eggs were so over cooked it was like eating rubbery rice. I didn't try the coffee (Starbuck's was right around the corner). The toaster was a commercial run-through which is convenient, but was set to a speed that gave only a slight warming once through. There was a couple kinds of yogurt and some fresh fruit (apples, bananas, oranges) as well. I would stay here again, though the prices were a little high, because it's close to SeaWorld and to our dog show, but I'd make it perfectly clear on the phone with them that I have specific reasons for booking the suite, not just because I want a big room, and that if their reservation center is going to overbook I would be very appreciative of them not giving away my room.

The van will take guests anywhere within a few miles, so I signed up a couple of times to get back and forth to the Convention Center.

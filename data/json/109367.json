The hotel is conveniently located right off I-35, which may be a demerit for some travelers but we love it. Every room here is a suite with comfy beds, LCD TVs, and a great view of downtown Dallas if you request the right side of the hotel. The business week staff are the best- courteous and accommodating- from whom the weekend staff should take a few pointers. For example, people who are Marriott Elite members and veteran guests should be greeted and accommodated as such. With that said, however, the weekend staff is not bad (still professional, there's just some room for improvement). On the weekend the concierge lounge is not opened either, so be sure to request a breakfast voucher if you are a Marriott Elite member. Kudos to the room service team, who always serves up some of the best cuisine I've had on the road.

A lot of small inconveniences that took its toll: 1. Cannot make reservations directly with the hotel. The hotel transferred my call first to a young woman who I could not understand. Next transfer was to Marriott business center and not reservations. I had to call the hotel three times to get transferred to reservations. 2. Reserved two double beds in each room. However, upon check in, told they only had a king bed in rooms left. 3. Lamp would not turn on in room. Noticed finally it was unplugged, Telephone would not work. Noticed it had been unplugged as well. 4. Room was very warm upon arrival. Maintenance woman did a good job figuring a/c was not working, and transferred me to another room. 5. Room TVs -- Set on analog and not digital - could not change, and only one remote for each room even though two TVs in each room. 6. No ice in ice machine. Went to bar, got ice, and five cokes. Charged $13.00 for cokes. 7. During check in, after being told there was no double bed rooms left, I was handed an \"Elite\" member card. When I used the wireless Internet, it stated that as an Elite Member there would be no charge $12.95 for each room. On check out I was told that I was not really an Elite Member so I had to pay the $26.00. 8. Check out was Noon. Front desk reluctantly extended to 1:30.

The only reason this hotel should carry the Marriott brand rather than the Fairfield brand is that this hotel has the higher end tile bathroom and stone countertops, rather than the more plain / inexpensive tile floor and plastic surround bath, and formica countertops. My room was generally old, tired and smelly, and lacked the fine details and cleanliness that I had just walked out of at the Hilton Anatole down the block. I think my corner room at the Hilton had more floor space than the suite at the Marriott, which was probably the equivilant of one and a half small rooms. The mattress was older and thin, and the sheets were stiff.

I ended up eating my cold steak with a plastic knife and fork.

I can safetly say that I was not dissapointed at all. Check in: The Check in process at the front desk was extremely quick and the front desk staff was extremely friendly. Rooms: The rooms were all suite type rooms as our room was divided into three sections. The first section was the living room/desk area where there was a couch, a desk, a small coffee table, mini fridge and small bar sink and flat screen tv. Then the room splits off into two double french doors that leads into the master bedroom and the other into the bathroom. Inside the master bedroom was another flatscreen tv, lots of different types of pillows on the bed, table lamps etc... The bathroom was furnished with bed bath and beyond shampoo's, fresh linens and towels, etc.... The room really felt like a small mini apartment and made you not feel like you were in a hotel room. Pool: The hotel did have a pool but we did not have the time to visit it. Hotel Bar/Restaurant: The hotel did have a bar and a restaurant downstairs. The bar is a little pricey as you are buying drinks in a marriott, however, there was plenty of seating at the bar if you wished to sit down at the actual bar to have a drink or if you wished to have a small table near the bar to have your drinks at. As for the restaurant, we did not have lunch or dinner here, however on the day we were departing, we did have the berakfast buffet and all of the foods, fruits, were all fresh and delicious. Also, the chef making fresh omlets was a very nice treat. Parking: The hotel has plenty of free parking that is onsite. No issues here. Service: Everyone from housekeeping to the front desk, to the servers in the restaurant were all extremely nice, courteous, and professional and should all be very proud of how they conduct themselves as a staff. Sundry Shop: There is a small gift shop/sundry shop open 24 hours next to the front desk in case you are looking for a late night snack, emergency medicines etc.... prices are reasonable. Location: The location is right next to the Stemmons Freeway with easy on/off access on I-35E.

From the time you walk in you are greeted and treated well. I was able to get the concierge upgrade to my stay and it was like icing on the cake. The room was delightful with a seating area and a sofa that could fold out to a bed. Had a small kitchenette (however lacking a microwave and stove) but a nice fridge (hidden behind cabinet doors). Two flat screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and a fair selection of channels. The desk area was nice and for me internet was free (due to company contract), however, it can cost up to $12.95 a day. The bed was large and comfortable. The sink was separate from the toilet and tub, which can be beneficial. The exercise area was well laid out with mirrored walls to make it look a lot larger than it is. But the machines were well available as was free ear buds to listen to the TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attached to each machine. The lobby had flavored iced water in a nice pitcher, the bar area was well placed. The dining area was under construction so I could not see that, but they had set up the bar area and a conference room to accommodate the needs of their guests for dining. The concierge perk was very nice, it is open from 0630 to 2200. Had a very nice breakfast spread, a nice evening nosh area and some nice desserts. The staff were friendly and informative. It can be well worth the $30 extra cost for the perk (especially for 2 or more guests in a room, hint family). The courtesy shuttle staff were great and will take you within 5 miles of the hotel at no charge (not on a schedule either). I did not get to use the pool but it looked nice and had a small hot tub.

We heard some sirens around 11 p.m. both nights, but we weren't yet asleep. I'm not sure if they would have woken us up. And you could definitely hear the freeway. The only real downsides for us were the location and the restaurant at breakfast. The location was very convenient to find because it's right on the 35 freeway, but there's nothing at all within walking distance. I should have researched what \"Market Center\" actually was. I thought it was a shopping area, which my sister and I would have enoyed, but it's actually just a convention center type thing. And it's still not within walking distance. But that's probably mostly my fault. I just wish we had stayed somewhere where we could walk to things. About the restaurant for breakfast: We only ate their one morning. The food was quite good. I had the part of the buffet that was only cold items plus oatmeal. The fruit was absolutely excellent. Some of the best I've had in a while. And the oatmeal was delicious. But it was $13. Slightly pricey, but not a huge deal. The problem really was with the service. There was no one there to seat us, so we just decided to seat ourselves.

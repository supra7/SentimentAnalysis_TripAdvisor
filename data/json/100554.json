As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel abuts the highway on one side and sits on top of a hill. Everywhere you walk (other than across the highway to First Hill) is downhill....until you need to walk back up, of course. It wasn't a problem for us, but might be for others. Our room on the 22nd floor was quiet. The elevators were a bit slow at rush hours. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and well designed. There was a plug, a mirror and a light everywhere you needed one, plenty of room to unpack and even a mini fridge with complimentary bottled water. The bathroom, while not particularly large or luxurious, was spotless, and more than met our needs, with plenty of counter space, towels, Aveda products and perhaps most importantly, water pressure. Our only complaint about the room was that the thermostat had a motion-detector which did not detect our presence at night when we were asleep. It wasn't a huge problem in March (so we did not call maintenance), but might be in August. Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful and competent. If I could give a 4 1/2 star rating here, I would. We especially received great service from Fred, the concierge who helped with dinner reservations for a group of 8-12 two nights in a row. Both dinners, at nearby Sip and Tulio's, were great.

No problem with the reservation - everything was as advertised. Arrived around dinnertime on Saturday 10-March - check-in went fine...UNTIL we found out how much they intended on charging for parking - $30/day plus $6 car charge + other taxes. Shocking, and took an ok deal into the \"meh\" category and I have big problems paying $40 to park my car. Chris and Christina were manning the front desk that evening, and couldn't have been more understanding and nice about it. Christina upgraded us to a \"Corner King\" as a gesture for my b-day, and dealt with our parking sticker shock as well in a very natural, kind, customer-oriented manner that turned a potential disaster into a better-than-average experience in less than 10 mins. My wife and I can not say enough about the customer-service attitude about the staff at this hotel - simply phenomenal and Chris/Christina deserve special mention for going \"over and above\". The hotel is a VERY tall building located right on the I-5 - we were facing the freeway on the 11th floor and the roar from the highway was non-stop and very noticeable (they were booked solid that weekend and couldn't get us a higher room, on the east side). Strongly, STRONGLY suggest that you request a high room on the West side of the hotel as soon as you book - the noise from the freeway was pretty bad though continuous so except for the trucks and sirens it turned into white noise after a while. Public spaces are very nice, even luxurious - reminds me of the Four Seasons in NY in terms of style. Pool was closed and didn't use the weight room. Location (except for the freeway) is fine - it's in the \"NoCharge\" zone for public transit and it's a 20-25 min walk to Pike Place Market from the hotel. Steep hill going up Madison - go up Pike to 6th St and turn right and you'll have a much easier time of it if you are physically challenged. Room was ok, nothing spectacular (though spotlessly clean). Coffee maker, king-sized bed in a separate room, two wide-screen TVs, very spacious room. Decor a bit dated but again very clean and just fine for a couple of days, or even more than that.

This hotel is way too overpriced if it wants to be competitive with other Seattle hotels based on what it has to offer.

Also, the walls are very thin which makes the rooms susceptible to much outside noise so I highly recommend asking for a room away from the freeways. I personally would never select this hotel again and pay full-price. If I was forced to stay here because of a great Name-Your-Own-Price deal on Priceline, I would be okay with it, but that would be because I wasn't paying full price. Either the prices overall here need to come down, or management needs to invest in some sound barriers, comfier beds and more luxurious rooms in order to draw people from competing hotels in the area. I was very disappointed that this is where I had to stay for my two-night jaunt up to Seattle. (Also- valet fees are so ridiculous.

In my more than fifteen years of travelling I don't that I've ever actually starting crying in the hotel room because the hotel room was so terrible. Upon arriving on the late morning of Tuesday, March 13, 2012, the valet was most helpful. We found parking quick and easy. (Although the parking garage needs some much brighter lighting; the parking felt a bit unsafe it was so dark down there.) The front desk girl was happy, smiled, and greeted us warmly. She upgraded us from a $130 room to a corner suite with a king bed for $30 more. Oh, and parking is an additional $35. So, total cost: $190. (We booked through Hotwire, but I've started noticing a trend lately: hotels at which you a book a room via Hotwire more often than tend to have a negative, slightly-unwelcome attitude toward you than their other guests. The Renaissance was one of those hotels.) The room on the fifth floor was clean. Cosy. A bit dark. The room was a north-east facing room, overlooking the: I-5 highway. The bed was clean. Everything was nice and fine. This was the afternoon when we checked in. We went out for dinner and returned around 10 PM. The noise from the I-5\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich has got to be at least 9 lanes of traffic across is it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas absolutely DEAFENING! It was so bad that my wife had to turn up the TV and I had to grab a blanket and sleep on the couch in the room furthest away from the bedroom. Lame. The noise was still bad, but after much exhaustion in trying to get comfortable on a couch made for a child, and the noise that never stopped, I finally fell asleep. I actually contemplated sleeping in my car in that dark parking garage to get away from the non-stop sound of traffic. At 3 AM, I awoke and went to the bedroom. Still the noise from the never-ending traffic outside was so overwhelming I had to go back to the couch. So, there I slept, for probably 5 hours and not much more, thanks to the hotel room. Why are there double-paned glass windows on a hotel that faces a freeway? Why did the check-in girl not ask us if we wanted a room facing the freeway? Why did the girl at the front desk upon check-out the next morning not ask us how are stay was? Well, if you and your hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners want to know what we thought of our stay, just read my story above. Oh, and I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Ever.

I was a little worried after some of the reviews I'd read. Lots of people complained about the workout facilities; we don't go on vacation to work out so we never went anywhere near that so I cna't comment on that. As far as the actual room goes, we requested a room on the west side away from the hotel and as high up as they could get us, and were given a room facing west on the 20th floor. It had a great view of the modern library, many of the tall downtown building and water (I don't think it's the sound, just an inlet or lake or something). We didn't hear any traffic noise up there; what we did hear (and this is something you'd hear anywhere that high up I think) is the wind on one particularly windy day. It still wasn't enough to wake us up or anything. The room was very clean and all of the staff: the front desk clerks, the bartenders, the doormen, the lovely concierges - were fantastic! The bed was very comfortable as well. I think the location was great too. It's about a 15 minute walk down to Pike market and the front desk clerk advised us to walk over to Pike on 5th so that we didn't have to deal with going up or down the massive hill that runs right by the hotel (it's not nearly as severe going down Pike). We didn't have a car, just walked everywhere and nothing seemed to terribly far away. If you do want to take a cab to Pike's Market (we were running late for a tour and had to get there quickly), the doorman will hail one for you and it's only about $6 for the trip down there.

The hotel has been renovated beautifully, the lobby is gorgeous, even the rooms have been renovated nicely..but there's one thing I wouldn't have thought of prior to staying here, and that I've never ever experienced in a hotel in Seattle before.

There were a few pleasant surprises (namely the ability to print airline boarding passes in the lobby and great sweet potato fries at the bistro), and the location is convenient, but overall the visit was disappointing. This current Priceline description has several inaccuracies: The 28-story Renaissance has 553 spacious rooms, with the upper-floor rooms boasting views of Elliott Bay, the Space Needle, Cascade or Olympic Mountains. Rooms come with mini-fridges, coffee/tea makers, Wi-Fi (for a fee in room, free in lobby), windows that open and flat-panel TVs with premium cable. You'll love flopping onto this bed after a day of Seattle sightseeing. It has a pillowtop mattress, down comforter and cotton-rich linens with triple sheeting. No belly-flopping in the pool: Take a refreshing swim around the splash pool and a soak in the hot tub on the 28th floor, with views of the bay. You also get expansive views of Elliott Bay, the Space Needle, and the surrounding city from the 28th-floor restaurant and bar. The hotel also has parking (for a fee), a fitness center, second restaurant and lobby coffee bar and lounge. Sounds good. And the windows DO open a bit, the bed is comfortable, and the night views are pretty. Unfortunately, there is no splash pool/hot tub (despite signs in the hotel elevators that also point you to the 28th floor pool). According to the front desk folks, they're being turned into more meeting rooms. That would have been nice to know BEFORE arriving. Also, the water in our bathtub reached warm, but not hot, even when I turned it to max hot. As I didn't have hours to spend with a hotel engineer, I used the coffee maker's hot water to heat up the bath. Servicable, but hardly \"luxurious.\" Also, from 3 to 6 am, our room on the 21st floor made loud creaking noises that actually woke (and kept) me up. (Apparently, according to the woman at the front desk, the hotel is built on rollers, so whenever it's windy out ... it moves and creaks). And then there's that flat screen TV. The picture was poor and the \"Daily Special\" movies listed for $4.99 were actually $13.99 when I you get to the purchase screeen. I called downstairs and they said: \"That's a separate company and they did have that daily deal, but I guess it's over ... but we can't get them to change the menu. So the price is $13.99.) One thing goes wrong, OK. Two, not great, but livable. No pool, no hot water, interrupted sleep, and bait-and-switch movie prices?

This huge store is a great place to get almost anything you need (snacks, toys, toiletries, organic milk!). And yes, it is a steep hill down to the water, so watch out when it's raining because it can get slippery! Pike Market is 15-20 minute walk away, all down hill. The Sheraton is about 10-15 minutes away to Market, so just a tad closer. When you're coming back to the hotel from the Market, definitely go up Pike Street to avoid the steep incline, it's more gradual (turn right on 6th avenue to hit the hotel). It's a pleasant walk through City Center with all its shops and restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, HMV, Ross, etc). Definitely on the outskirts of downtown, it'll be a walk to hit the popular areas. If you want to be right in the middle of the action as soon as you leave the front door, stay at the Sheraton. We didn't mind the location. Parking As with all other hotels in Seattle, you pay for it. Self park is in a secure garage (in and out privileges with your room key- all automated) is $30 plus tax ($36 total). One night we overheard that self parking was full and only valet was available. The garage seemed secure enough. Plus, there's one elevator (kind of small) that takes you straight up to the lobby. Check In Smooth, accepted my request for a room away from the highway as per other posts suggestions. Room Located on the 15th floor, views of the apartment building across from us. Good people watching. They had their blinds open, so we could see them making dinner, watching tv, etc. Nice apartments! Good size, comparable with Westin and Sheraton. Very nice decor, modern dark woods. Flat screen TV. We requested 2 doubles. Bathroom was standard sized, very clean. We liked the Aveda products. Unfortunately no free Wi-Fi. Beds were fine, no major complaints. Lobby Live band Friday night in the lounge area. Packed with people. Concierge was nice, let us borrow an umbrella. Overall Good hotel.

Its not horrible...but the Sheraton and others are closer. I got this hotel via Priceline...and I felt that the Priceline price was more acceptable given the rundown condition of the hotel. The Renaissance lacks a dedicated lobby entrance (i.e. place to pick up taxis, etc.) and I felt every time I went outside for a taxi was an adventure in and of itself. Be prepared to be hit up by \"private\" limos instead of the usual taxis. I made this mistake...once. You will not get a good deal with the private car.

My displeasure has much more to do with the food and amenities which just aren't up to Renaissance standards. The rooms themselves are very nice -- lots of easily accessible outlets, remodeled and clean bathrooms, linens etc. Complaint 1: the breakfast in either the restaruant or the consierge lounge is really meager. Today the buffet included: scrambled eggs, waffle quarters, bacon/sausage, oatmeal and potatoes, yogurt, pineapple, cantaloupe, grapes, strawberries, sandwich bread for toasting and some pastries. Cheerios or cornflakes. That's it. Seattle is a rather international city. Where is the salmon? Where is the European style cold cuts? Is it not possible to find higher quality bread? (The concierge lounge was worse. The only protein there were hard boiled eggs). I know this sounds like I'm spoiled, but I've stayed at a significant number of Renaissance hotels in the past year: Milan, Zurich, Las Vegas, Bankok, etc. and I found all of their breakfast buffets to be mouth watering. This one reminded me of a tired dining hall. Complaint 2: Amenities in the form of exercise room is the other thing lacking. Actually it isn't lacking so much as it has not kept pace with demand. At 5:20 the other morning every single machine was taken! At 6:30 this morning, -- same thing. There are a total of 7 machines (5 treadmills) one elliptical and a bike or stair stepper. Basically the place was bursting at the seams and the poor AC could not keep up. So it was like exercising in a sauna. I have to give them credit for having really nice machines though -- built in TV in each one. On the good side though ,this hotel has a 2 lane lap pool on the 28th floor!

For the money I paid, I could not have been more pleased!! However, if I had paid the full price of $150+, I would not have been so happy. The lobby was trendy and relaxing. The staff very friendly and helpful. But when I stepped on the elevator, I became concerned of what I had gotten myself into. The elevators are old and remind me of what you see in a horror movie before the hotel becomes haunted :-) Aside from the lobby, the entire hotel has an old, musty smell. The carpet is frayed along the seems, and the paint needs to be scraped and re-done. The hardware (door handles, hinges, etc) need replacing, as do the windows and window hardware. There was a weird ledge underneath all the windows in my room that just looked tacky. The TV in the bedroom sat on the ledge rather than having a TV stand/armoire...again, tacky. The TVs were LCD flat panels, but had poor quality pictures due to the awful signal they were receiving. It was a shame to have nice TVs but have such poor picture quality. The windows cracked open about 4 inches which let in some nice fresh afternoon air, but had to be closed at night due to the expected downtown noise. Upon check in I requested a room with a nice view of the sound. The man at the front desk upgraded me to a King Corner Suite! I was surprised considering I had booked my room through priceline. I certainly can't complain about my room, especially since I only paid $88 a night AND got a free suite upgrade. However, if I had paid full price, I would be quite disappointed in the quality of the room. The TV in the sitting area was not straight and looked as if it was going to fall off the wall. The cables from the TV hung down the wall in a haphazard way. The sofa in the sitting area was not meant to be sat on! It was old, uncomfortable, and just ackward. The suite had a small refrigerator with complimentary bottles of water. It also had a coffe maker with (awful) coffee and a wonderful tea assortment. There was a safe and iron/ironing board. I found it odd that in a king suite they only provided one bath robe, but I'm sure if I had requested another they would have provided it. The bathroom was the most up to date part of the room. It was obvious the majority of their recent renovation budget was focused on the bathrooms. I found it odd that the door was on a sliding track, similar to a pocket door. It provided little privacy from the rest of the room. The tub was small and would have been nice to have a seperate tub and shower instead of a combination. I loved the mirror and lighting in the bathroom!! And the Aveda toiletries were a nice compliment as well. The bed was comfortable, not great, not horrible. The bedroom had a view of the Space Needle, Lake Union, Puget Sound, Qwest and Safeco fields, and in the far distance UW (if you know what you're looking for). :-) Overall, it was a good hotel for the price I paid. The location wasn't great for downtown tourist attractions, but it wasn't horrible either. Don't plan on walking back to the hotel alone after dark, however. There were many questionable people on the streets after dark. It felt a bit out of the tourist area, but still within a 15 minute walk to Pike Place, Benaroya Hall, Game Works, the movie theater, and shopping. There is also a free bus route that runs through downtown. It picks up every half hour right across the street from the hotel!

They are made of white glass that you can partially see through (silhouettes). For most people this might not be a problem, but for families or friends sharing a room , it might. Also when someone goes to the bathroom at night ,it lights up the whole room. Plus they are sliding doors. The second complaint is the cost of parking. $30. a day plus $6 & change tax on the parking. This reminds me of the luggage fees that airlines charge. I prefer just to have the full price upfront, please. This hotel is in a good location for walking around the city. But I do recommend going down 6th to Pike to get where you want to go, as it is a lot less steep. Also recommend the Mod Pizza place on 6th for an inexpensive meal.

Let's see...where to begin? The price. Because we are cheap, we booked through Priceline's NYOP and it was the Renaissance that accepted our bid @ $125/night + taxes and fees. Because this was a July weekend, this was about the best deal we could get for a 4* hotel (which, by the way, I would classify this as NOT). The location. The hotel is on Madison between 5th and 6th. This is not a part of the city where I would prefer to be because there is not a lot going on in the immediate vicinity. I have stayed in other hotels in Seattle that are not just more central but also closer to a variety of restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. That said, most of the major attractions are still within walking distance, but be aware that the hotel is on a steep hill, and climbing that hill could conceivably get annoying and tiring pretty quickly. The room. The room we were given was one on the 16th floor that faced the I-5. It was looking a bit tired, but was of an adequate size. While the bed was not the most comfortable bed I have slept in, it was perfectly fine. Some reviewers have complained about the freeway noise, but this did not bother us at all. It was hardly noticeable to us as soon as we closed the window. The bathroom. The bathroom was of a good size, and it was clean. The water pressure in the shower was good, and the water was hot. The toiletries provided were also of a good quality (Aveda). The service. I can't really say much about this because the lady who checked us in barely said more than a few words to us. She just asked for a piece of ID and a credit card, gave us the keys to our room, and asked if we needed a map. She was neither rude nor friendly. She was just very...robot-like. Etcetera. 1. Self-parking is approx $30/day + taxes of almost $7, which is pretty ridiculous. I did see a parking garage on 5th and Madison that charges $24/day, but I am not sure if it is even accessible 24 hrs/day. 2. In-room wifi is available for a charge, but there is free wi-fi in the lobby. 3. I would have liked to have had a drink in the lounge on the 28th floor, but it was closed on a Sunday, which was quite disappointing to say the least. Would I stay here again? Not if I can help it. I say this primarily because of where it is situated, and because I feel that there are better options in Seattle. I would not go and purposely book the Renaissance, and if I ever bid on Priceline again, I would probably cross my fingers and hope to god that a hotel other than this accepts my bid.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cGood location, except on the highway side!\u201d", "Author": "captJose82", "ReviewID": "UR116317706", "Content": "I stayed here with my wife for 5 nights.

Booked a double room with 2 beds. On arrival we were told all the two bed - rooms were sold out (due to a anime convention in Seattle I would guess) so they offered to upgrade us to a junior suite (Corner King Guest Room) with a king bed and we had no problem with that. Us girls don't mind sharing a big bed. The room was spacious, cozy and clean - no complaints there. Room was on 11th floor. Some traffic noise yes, but we slept like babies because we were tired from all the shopping and walking around. Loved the bed! The breakfast buffet was good. Ok selection of warm and cold breakfast foods. On second morning (Sun) there was an omelette bar, but we didn't try it. If you go to breakfast around 10am you might have to wait for a table for a bit. We got a table right away on both mornings there, but on the second morning we got the last available table, so the people who came after us, had to wait for one, but it didn't take long. The service at the Renaissance was brilliant. The maid slipped a card under the door on our first morning when we had the \"little privacy please\" sign on the door, asking us to inform her when we would like to have our room serviced. We saw her when we left for breakfast and asked her when she might have time to do our room. She offered to do it right away, while we were out having breakfast, even though she was in the middle of cleaning the room next door. The person who gets top marks from us is Richard, who greeted us at the front desk when checking in and out. We absolutely adored him. He was always so friendly and helpful towards us - he e.g. helped us change our bus reservation to an earlier departure time on Sunday morning, when we were leaving back to Vancouver. Such a lovely guy!! The location of the hotel was ok in our mind. You had to walk a bit though to get to Pike Place Market for example, but if you don't mind walking it's a good location (about 5 blocks from Pike St.). BUT note that the hotel is located on a massive(!!) hill so if you're in a crappy shape (like I am ;D) you will have a hard time climbing that loooong steep hill back to the hotel after a days shopping and walking around downtown. Just bear that in mind :D But all in all we had a really lovely stay and we would definitely go back to Renaissance hotel.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fremont, California", "Title": "\u201cGood quality budge Hotel without the Frills\u201d", "Author": "lionmaster", "ReviewID": "UR108106392", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel during our family vacation to Seattle/Vancouver area for 2 nights.

We ate out at the upstairs restaurant for dinner the second night, the food was not so bad but could've been much better. The service was supar and there was nobody to greet us for few minutes. I would expect better service for this type quality hotel or restaurant. I can see why the place looked empty. If you are here for a family trip, this place is somewhat close to the shopping and restaurants area nearby. However, it is not the most convenient place to stay due to the uphill climb if you are out of shape. My kids were complaining due to the walking and the shops/restaurants is a good 10 minutes away which is not so bad. I would stay at the Red Lion hotel which was our second leg of the trip, a much better location, when you step out of Red Lion, you will be with the crowd and all the coffee shops and stores and the mall too.

Once or twice per month I take my teenage daughter for shopping and mother-daughter quality time together. This time, I booked our hotel through Hotwire for $88 (including fees and taxes $108). It was described as 4 star hotel close to Pike Place and shopping. It was not as close to Pike Place as stated on the website but about 10-15 mins walking distance. I believe everything in Seattle downtown is walking distance. Luckily, we do not mind walking. Conveniently located on Madison st and 6th Ave, and right off of the freeway so we should not navigate through the downtown traffic. We stayed at this hotel one Saturday night. The check-in was fast and receptionist was very friendly. The lobby was spacious, modern and nicely decorated. We got a room on the 16th floor with freeway and city view. The room was spacious, as well, with two comfortable double beds, nice modern decorations and was very clean. Amenities included mini-fridge, flat screen TV, desk with Internet connection for a daily rate of $13 and complimentary coffee-tea station. I tried both caf and decaf coffee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very good roasted coffee. I really liked the idea of one-time use coffee holders. It was very neat. With 5 or 6 types of different sweeteners, I was a little bit disappointed to not find just regular brown sugar. Good coffee deserves something better than sweetener. The restroom was also modern and clean. Shampoo/soap/conditioner were of decent quality. The only thing lacking were the shower caps. I am in love with swimming, so immediately I went to check on their swimming pool. The pool, whirlpool and fitness center are located on 28th floor. The fitness center has cardiovascular equipment, weights, and treadmills, and was mostly deserted. The pool to my disappointment was not deep enough. Max depth was 48\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or so. One can walk but not swim. The whirlpool was full, so I did not try either of them. We didn't try any of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lounges or restaurants, so I cannot quote on their bar or restaurants. I found only 2 downsides of this hotel: 1. Parking. $30 for self-parking (with taxes $36) per night. Parking is narrow and has limited spaces, I found one empty spot almost at the very end. Parking in Seattle on the weekends is free starting Saturday after 6pm. I saw a couple of free parking spots right under my window. So it really is possible to find free parking close to this hotel (if you are staying on the weekend, of course). 2. Thin walls. We had a very noisy couple and I was embarrassed to hear it in front of my daughter. In general we enjoyed our short stay in this hotel and definitely will stay again.

Our was very comfortable and nicely decorated. The bed was ultra comfortable. Both feather and foam pillows were available. Lighting in the room was very good with lamps on both sides of the bed, on the desk, and a floor lamp. There are adjustable LED reading lamps on the bed which would be great if you were traveling with someone who wanted to sleep as you read. The work desk was large and the office-style chair functional and comfortable. My The room had a sofa and a comfortable arm chair. Since my last stay, new LCD flat screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have been added. The TV was had a lot of cable channels as well as a wide selection of pay-per-view movies. I looked at some previews and costs per movie seemed to be between $12 and $15. The bathroom was also recently refurbished.. Lighting was good, the towels were plentiful, and the shower worked well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c immediate hot water with plenty of pressure. Bath amenities include shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and mouthwash. The concierge lounge located on one of the top fllors Like guest rooms it has been recently refurbished. The hotel public areas were clean and well-kept, but could use an updating to the style of the rooms. The hotel has a large indoor swimming pool and hydrotherapy spa. Sliding doors open onto a patio with additional lounge chairs. Next to, and with windows looking onto the pool, is a very complete exercise room. All of the exercise equipment seemed nearly new. There is also a sauna and steam room accessible from the pool area. This property is located on a steep hill but the trick is to walk towards Pine street where the incline is gradual. If you take this route, then walking to the Waterfront and/or Pike's Public Market is not too bad. If you need to visit the local government offices and Federal courthouse, then this location is plus. It is also near the public library and is near the older Pioneer Square businesses and allows you visit another neighborhood of Seattle different from either the Public Market and/or Belltown. There is University of Washington store nearby too. Seattle is increasing becoming more visited due to all of Alaskan Cruise lines which prior to 9/11 disembarked from Vancouver, B.C. So sometimes property rates can be really high in this city.

We requested a room on a higher floor away from the highway but was only able to secure a room on the 22nd floor on the highway side. Luckily, we didn't notice the highway traffic at all while sleeping. However, we did find the air conditioner/heater to be quite noisy as it would turn on and off periodically throughout the night. The $30 non valet parking does give you in and out privileges, but the parkade beneath the hotel is difficult to navigate. Upon returning to the hotel at 1030 or 11pm, we drove all the way to the bottom of the parkade but could not find an empty spot - even in the restricted area reserved for valet parking! Luckily, on our way out of the parkade, we found one empty stall at the parkade entrance that was previously filled. We weren't upset, but we did find it odd that such a huge hotel had such limited parking available for guests. When we mentioned our parking incident at check-out the next morning, the concierge explained that there had been a wedding at the hotel the previous night and that, had we not been able to find a parking spot, we could have driven the car back up to the hotel entrance and the valet could have secured a spot for us on the street. He also mentioned that parking is free in downtown Seattle on Saturdays after 6pm and all day Sunday, so we actually could have found street parking ourselves for our one night stay!

Check-in...The staff member was nice and professional. We asked for a high floor on the cityside of the building and were given both request. Hotel Room...We were in a two room suite, small living room area and a small bedroom but perfect for what we wanted. The room have multiple views from the window and there was limited street noise in our room. The room was clean and stocked well with linens, towels and hotel information. There were two tvs, one in the living room, guessing about a 37 inch and one in the bedroom again guessing 32 inch. The tvs were LG brand and both were a little fuzzy. The bed was semi-comfortable and the sheets were a little rough as were the towels. The bedroom had a nice window seat. The bathroom was on the smaller side but worked well, the lighted mirror is a nice touch. The bathroom door is a joke, guessing that due to the small size of the bathroom having a door open into the bathroom wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work well and having one open into the narrow hallway also wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work well. The bathroom was also missing a proper towel rack. The closet space in the hallway was good and there was a safe in the closet. There was also a small fridge and shelf area next to the closet. Hotel...The hotel was nice, clean and the elevators were very fast. The bar and lobby area were nice. The gift shop was well stocked and had moderate prices. The parking garage under the hotel is a little tight and many of the parking spaces are also a bit tight. Hotel Staff...All staff members were great, we ordered delivery twice and asked the concierge for delivery advice and they were so helpful and even provided menus to different restaurants that deliver. The housekeeping staff were friendly and did a very good job cleaning the rooms, kudos to them. A coupleof issues...Two of the chanels on the TV were not working, we asked to be comped TV internet in return and the helpful employee did so, but the internet tv is not even worth the hassel when it is free.

The food was cold at times and they ran out of things like mashed potatoes quickly and you had to wait for them to refill the items. The selection was also not great. I also think having this buffet in the actual space of the R-view Restaurant on the 28th Floor would have been better instead of the 2nd Floor Maxwells location.

The location of the hotel is ok, but do be aware that you will need to do a little walking to get to a plethora of restaurants. Within 6 blocks or so, one can be in the midst of shops, restaurants, etc. The hotel itself is ok but I'm not sure I would call it a 4 star hotel but perhaps more of a 3.5 star. As a meeting planner, my reviews are based on more than the hotel room itself and take the meeting space and hotel amenities into consideration. At check-in, I was placed on the Club Level - 26th floor. My room was spacious with a king bed and two chairs. The view from my room included city sights as well as the freeway and in the distance on a clear day, one can see the snow capped mountains. Amenities: The hotel offers a decent sized fitness center on the 28th floor along with an indoor pool and hot tub. The hotel also offers a Business Center on the lower level of the hotel, however, it is costly to use ($1.20 per page printed black ink only) and while I was there, the equipment consistently was out of order. Meeting Space: I was not impressed by the meeting space. I felt it was older and needed renovations and is far too spread out over 5 floors. The first three levels on which the meeting space is located are connected by escalators but the additional 2 floors require use of the stairs or elevator. The rooms themselves are standard rooms though some have windows with a view. Food: The hotel offers one restaurant, one restaurant/bar, one coffee shop/bar and in-room dining. Food prices are consistent with most other hotels. Catering for events was perfectly fine and I was happy the hotel was willing to meet the diverse dietary needs of my group (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-intolerant, etc.). Room service was prompt and hot (unlike many hotels I have visited). Overall, I would recommend this hotel to others though I am not sure I would host an event here again due to the layout of the meeting space. My main complaint about the hotel is the elevators. While I understand that my meeting included over 600 attendees, I was on the 26th floor and consistently had to wait for quite a while for an elevator to get to various floors. Though this hotel has 5 elevators, an addition of two more elevators would be ideal as they move fairly slowly and seem to not respond as quickly as in other properties in which I have stayed.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cgood enough\u201d", "Author": "melhojo", "ReviewID": "UR87178962", "Content": "Overall, this hotel was pretty good.

She brought me bottled water every day for tea and coffee and made sure I had enough toiletries and towels every day (yay Aveda!). I think I became spoiled...:) The location was in the middle of downtown Seattle, overlooking an interstate highway. However, one can walk over the highway via an overpass and it is not loud at all. I enjoyed this hotel's location very much; it was just a few blocks from Frye Art Museum, the Underground Tour, Smith Tower, and the Columbia Tower SkyView. The concierge directed me to these attractions and they did not disappoint. Just beware that the hotel is located on a hill. It may be challenging at the end of a long sightseeing day to climb back up. Seattle is very walkable. I took the downtown free ride zone buses (Bus 12); one of their last stops is at front of the hotel. After walking to Pine St. and 5 or 6 Ave., it is possible to take a monorail at Westlake Center to Seattle Center (Space Needle, Experience Music Project). I also recommend the SkyView Observatory at Columbia Tower instead of the Space Needle. It is only $5 ($3 for students with ID) as compared to like $18 at the Needle.

The door men, concierge, even the bartenders were knowledgeable and helpful with any and every question I had regarding Seattle. In particular, the concierge, Jean-Paul, provided excellent advice regarding fine dining. I needed to entertain several business associates, and Jean-Paul directed me to an excellent restaurant and secured a table for us without a reservation. Fantastic service. My business associates were very pleased. I can't recall a single instance in which a staff member was not eager and ready to assist me. A job well done to the Renaissance Seattle. Also, the food was excellent. I did not dine at the Visions lounge which is the restaurant/bar on the top floor, but I spent quite a bit of time at the lobby bar. Lunch starts at noon, and it's fantastic. The quality of the food is excellent and worth the premium one usually pays for dining at the hotel. After a disappointing lunch at the Cheesecake Factory, I had a splendid meal at the lobby bar. My compliments to the chef. I stayed in a standard room without any complaint. The accommodation was roomy with a soft bed and an ample selection of pillows to choose from (soft to extra firm). Unlike other premium hotels I have stayed at, the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign actually worked. On the days I decided to sleep in, I did not receive any hostile calls from housekeeping asking me if I wanted my room cleaned. If I slept in, I wasn't disturbed. And when I returned in the evening, I came back to clean towels and a freshly made bed. Fantastic! The service and quality was excellent and well worth the daily room rate.

Aside from that, they were one of the nicer hotels I've stayed at in Seattle. I'm a government employee, and when we travel we almost always get the least desirable rooms as we pay the gov't rate. Mine was in the back of the building, close to both the elevator and the ice machine, overlooking the freeway and the city street, yet it was very quiet and very comfortable.

The gentleman on the phone was friendly and polite. My food arrived in 15 minutes, exactly when I was told it would, and was prepared to order. The fitness center was clean but small. There was a decent selection of free weights and enough treadmills for everyone who wanted to use them. My only complaint was that there were only two ellipitical machines and both were in use for over half an hour. The waterfront is only about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel, but be forewarned that the walk entails some pretty steep hills.

The renovations appear to be done, for anyone who is wondering. Our first room was a king bed, corner suite located on the 10th floor and it faced the incredibly busy I-5 interchange. We asked to be switched to another room the next evening - the roar of the highway was just too much - and thankfully they accommodated this request. Our second room was a standard king that faced the city and was on the 16th floor. MUCH QUIETER. If you are a light sleeper, ask for a room away from the interstate. The hotel was very large, businesslike, and bustling at all hours so if you're looking for a romantic, cozy feel, this might not be the one for you. As far as location is concerned, the other reviewers are correct when they say that this hotel is located on one of the steepest hills in Seattle. Ladies, do not try to wear heels on Madison Avenue or you will bust your booty! Just be a bit strategic and cut up or down a street as there are others that are not as steep (or take a cab). Overall the hotel was located close enough to the sites that we wanted to see that we walked most days/nights. We did use the monorail at one point to get from the Space Needle area closer to our hotel's location and that worked great. Cabs were readily available outside of the hotel (lined up on 6th Ave). The rooms themselves are everything you would expect from a high-end Marriott. Granite countertops, lush linens, fine bath products... My only gripe is that the bathroom doors (in both rooms) are sliders and they did not close all the way; there was a 1\" gap between the door jamb and the slider! Nor was there a fan in the ceiling or a lock on the door! So if you are on a business trip and must share a room, you may want to seriously consider another hotel. Or if you are on a \"new hot date getaway\" this is a possible deal-breaker. The bar upstairs (Visions Lounge) was fine for drinks and had spectacular views. Drinks were fairly priced. It was very hot in there when the sun was going down so perhaps they are having AC issues. The cafe downstairs served Starbucks and had a pretty decent selection of muffins, pastries, and fruit. A fully-stocked drugstore is located two blocks down on 4th and Madison.

You really should see it for yourself and the only thing I regret about my stay is that I didn't take any pictures of the place to post here. The room renovations are up to date, trendy and stylish. I often travel for business and I don't usually sleep well in a hotel the first night but had no problems here. Television is now flat-screen - no fridge in the room but with turndown service nightly we got a fresh bucket of ice. Admittedly, the room size is a bit smaller than most, but they were still comfortable and roomy enough to hang out in for a couple of hours during the day. Someone in an earlier review mentioned not having a fan for the bathroom and there isn't a seperate fan (which I was worried about) but the four days I was there I never found it to be a problem. Infact, this bathroom often cleared out faster than some others in hotels that do have separate fans. Unlike some other Marriott properties, this one does have wireless in the rooms. If you have two laptops with wireless you either need to pay twice for the internet access OR someone will need to write down the access code and you'll have to take turns. I called the front desk on this and tried to get them to understand when you've got two people traveling, and two people with two seperate laptops that need to use their own laptop for business purposes paying twice for the service seems stupid, but I didn't win that battle.

The one downside is that it is a bit further away from the rest of the \"toursity\" area of Seattle, but it's not like it's an unreasonable walk either.

Everytime we left the room, we could breath and did not itch. Return to the room and it began again. Carpet is a multi dark color which did a lot to hide the years of goodness knows what. We did not dare walk barefoot. Carpet was also tore up in every doorway and tiles were loose in the bathroom. Usually when a hotel remodels it starts with the most expensive room, so remodels are a long way off. Beds were beds, nothing special. Bathroom the size of a closet, forget closing the door, it was not possible. For those that need to know, friends of ours requested a handicap room because one of them is in a wheelchair. There is no handicap room! It is a regular room with a couple of shower bars as a minumum legal requirement. NOT ONE SERVICE PERSONAL other than check in and the bar of course, spoke complete and coherent English.

You actually have to enter doorways to stairs and go up a flight to reach an elevator in some places. ANYONE can be in these stairways and believe me in this part of town, anyone is. BE CAREFUL!

Had I known this, I would have requested a room on the other side of the hotel -- but better staff would have automatically tried to be accommodating, where possible.

Maybe I'm a progressive thinker, but I would have thought that knowing how to drive a car would be a basic prerequisite for being a valet attendant. After parking the car myself, we found the lobby to be PACKED with people and the lineup for the front desk literally had dozens of people in it. It was obvious that it would take close to an hour to even reach the check-in desk. I have Marriott Elite status as a frequent Marriott guest, so after trying to get the concierge's attention for several minutes, I was finally able to ask him if they have a dedicated Elite check-in line as they do at many properties, to which he replied, \"no, we got rid of that.\" Frustrated, we left and went to the W instead, where we had a great stay.

Here is my take on the hotel and room: Room - I called the hotel a week before my stay to request a king bed and a quiet room based on the feedback I got from other folks on Tripadvisor. When I got to the hotel, I asked them again for the same requirements. I was given a king bed and a room not directly facing the freeway but still within viewing distance. In addition, the room was on the 6th floor so you can still hear the freeway noise. I requested for another room, but they could only give me one floor higher but still within viewing distance of the freeway. So, it didn't make sense to move. At this point, I was very upset since I've made my request ahead of time. However, I must admit the room was quite big for the price we paid and the bed was pretty comfortable. Wake up call w/beverage - I thought this was a great service the hotel offered. I got the hot cocoa and it was delicious. This sort of made up for my disappointment of the room. Parking - Parking in the hotel is expensive ($21/day). You can go to other garages for a bit less but you would need to move your car early in the morning. Also, you can park in the street at certain times for free but not the full 24 hours. So, I suggest not renting a car. However, we did find parking up the street past the freeway on 8th avenue which was free for the whole day, but availability is very limited. Late night cravings - the hotel is a bit of a walk from the main shopping/restaurant area...so not much choices nearby. However, we did find a pub that opened late and cheap too which was on 4th avenue... i can't remember the name. The pub was recommended by the concierge...so definitely take advantage of that service...they are very helpful. Hotel Staff - I have to say I was impressed with the hotel staff...bellstand, concierge, maid service...they were very helpful. One day during our vacation, it was raining and we didn't have an umbrella. I called housekeeping to request one and they made sure I got one. So, initially I was going to give a rating of 2 due to the problems I encountered with requesting a quiet room. But based on the customer service I received from the hotel staff...I changed it to 3. However, if you are paying full price...there are other alternatives you want to consider which are closer to the public market.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Renaissance Seattle Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d100554-Reviews-Renaissance_Seattle_Hotel-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$195 - $284*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">515 Madison Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98104</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "100554", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/02/48/02482dc765309d951a1d9d986d993c474large.jpg"}}

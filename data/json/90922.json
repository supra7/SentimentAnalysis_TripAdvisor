We were traveling with children and they gave us a early check in AND our car stayed there the day we checked out (St. Patrick's Day of all days). Staff answered every question with a smile and were very friendly and helpful. Parking was FREE, and this was huge for us. The shuttle was fabulous. It always left on time and we had front door service to all museums, etc. We were dropped 30 feet from the Chicago River ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY to watch them dye the river. What service!! The two drivers we had were so friendly and pleasant. The only time we had a problem with the shuttle was when a staff (I think actually the owner or manager) gave the wrong pick up point to our driver. Every other day, all we had to do was call and they picked us up. Room was super clean and neighborhood was really cool. I was with my husband and two young children and we thought it was great. I would have liked it better if the rooms in the main hotel had heat/cool control. It was unusually warm for March and with the window open, the traffic was too loud. I also think adding a fridge and microwave would really make me want to stay again.

The Good: The hotel is right infront of Michigan lake and offers a very good view. The location is ideal for travelers as it offers free parking and easy to locate. They also have free shuttle to downtown at scheduled intervals and so connectivity is to downtown is good. The train station is also 5 blocks away and you can easily walk to 43rd street station from the hotel. The rooms were clean and spacious. The lounge is not very attractive but overall facilities are good at the price they offer. The internet connectivity was good in rooms and it was free so I enjoyed it. The Bad: Far away from downtown and you are dependent on their shuttle to travel to the downtown. The breakfast had limited menu and I wish they had better varieties.

My expectations were lowered, but somehow this hotel was able to set a new low in my hotel experiences. Without going into long detail which would make this review go on for pages, a summary: * The hotel room we booked wasn't available. They moved me to another room (two beds instead of one) and instead of apologizing - I really didn't mind, but at least an acknowledgement would have been appreciated - they noted that \"at least with this room I'd have wifi\". Wait? So I'm supposed to thank you for not getting the room I ordered which then allows me to have an amenity your site claims (or at least misleadingly implies when it says \"Free wireless internet\") is available throughout your hotel? * On the second night I found a bug under my pillow the size of my thumb. It wriggled away pretty quickly after I saw it and I couldn't find it again. I was too tired and already undressed from being soaked in rain on the way home, so didn't ask for a room change (another reason to thank them for two beds?). * The morning after I found the crawler I woke with six small itchy bites over my body. I assume this was from different bugs since the crawler didn't look like the sort of bug that bit people - it just looked creepy. Sure, these bites may have come from somewhere else, but it's hard for me to believe they came from anywhere else than from that room. * I had troubles raising a taxi to come back to the hotel. While I understand that a hotel doesn't have any responsibilities in this realm, in other times I've called my hotel and they've helped me out with problems like this (or at least been sympathetic). I called these guys and got the response \"yeah, we can't help you with that\" and offered me the taxi phone number I'd been trying. If this were the only problem, I'd have brushed it off (Ramada isn't known to me for their customer service, so this was well within what I expected from them). While not really a problem, the hotel just looked old and sad inside. The hallways with their sagging ceiling and tired lights just felt way past need of a remodel or update. Frankly, I don't care about this if the rest was decent which, well, see above.

With that said, I must be honest and speak about the noise that I encountered. During the first night I noticed a lot of traffic noise coming from Lake Shore Dr. (my hotel room was on the pool side about three \"rows\" back). I could tolerate the traffic noise again if I had to, but at times, it could get loud. On the second night, there seemed to be a group of young adults staying within the same \"area\" (six rooms, one outside door) as I and they were up all night in and out of each other's rooms and out of the hotel. All of the doors going to the hall and the outside were very loud. If you didn't hold the door back, they would slam shut....this is what I heard all night until about 3am. I chose not to call the front desk. I felt that the young adults might have retaliated if they knew who had called on them, and I didn't want any trouble, they were obviously drinking and having a fun time hanging in and around the hotel. All of the rooms are clustered together in one small area with one door leading to the outside. I was in one \"area\" with one outside door and six other rooms. The door leading out to the hallway was very thin and didn't control any noise. I heard everyone that came and went. I will say that I am a light sleeper, so take my review as it is......just that, my experience. I would probably not stay at this hotel again for the noise.

If you're on a budget and willing to take a bus or drive to downtown Chicago, this hotel is perfectly adequate for the money. And it has a pool. But the staff was pretty unpleasant. Look. I know that it was the weekend of Lollapalooza and the hotel was full. Still, my party and I went out of our way to be nice and smile to the hotel staff who were not outright hostile but they were terse and unfriendly for our entire stay. The value was pretty reasonable. The hotel is nothing fancy but there is a pool and a small workout room. Everything was clean enough. I did however reserve a room with two twin beds and got a room with one king so we had to pay extra to have a cot wheeled in (and we didn't have it for our first night so my poor sister had to sleep on the floor). Similarly, our room had maybe only one or two towels which were not adequate for three people. We arrived at the hotel at about 1 p.m. on Friday and asked if we could check in early. They told us we couldn't check in until 3 p.m. which we understood but the way they said it was a little harsh. They did let us leave our bags with them so we could go to the concert. We also asked for a room with two twin beds (like we reserved) and they said no and we asked for a cot and were told no. I understand - it was busy - but that was it. No offer of extra pillows or blankets, just no. The location is okay for the price. It seemed like a cute neighborhood. There's a bus that stops nearby as well as a subway stop though I think the subway stop may be in a rough area. There's a museum and cafe not too far away as well as an Original Pancake House. The bus was about 30 minutes from Grant Park and downtown Chicago. There's also a shuttle but we didn't want to ask the staff for more info about it since they were already pretty unfriendly. Also, when we were getting ready Sunday morning, a housekeeper knocked on the door at about 9:30 a.m. and asked if she could come in. We asked her to come back later. She knocked on our door again about an hour later. Now, sure, most people probably would have left by then, but this was Sunday morning. I'm confident that many of the guests in the hotel had probably checked out. Why did she keep bothering us? The actual room was fine. With the cot, it was a little tight for three people. The complimentary shampoo and conditioner were gross though. They made my hair feel terrible. I'm usually not at all picky about that type of thing but these were bad. In general, this experience could have been pretty solid if the staff had not been unpleasant for the whole weekend. I've stayed in cheap hotels before and been treated well.

Of course they are trying to update but I'm sure it's expensive to take care of all that needs to be done so I can appreciate the small steps here and there. In this case though, the housekeeping staff are the guilty ones for not reporting room issues. It may be an older room and all but there is no reason for the shower curtain rod to be loose from the wall. Housekeeping should report this so it can be repaired before the next guest checks in. THe coffee pot, my bad since I didn't realize it should have a lid. I told my husband it was clogged and he went to pull out the filter part to unclog and all the hot water burned his fingers... I guess we needed the pot lid to hold a lever in order for the coffee to automatically drip out. Afterward we made coffee again and held the part with a pen so it would drip out. Housekeepings fault again because they are to check that everything in the room is working and there. The coffee maker outlet was not working. I tried the reset button and no luck so we had to move rthe maker to another outlet to get it to work. But to their defense on this, if no one has told the hotel the outlet is not working then they can't fix it so now that I've told them, hopefully they will look into that for the next guest.. Yes, I reported the shower curtain rod right away only because I did not want to be blamed for it being broken. I did leave a comment card in regards to everything else. My fellow roomates on the other side of the hall were a bit noisy if you know what I mean but once we were in the room and turned on the TV, we did not hear them after that except the doors shutting kind of hard from time to time. All in all, yes, I'll stay here again. I think the cost is high for the room but as far as the rooms compared to other hotels in the area, this is one of the lowest. THey always seem to be busy which is a good sign as well. THe night of my stay, the frontdesk recommended a pizza place and this was the best pizza and philly steak I've ever had.

We sat down to eat late and so didn't expect a lot but we were pleasantly surprised at both the quality of food and service. Overall a nice stay but not a great location.", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sister Lakes, MI", "Title": "\u201cThis Hotel Is Just Fine\u201d", "Author": "LoveToTravel72", "ReviewID": "UR17918245", "Content": "We needed a room for a couple of days while a family member was at U of C hospital.

We are so glad we took the chance. The room was clean including the bedding, bathroom and carpet. The staff were all friendly. We felt the neighborhood was fine. We never felt afraid. The only things we didn't care for were the elevator (inspected?) and the smell of the hallway. The room did not smell bad. There is a taxi stop directly outside the hotel but if you choose to drive yourself, the front desk is more than happy to give you a map with specific instructions on the best way to get somewhere. In fact, the front desk was alway more than happy to help answer our questions, and we had several. I took my laptop and had no problem receiving a wireless signal in our room on the 3rd floor. The restaurant/lounge was a nice place to sit back and relax. We will be staying here again soon. I recommend giving it a try if you aren't too picky of a person. If you want a 4-5 star room, I suggest driving downtown and paying for the 4-5 star room.

Self-serv parking elsewhere in Chicago is $29+ per night. The first stay in the last week of February, I had a room about 399 yards from Lake Michigan and with a view of the south side of Downtown Chicago. Nice, comfortable, clean with a coffee maker, fridge and comfortable bed. Ordered room service one night and had a good 10 oz. Ribeye for $20. Only bad part of the stay was the internet not working. After confirming that the internet was working, I booked two days the next week. Internet was working, as I am writing this from the room. When I checked in, Angie, the frint desk staff welcomed me back. The room I was first assigned was not adequate. The TV remote did not work even after replaing the batteries and the fridge was not working. Called the front desk and Angie immediately reassigned me a large room with a working remote, fridge and a microwave. The room was not a suite, but was huge. The view was not on the lake, but in a big city, the view of the tall building is always spectacular.

It has working internet access like it says it does. Secondly, there if you are lucky, you may get a room with a great view of Lake Michigan across the highway from you. I guess a 3rd plus is that we saw no roaches. Now for the real. This spot is run down and when I say run down I do mean run down to the point of neglect. I don't know when last the vents were cleaned, but they were so dusty that it looked like grey cauliflower coming through the grate. The hall carpet is filthy. It is akin to walking through a back alley behind a butchers shop. Who konws what ran off into it, but it is sticky. The property has a laundry list of things that need to be fixed that is too long to detail: on 4 floors only 2 ice machines only 1 of which was working, broken windows in rooms fixed with a bit of clear tape, air conditioners that do not work, holes slammed in sheetrock everywhere..... The list continues for many more paragraphs. Parking too, is a bit of a joke. Though not as bad as some places, having to fight with locals who parked across the entrance to the hotel to watch July 4th fireworks and parked in the Guests only parking then came in to tell the manager they were gonna 'block him in for a minute' while my wife & I cruised the roads around trying to get into the hotel lot........ Oh, cable tv didn't work and at first, neither did the phone. They tried to get me to fix it over the phone ( I called on my cell phone) and I had to tell them to just send the phone guy unless they were going to pay me...... Best of luck staying there.

I didn't read any reviews until shortly before we left and I then got very nervous because most of them were pretty negative. But, the hotels in the center of Chicago where all the tourist attractions are were simply unaffordable for us, so we proceeded to stay at the Ramada. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised by our experience. All in all, for the price, this choice was fine. We knew upfront that there was no free shuttle service between the airports and the hotel. It costs about $50.00 to get from the airport to the city unless you use the train or bus. We chose to use a cab for our return to O'Hare and the Omega Shuttle upon our arrival. (Omega goes between the airports and the south side.) The accomodations themselves: The bed was comfortable; the bathroom was newly renovated and the shower was the best I've ever used anywhere. The room appeared to be as clean as any hotel I have stayed in and we were resupplied with fresh towels every day. The TV included HBO and Showtime, although the reception for Showtime never did work. As well, most of the cable stations were full of \"snow\" and difficult to watch. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. It was unseasonably warm in Chicago and it took a day to get the air conditioning on again, but they did respond to our request. The hotel itself is a bit rundown, but if you're really there to see the city, it's fine. There is a taxi stand right there, so you can always get a cab. And the bus stop is about two blocks away. The neighborhood felt safe to me. We took the bus most days using a three day visitor pass that cost $12.00 per person, unlimited use. Ramada does have a free shuttle that will take you downtown and pick you up daily if you want to visit the attractions there. We didn't use it because we're early birds and wanted to get going very early every day. The biggest surprise to me was how good their restaurant was. The only complaint I had was that the vegetables were the same almost every night and were not seasoned properly. But everything else was delicious. Their breakfast buffet was superb and the wait staff was very polite and helpful. All in all, this hotel is a terrific bargain for Chicago.

The room was generally clean and well-maintained. Room service was good. Reception was also nice. They might not act as eager as you expected for 5-star hotels, but that's not what you can expect from this hotel. The hotels in Chicago are really expensive. For this kind of price, Ramada is considered a good choice. The connection to downtown depends on Taxi or Metra Electric Railway. Taxi to McCormick Place is about 10 min and costs approximately 11USD. Metra Electric runs more frequently around 7 o'clock. The 53th Street and the 47th street stations are equally far from Ramada. It's takes about 10min to walk there. I'd suggest the 53th street since the way to it seems easier. Some trains do not stop at the 47th street station. Internet connection is a real problem. It is unstable and seems relatively slow. Those live in the 2-floor building might not be able to use it. Sometimes connection can be established at around the window at certain angle. If you have an external antenna, it might be easier. That's why sometimes you can see people taking their notebook to lobby.

One thing to note is that there are a variety of rates available - some include breakfast, some don't. Mine did not, but it turned out to be a non-issue since my days started at 5am. In general, I found the staff to be very kind and helpful. When I checked in, the lady at the front desk gave me a choice of the two rooms that were available at the time. That's something you rarely get to do. In the lobby, there are two computers for guests to use. When the mouse stopped working on one machine, Cory immediately went looking for a spare mouse for the computer. I personally liked the room. The things that are important for me in a hotel room are a comfortable bed and cleanliness. I don't mind the fact that there wasn't a flat screen TV. Since decor is based on personal taste, I've included pictures of my room so you can be the judge. The alarm clock had an iPod docking station. Now the reason why I didn't give the hotel a higher rating. The hotel has exterior corridors, so noise can be much more of an issue. The first night I was there, I did not have an issue with noise. Unfortunately, during the rest of my stay in San Diego, 10,000 athletes also came to San Diego and there were quite a few staying at the Radisson. I did not appreciate the fact that there were kids running up and down the corridors and yelling late at night in light of the fact that I had early mornings. The only way I was able to sleep was to use my noise cancelling earphones. The issue just might be the timing of my visit.

I learned at check-in, that although the company had made all the arrangements, I was to pay for the room and expense it. The front desk staff was very understanding, and gave me a much better nightly rate than the reservation price. The rooms all have outdoor entrances, and the area around the hotel is not threatening by any means. There is at least 1 security guard that roams the parking lot area during the night time hours. The free breakfast buffet was limited in selection, but cooked perfectly. I had an early flight out and arrived for breakfast 10 minutes before opening time. I was invited in for coffee, and offered some muffins to go if I desired them. The hot items were available just before opening at 6am, and the staff let me know that it was okay for me to help myself. The sleep number bed was a new experience, but honestly, I could not find a \"perfect setting\" as shown on the commercials. None the less, it was comfortable enough for two good nights of sleep. The room was quiet, but I was located on the outside area that faces the parking lot, not the pool. A newspaper was at my door on the first morning, but not on check-out day. My receipt was slipped under the door sometime before I woke up at 5am. The room was clean and well maintained.

We chose the hotel because they allow pets and their pet fee was way below the other properties. We, unfortunately, came to find out there's a reason this property was so much cheaper. I stayed in the car as he checked in. When the doors from the outside opened, music was blaring from a party booked in the party room. A buffet was set up for this party right in the lobby and children were running around all over the place -- at 11:00pm!!!!! The only saving grace to this property is the staff. They took the first night off the bill for the inconvenience. They have a bend-over-backwards attitude which is even sometimes absent at the finest resorts. The rooms are gloomy. We could not tell if the sofa was old and dirty or just really ugly. The room, however, was spacious. It was somewhat clean, however the coffee maker was dingy. The look is weird. The bedding looks somewhat new. The beds look old. The towel rod in the showe rod feel and cut my foot. The wallpaper in the bathroom and sink basin look new. The tub walls are white, yet the tub itself is an old and dingy yellow. The bathroom has only a sliding door which stays slightly open. The bathroom is very small. The property itself leaves much to be desired. It is really a 3-story cramped motel. Many of the guests on Saturday night chose to drink beer shirtless at the outdoor halls. The parking is very limited. The pool is in very close proximity to the inside courtyard rooms and the acoustics are terrible. This seems to be a bit of an \"event\" hotel. As mentioned, they book parties in their facility which is also very close to rooms. On the positive/negative side, the loud air conditioning covered the noise. Young soccer teams were booked into the hotel. The staff offered to change our room because it was close to the party area, but we discovered it was the \"bride room\" for a nearby wedding. However, kudos again to the great staff for holding a room aside for us to check. Also, a note if you want to visit the attractions of San Diego. Rancho Bernardo is to the north. You are look at a 30 minute drive to downtown San Diego.

They classfied the room as a suite, which is a little bit of a stretch, but is was very nicely decorated. Not your usual grandma covered, flowered comforter, it was a clean, fresh down blanket, the room did have a microwave, frig, free internet, and free parking. Driving a SUV, I did find parking spaces were a bit snug though. Our room had a Sleep Number Bed, which was a little noisy operating, but very comfortable to sleep on. The room is seperated by a pony wall and on 1 side you can watch T.V. on the sofa-bed or swivel it to where the bed is located. The room was located on the 1st floor, across from the heated-pool and jacuzzi, so with kids it was easily accessed and not noisey at all! There is a restraunt on premises called JJ's Grill. They do serve breakfast (buffet style only) for $7 a person, to my surprise they did not charge for kids! Pasteries, pancakes, eggs, sausage, oatmeal, coffee, teas. Really a good variety, just don't expect high-quality. Every adult does get 1 free alcoholic beverage each evening, which is nice. The Grill also serves dinner as well. Although, we ventured to The Elephant Bar just down the street, which has a great selection and great food! You can drive a couple exits' down and will find many places to eat or go to Old Town or Balboa Bay and have a ton of shopping, a variety of dining choices, and the Ocean breeze only about 20 minutes away.

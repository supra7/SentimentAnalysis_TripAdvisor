The hotel is fantastic. Don't be swayed by the slightly run-down lobby (the concierge is behind a pane of glass); it really is a great hotel. We (girlfriend and i) stayed in a queen room and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the room. Simple but spacious, with a nice flat panel TV and large bathroom and entrance. To echo what others have said, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and the room had other notable features (large shower head, a well-lit vanity mirror that my girlfriend loved, a secure safe, dimmable lighting) that were a great plus. The hotel also has a coffee/breakfast area, full modern washer/dryers, and cheap lockers (to store bags before checkin/after checkout). The front desk was helpful, and the whole place is family-owned. We didn't have any hot water our first day there, but we didn't put up too much of a fuss and the water was toasty the next day. Also, our fire alarm beeped for low battery the first night, but after telling the concierge we didn't have any problems afterwards. Finally, on our last night, we did notice that we could hear the voices of the people on the room next door - not sure if they were being loud or if the walls were thin (or both), but it was noticeable. But the most valuable feature of this hotel is the location and the price. located just five minutes from Herald Square right in the heart of Manhattan, and a 10-15 min walk to Times Square, the location was perfect. It's not overlooking a busy street, so you don't need to worry about street noise all night long. And it's just 3 minutes from a great subway station that serves major lines that will get you anywhere you need to be. And it's a short easy walk to Penn Station.

The hotel is in a very convenient location, is clean, the personnel are friendly and helpful, the beds are very comfortable, and the very plush, heavy towels were lovely. We were given one of the pre-renovated rooms with 2 double beds [Room 703], so I can't comment on the renovated ones. It was very small. Since most hotels/motels [even the budget chains]have both complimentary toiletries and hair dryers in the bathrooms, the fact that they didn't was a little surprising especially considering the cost of the room@ $381.00 for the Saturday night [they do have nice, small-size AVEEDA soap bars]. We were able to borrow a hair dryer at the front desk, no charge.The woman at the front desk said they also have the toiletries at the desk - you need to ask for them - not sure if they are free. The heat from the radiator couldn't be controlled, and, as it was warm in NYC for this time of year [December], it was really uncomfortably hot in the room, requiring us to turn on the air-conditioning overnight. One bed was very close to the bathroom door which opens out - a bit inconvenient for the person sleeping in that bed. Only that bed has a small, mounted shelf next to it. The other bed closer to the window has none, is against the wall, and there's not much distance between the beds. With no bathroom exhaust fans, only a vent, it made for very steamy showers.There are two desk chairs, a small closet and a fold-up luggage rack. They do have very cool coffee/hot cocoa/hot water for tea machine in the lobby, but it is not available 24 hours/day. There is a DUNKIN'DONUTS on the corner of Fifth Ave. & 31st St., as well as a couple of cafes, a deli and a CVS close by. I would guess the room rate was high as it was a Saturday and a pre-holiday weekend, and I booked directly with the hotel. As I said, these are not complaints, just comments on my experience.

After reading reviews here and elsewhere, we decided to give the Herald Square Hotel a try - a very good decision, as it turned out! First things first - this is *not* a hotel for you if you expect tremendous views from your bedroom. However, with that caveat in mind, it has much to offer, in terms of location (15-20 minute walk from Times Square, slightly longer to Chelsea/West Village), cleanliness (spotless), comfort (the beds in the 2 rooms we stayed in were great), and service (very friendly and responsive, with one minor exception noted below). We stayed for 6 nights, but this was divided between 2 rooms (904 - 'standard room' with 2 full-size beds; 219 - 'renovated room' with one full-size bed - 1st night only in 904). Both rooms were clean, with the same (very comfortable) mattresses. 904 was carpeted and 219 had laminate flooring - but the real difference is in the bathrooms - the renovated bathroom was a joy - HUGE bathtub/shower (showerhead the size of a dinner plate - not a *power* shower, but more like your own personal waterfall)! Really appreciated after spending ~8-10 hours walking each day! Lots of fluffy towels, very nice Aveda toiletries. Also, very good lighting in the bathrooms and the rooms (lack of sufficient lighting was one of my complaints about the New Yorker). Other points - the wifi worked perfectly throughout our visit, we never felt hassled by staff because we stayed in until 11:30-11:45 most mornings, no charge to store our bags on the last day of our visit (also unlike the New Yorker), free coffee/tea/sweets during mornings and early evening, comfortable old leather armchairs as well as tables in the downstairs lounge area... Finally, the one little niggle - the TV remotes in both rooms didn't work, and our request that it be fixed in the second room didn't change that. This was an issue only because the bed was quite a distance from the TV in the second room, and the controls on the TV itself were difficult to see as the TV was mounted on the wall. (Opening the remote casing showed why the problem existed - the batteries probably hadn't been changed in over 2 years, and had corroded. My husband, who travels a lot for work, says this is the most common problem he encounters in hotels.) I did let the management know about this problem on my comment card as we left. Otherwise, no complaints and much satisfaction.

We did mention the noise problem to management who said if we had mentioned it earlier they would have changed the room for us. We would suggest that if staying at this hotel do not get room 116.

The hotel is located on a dirty and unrepresentative street with horibble smell from garbage water and facing some ugly buildings. The entrance of the hotel is unfriendly since the doors are always locked and the front desk staff is separated from the guests by bullet proof glass. When we asked the manager what the reason was for that, he answered that he found it unnecessary but his boss likes to have his staff in a safe work environment although nothing ever happened... That gave us a creepy feeling. We stayed in many hotels in the world, but we never have seen hotel staff working behind bullet proof glass. Makes me think... The lobby has a very low ceiling and isn't very nice decorated, neon light. Free coffee and tea during the whole day and night. The corridors in the hotel are very dark, narrow and warm, so are the elevators. Good thing about the hotel: the rooms are clean, the bed was good, clean new towels. The common area's are very clean too. There is a lot of housekeeping staff around during the day. Unfortunately, the rooms were very warm and the airconditioning was extremely loud which made it impossible to sleep with the airco on. The rooms are facing blind walls. My biggest worry in this hotel was the escape route in case of a fire. Luckily we stayed on the second floor, so there would have been a chance to get out of the hotel by the very narrow stairways totally made out of dark green concrete. You will be able to climb out of the window on the 2nd floor, but then you will end up on a little platform squeezed in between 9 level high buildings, you can't escape from. For the first night we stayed in this hotel the rate was $347 plus tax. We stayed in a fantastic 4 star hotel in the Financial District the week before for the same rate. We travelled with a group of 10 people. We were the first couple that arrived. The leader of the group was arriving later that night. She was still on her flight. The manager did not want to let us into our room without the full payment of $347 plus tax for the first night as if we would run away. He repeated himself several times that the amount wasn't refundable. Even though we were 10 and the total payment should have been done that night. Don't believe the pictures on their website.

(There is one right around the corner though, if you do want to use it.) The lobby, elevators and halls seem a bit dated, but it turns out that the building is the historic site of Life magazine, which gave the decor a bit more charm. The staff was pleasant enough, but not very personal - we never interacted with anyone who wasn't behind the glass-enclosed desk. They do give you a good map and a subway map when you check in which is nice. The room was fine, but nothing too special. Nice TV, comfortable bed, nice bathroom. There was a support beam in the middle of the room which was a bit odd, but not a big problem. Our biggest complaint was that the street noise in the mornings was very loud. I think there was construction being down on the building next door which meant loud noises at 6am every day. Not sure if it is always like that. The air conditioning unit was also extremely noisy, but luckily it wasn't hot enough to need it. Overall, the hotel was just fine for a few days for a tourist trip to NY. I would consider staying here again because the rates were so good for the location. I would make sure to ask for a renovated room though, and maybe bring some ear plugs...

I was housed in room 500 which faces 31st Street. While my stay overall was satisfactory I would be negligent if I failed to mention some significant observations. My room had not yet been renovated. It was quite small, as expected, but would not accomodate more than one comfortably. The \"surface' was quite clean but with no effort observed hair on the toilet paper dispenser, dirt and debris on the bed skirt and laundered stains on the comforter cover. The mattress does have a completely insulated mattress which is positive if one wants to avoid bed bugs. What became annoying was the void of any electrical outlets anywhere near the bed. The alarm clock sits on the desk...5 steps from the bed. The lights above the bed are on a dimmer but you must stretch completely accross the bed or physically get out of bed to adjust it. The t.v. is on top of the hutch making the bed the only place to watch it. The a/c temperature is \"regulated\" or \"not cold enough\" as I prefer to say. The a/c was just loud enough to drown out the street noise but not quite loud enough to eliminate the fire truck siren blasting from the fire house a couple hundred feet away. Even with ear plugs it was VERY noisy. The shower was satisfactory but a complete crap shoot as to water temperature which changes with each flush, shower and sink use. The hotel does provide some very nice soap and shampoo. While the staff was very friendly and helpful the setting is not warm or welcoming. You get buzzed in from people who sit behind a plastic cage. The entire lobby area is reminicint of an icky 1970's pay by the day or week hotel, which it may have been back in the day. They are clearly trying to remedy this situation but haven't quite succeeded. The history of the hotel is very cool. Very close to the subway and restaurants. I paid $179.00 plus tax per night.

Just check on Trip Advisor or Hotels.com or even Google and you will find eye popping tariff on nightly accommodations. We were on a limited travel budget so we were in the market for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economy hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We chose the Herald Square hotel on W 31st Street. First off, its location was just great, one block from two subway entrances, one block from the Empire State Building, one block to Broadway, one block to Korea Town, 3 blocks from Penn Station and less than 1/2 block to 5th Ave. The Herald Square hotel is a 100 room facility housed in the building that once housed Time Magazine. Indeed, hung on the walls of the hallways in the hotel are many interesting images taken from Time Magazine covers from the past. This was an office building prior to its conversion to new use, a hotel. That means that the room size was based on what once was office space. The rooms are small. But the conversion overall was pretty well done. The Hotel has no doorman but a buzz in, buzz out affair that actually worked out very well for us. There is someone at the desk 24/7. There is a minimal lobby with a coffee bar offering coffee, tea and hot chocolate. No breakfast is served and there is no room service available. Meals may be ordered in but it seemed most guests preferred to go out to the scores of restaurants in the surrounding blocks. Our first experience with hotel staff was when we checked in, it was about 11 pm and we were assigned a room on the 7th floor. When we went to that room we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe how small, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd really was. In that room if two adults were to open just two bags on what available horizontal space there was then the two adults could not move around except into the bathroom. Staying in that room for 1 night much less the 6 nights seemed impossible. We had to do something. We then contacted the hotel employee at the front desk and asked that we be moved to any larger room available. He said there were none, so we went to dinner to think about our options. After dinner we returned to the hotel and checked once again with the front desk to see if we had choices at all for the Herald Square. A different employee was at the desk when we made this inquiry and after he checked the available rooms he said sure and handed us a key to a room on the 8th floor. When we checked this room it was at least a third again larger than the postage stamp sized room we were first given. Still small but not impossible. Overall our stay was very good. The hotel halls were clean as were the two elevators. In general housekeeping was excellent, in fact they changed our sheets and pillow cased every day. Once when we needed an extra towel we call the front desk and the towel was at our door in 5 minutes. Later in our stay we asked the front desk for a wake up call, they said they would and they did. Another occasion I asked for a taxi or car service and they arranged that without problem. Internet wireless connectivity was available throughout the hotel. We paid $179 per night for our room but with 15% taxes and room fees the actual cost was about $206.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cClean room at reasonable rate (for NYC!)\u201d", "Author": "MainSt", "ReviewID": "UR110133615", "Content": "I had to find a room for the night with about a week's notice.

We arrived on Friday afternoon, a very snowy, one at that, but the sun was out and the sky was blue, what more could you want? We got a friendly welcome at reception and where allowed into our room right away (usually most hotels abide by a strict 2/3pm rule). To the right of reception is a small seating area with coffee served at various times throughout the day and a LOVELY seating area at the front of the hotel which made me feel like I was sitting in an old 1920's explorers living room. Fantastic. My first impression of the room was that it was outdated, VERY outdated. Faded carpet, light switches that look like something Thomas Edison himself installed and a really old, chunky TV. Not really what they show on their website. Having said that, we had two double beds with the nicest matress' I've ever tried.

I wasn't aiming at luxury as we got the room for \u00c2\u00a3320 for 4 nights, I simply wanted somwhere to sleep...this fit the bill. Set in one of the quieter streets, it was nice to put your head down at night and listen to that typical NY police siren in the distance. Hotel is in a prime location, about 2 minutes from Herald Square, easy access to the Subway system and a 10, 15 minutes walk into Times Square. Also, the fact that the Empire State Building is 2 minutes away made it even better. My only real complain about the room is not wanting to get out of the comfy bed in the morning!

First time in the summer of 2007, second time in the summer of 2008. First time 12 nights, second time 9 nights. Mixed feelings when we look back at our stay. The first year we choose a renovated room with a King bed. It was on the second floor. The room was very small. It had a little entrance with tiles where you found the iron and ironing table. Then you had the room with desk, two chairs, king bed and bathroom. Everything was clean, but you hardly had any space to put your suitcases and the room was just big enough so you could walk around the bed. Bathroom was clean, but not big either. It has a window which looks out to a blind wall. The really thing that bothered us was the extreme loud air conditioning. Downstairs is a lobby where you can get some free tea, coffee, chocolate milk and candy/cookies. It all looked kind of cheap though. There is a vending machine where you can buy coke, sprite, minute maid and in the same room as the vending machine, you can do your laundry. There is a small room where you can go on the internet, do your phone calls, but you need to pay for all of that. Overall experience in 2007 was ok, so we chose to book a room the next year for our second stay in New York. Boy, were we disappointed! We arrived around 3PM and the woman on the front desk told us our room was not ready yet. We wanted to stay in the lobby, since it was very hot outside, but she was rude and told us to leave and come back in an hour. We got back an hour later, room still not ready. Had to come back in 30 minutes. Room still not ready when we got back. Finally, when we came back for the third time, she performed a magical trick and our room was ready. She gave us the key to a room way back on the ground floor, behind the laundrette and the vending machine. This was not the big room she promised (\"I'll be worth the wait. It's a big room with a large LCD, bla bla bla\"). We refused the room and finally after a 3 hour wait got the room we booked. The room was a large room, with fake windows, quite dark, but renovated with a desk, chairs, extra table and clean spacious bathroom with two sinks. It was on the second floor. There was also an encounter with a cockroach downstairs in the hallway. We went to the front desk and told the woman what we saw and she just picked up the walkie talkie, said \"roach\" and went on with her business, like this was just another roach on just another day...

The only drawbacks to this admittedly \"budget\" hotel is that there are few services: the clerks are behind bullet proof glass (which is scary) and since there is no doorman/concierge, you need to be buzzed in to get into the hotel (which I suppose provides safety). There is a lounge, but there is no food (just coffee)--so you need to go elsewhere for food.

The bathrooms look updated and roomy. What we found was the exact room in the picture--same window, same orientation, same beds, same carpet color--minus the nice decorations, nice headboards, and with a totally different, un-updated bathroom than was seen in the photo. Two things came to mind. There are identical rooms in the hotel, some of which have been updated, some not. Maybe the price I paid reflected the fact that I was in a shabbier copy of the room seen on the website. Further reading on Tripadvisor would have revealed that I was not the only one to suffer this fate. In addition to the room which looks like it might have been rented at the YMCA (with the exception of the beds, which were comfy and with decent linens), the lobby is drab and the \"receptionist\" is behind bullet-proof glass, which should have been a giant tip off that this was not the hotel experience we expected. In summary, I repeat. You get what you pay for. We paid $150 (including taxes) a night for a true economy-type hotel. The free wi-fi in the hotel was a plus, but there wasn't even shampoo or conditioner in the bathrooms.

However, as we were out sight seeing in daytime, we didn't mind that so much. The room was made up with fresh towels every day and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom in our room was very small. However, for NY, the room itself was v. large-2 double beds and plenty of room to walk around. There was no hair dryer but we were able to get one from reception with a deposit of $20. There is free coffee tea etc. in the lobby and nice big flat screen TV's in the rooms. We were on the 9th floor so it was nice and quiet-although the pipes banged a bit if people were taking a shower. However, this has happened in almost every hotel I have stayed in in NY in the past-I think it is a problem in the older buildings. By far the top selling point for this hotel is its location. It is minutes from 34th street, Macy's and the many many shops that are around. It is also minutes from the subway station. There are a lot of nice places to eat nearby. Our overall opinion: clean safe and excellent location. However, we felt the price ($199 a night before taxes-$230 after all was added in) was quite high for the basic level of the hotel.

Our cab driver had a hard time finding the hotel (he's a 3rd generation New yorker) and even joked that it might be a dodgy place. Our initial apprehension was put to rest the minute we stepped into the hotel. The staff was courteous and very friendly, entertaining my husband with chatter when he asked if the water was safe to drink from the tap (they say it is) and we felt very welcomed by them. A lot of emphasis was placed on safety - only 1 keycard was issued (can drop it off at the front desk if we're worried about losing it when we're out and about) and also the front door of the hotel has a security feature where by it locks automatically and would only open when one of the staffs presses a button from the office. The room also has a safe (albeit, kind of old - set the password and try it out first before you use it because it locks without having you set a password first!) The room and toilet was very clean, and had a pleasant smell (NO MOULD!) and the sheets were clean and comfy. The room was small, with just about enough room to move around the queen sized bed but when we chucked our bags on the floor we ran out of walking room. But checking out the website and the fire-escape floor plan, it seems that all the rooms differ in sizes so each room is unique. in short, i didnt get the room as featured in pictures on the website, but we were satisfied with the room nonetheless. Location wise, we were very close to 5th avenue (though 5th avenue is very long so you have to walk a bit along 5th ave to get to the shops) and a street away i think from the empire state building. what my husband and i really loved was that we were so close to the harold square station for the subway, and it was quick and easy for us to get about (less than 5min train ride to the natural history museum!). There were many subway lines going up and down town so it was a real convenience. There's a pharmacy across the street, a restaurant just downstairs and Koreatown just around the corner (The Korean restaurant behind 31st street called Mondoo is a ripoff!). Also, Macy's just about a block away, near the harold square subway entrance. If you intend to ship back your shopping, there's a post office right downstairs too, to the right of the hotel when you exit. It was raining a lot when we were there, so we called in some sandwiches (Speedy's) from brochures placed in the room ($1 per local call out!). Neighborhood wise, it's a street away from the quieter areas so if you're the cautious sort it'll be good for you to pay attention. The street which the hotel is on is safe and busy in the day, and in the evenings you can walk over to the irish pub which is about a 5min walk. The only thing unsatisfactory during the trip was that they were doing carpentry work on a room on my floor - you can hear an electric saw ripping at 6am in the morning. It took me 26hrs to get to New York and I was suffering terrible jetlag so the noise was not appreciated. But overall, aside from that issue, we were very pleased with the hotel and we would most definitely stay there again if for some reason we have to go back to NYC.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "amsterdam", "Title": "\u201creally good hotel in midtown\u201d", "Author": "joeAmsterdam", "ReviewID": "UR46770586", "Content": "Stayed with my husband a week in the Herald square hotel in the beginning of september.

The negative points are of minimal importance, if any: there is no room service, but we never use that anyway in any hotel, so no problem for us. No minibar, but an ice machine at lobby. Small reception, but we didn't go to NYC to stay at a hotel reception. No restaurant, but a plenty of restaurants nearby. Of note: we stayed one night at the more expensive Sheraton, and our room at the Herald Square was much better than at that hotel.

I was travelling alone and had a small room to myself with an en suite bathroom and a double bed. It is a basic hotel, but very comfortable and clean. My bed was very big and the bathroom was spotless. My view was terrible - an airshaft, but I was only there to sleep and shower so a view was not a priority to me. My room had a flatscreen TV with lots of channels including HBO. This was good for nights I was tired and wanted to stay in and also for checking the weather in the morning as my airshaft view gave me no clue! The staff were friendly, I had no problems with them. There was high speed internet available at $1 per 5 minutes which I used a couple of times without any problems. I was told by staff that there were hot drinks available in the lobby, but I never used this facility, but I often saw people sat in the seating area around the drinks machine. The location of the hotel was probably the best thing, right in the heart of midtown, a few blocks from the Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens. Perfect if you need to pop back to drop off your shopping bags or get changed for dinner without wasting too much time. Also very near to a few subway stops, which I used often. If I had any complaints it would be that there seemed to be some building work going on in some rooms near me and a few mornings I heard loud banging and various other noises. This wasn't a major problem for me as I got up early most days, but some would find it irritating. Maybe check your room is not near any building if you feel this would bother you.

The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was small to say the least but it was clean. The shower also had good pressure which can sometimes be a trouble in older hotels. The only negative I would say is that we slept in one day and didn't want maid service and left a do not disturb card on the door. We came back after a long day of touring to find our room cleaned. It wasn't bad that it was cleaned but we had flown in late the night before and our stuff was everywhere so we just wanted to settle a bit before a cleaning. Plus, we don't like to waste water and energy by having our room cleaned everyday. I was slightly perturbed that the staff disregarded the do no disturb sign and cleaned anyway.

I have no idea what other reviewers are talking about when they describe wonderful rooms or granite countertops. The main room had 2 full size beds - which were great - VERY comfortable. Otherwise, basic old green carpet, and an old laminate shelf ran along the other wall holding the TV. No alarm clock, no waste bin, no desk, no closet door, no mirror. Bathroom was basic - one sink. Generally clean except for a few odd hairs. Tub/shower was happily very clean. No shampoo, no conditioner, so make sure to bring your own. Since I only slept there and was out and about most of the time, it was just fine for me, but if you're looking for any luxury at all, or trying to impress somebody (family, honeymoon, romance), I would not recommend here. If you're young, on a budget, spending minimal time at hte hotel, then it's just fine. $2 lockers in the lobby let you store your bags on the day you check out if you're not immediately running to the airport. I used them on my last day - very convenient, though I'm accumosted to hotels holding your bags for free. Oh well.

The room was spotlessly clean, the cast iron bed was super comfortable and the decor neutral and pleasant. The flat screen tv had a lot of channels to choose from, and there is a free WiFi in the hotel (ask for the code when checking in). There were also a hairdryer, a safe and a make-up mirror in the room. The bathroom was big and airy and very beautifully decoreated in early 20th century style. The bathtub was big and the rain shower nice. The room was cleaned daily and the bedlinens and the towels changed. Outside the hotel looks better than when you get into the lobby: the reception is a bit dull as the staff sits behind a glass like in a post office. Nevertheless the staff was very helpful in all matters. When we got to the hotel, we didn't get any hot water but the maintenance guy fixed that in 2 minutes. There only limited services in the hotel: a free coffee automat in the lobby, guests' laundrette (handy for backpackers), a vending machine and a locker room for luggage if your plane leaves in the evening. The Herald Square is perfect for an independent traveller who doesn't want to pay a fortune for a hotel. There is no restaurant or breakfast room at the hotel, but there are plenty of restaurants around, and the Koreatown with its Korean restaurants is just one block away. There is also a post office almost next to the hotel, and on the othere side of the street, there is a small convenience store which is handy for a late snack or buying drinks for the hotel room. The only negatives would probably be the drab decor of the hallways and the lobby, and the fact that our window was to a courtyard that was quite dark, more like a ventilation shaft. The central heating was also a bit too efficient. We paid around $180 for a night, but made the reservation well in advance using the hotel's own pages.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "WOLLONGONG", "Title": "\u201cA hidden gem - what a wonderful hotel!\u201d", "Author": "pengu55", "ReviewID": "UR28090404", "Content": "This hotel is an absolute gem.

Unfortunately both of us caught a gastro bug on the way over and spent almost the whole time being very ill in the hotel so we definitely made use of our room! Fortunately we went for a renovated room (our friends both stayed in non renovated rooms and said that they were tiny and very very basic, one of our friends even had the electricity to his room cut while he was having a shower and had to shower in the dark!). We spent ages looking at hotels and this was the cheapest we could find when we were looking (although still quite expensive). The room was on the second floor and gorgeous, chandeliers, huge queen size bed which was very comfortable, wardrobe and safe in the room. Beautiful bathroom with the biggest rain fall shower I have ever seen. There were also mini Aveda bath and hair products which was wonderful for me as I love Aveda! The room was very warm but there was air conditioning which was a little loud but overall fine. We had a big flat screen TV opposite our bed with loads of channels which was great for watching TV in bed. There was also a little table with a couple of chairs which was great since we did have to eat take away in our room on a few occasions because we were ill. The only bad thing about the room was that it was a bit dark. There was one window in the bathroom and the room which both opened up on to an internal part of the hotel so there wasn't much natural light although plenty of bright internal ones which made up for it and there was also some sort of extractor fan thing which we could hear if we opened the window. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom but it was really weak and took me about ten times longer than usual to dry my hair and it kept getting scorchingly hot making it difficult to hold. I did have my own little powerful travel hairdryer but with the adaptor just made it also very weak which was a little annoying. There was also some sort of work going on at the hotel during the day which was a little annoying for us as we ended up being ill and having to sleep during the day while there was constant very loud banging and drilling going on. Usually this wouldn't bother us tho as we would have been out sightseeing. The location is decent, mid town and just a block away from the Empire State and Broadway. The nearest subway stations were a couple of blocks away in various directions. Check in was efficient and the staff were fine.

The room itself was comfortable. While the room was not huge, it did have two double beds and there was enough room for our three large suitcases.

The bathroom was adequate, with plenty of hot water. There was also a free room safe for the storage of valuables. Housekeeping was very good. We always returned to a nice tidy room at the end of the day. Hotel staff were always pleasant and helpful. The HSH also has a good laundry facility and a pay internet kiosk.

Or there was a subway stop two blocks away. Penn Street Station is also only a ten minute walk away - even when wheeling suitcases. We found a number of restauants within about a 15 minute walk (There is also a good restaurant right next door if you dont want to walk). For breakfast, we walked less than 2 blocks to Speedys.

He gladly gave me the key to the guest/public washroom so I could freshen up and change, sold me a token for the lockers, and told me to enjoy the free coffee, etc.. in the lobby/lounge before I headed out. For the price I paid ($99 for a single room with private bathroom), I actually got a double room courtesy of a free upgrade when I checked in later in the day. I'm not sure if it's because they took pity on me, having arrived so early after being on a bus all night, but I didn't care the reason - they did the same thing when I stayed for 4 nights last year - I just knew I appreciated it.

Judging from the number of positive reviews posted here, that's a possibility. But you might want to take a look at some of the negative reviews, as there's also a possibility that there is a range a room types, some a lot better than others. I may have had the worst room in the house. In 2003, there was no link on Expedia with which to review the hotel, and I definitely wanted to review it, as my experience there was terrible. I just took a look; there's still no link on Expedia. That should tell you something. My first contact with reception was a phone call to ask if it was possible to upgrade to another room with two beds, in order to share with another guest. The woman who answered the phone said there were no alternative rooms available. When I asked if there was a possibility of putting in a cot, she dismissed that with a laugh, and then cut me off. When I got into the room, I could see why she had laughed: it was tiny, and one of the dimmest, dreariest spaces I've ever been in. There were no windows to speak of, only one high up toward the ceiling that looked out to what seemed like an alley way - only you really couldn't see out at all. The room was bifurcated at the foot of the bed by a demi wall-column that doubled as a closet. The whole feeling was closed-in, positively clausterphobic. I would have tried to change hotels then and there, only it was a Friday night on a big game weekend, so the prospects were dim. I was pretty much stuck there for Friday and Saturday nights, but was determined to get out for Sunday night, which I did. There's no lobby in the hotel to speak of, only a small room with the reception desk behind plate-glass. Off to the side is a small room that did have a computer that guests can use, one very small amenity in a hotel that had virtually none. The other redeeming feature was the artwork on the walls - reproductions from the old Life Magazine, which used to own the building. I had one other encounter with the woman I first spoke to, and that was when I called to cancel Sunday night. She was once again very rude, and I told her so. Note: it is very rare that I ever say anything like that to anyone. A final insult from that visit was what looked like hugely inflated phone charges on my bill for the few phone calls I made - beyond the usual hotel gouging, I'd say. Needless to say, changing hotels from Herald Square to the Quality Hotel Times Square was a huge relief. I traded one tiny room for another pretty small one, but the latter was simply heavenly by comparison!", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, WI", "Title": "\u201cGood value - maybe splash out for en-suite next time\u201d", "Author": "limehotcheeto", "ReviewID": "UR18154853", "Content": "I stayed one night at the Herald Square Hotel and but for the state of the shared bathing room, I was impressed considering the room rate.

There was a rockin' cold air conditioner in the window, a small nightstand, a safe, a sink with mirror and bar of soap, a hand towel, washcloth, and bath towel, and a clothes hanging bar. The room smelt a little fusty and close (like a small room smells in the morning when someone has slept in it), but since it has a window a/c and not central ventilation, that makes some sense. To get to the shared bathing room (one per floor if I recall), I went down my hall, through a door, left, left again, and down another hall. This was slightly inconvenient in the middle of the night. The bathroom was stifling hot at all hours - seemed like it had the heat on in the hottest weekend in July - and twice I discovered someone had not flushed. Yuck! This is clearly not the hotel's fault, but in any case it made me wary of using the shower. The folks at reception were unfailingly friendly and kind and allowed me to check in as soon as my room was ready - 10 a.m. in this case!

And, on check-out we were presented with a lovely souvenier keyring which was the (unexpected) icing on the cake after a very pleasent and comfortable stay. We paid US$209 before taxes/night which was very reasonable for the standard of accommodation we received.

We did have an older room and I thought the rate was wonderful ($98 a night). I had read many reviews here and thought we were getting a \"newer\" room until I realized that I had booked just a regular queen. This was okay because we're more for cost than for extra comfort and room that we don't necessarily need right now. Anyway, arrived at the hotel at 2:00. The being buzzed in wasn't a problem as there is a huge window where the receptionist sits right by the front entrance. She said our room wasn't read and would be ready at 3. We went out and came back around 3:15 and it still wasn't ready, so we went out and decided to come back at night when we were ready to go to bed. They rent out lockers for $2 each to leave your luggage in--ours barely fit in 1--2 backpacks, a small duffel bag and a rolling carry-on. Our room was an older room--bed, night stand, small bathroom and a closet. This worked for us though as we only needed the room to sleep in. The bed was comfortable and it was an enjoyable time. I would recommend this hotel. I looked at the rates recently and noticed that they have gone up significantly. I'm assuming they are trying to make up for their renovation rates. About 2 days after we booked our room, I found our same room on their site for $150 more! The staff was friendly, but nothing exceptional. The location is great--very close to so many sight seeing places!!!! We only saw the older room that we stayed in--heard construction noise in the morning, so we're assuming that they are redoing the entire hotel and won't have older/cheaper rooms for much longer.

We selected the Herald Square Hotel a few weeks ago based on a recommendation and made reservations. When we showed up, I must admit, I was a bit apprehensive due to the fact that you have to be \"buzzed in\" to get into the hotel lobby and the receptionists are behind thick glass. I felt I was in a bank in a bad neighborhood. However, this is a no-frills hotel. There is no concierge, no porters, so I can understand why they would take certain security measures. From what I understand, the hotel is undergoing renovations, and parts of the lobby prove that fact. There is a decent sitting area and another area where you can grab a cup of free coffee along with complimentary chocolates. We discovered that this hotel used to be the original LIFE magazine building, and they have done their best to preserve that heritage with many, many LIFE photographs positioned throughout the lobby & the building. We arrived early on Saturday and were told that our room was indeed ready. The receptionist was very friendly and told us that we have a beautiful room on the 8th floor. Great! Keeping in mind that this building was built in the late 1800's, the elevator ride was an experience. In this day and age of super fast elevators, the elevator here is as slow as molasses. If you're in a hurry, take the stairs. Our room was a surprise. Everything in it looked brand new. From previous poster's pictures, it seems as though our room was just recently renovated. Also, since we were on the top floor, we had 15ft high ceilings, which was a treat. The walls were freshly painted, we had a window view to nowhere, which is fine, as there's nothing to see out any 8th floor window in the city, unless you're on the shoreline. There was a queen sized bed in the room. As for the size of the room, it was fairly small, but with the high ceilings, it didn't matter. The bathroom also appeared freshly renovated, completely tiled, with a brand new tub, and a rain-style shower head. The bathroom was about 1/4 the size of the room, very large! One minor complaint was that the hot water took a little bit of time to get warm, but once it got there, no issue. Room amenities included a 27 inch flat screen TV, a large room safe, a small table, a small desk, and a telephone. At night, there were no strange noises and it was very quiet. The location is very good, right on 31st & Broadway. You're withing walking distance to the Village, Penn Station, Grand Central, the Empire State building, Times Square, & Rockefeller Center. My wife did not want me to write this review as she would prefer to keep this hotel a secret, but fortunately, I believe in sharing. Since it is my understanding that the hotel is currently being renovated and since we were lucky enough to be put on the 8th floor with the higher ceilings and renovated rooms, this is definitely a favorable review. Judging from some of the other rooms shown in previous poster's pictures, I would recommend that if you're coming to this hotel, that you ask for a renovated room.

The lobby was the best part of the hotel and even then, I found that the fact the staff remained encased behind what I assume was bullet proof plexi glass disturbing. There were some problems checking us in under the last name Carlson. The staff kept mixing us up with Karlsen(stay with me... there is more to the name problem later). We were \"upgraded\" to a better room and then took the incredibly filthy and noisy elevator to our floor. We entered the room and it was small, which is to be expected in NYC. However, the carpet was dirty and worn out - I have no idea how old it was, but can tell you that neither my sister nor I dared to walk on it in bare feet. The furniture is basically formica cabinetry which IS NOT shown on the webpage. The lights in the room sparked when turning them off and on- very scary. The A/C unit in the room did not work, and despite several calls to the front desk to have it fixed and one vist from a maintenance person, it was never fixed. There are no hair dryers in the room and to get one, you had to leave a $20 deposit. We called the front desk for cups and were told they would bring some, but they never arrived. Not having cups is not a huge deal, but the disregard of our request is indicative of the type of service at the place. On our last night there, we requested a wake up call so we would be sure to catch our flight. The call never came and luckily we woke up on or own in the nick of time. We checked out and again experienced the confusion regarding the last name \"Carlson\" vs. \"Karlsen\". We were assured everything was correct and we happily left this horrible hotel and experience behind us. Weeks later, the Visa bill arrives and we find that were charged not only for our stay (Carlson), but also for the other \"Karlsens\". We contacted the hotel to have the error corrected and were treated very rudely by unconcerned staff. We were told it would be fixed, but of course, it wasn't. Many calls later with many rude employees, the issue was corrected. This hotel did not have ONE redeeming quality. There are other boutique hotels in the city that do a much better job.

It was our first time to New York so I had booked it upon a recommendation by some colleagues. They had told me that this hotel was very basic but that the location was excellent because a lot of places were within walking distance and more importantly that it's not as expensive as other hotels. I did compare the prices to some other options I looked at on the web and it certainly seemed to be the case, unless of course you managed to get a \"special\" or one didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind some of the tacky places that were on offer. Therefore, on these grounds we decided to try out the Herald Square Hotel. I would now entirely agree with what we had been told in advance; the Hotel is rather old fashioned, nothing glamorous about it. Our room was very basic, very small but clean and it looked out onto a wall and fire escape (no room with a view here!! ). There was some sort of fan or air con system at our window blowing in cold air on the first night, although there was an adequte amount of bed clothes on the bed so we were still warm but standing or walking about in the room it felt cold. We told the receptionist the next day and I think the heating was turned on as it seemed better. During our 3 nights stay, there wasn't really any noise, apart from the air con in the room, so we were grateful for this. In conclusion, we would recommend this hotel if you are just looking to be centrally located in a basic (with TV), clean, very small room without any fancy trimmings at a reasonally priced rate. When I say \"reasonably pricedt\", well this is New York we're talking about, so the prices are above and beyond what we'd normally expect to pay. I think it's suitable for visiting tourists who will be on the move throughout most of the day and just want to use their room as a base; somewhere to sleep after a day's shopping and doing all the tourist sites. Just be prepared it's not the Hilton by no stretch of the imagination, that's for sure. :)", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Danbury, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cWhat a wonderful hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Daytimes", "ReviewID": "UR11097899", "Content": "With all of the commotion in NYC at holiday time, it's wonderful to know there are still hotels to be found with this level of charm and comfort AND reaonable rates!

I was anticipating we would have to spend around $300 per night for a decent place when we were going to be out on the town most of the time. Then, my father-in-law brought this hotel to my attention. Upon reading their website, finding a rate of approximately $220/night, and the location we decided this was what we were looking for. We booked about 3 months in advance to make sure we got a room here. Our room was on the ninth floor and it was toward the back of the building. There was a window in the bathroom and along the same wall in the room and both looked out at another brick building. Even though the view was nothing, it was quiet at night! Considering what I had read about the size of rooms in Manhattan, I thought we had quite a bit of room to move around. The bathroom was small but nothing less than what I expected. I think we were in one of the newly renovated rooms as it was nice and had a flat-screen television. My only complaint would have been the 1 elevator that serviced the ninth floor was slow. We had one time where we waited about 10 minutes for the elevator after pressing the button before it made its way to the top. The location on 31st street between Broadway and 5th Av. was very nice. It is 2-3 blocks South of the Empire State Building and 2-3 blocks East of Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. We were within 2-3 blocks of several subway stations. There is a major subway station at Herald Square (31st and Broadway) where several trains stop to get you to where you are going. Several things are nearby including the Manhattan Mall and Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. At night, the store fronts on 31st Street all have the metal fencing over the windows which kind of make the area dark and unattractive, but during the day it looks much better. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let this scare you if you get there past dark. Overall, it reminded me of hotels in Europe that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at (local ones, not chains). It provided us with a nice, clean, comfortable room. There really are no extra amenities, like a continental breakfast, shampoo or hairdryers, but we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking for that or were willing to forego that for the more favorable rate. I would say that it met my expectations.

From our perspective, we would have preferred to be closer to Times Square or the 42nd Street area. The street that the hotel is on (31st Street) is a bit dark and run-down and several buildings were undergoing renovations, including the hotel itself, making it a somewhat depressing street. The lobby was being painted while we were there by an extremely slow painter, who seemed to be painting just one wall every other day, and so the lobby had an unfinished appearance throughout our one-week stay. The lobby itself is small and cramped and the persons at the front desk are insulated from the hotel guests by what appears to be reinforced glass, which was a bit off-putting and impersonal (this is the first time we had ever seen a hotel lobby of this type in all our travels, and it was more suited to a bureau de change in a dangerous area). Some of the staff were a bit rude and unhelpful, while others were helpful. There is a laundry area on the ground floor with fairly new washing machines, but you have to purchase tokens to operate the machines. The sign in the laundry says that detergent is included in the price of the tokens, but when we enquired about this, the person on duty said that the machines dispensed detergent automatically, and so we did not need to bother with this. Unfortunately, this was just not true, and so our clothes went through the wash cycle without detergent, which was a bit infuriating. The toilet clogged up on the first night, but an attendant came within 5 minutes and fixed it immediately. The hot water came and went and it was difficult to maintain a constant temperature. To our amazement, around the 3rd day of our stay, the housekeeper/maid left a message on our room telephone complaining that we were not keeping the bathroom clean, which we found objectionable, not only because it was an exaggeration (all that happened is that we left a few towels on the floor and personal effects on the vanity counter), but also because we did not appreciate paying for a hotel room with a daily cleaning service and then being told to clean up the bathroom in order to help out the maid. This is the first time we have ever experienced this type of complaint in any hotel anywhere in the world in the last 20 years and we found the message to be unpleasant and impolite. The room was relatively small (we were in one of the deluxe double-bed rooms), but it was clean, and the beds were comfortable. The room was bit dark because the window was small, and the room lighting was inadequate. The air-conditioner worked reasonably well. The bathroom was small and it was difficult to use the sink because of the cramped layout. The elevators were old and slow, and only one went to the top floor. There was no breakfast service. We would not stay at this hotel again because its bad points outweighed its good points. We stayed at the Metro on 35th Street in 2005, and we had a much better experience for more or less the same price.

Nice little lounge downstairs in the foyer and area with tables and chairs in case you wanted to pop out to nearby bagel place and bring back breakfast, and a free hot drinks dispenser with coffees, hot chocolate, teas etc , tea bags of every variety and even a bag of Hersheys Chocolate Kisses or Mints to help yourself from!

The hotel is 5 minutes from the Empire State Building (go when it opens at 8am and you will be first in there and no queues) and within easy walking distance of lots of places you want to see, subway also.

We were just about to purchase the tickets when the clerk advised that it was cash only and we did not have enough. No matter, he said we could get them later when we came to collect our luggage. We returned at 4pm to collect our bags and once again went to the front desk to purchase tickets for the shuttle bus for the next day. There was a different guy on the front desk this time. He seemed very harassed and was extremely rude. He informed my husband that he was too busy to sell us tickets right now and we'd have to come back in an hour.

I booked the cheapest room possible, with the shared bathroom, sight unseen (every photo on their website showed off their \"newly renovated\" rooms, not what I would be getting). My room ended up being the cheap hotel room of my dreams: everything I needed, and nothing more. Bed. Table. Tv. Safe. Clotheshangers. Air Conditioning. Enough floor space for my suitcase. And CLEAN. I'm at that point of being too old for a hostel, but too poor for a \"real\" hotel. Everywhere I go, I wonder why I can't just find a clean, safe, cheap room. Well, score one for me! The hallways and shared bathroom aren't air conditioned, which was a challenge in the heat wave while I was there. I didn't want to spend any time in that bathroom, and ended up buying a mirror so I could do my hair and makeup in my room. While the shared bathroom was the only one on the floor, I never even ran into anyone else coming in or out of it. It's relatively clean (needs remodelling), and the shower stall is big enough that you never have to experience that horrible moment of accidently brushing up against the wall. Location-wise, I couldn't imagine a better place to be. I was able to walk to most of the places I needed to go throughout my stay. The Empire State Building really is right around the corner. I easily grabbed a bus to get uptown or down to the village. And as a single woman walking alone at night, I felt completely safe around the hotel. Financially, I had already hit my breaking point by paying the $80 per night. I'm not a rich girl. But I would recommend splurging the extra few bucks to upgrade if you plan on spending any time in your room. I was able to peek into a few other rooms, and they were beautiful. The pub across the street has amazing food for reasonable prices. Breakfast is easy to grab closeby too, and there's a drugstore around the corner. The staff was always friendly and keen to chat in the elevator. The maid service is great, and very on top of things (I'd switch my sign over to \"please make up room\", leave and come back within an hour, and it would be done). The laundry area is very clean, and I was impressed with the free detergent provided. Little touches like that -- and the 24 hour free coffee in the lobby -- make a huge difference to me. The clientele was surprisingly classy. Lots of young couples, families with teenagers, and a number of guests from overseas. No questionable characters. Yes, there were quirks. I jumped a foot the first time I heard my neighbour's door close, but thankfully we kept similar (yet inconsistant) schedules. I slept soundly through the night with earplugs. The layout of the floor is confusing, and frustrating when you first get off the elevator with an armload of baggage. The workers sometimes kept the elevator door open for a length of time, so you either had to wait or climb stairs. All of this was minor, though, and no more annoying than things I've experienced at major chain hotels.

If we wanted a view, we strolled out the front door to 5th Ave. The hotel building itself is tucked away (if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible in Manhattan) between 5th Ave and Broadway on 31st. We walked to the hotel after midnight on a couple nights and felt safe (the Hotel Wolcott is across the narrow street). 31st has a fraction of the 5th Ave crowd after dark, but the stroll to the hotel front door is so short you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re practically there once you turn the corner. Several subway stops nearby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c since we like to walk, we enjoyed the central location - great for a quick shower and change of clothes between events in the City.

In the summer, they turn off the AC while you are gone from the room, and it can take a long time for the room to cool off again, but otherwise the rooms are very good for the price.

I loved Speedy's on Herald Square, just a block away, but the American Burger shop and O'Reilly's Irish Pub around Herald Square were also good for cheap, tasty meals. If you are going to New York for the gay pride parade, this is an ideal place to stay. You can just walk 1/2 block down to Fifth Avenue to watch the parade, and then when you get tired or hot, you can just pop back into the hotel to rest & cool off a while. The parade crowds are smaller around 31st Street, too, so you can see the parade better.

When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re travelling on a budget, there are really three concerns: One, cleanliness: Bed: Great fluffy bed (Just like 5 star hotels), always smelled like fresh laundry. Carpet: Really clean, was vacuumed every day. Bathroom: Cleaned every day, nice blue stuff in the toilet made it look hygenic. Furniture: Found a bit of dust in the upper part of closet, no biggie. Two, safety: Hotel: Yes, people are buzzed in, so that provides a sense of security. Room: Has indoor locking thingie. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an in-room safe, electronic and big. This was a huge plus, since we were worried about the purchases we were going to make, and my laptop, not to mention our limited money. Three, location: Exellent, two blocks away from the Empire State Building, four blocks from Madison Square Garden, one block from Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, walkable distance to Times Square, two subway stations nearby, you can get anywhere from here. Great stores on 34th street. So, in conclusion, this hotel complied with everything we needed for our stay. Now, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to mention a few other things to consider: View: None. There was a tiny window that overlooked a dark alley. Closet: Enough space to fit clothes and stuff for two people. Furniture: Ugly, but what difference does it make, right? TV: Just 14 channels, but who stays and watches TV in NYC? Appearance: Overall, ugly. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind of an industrial building, and they would benefit from a decorator. Staff: Not friendly and just limited themselves to do their job. Heating: They turned it on in the evening, and when the pipes started to get warm, they produced a horrible clanking noise which kept us up a couple of nights. Take advantage of: The tons of brochures in the lobby, they have some good disccounts and promotions! New York Pass, buy it online, it saves time and money and you get entrance everywhere. Metro Card, $24 for unlimited rides for seven days. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it. Speedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, great diner, good prices, great food. As you walk out of the hotel, turn right, and then turn right again. In the following corner, cross the street, there it is.

Was over in New York for my brothers wedding in September 2005, and enjoyed my time up in Westchester. I needed somewhere close to everywhere in Manhattan after the wedding for my family and I ( including 3 children). Saw this hotel on the Lonely Planet guide for New York as a good budget hotel. Checked it out again on Trip Advisor, and decided I had seen enough to go ahead and book. The only negative I had about the whole experience was the fact that I couldn't book for 5 on the internet website. I sent a quick mail to them, and they said, don't worry about it, book for 4 and send us a note. Therefore negative becomes positive as staff were helpful and my worries were dealt with. We then arrived at the hotel on the Sunday evening, Sept 25th. The staff welcomed us. The glass panels at reception look daunting, but at least they are safety conscious. The rooms are fairly basic, but had everything we needed. TV for the kids in the evening time when we were exhausted after lots of shopping and sightseeing, bathroom, beds were fine and AC. The pictures on the website do not give this hotel's location enough credit. You are about 1 minutes walk from the Empire State Building. Macy's, Madisson Square Garden etc are right beside you. Brilliant. I just want to finish up by complementing the staff, even though it will not be enough of a complement. On our last day, I think check out time is 12 noon. My shopaholic other half decided she wanted one last look and spend in Macys before we headed home. All went well except she had to go back to another department to get a tag to scan an item she was buying. Whislt heading to the department, she started looking at more items, got lost, and I couldn't find her and my daughter and son. My daughter and I walked around and couldn't find them. I couldn't believe there was no PA system, so I didn't find them until 1pm. I went back to the hotel, apologised for the late check out. They could not have been kinder as they realised I had got a shock. \"Take your time\" was the answer I was give. Wonderful, at a brilliant price for Manhattan. Stay there if you are on a budget, want to be treated with respect, and are looking for prime location.

We were thrilled to find that Herald Square Hotel is the real deal -- our rooms were immaculately clean, smelled fresh (it's a no smoking hotel!), and the beds were as comfortable as the heavenly beds so widely touted by the Westin chain. We had beautiful clean white sheets and overstuffed down comforters in our rooms and had the best nights' sleep I've ever gotten in NYC. The location is great, we felt safe and comfortable, and it was just like having our own little haven in the middle of the city. It's not luxurious or decadent, but I've paid three times that much for a room not much better. I can't recommend it highly enough, what a great find!

I was nervous as heck, not sure what we were getting into. My advice: Read all the reviews on here carefully and they will tell you pretty much everything you need to know about it. If you are considering a budget hotel, then this is an excellent choice for you. As mentioned in many reviews, the location is perfect for first time visitors who want to see it all in a few days. Main subway line is very close. (ps: I found a site online where you can enter your starting point and destination, and it will tell you exactly what subway line to take, and where to get off. It saved us tons of time. I highly recommend you do it before you go if it is your first time. We would have been a mess without it. I just printed them out and carried them with us.) Anyway, we were there to see the parade, etc over Thanksgiving, so with Macy's being so close it was perfect. There is adequate food close by, but no exceptional restaurants. But that's what cabs are for! There is a d. donuts right down the street, and a great 24 hr. bodega with groceries and hot breakfast/lunch/dinner right across 5th. ave. The staff is courteous, not overly friendly but never rude. I checked on our reservations twice before arriving and we checked-in in a very short time with no problems. We had a room with private bathroom. The rooms are very small but well cleaned every night. The bed is adequately comfortable. Bathroom is tiny but clean. I also used one of the common bathroom/showers down the hall a couple of times, and they were clean. They are bigger and have more shower space than the in-room bathrooms. I never saw anyone else use them over the 5 days we were there. Do not stay here if you want a classic NYC skyline view out the window, as there really isn't any. But again, it's a budget hotel, and great if you are just needing a place to shower/sleep. Internet access in the lobby is handy (cost a few $$) There is a very authentic Irish pub on 31st right across Broadway--great food, cold beer, and very friendly wait staff. We walked to Times Square a couple of times (with a 5 yr old child.) The neighborhood just south on Broadway is a little rough, but there's no reason to walk that way anyway. Overall, I highly recommend and would stay again if on a budget. Thanks NYC for a great trip. I was pleasantly surprised at the friendliness of the city.

The front desk gave us directions to one that was about 6 mins away, but when we got there - it was closed, even though they should have been open for 2 hours already.

Actually this was not our first choice for a hotel (it wasn't even suggested by the travel agent or in any travel info we had received), but since almost everything else was booked for this time of year we booked it as soon as we located it on the internet. We were afraid that only paying $189.00/night we would end up being in a less than desirable hotel, but this was not the case at all. Our room was a perfect size for the four of us and all our luggage and shopping bags. The bathroom was just a good size but it was without a vanity so there was no place to keep our toiletries. This will definitely be the place to stay for us when we are lucky enough to return to NYC. Very friendly staff (so friendly we treated them with candy from home each day), awesome beds - so comfy we didn't want to get up mornings, lots of clean towels and hot water too.

We didn't get to watch much TV but loved being able to check the weather station each morning when getting ready. There was even a safe available in each room. The elevators were a tad slow but we spent our time browsing the huge assortment of tourist brochures they had available. We also appreciated the small lounge area with telephones and internet hook up. We took advantage of the lockers for our luggage since we arrived at 7am on a Sunday morning. The staff helped us lock up our luggage until later in the day when our room was available. We loved being around the corner from Macy's and the Manhattan Mall. We walked almost everywhere we wanted to go (Times Square, Rockefeller Centre, 5th Avenue, etc.) but after leaving the Broadway shows at night we easily caught a cab for only $2 each (including the tip).

As I tried to sleep again I noticed an even louder buzzing, like I had my head on top of a Boeing 747. I wondered if maybe I was sleeping on top of some kind of generator room. It turned out that the street light of the hotel was attached to the wall right outside our front window. The humming and buzzing were so loud, I swear I could feel the walls vibrate. Of course the light was shining in our room from the sign. All it needed was to be blinking to give us that seedy hotel room from a 50's B movie affect.

Why the guests had to bang on the door I'll never know. A knock would have sufficed - it's not like no one in the room would hear since it's about the size of a closet. But bang away they did, each guest as they showed up through the hour. Clanging beer bottled and loud talking about who threw up in the limo and who was gonna punch who out....it was at this point I plugged my ears with tissue.

After the party wound down, I FINALLY fell asleep again only to be woken up at around 5AM by the sound of the heat being turned on for some inexplicable reason. I could hear all the radiators throught the building clanging and banging as they were turned on, which made no sense since it was about 65 degrees outside.

I arrived expecting to find a small but comfortable and clean room. This is exactly what I found, and then some. The room was extremely clean, had a safe in the room, and was very quiet. The staff at the front desk is very nice, and helpfull, and even allowed me check in at 10am, 5 hours before regular check in, at no additional charge( I wouldn't expect this all the time, but I guess I got lucky and they had my room ready early). The location of the hotel is great, and close to everything you need. Several subway stations are within walking distance, as is the HUGE Macy's. One of the highlights to any of my trips to New York is a venture to the top of the Empire State Building, and you guessed it, it's only a stones throw away!. Literally about a 3-4 minute walk. Lot's of pizza joints all over, as well as some decent Bars/Pubs. Several deli type stores dot the corners and are along the streets, with a great selection of drinks, and things to snack on. There is also a Dwayne Reed Pharmacy about a block and a half away. You are also right in the heart of what i am now calling \"Little Korea\", so if you enjoy Korean food, you're in big time luck. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant on site, which many people might find a bad thing, but really people, YOU'RE in NYC!! get out and find some of the great food they have there. The bottom line is this. If you are someone that needs to be pampered, and waited on hand and foot, then this hotel *might not* be for you. If you are looking for a cheap, and clean room in the middle of everything, this hotel is definatly for you. This hotel doesn't offer all the amenities that other ones do, like shampoo and a toothbrush, but honestly, who doesn't travel with these things? I will definitely be staying here again and again.

The late-night desk clerk gets extra points -- we were starving after a night out and I vexed him for any names of all-night food places that deliver. He tried very hard to find the list that the day clerks keep, couldn't find it but looked up an all night pizza place for me in the phone book. (OK, Pizza Hut, but he tried).

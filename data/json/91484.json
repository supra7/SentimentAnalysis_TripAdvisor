We had a toilet back up in another room and it took 4 trips to the front desk (which we couldn't call because phone in room didn't work) to get it semi-cleaned up. The heating and air was turned off for the night due to a water leak. And for those that don't stay...The bottom of the \"kiddie\" pool is covered with brown stains. The sitting area smells like urine and the upstairs snack area was extremely hot. The upside to our experience was the staff was very courteous and we were given free breakfast buffet for the heat and air being turned off. Although be warned. Toast will cost you extra!

We have brought our children here since they opened the Cove a few times. The hotel is maintained and clean, the cove is well staffed w/ lifeguards and plenty of fun facilities w/ the kids. You can get a waterpark package through the hotel w/ 4 wristbands per day, extra's will cost you $15. They now allow outside use of the park, which is kind of a downside, people can buy day passes that aren't hotel guests. The rooms are well kept and clean, there are not fridges or microwaves in the rooms. If you have not stayed here this hotel is built around an indoor atrium that has the pool, spa, pool tables, putt putt, bar/snack bar, and common seating areas. The balconies overlook the atrium which is the or should I say was the plus side to stay here. Now the Are you serious......they close the pool area down at 11p on weekends which I understand due to noise, however they now say the entire atrium is closed at 11p which means the common areas adults were \"ran out of\" from this older lady who had an authority complex. Grown adults were playing cards and were told they had to leave,. My husband was told he couldn't sit there w/ his computer he had to \"go to his room\". Are you serious? We have never experienced this in the past, It was like camp \"lights out at 11p\". Not only did Ms, Authority complex run ADULTS off from the atrium area, she wouldn't allow you to walk thru it to other locations to the hotel. THEN, she came through and started telling people they were not allowed to sit on their balconies? ARE YOU SERIOUS? I paid GOOD $$$$$ to stay here and now I am being dictated to were I can go in the hotel and I can't sit on my balcony? Not only was this ridiculous but the woman was rude, overbearing, and needed an attitude adjustment. Needless to say, we will NOT go back.

The first year we stayed was not bad, but the last two years have just been awful! Our main attraction to this Hotel is the indoor waterpark for the kids, but this year that wasn't even enjoyable! The lifegaurds were NOT doing there job as kids were out of control! Many children were jumping from the edge of the lazy river onto the tubes and one child nearly smacked his head on the fake rocks around the river. I told the kids to stop, but they did not listen to me. I told the lifegaurds what was going on and they told me there was not much that they could do about it! Seriously!?!? Try kicking them out of the park if they can't follow the rules. This is what most reputable water parks do! Also, the water was very cold in all places except for the lazy river. Now let's move on to the rooms. We were given a room with two full sized beds, a small very outdated television, and no refridgerator. When going to get ice to put our drinks on, the ice machine wouldn't work. Our room didn't even have a toilet paper holder! The rooms did seem as clean as the cleaning staff could probably get them, but they still looked dirty due to how outdated everything was. When we finally decided to lay down in bed and watch a little tv, we discovered that our beds were as hard as rocks! When trying to rent a movie for our girls we discovered that our small TV's movie channels were not working. We called the front desk and they said they'd send someone up. When the they got there about 15 minutes later they informed us that the whole system was down. So great, nothing to help our children doze off to sleep in an unfamiliar place. Then when we finally decided to try to go to sleep, that's when the partying started. It literally sounded as though they were having a party right outside of our room. I tossed and turned until 1:30 AM until I finally decided that something had to be done. I contacted security who said they would be up to take care of the problem. There was only two more episodes of noise after this, but I ultimately didn't get to sleep until 2:30 AM.

Very frustrating. We were told we could not use the waterpark early either even though I had been told we could. The guys who answered the phone was confused as to why I was even calling so I explained what I had been told. We then were told if we wanted to we could pick up our zoo tickets but we had plans to do that the following day, So we looked up parks in the area to take our 6, 4, and 2 year old to to pass the time until they would let us use the hotel. I informed the front desk that I was given the wrong info over the phone and my husband also did the same when checking in. They barely apologized acting like it was not big deal. (I bet they would feel differently if they were trying to entertain 3 kids aged 6 and under) They did tell us that we were probably given the wrong information because their rules are different over spring break then during the rest of the year. Then their staff should be trained to give the correct information! The second big negative for our family was the water park was freezing! They keep the doors open to the waterpark area and the first section is the little kids section. All three of my kids had a blast but after 2 hours my 2 year olds teeth were chattering and my husband and I were so cold even though we were chasing after 3 children. If you are going to the waterpark take your own towels. The towels they provide are the size of a hand towel. My husband and I both agreed that when we were by the slides with one of our older two we were not cold but whoever stayed with our 2 year old was freezing. Another thing that annoyed me was that our heavy curtain in our room would not close only the sheer curtain so all night we had the city lights shinning through our room. I had a friend who used this hotel and her curtains shut so it must be a room to room deal. The room was clean but you can tell this is an older hotel. They provide Bath and Body soaps and lotions. There is not a small refrigerator in your room so bring a cooler with your kids needs and yours too. Kids eat for free but this is only because the adults meals are so expensive you wont want to eat at the hotel. There are plenty of choices right around the hotel to choose from. There is not a complimentary breakfast. So to sum this up: over spring break you can not check into your room until 4 but you are allowed to pick up your zoo or museum tickets early the day you check in. Bring your own towels to the water park and be prepared to be cold. The kids will love it and be wipped out and mom and dad too. Plan to eat elsewhere. I would not stay here unless you plan to take kids to the waterpark. I would possibly come back but only because the kids had so much fun.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cNot bad at all.

First, if you have an expectation that you are going to be at a quiet, well-appointed four star hotel, please stop trying to deceive yourself. Unless you paid for a waterpark package, you priceline'd this property or you did not know that this was essentially a resort property. Yes, you will hear kids running. Yes, it is older. No, the rooms are not dilapidated (mostly) No, I did not feel as if I would encounter a contagious disease. Pros: Trey, and the rest of the front desk staff were OUTSTANDING. They were friendly, cognizant of Priority Club status, and willing to work with people. They exhibited qualities that were representative of the best of the best I have encountered. I got a great night's sleep. If you are a light sleeper, other properties close to 465 will wake you up due to road noise, so you should expect kids' noise. Otherwise, the beds were comfortable, equipped with an appropriate amount of pillows that varied in density. The Internet was fast, and free. In terms of noise, it is an old Holidome-design, Embassy suites' due to their predominant design, will also promote the kind of noise engendered by this design. That being said, the waterpark is relatively separate from the rest of the building and closes at 10:00. CONS: The hotel, though I got a good night's sleep was in DESPERATE need of a makeover. The hotel directory listed Pan-AM, TWA, and ATA as airlines. Come on, I can understand ATA, maybe even TWA (Their operating certificate was merged into American's in 2001), but Pan AM? Update your directory. The hotel's restaurant offered 'kids eat free' promotions. THEY OVERCHARGED US. The bill already included gratuity: 12.00 ON A 28.00 BILL. Then, they decided to add an extra $6.00. The hotel offered no apology, no compensation, nothing to smooth things over. The poor experience soured my experience at the hotel unfortunately, but it is endemic of poor-quality establishments. Trey, the host at the desk was apologetic, but the food and service manager accused me of being insubordinate and raising my voice; neither of which occured. Because of that, I cannot recommend this hotel, unfortunately.

I didn't with this one and have learned my lesson. We arrived around 7P on a Friday evening. We were in a bit of a hurry as the main attraction for this place is the waterpark and it closed at 10P. I left my family in the car while I ran in to check-in. The staff at the desk was very friendly, but couldn't find my reservation. In my haste, I didn't have the confirmation number on me. Instead of offering us available rooms, the clerk directed me to search for my confirmation on a computer in their business center. I looked, but to no avail. I searched the hotel's website and found that rooms were available. My wife had parked and come in at this point. She reminded me that we actually had called and reserved the room over the phone (remember that?). I returned to the front desk to make mention of this remembrance and also seek out the available rooms. He offered us a rate $30 higher than what we had just viewed on the website, saying that it was the best he could do. I countered with our website findings, only to be told that I was probably looking at rooms for the night before. How do you even do that? I returned to the computer to reserve the cheaper (read: same) room. It's funny that our reservation misplaced, while another reviewer had an experience where the hotel rep actually cancelled someone else's reservation. Strange. We found the room to be typical for these properties that are 30+ years old. Holiday Inns in general were classy in the 80s, but certainly need some updates. This place was no different. I didn't find the room to be completely disgusting, just old. The waterpark is much newer than the hotel, but it's hard to tell. It already looks very worn and in need of paint, caulk, etc. With a 3-year-old in tow, we naturally headed toward the shallow water of the \"bucket\" climbing structure and pool. We were greeted with a torn up pool bottom near a climbing crab that is so loose, it looks like seaweed as it floats atop the surface. Oh, we were also greeted by frightfully chilly water. While I'm typically a little cold while swimming, this water was downright frigid. I wanted to know that actual temperature, but could only guess it was the low 60s. I witnessed several families having the same experience. My wife asked a lifeguard; she stated that it was too cold and something was wrong with it. I asked another lifeguard, one who was a supervisor. He was flanked by two additional lifeguards who each looked at him upon my question like I had just asked about a missing person that they knew was buried in their backyard. It was obviously that it was an issue and I wasn't the first to inquire. He responded by telling me that they had to replace the water that had been splashed out and the heater hadn't caught up yet. I hardly believed that since the temperature felt 15 - 20 degrees off, not 4 or 5. I followed by asking that by the next day the temperature should be corrected. He, of course, said yes. Ironically, another reviewer from back in June had the same issue. He specifically stated that the kiddie pool was freezing. Strange. We're like most on here. We were seeking a nice getaway for our family and this seemed like a good bet. In the end, we paid nearly $200 for a rundown room and a rag-tag waterpark whose water temperature resembled actually swimming outside on a nearly-November day in Indiana.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThis Place is a Priceline DUMP Hotel\u201d", "Author": "defore4735", "ReviewID": "UR85273720", "Content": "Just like many Priceline deals you may search for, sometimes you get coal.

Rooms are comfortable. Staff in the hotel, nice -mostly helpful. The indoor waterpark, The Caribbean Cove, is another story all together. We visited on a Friday/Saturday in winter - so it was particularly crowded. And given such a large crowd of people, there is very little staff/life guard supervision. At the entrance, it is posted that anyone visiting the waterpark is to have a wristband, however, no one checks the wristbands. Anyone can walk into the waterpark area. It also states that children under 12 are to be accompanied by parents. No one checks if a child is accompanied. It truly is a very chaotic atmosphere. Our son stayed in and by our grand children the entire time they were in the water, however, even his presence couldn't stop the rough housing by older children. (All ages of children are allowed in the same areas). Life guards do walk the pool areas, however, they appeared to ignore much of the rough housing. Our 3 year old grand child was \"tackled\" by two 12 (ish) year olds rough housing, and his left leg was injured. We went immediately to find first aid. The first aid we found amounted to a young lady that was able only to take an accident report and give us directions to a local hospital. A visit to the ER ended with my grandson in a cast from the top of his knee to his toes. We understand that accidents happen, but they happen more often when you have a lack of professional supervision, a lack of trained emergency staff, and particularly the uncaring attitude by some of the staff that we observed at the Caribbean Cove waterpark. It would be my opinion that if you are going to operate such a facility you would want your visitors to feel comfortable that their safety while visiting is paramount. You will not get that warm fuzzy here. We called to follow-up on the accident report that had been filed. We told the young man that our grandson had suffered a leg fracture, and that we wanted that added to the report. His response, \"is that ALL you wanted?\", and he hung up.

One - The Holidome pool was freezing. Entirely too cold to put a small child in it. Even the older teenagers were complaining that it was too cold. Two - The overnight staff. At approximately midnight, one of my children became sick in the room. All of it was contained on the bedding so I stripped the bed down and called the front desk to ask for replacement linens.

Since that wasn't good enough for me, I rolled all of the soiled linens up and threw them in the hallway next to our door. I then wandered around the hotel until I found the laundry area. There was a woman in there that didn't speak any English, but was more than willing to give me whatever I wanted. She basically pointed to the shelves of sheets and linens and let me take what I wanted. She also got me some new blankets and pillows.

So between check-in, waterpark, showers, and dinner, I was paying $230 to use the park for a grand total of 3 hours.

The rooms were clean and tidy. We had to call maintence to replace the light above the bathroom sink, and to try and fix the sliding patio door (the door was really hard to open) and the toilet got clogged. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. There is always someone from housekeeping coming around the atrium area and water park picking up dirty towels and bringing out clean towels. The water park has a policy that all children that are not potty trained must wear swim diapers. I saw one child who I don't think was potty trained, without a swim diaper, only in training pants. A short time later, they had to close down the zero depth pool, because someone had lost some fecal matter in the water. Was it that baby with only the training pants on? That is what the swim diapers are for!! The kids were having fun in the water park, so we decided to eat dinner in the Cafe St. Paul restaurant in the hotel. We ate the dinner buffet.

We had a king size bed and a sofa bed. The room also had a desk, chair, coffee table, dresser and spacious bathroom. There was room for all 5 of us. I reserved the room because of the Caribbean Cove Waterpark. However, I was pleasantly surprised with everything else the hotel offered. The hotel was sold out that night. Even so, the waterpark and holidome pool never felt too busy or overcrowded. I didn't experience any problems checking in or out. The girls enjoyed playing billiards (pool), ping pong, miniature golf (small course, but still entertained them), and foosball as well as swimming in the holidome area. A game of pool and foosball costs 50 cents each, not a big deal to me. The other games were complimentary. We were given KIDS EAT FREE coupons upon check in, so we all had pizza or breadsticks and a drink for $8.00 TOTAL on Friday night for a snack. Not too bad as far as I'm concerned. The Kids Club also offered a movie night that I observed younger kids enjoying outside of the pool area in the holidome. In the morning, the Kids Club offered free milk and donuts, and the hostess also provided us with a picture of the girls as a souvenir. The waterpark was fun for all of us. The slides were fun, the \"lazy river\" was enjoyable, and we had a blast shooting hoops in the pool w/basketball goals on tall wooden stilts. There is also a Chuck E. Cheese-like arcade on the 3rd floor of the waterpark. The girls were able to redeem their tickets for prizes there. All of the games I observed were 1-2 tokens like at all the other arcades I've been. For the entire experience, I spent approximately approximately $260.00 (I could have spent less, but I had fun giving the girls money in the arcade), and I was pleased with what a great time we had. The room was clean, the front desk was quick and efficient--even w/a packed house, no long lines for us. The staff was friendly and helpful. One thing to note, (which is not an issue for me at all, but I want to be thorough) I found were some of the male, teenage staff members at the prize desk by the arcade were more interested in talking to one another than initially waiting on the girls, but one of the male staff members stepped forward and took care of them w/o any attitude or problems. (I mean honestly, how many of us would want to work a prize desk at Chuck E Cheese or Caribbean Cove??). One thing to note is the lifeguards routinely have a drill (once in the evening and once at 1 PM the following day while we were there) in which they clear the pool and simulate a rescue. This took most people off guard at first, but I will admit if I had read the disclaimer upon walking into Caribbean Cove, I would have known it was coming. The only negative I did find was the side doors were unlocked as some other reviews mentioned. This is definitely a security concern, and the only reason I didn't rate the experience higher than a 4.. We didn't have any problems and I felt safe while staying there (and I was probably the only one walking in and out taking stuff to the car), but I would like to see at least a pad in which a room key could be swiped to gain entry into side doors like I've seen at most other large hotels I have stayed.

It was part of a package, but our room bill showed we paid only $43 per night for the hotel. Certainly worth that, especially with the free breakfast buffet they gave us for joining the HI club, but this is not the greatest hotel on earth. Do not stay here on a weekend if you don't have/adore kids. The lobby area was surprisingly nice, well decorated and themed in sort of a New Orleans street scene style. There are four restaurants here (!), which I would never expect at a Holiday Inn. We had an executive level room facing the indoor pool area. The room itself was nice, large enough with a decent bathroom and excellent water pressure in the shower. The ceilings are unusually low, but this was not a big deal. The problem with this hotel - the atrium design of the hotel ensures that the kids playing and screaming in the pool area create tremendous amounts of noise. If you need quiet to sleep prior to 11pm, do not stay in an atrium-facing room. The attached water park has what is essentially a runway linking it to the indoor hotel pool, and there was constant activity there and on the elevators - dripping, rambunctious kiddos with run-of-the-house priveleges running wild all over the place. Fun for them. The breakfast buffet was good for the price (free) and the sports bar had a decent beer list. Our final bill showed we were charged for our free breakfast (how, I don't know, since we never got a bill at the restaurant) and the desk clerk gave us a little attitude (\"can you prove you had the free breakfast coupons?\") but ultimately took the charge off our bill. The evening clerk made copies for us for free instead of sending us to Kinkos, which was nice. There is free internet in the lobby business center, which is supposed to be for 18yr olds and up, but there were plenty of kids checking out MySpace and whatever at all hours. Overall, a decent hotel for the price, and seems ideal if you have a pack of kids to keep entertained. I can't speak to the cleanliness of the water park as others have mentioned, but the kids we saw seemed genuinely thrilled to be there.

Front desk gave me my request, for a top floor holidome balcony room. I was told the room was freshly renovated the month before. They also gave me several coupons for free kids meals at all of their restaurants and snack bars, provided one adult meal is purchased. We went up to the room, changed into our suits for the waterpark. We enjoyed the waterpark for about two hours before we stopped for dinner. We ate at Cafe St. Paul's dinner buffet. Two adults were $12 total. All of the kids ate free. About an hour after dinner, our 9 year old got very ill. He threw up all over the bathroom. He ate a dessert cheescake that the rest of us did not eat. He spent 2 hours puking, then he was fine. I called the front desk at 9:30pm to ask for housekeeping to come and clean up the mess. No one answered. I left my spouse with the kids, went all the way down to the front desk to tell them what happened. The woman said she would give housekeeping a call. She also offered to switch us to a different room for the night. I went back to the room, and started packing. The other 3 children were asleep at this point. The housekeeping man showed up shocked that no one told him what he was cleaning up. He left and said he would be back. He came back, did an okay job cleaning. He never even replaced the shower curtain. Really gross. I went back down to the front desk to get a luggage cart and our new room keys. A different lady was at the front desk. She was very rude in her manner and out right told me that there were no rooms to give out, that they were sold out. She scolded the employee who told me that before, in front of me and other staff people. We had to leave our room door and balcony door open for another 2 hours to air out the air freshner smell. Husband took 9 year old home....then to doctor the next morning. Food poisoning was confirmed. Myself and the other 3 played in the water park most of the morning, then had lunch and went home. Our newly remodeled room was a dirty mess. There were sticky finger prints on the mirrors and doors. There were gummy bears all over the carpet, stains on one of the bedsheets. The bathroom could use a string pulley to hang wet bathing suits over the tub. When the bill was placed under our door at 4am, the person knocked waking us up! Someone had also charged a $40 meal to our room. It took 30 minutes of arguing on the room phone with the hotel operator that it was not us. She finally removed the charge, but was unhappy that we didn't want to pay for someone else's meal. Next time I think we'll give into Chuck E Cheese's instead.

With the extra special water park amenity it\u2019s a good getaway for families with young children and maybe good for teens, but the novelty wears off quickly for them. This is a solid Holiday Inn property. It delivers the quality one would expect for a HI: nice rooms and amenities but no extra special levels of service, hospitality, amenities or d\u00e9cor. There are four and five stories, depending where in the property you stay, and the hotel rooms are arranged in a horseshoe pattern around the original Holidome pool area. There are exterior rooms and interior rooms facing the pool. As far as I could tell the interior rooms are larger and have two double beds. \u201cLarger\u201d is a relative term. It was cozy for our family of two adults and two teenagers. The exterior rooms are smaller and only have room for a single king bed as well as a reclining easy chair and a desk. (There are a handful of outside corner rooms that are appear to be the biggest. I don\u2019t know what kinds of beds are in these.) Clothing storage includes dressers and a small alcove for Bathrooms were clean with white tile floors, hair dryers with integrated night light and coffee makers. The bath towels were thick and absorbent. The mattresses were fair but one in our room seemed to be coming to the end of its serviceable life. The four rooms I saw had wired Internet access, which is free. Ethernet cables are available from the front desk. Wireless access is available in the lobby and the Holidome. We stayed at this hotel for five days during the Easter break period. As you could guess there were lots of kids. Lots of kids. Children in bathing suits were all over the grounds despite the early spring weather: in the lobby, in the halls, and of course around the pool and water park. Appropriate to the season, there was lots of running in the hall, easily heard in our room, slamming doors and lots of loud talking the hall from both kids and parents. The ruckus quiets down quickly once the water park closes, which is 10 pm most days and 11 pm Friday and Saturday. The Holidome is a largish atrium and offers an indoor pool, as you would expect, but also offers, apparently, a staffed kids\u2019 program with crafts. Inquire with the hotel for more details. There are also pool tables, one foosball table, one ping pong table, available for use with a fee. Family-friendly food is immediately available in the Holidome, including local chain Noble Roman\u2019s pizza. You can eat your pizza, ice cream and soda in front of a wide screen TV. (The interior rooms facing the pool are probably noisy when the pool is busy. The exception may be the ones way off in the corners, like we had. While our view was obstructed and the light was dim it was also much quieter. You have been warned.) And now to the main attraction, Caribbean Cove, the indoor water park. It\u2019s impressive, with three slides accessed from one interior platform. Kids climb stairs up three or four stories and choose one of three slides. One is large enough for innertubes (provided) \u2013 the other two slides are completely enclosed until you exit down below. There are three other pool areas with imaginative large interactive water spouts and fountains. The release I signed pledged me or another adult to supervise my children at all times, but several attentive lifeguards also staff the water park. Breaks are enforced every two hours. There is a third floor observation deck from which parents, relatives and others can see the park without paying for admission. There are a snack bar, a souvenir stand and a games arcade on that same observation deck. There\u2019s also a souvenir stand on the first floor. We paid $269, plus taxes, for our daily Caribbean Cove package. That included the room and five wrist bands granting us admission to the park. The write bands will grant you admission on the day you check in and also the next day up until 3 pm. Note, however, that check-out is 11 am. There are dressing rooms in Caribbean Cove, but I don\u2019t know how extensive they are. Was it worth it? Our younger, more innocent cousins would have played until they dropped. I think they played for a couple of hours on each of three days and played until they were exhausted. My older kids (16 and a worldly 13), however, had had plenty after two days, at about two hours each day. One can book part of a stay with the package and the rest of a stay without the package, as we did. We did have to do some silliness about checking out and checking back in when our rate changed. Finding food is not a problem at this hotel. Besides the poolside options there are three other restaurants at different price levels in the hotel. Within walking distance are a popular Texas Roadhouse and a Ruby Tuesday. Across the busy expressway are a Chinese restaurant (pretty good by Indy standards) and Bob Evans and Cracker Barrel restaurants. And a half mile away are more fast food places. If you like to eat large there\u2019s a Costco within that same half mile. There are self-serve laundry facilities in the hotel. This consists of two stacked washer-dryer combos in an alcove off the second floor hallway. The washers are front-loading. While clean and effective, folding is a problem because there is no table or counter on which put your clean clothes. As a place to stay, sleep and eat there are better, quieter and less expensive options in the north west and north east areas of Indianapolis. However, under the right situation a trip to the Holiday Inn Caribbean Cove might be just the ticket for a very memorable family weekend getaway.

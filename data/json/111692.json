We stayed in the rooms above the parking structure. This is an older part of the hotel so the rooms are on the small side. There is no desk in the room so I had to use what space there was on the dresser for my lap top. The in room safe is large enough to fit a laptop. My major complaints are with the bathroom; the mechanism for the shower drain was out and lying on the side of the tub. It was impossible to control the temperature of the shower. It when from cold to hot. I had to step out of the way and wait for the water to get in a temperate zone and then jump out again when the temperature changed. I would not recommend staying here if you like to go to sleep before12 am or sleep past 6 am. Even if people are outside speaking in a normal tone you can hear them as if they were in the room but this is Vegas Baby and many of the other guests were drunk and loud. What I did like about this hotel? The staff at the hotel were all nice and pleasant. The price thru Expedia was good. It\u2019s located on Freemont Street which is where I prefer to gamble. We went to the NASCAR race and it was easy to get to Las Vegas Blvd and get to and from the race track. The queen beds were comfortable. Would I stay here again? Yes but I would check the other hotels on Freemont Street first. By the way they did have $3 double deck Blackjack and the slots seemed loose than the rest of Freemont Street.

I flew at the last minute on Allegiant air and booked a package and stayed at the El Cortez. I chose this hotel because of the price and location and the rooms looked good on the website. I stayed in a tower room and I was really pleased with the room. It was huge with a king size bed, lots of dressers, a sitting area with coffee table and love seat and a huge window overlooking north Vegas. There was a coffee maker in the room which was a nice touch. Stayed at Harrahs last time and although the room was nice, there was no coffee maker and it cost $5+ to get a coffee in the lobby at Starbucks. The hotel is old and if you're coming to gamble, they advertise that their slots are 30% looser. I liked the location at the east end of Freemont St. It's only a few steps to the lively nightlife under the canopy. The food was fantastic in the coffee shop. I didn't eat in the dining room but other guests told me it was really good. There's free parking attached to the hotel which was great because I rented a Piaggio Scooter (400ccs). I toured around Vegas and left the city for the short ride to Red Rock Canyon. It was a beautiful ride and a must see for anyone who visits the area. Super scenery. Next time I plan to go to the Hoover Dam or the Valley of Fire. Las Vegas area is made for bikers. Good highways and I found it easy to get around. Even had fun driving down the strip on Las Vegas Blvd. As part of my stay, I was offered an entry into their free slot tournament and I placed third and won $100! Canadians be warned, they took 30% off the top because I didn't have a foreign tax number. If you ever won a jackpot and had to apply for a tax rebate, bring along your tax number and they will give you the full winnings. One day I walked south to the Strip and although I'm a very slow walker it only took me about 2 hours and it was interesting. You could easily do it in just over an hour if you are a \"normal\" speed walker. I would definitely stay at the El Cortez again and I would reccommend it to others.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corpus Christi", "Title": "\u201cAnother Great Stay At The El Cortez!\u201d", "Author": "persians2", "ReviewID": "UR125613227", "Content": "Another trip to the El Cortez! Was hoping it would be as great as the last time (in September 2011), and we were NOT disappointed. This time we arrived early on Valentines Day and stayed a week. We got the same tower room we had last time, on the top floor, with a fabulous view of the strip and the mountains. We had a very romantic Valentines dinner at The Flame in the Cortez. A wonderful place. Low lighting, piano music, live, the whole time during dinner. A lovely rose for the ladies. Wonderful food. We spent 3 hours on this wonderful meal, killing a large bottle of wine in the process.Wonderful, vintage old Vegas! Full, and mellow we turned in early. I highly recommend the tower rooms. They are large with a super comfy sitting area with a great view. We have stayed in just about every hotel and resort in Vegas, on the strip and downtown, and we love the Cortez the best. Prices are right, the gambling is fabulous (especially the blackjack) and the comps seem to come easily. We ate almost free the whole time we were there. In addition to The Flame, they have the Cafe, and it has just as fabulous food as the Flame. I highly recommend the Cortez. One of the few hotels in Vegas with a FREE town car drive to the airport, and coffee pots in the room! One of my pet peeves in Vegas is no coffe pots in the rooms in 95% of the hotels. Have to either way overpriced room service coffee, which arrives cold, or get dressed and go in search of $4 a cup coffee. Not at The El Cortez. You can get up in the AM and enjoy hot coffee in great sitting area. One other little thing I want to throw in...be sure and eat the buffet at Main Street Station.

This is also the second time that we stayed in the Cabana rooms across the street. Now while I will agree that the colors are a bit funky, I don't find them so disturbing that I would not stay again. And since this building is \"across the street\" from the main building, I appreciate the fact they have a security guard and restricted key access to the building. Why do some people say that is \"shady\" or a \"sketchy part of town\"??? We have walked back to our room at all hours of the night both through the main El Cortez building and via the side streets around it and have not ever had a problem or even felt like we would but to each his own. For the rates that you can get for staying here we feel that it is well worth it. The hotel itself and casino is not part of the Fremont Experience and is just a couple of blocks outside if the main area. For ourselves, we like winding down with a quick walk back to the hotel after being in the main Fremont area. The room we had again was in the Cabana building across the street and it was clean and comfortable and was a good value for the price paid. We asked for an extra pillow and got it promptly even though it was late at night. On the days that we wanted housekeeping service they came in and did a great job. Both check-in and check-out was easy, friendly and helpful. We feel the casino here is great. We often use play here at the beginning and end of our days and love the fact that they have great low minimum tables and some really great friendly dealers. We also eat at both the Cafe and the Flame restaurants and find the Cafe to be one of the best values almost anywhere in Vegas. We could get a full plate for breakfast for less than an egg sandwich at Dunkin Donuts.

Since I had to change my clothes and freshen up for a work-related mixer, I had to drag my suitcase into the Ladies Room of the Casino and change in a bathroom stall, putting on my makeup under the fluorescent lights. When I finally got to my Pavilion Room that evening, it was tiny and extremely cold. The outside temperature was in the 30's. I don't know what the temperature in the room was, because the lowest the thermostat goes is 60, and the needle was lower than that. After an hour or so of having the heater on, the temperature in the room got up to about 64 degrees, and even with the heater on all night, it never got above 70 in my room. My feet were extremely cold from the tile in the bathroom/sink area, and there were no extra blankets to be found, so I had to take the very thin blanket off the other bed in my room and put it on the bed I was sleeping on, but I still felt cold all night. I went there with a coworker, and our first impression was that it was smoky and noisy, not only in the casino, but in our non-smoking rooms. The rooms across from us were smoking rooms, and there were ashtrays only a couple of feet from our doors, so smoke still gets into the rooms when you open the doors. The clock in my room wasn't plugged in, and the outlet was behind the headboard, so I couldn't reach it. The water in the shower vacillates between hot and cold, doesn't stay one temperature. But the icing was when the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night--not once, but twice! I've stayed downtown before, and never felt like I was at a motel 6, until I stayed at the El Cortez.

We had always heard good things about the El Cortez and decided that we wanted to check it out for ourselves. After three nights in a smaller bed, we decided that we wanted to get a King Size bed which was available in their Cabana Suites which is located across Ogden Street from the original El Cortez property. Check in was a breeze. Parking for the Cabana Suites is a little confusing. There is a huge parking lot next door to the hotel and I assumed that is where I would park the car. I guess that is for Valet since I could not park there. El Cortez actually has two parking garages, one on the property itself and one across from the Cabana Suites. I parked in the farther garage the first day and then parked in the regular garage after that. The room itself was great. Large and very colorful. Green paint throughout but done very tastefully. A very comfortable bed and a large plasma TV on the wall. The bathroom was laid out a little strange with the toilet being around the corner as you walk in, but the shower was a walk in with a shower-head that was high enough for me and I am 6'3\". Since the Cabana Suites are across from the main property, there was always a security guard on duty making sure only guests were accessing the hotel. I always felt safe walking from the El Cortez to the Fremont Street Experience. We even walked down Ogden all the way from Main Street Station at 3am and I never felt insecure at all. The Fremont Street area is great and the El Cortez is a great place to stay and get a little bit different of a Downtown Vegas feel. I look forward to going back next year and hopefully spending a couple of nights back at the El Cortez.

We basically shower and sleep there, so our needs are easy to meet. When we tried to check into our rooms on a Thursday afternoon, one room was not ready. We were given a few different times the room was going to be ready, and after a couple hours, it finally was. The room I stayed in was the worst of the bunch. It was in the section called the \"vintage rooms\" and there is a reason for that! The list of complaints is long, so bear with me. The room was small, with no desk, fridge, or microwave. The old wood window rattled randomly, so we wedged some toilet paper in it to minimize that vibration noise. The switch on the entrance wall controlled the TV, not a light. The HVAC is noisy, and the exhaust fan are loud enough to have to really raise your voice over. The sink and tub did not drain well, took 15-20 minutes to drain the sink after brushing your teeth. The room had a pedestal sink, a tiny shelf, the back of the toilet and lid to put your toiletries, no vanity top, so you could have a comb, soap and toothbrush/toothpase out, that was about it. The toilet seat had to be held up to use it. The hotel towels are not bath sized, I would call them salon towels, unless you are wrapping one around a small child, it is not an adequate towel. One morning, I was observing how I felt the room had not been cleaned the day before, so I left one lonely piece of toilet paper in the bowl, closed the lid and left. When we came back to the room in the evening, the piece of tp was still there. We went to go back to our room the last night and our room key would not work. It took way too much to convince the front desk person we were booked through that night. It took so long, I had to have a bathroom break. But when I came back, she found the mistake, decided we were ok to stay and renewed our key. The reason I give this hotel two stars despite all the issues: the beds are comfy, the showers are hot and most of the staff are friendly. I really liked the price and it is not far from the Fremont St. Experience. But I doubt I would stay here again.

A birthday present for him. We were going for the car race and thought it would be closer to access a shuttle to the track and I have read positive things on TA about the gaming so thought we would give it a try. I chose a junior cabana suite thinking it would be worth paying a little extra. The decor was modern and funky. Fun to hang out in the room although a little small for a suite. I agree with others on here that the slots appear to be looser than other hotels we have stayed at in recent years and the blackjack pays 3:2 but in our experience quite hard to beat the dealer/house. Most staff in the casino were pleasant but others appeared to be tired and uninterested in their job or the customers in front of them. We found the staff in the Cortez cafe and Flame restaurant were great. It was the hostess in the Flame restaurant that retrieved the information for the shuttle to the race track when we asked at dinner although the bellman and front desk staff had been unable to do so earlier in the day. All staff were very friendly on our visits to both restaurants. The food was exceptional in the Flame restaurant. I would say the lamb chops are a must try as is the scampi and linguini. Meals in the cafe were great and excellent prices and you can use your comp. dollars in both restaurants. There is a walkway from the El Cortez to Freemont that has been refurbished which made it much less scary than I expected. I must admit this was one of my main concerns about staying there was the walk to Freemont at night as it seems a bit out of the way. Looked like a road a less traveled and not so well lit. I am not normally a fussy person or one to complain but this time I felt strongly about the poor housekeeping service and this place being advertised as the only \"boutique hotel\" in the Freemont district. The first morning, inspite of the Do Not Disturb sign posted on the door the maid was trying to enter the door to our room as I was walking out of the bathroom which she apologized for as she looked down at the sign. Thank goodness I was dressed. I assured her we would be leaving soon. Two days later the maid was knocking loudly on the door at 0930 hrs, again I informed her we would soon be leaving soon. I thought Vegas was about staying up late & sleeping in but not here I guess. It appeared the bathroom? or the toilet was being cleaned, we doubt the shower was cleaned, but the water was left running in the toilet on two of the five days. We arrived back about supper time and could only assume it had been running for several hours as it was obvious that the maid arrives fairly early in the morning. So much for water conservation in the desert. Second to our last day we returned that to a poorly made bed, dirty glasses and a dirty coffee cup left on the counter. We wanted to relax and have a drink in our room before heading out and thought a clean glass might be in order, I called down to the front desk who put me through to housekeeping and they said they would send someone up with clean glasses. This person did not arrive so when my husband went out for his cigarette he complained to the woman at the front desk about our disappointment in the poor service and within about 10 minutes the maid was at the door with glasses. By that time he had washed them in the bathroom sink and turned her away in frustration. Too little too late. Boutique hotel maybe but not the service one would expect, Next time I will pay less and return to one of the hotels I have stayed at in the past that have provided much better service for less money. I might return to the El Cortez for dinner and a little slot play but I would not stay there again. There is way too much competition in Vegas these days to not expect decent housekeeping service and clean glasses in your room. By the way very friendly security staff outside the cabana suites building 24/7 which we appreciated as you have to walk outside and cross the street to this building.

The rooms (in the tower) are huge compared to what you get on the strip. The rates are always some of the best on Fremont St. If you want to get even more retro there are the \"Vintage Queen\" rooms from the old casino back when the whole thing was only 2 stories. These are usually a bit cheaper than the tower rooms and as advertised they only have one queen bed in them. Note that there is no elevator to these rooms, the only way to get to them is by the staircase near the front of the casino. Now if that isn't retro I don't know what is! Now realize that the El Cortez is not the strip. If you want glitz, glam and white glove service this is not the place to stay. However, the gambling is great, the drinks are cheap and the restaurants serve up suitable meals. Because it has some of the best gambling in Las Vegas it tends to attract a more, shall we say, \"dedicated\" gambler who come with their social security checks. Don't be alarmed by the amount of people walking around with oxygen tanks! Also, if smoke bothers you this is not the place to be. There is a lingering smell of cigarette smoke that probably dates back to the Rat Pack days! A couple extras. Right across Fremont street in front of the casino are a couple of really good, quite reasonable restaurants. The Kabob Korner has awesome mediterranean food. There is a Cuban restaurant and a take out pizza place where you can get those huge one slice pizza meals. I recommend them all!

I have stayed at almost every hotel/casino in the city so I think I\u2019m a good judge of hotels there. The El Cortez is an excellent budget hotel in downtown Las Vegas. I personally prefer the downtown area because it is less busy and still has all of what makes Las Vegas a great destination. A word of caution before you read too far. If you are the type of person that name brand is important to you and/or you have to stay at a mega resort where you never leave the place to see the real Las Vegas, then read no farther. This is about a place to stay that is the exact opposite. Located on the happening end of \u2018the strip\u2019!! The hotel and casino have been completely remodeled within the last few years. So has the Freemont Street area where the hotel is located. The hotel is not the up-scale experience that many people may want when they travel but is perfect for me. Some things I like about the place are: \u2022 Easy to find \u2013 Since it is away from the congestion of the other hotels the tower is easily visible from a distance. \u2022 Easy and plentiful free parking \u2013 they have two parking garages and one can even park on the street in the area. \u2022 Easy to get in and out of the place \u2013 at the bigger places on the strip one has to wait for lines, wait for traffic, wait, wait, wait. Not at the El Cortez. I can not remember having more than one person ahead of me to check in and check out is always a snap! Leaving the parking garage is also easy, as is getting on the highway to go to the airport. \u2022 Easy to get to rooms - Some rooms are actually located on the top floor of the main parking garage and are super easy to access, no hassle of walking through the casino. Tower rooms have an elevator near the one of the entrance doors, again no need to walk through the casino to get to the room (as is the case in many larger hotels) \u2022 Affordable rooms \u2013 I\u2019ve stayed in most of the categories of rooms (not the suite) and all were clean, secure and comfortable. \u2022 Walking distance to many entertainment and meal options \u2013 I enjoy walking and I do not consider three or four city blocks a long distance. Within that distance, some even closer, there are easily dozens of choices. \u2022 No Resort Fee or other added fees \u2013 The trick of many hotels in Vegas is to quote one rate for a room then when you arrive they add on charges for things that many guests do not use, resort fee, energy surcharge, ect. The place isn\u2019t perfect by any means but a real nice place to stay and see / experience the wonders of Las Vegas, my personal favorite destination in the world!!", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWere pleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "ljbrx", "ReviewID": "UR115874659", "Content": "My brother & I (both in our 50's) were loyal guests of the Sahara for years but were looking for an alternative after I went on the National Bed Bug list and saw reports on the Sahara (may it rest in peace) and came across the El Cortez(EC).

The thing I dont like about the smaller casinos is the smoke, I dont smoke and at times it gets to be to much for me. When this happens I just walk to the old town strip about 2 blocks away and walk around the old original casinos there. If you do want to go to the strip the bus line is a block away and you can ride the whole strip.

The sports book is by far the best spot in town to place bets and to watch the games too. The staff really cares about the casino and its reflected in their service. Frankie you are the best too! Thanks so much for opening the TV room for us for the KU game on Sunday! This TV room has plenty of room for groups of fans and betters, serving $1 draws, snacks, and its non smoking in the room itself. The sports book itself has ample seating compared to most any other books-downtown or the strip. The staff is very complementary, from the bellman, guest services, the wait staff, to the drink girls and generally....the dealers! The Hotel has two dining options, one fine dining, one 24hr place, both real decent..and a Subway too. There a couple of bars. I definitely recommend the video poker machines at the main bar..I won alot on them and there are also 4 TVs right there. They do make good martinis too by the way-good enough to buy (without playing the video games for the free drinks!) The slots are good payouts it seems, there's a whole room of nickel slots in the back of the casino that were constantly busy too. The casino has most of the tables you want too, single deck bj, pai-gow, 3 card poker, baccarat, 2 craps tables ( I don't remember the craps tables ever being $3 tables but they were not ever more than $5) 2 roulette tables (they were hot all weekend which is hard to believe I would think) The crowd there is colorful meaning, locals and downtown employees that get off work and they come to the El Cortez to gamble and unwind! There is plenty of security because the Casino is located a couple of blocks off the main Freemont area, but literally down the street. The location is great since you can get away from noise of the Freemont experience and actually get a good night's sleep-when you finally call it a night, or a day ;D We like to stay in the Cabana Suites directly behind the Casino..its part of El Cortez but its a swanky experience. Wonderful beds and pillows and the building has its own security guard out front and you have a walkway, that traffic stops for you to cross. Its super close, I even saw a guy with a walker going to and fro the casino! You also must use your room key to access the building. Finally, may I also suggest the restaurant directly across the street on Freemont. It's called Mamita's and has Cuban and mexican food, also has music videos playing, its loud but it definitely keeps the patrons entertained!

As far as the casino, Bj pays 3-2 and many tables to choose from. Dealers were reasonably friendly. Fremont seems to have more friendly dealers. I was about to sit at the $25 table that had just one player, as i was about to sit the casino manager told me that it now changing to $100 table. I then had to play at a $5 table since they had no $25 tables open. I did not think that was good customer service. My play at the EC did change from that moment on. I did play a lot at the Fremont as they had a $25 table open. The EC do a great job with the promos. Great players card rewards and free room offers. Also, a great fun book at check in. They do try to get your repeat business. The hotel...I booked rooms in the towers for a stay in Aug and a stay in December, the most recent I was on the 12th floor and was very happy! Didn't have any odors and was clean and had plenty of light. Also had a loveseat by the window overlooking a great view of the strip. Had complimentary newspapers to read with the free coffee they provided. A nice perk! Window in the shower, that was great! High quality towels, not the cheap thin scratchy kind. They are making a good effort to win your loyalty! House keeping was so, so friendly as was the front desk. The beds were very comfortable and clean. Loved the all white bleached bedding! So glad they don't use the gross bed spreads that many hotels still use. Good selection of tv channels and being a couple blocks away from the strip the rooms are quiet. \"No Fremont experience noise\" and no loud pool music noise as they have no pool! Once I returned home, I did call and talk to the front desk manager about a fun book concern and he was very friendly and professional.

The cabana suites are actually across the street from the El Cortez. However, you still must check in at the El Cortez and then haul your stuff across the street. One interesting thing is that the rooms are numbered oddly so make sure you ask where your room is before you take the elevator to the 7th floor because you assumed #705 is up there. The junior cabana is small but nicely furnished and they are very proud of the flat-screen televisions that take up a large chunk of the room - so if you came to vegas to lie in bed watching tv - these are great rooms. Also, a nice touch was the free candy dish in the lobby - they also had a free fruit bowl with apples and bananas. The neighborhood is not for everyone and if you are not comfortable walking amongst street people you should not attempt to stay here. It is a short walk to Fremont street but the security guard warned my wife to hold onto her purse tightly because there are a lot of \"crazy people\" around. There is a nice looking cafe with wireless internet across the street from el Cortez that looks like a great hangout.

Was told by the check in clerk they are a none smoking Hotel. The rooms are terrible the bath tub looked like it was stained into the tub, the casino does not have a good choice of playing machine unless u like poker or 1 cent machines. I was willing to forgive all that until our last day when I tried to get a cup of coffee while at a machine and was told by the waitress \"That is not my section and do not touch me\" all I did was tap her on the shoulder to get her attention. Went and talked to a manager about this and was told by him \"They just woke up and may be a little cranky that's just the way it is\". We spent a lot of money there, we booked through Allegiant's Air. I don't mind the none smoking but let me know before hand and give me the option to get a smoking hotel, I feel like they decieved us to get the business and to make you come down stairs to smoke so you will play the machines, and that is wrong. No place to sit and smoke and it's too hot outside.I give the Sub Shop there a A+ the only good experince I had there the ladies was nice. The food in the Resturant was not good but the service was OK. Oh yes the sink in the bath room made a bubbling sound like waterr draining all night, the air did work and the bed seem clean, the room smelled musty, a little air febreze goes a long way.Bottom line I wa so unhappy. So the El Cortez for me you get an F-- You need to change the way your Hotel is ran, and be honest with people up front, and stop lying to get the business. If the workers don't like their job then GET ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GOOD WITH THE PUBLIC. One other waitress was also rude when I moved to another machine she told me when I tried to get a cup of coffee or some water to take my meds \"I just left there and I have to do my up stairs area\". Well she never came to me and I was sitting and playing at a machine. So I went to the Sub Shop and bought a cup of water to take my meds I am glad I did not have a real bad medical problem because I would have not been able to take my meds. \"Just thought you would like to know how we was treated while we was there.\" I am 59 yrs old and my husband is 60 yrs old and a retiered Air Force serviceman have traveled the world and never seen service like this.

I had a king bed on the 12th floor of the tower - booked through 1800 Hotels.com - 5 nights for \u00a397 which included the 4th July holiday weekend. Large rooms with lots of furniture to stow your things away; writing desk; ample room to stow your luggage; room safe big enough for a 15\" laptop; good sized bathroom; clean, everything worked; nice view. I requested a refridgerator and one was wheeled up within the hour. WiFi was available but not included in the room rate. A flat 24hrs cost $11.99. All the staff were pleasant and friendly... many of them having worked for the hotel a number of years. Clientel tended to be regular locals and predominently 'older', unlike the hoardes of overseas young tourists in the strip hotels. I only once saw children in the casino and they were part of a family heading to the cafe for a meal. I liked that the slots and tables were well spaced in the casino, so there was ample room to move around. The decor was low key unlike the bright glitz and glamour of many strip casinos - so unobtrusive on the eye. Security was ever present and reassuring. The food was good value altough you might on occasion have to wait for it. The $7.95 rib meal offered good value although I couldn't eat it - all the steaks were bought-in pre-rubbed with pepper, and pepper is something I can't stomach. You could use your accumulated points from your casino membership card to pay or part pay for meals, and all new arrivals were given 3 x 50% coupons to use in the cafe. The location was just 2 short blocks aware from the Freemont Experience where it was easy to pick up the Deuce or Ace buses to go up the strip or down to the shopping outlets. Noticed a couple of vagrants in the general area at night but nothing to be afraid of. Just across the street from the casino was a handy convenience store. I couldn't hear any noise from the Freemont Experience at night and enjoyed a comfortable nights sleep every night. I made a point of visiting many of the strip hotel casinos and as a comparison they were very crowded and far noisier. Outside you had crowds on the sidewalk to negotiate. So I was very pleased with my choice of hotel and would stay again. The El Cortez has a lot in its favour and was voted by one of the local magazes as best downtown hotel 2009.

This made me a bit nervous as once you get off the beaten path for tourists, it can get a bit scarey.

We seen a lot of patrols by police officers on bicycles too. As far as the rooms went I booked one of the rooms on second floor above the casino. Believe me, there are no elevators to this floor. We had some heavy luggage when we got there, which was late at midight, and had no problem having the bell hop take our luggage up the steps. The room although small, was very nice. It looked to me as if they were trying to preserve the old Vegas feel with the dark woods and old fashioned look dressers. Everything was clean and neat and nothing seemed in need of repair. I would have to say there were only two negatives I could think of and one would be the view, which was a roof top and another building. The other thing was ocassionally, not all the time you could smell smoke, I imagine because of being right above the casino floor.

El Cortez is a good hotel with good and bad features. You have to figure out what is important to you. The cost is affordable. The rooms (we were in room 1205) were remodeled and very clean. Our sheets were soft, bright white and clean and the double beds in our room were comfy. Our towels were the same. The furniture in the room is dark wood and was like new. Our maid was wonderful. She vacuumed every day. When we arrived there was no refrigerator in the room so we called downstairs and asked for one and within 5 minutes, they wheeled one up on a scratched up mini black one on a gray cart (not attractive, but hey, it was a fridge). When I needed a hair dryer, one call to the guest services and it was delivered asap. Also, we needed some paper coffee cups and bingo again- within a few minutes they were delivered. Service was excellent in that respect. There was no microwave in our room (and we did not ask for one). The location is right in the heart of Freemont \u2013 a very old town Vegas atmosphere. At mid-night, you can watch& hear the 5-minute Freemont light show from the side of the hotel and it\u2019s worth staying up for. Upon arrival at El Cortez, the valet folks are really nice and helpful. We actually choose to self-park (because of a rental catr I am picky about who gets behind the wheel). The bellman is a different story. The older shorter white man was very nice but was not able to tell us on a map how to get to Fire Valley or Grand Canyon, and the taller black bellman was horribly rude beyond belief to my handicap niece who walks with a cane. We went to the store and upon return needed to borrow is luggage cart to tote in bottled water for her and he said no \u2013 he did not lend it out even though we were staying in the hotel. What? Did he think we were going to steal it? Strange and rude all at once. We ended up carrying up a bottle at a time each time we came and went from our car. That was very inconvenient. The folks working at the concierge desk were super nice also and explained our comps (they give you a book of neat comps at check-in). The self-parking garage is detached from the casino/hotel but we felt 100% safe. There were security people all about and a guard standing at the exit of the garage where you walk to the casino. They have ramps and elevators, so handicap people do just fine. The elevator has a slot to put your key car in before you press your floor number. I liked that bit of added security. There was a one-cup coffee pot in the room and they give you 2 packets of coffee and condiments each day. There were soaps, shampoos, conditioners and lotions as well. Only one night did any noise bother us, Tuesday I think when we heard extra loud Freemont Street music \u2013 just 1 night out of 6. The 12th floor hallway smelled funky but the room did NOT, it was perfectly fine. You can smoke in the hallway and probably in the room but we did not. The bathroom has a detached area for primping \u2013 which I like. The rub is not made for extra tall people (at least in room 1205). I am 5\u20193\u201d and it was perfect, but the nozzle would hit a 6 foot person on his chest I bet, and not over his head. It was very clean, but there were no exhaust fans, only a side window to open within the tub area to let our steam (it worked). The view from our room was ok \u2013 you could see the strip at a distance, but so many tall buildings blocked any new strip stuff, no balcony and window did open but with secure bar so only 2 inches. The slot machines did not pay me too well, but I only gambled in our hotel two or three times and not with a lot of money (I think less than 20 each time) so I never gave them a fair chance. We did not eat at El Cortez, so no comments there. The tv did have a lot of channels, we just didn\u2019t watch them very much. Oh, when the A/C kicked in, it scared us almost every time, a big clunk sound. I did notice a lot of older patrons, but it did not matter, who cares when you are gambling. The drive to the main strip where the new/big casinos are is under 10 minutes. WiFi Internet available in your room for $12 a day, ridiculous.

I was worried that the distance from the strip and the cheapness of the accommodation would dampen my stay, but I was wrong. The El Cortez from the second I arrived were friendly and accommodating. My room was small, but was clean, modern and had good air conditioning (which is important in that Nevada heat!). The bus to the strip comes every 5-10 minutes from across the road from the hotel; I found that on the LV strip itself, you HAVE to take the bus anyway as the strip is so extremly long that its impossible to walk across it, so the extra 5 minute ride up to Downtown to the El Cortez hotel was nothing, and it cost exactly the same as what it would on the strip anyway. I loved staying in the downtown area; while Las Vegas Strip is exciting and worth seeing the shows; downtown freemont street provides music and entertainment. The light show is amazing. There were live bands every night, nice little bars which didn't charge the earth to drink from unlike the bars on the strip. The only thing I would say is NEVER walk to the strip from the hotel, as 1) las vegas boulavard is incredibly long and in that heat is unbearable, and 2) about a mile into the walk, you go through where all the white chapels are, and its a dangerous area and I didn't feel safe. The bus's are fantastic and so cheap that its worth it. I'd recommend a trip to the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam, which you can set up with the Greyline coach company; the coach collected me from my hotel and took me to the canyon and back. Amazing trip. The most impressive part of my trip was when I asked for the free airport shuttle the hotel provided to take me back to the airport on departure. I expected a mini bus of some kind or a van; instead they provided me with a black executive car and a driver to take me back; I couldn't believe how nice it was, and it was free. Needless to say I handed the driver a nice tip. Its cheap and cheerful and I'd recommend this hotel anyday.

The bathroom had classic faucets, that leaked. No big issue.) To operate my netbook on an outlet, I had to purchase an extension cord to run from the bathroom, as the only other outlets were all hidden behind unmovable furnishings. It's a room for one or two. Wouldn't recommend any families. (Besides, the stairwell goes directly to the casino, where 18- kids aren't permitted.) The window would not open. But, the climate control worked quite well. TV had a decent selection of channels and was fairly modern. Has a multi-level parking garage. (And, the fifth garage level was elevator accessible rooms, which required a pass key to reach.)

I had seen pictures of the exterior, with the huge neon roof sign, and convinced her that we needed to spend the vacation here. We stayed in a vintage room in the original building, which I believe was built in 1942. We were on the top floor, right behind the big vertical 'GAMBLING' sign. It was kind of like being in an old movie. The room was really big, and had two couches by the TV, and a little office by the bed. It was clean, and well furnished. Although the rooms are non-smoking, a trip to Vegas is like a trip back to the '70s. Everyone is chain smoking, and all our clothing stank. We even had to air out the luggage after we got back. Our bed was comfortable, and the street outside was quiet at night. The air conditioning was not working, but they fixed it after I notified them. The bathroom was clean, but was not as vintage as I had hoped. Instead of a '40s tile bath, we got '80s tacky. Check in and out went very smoothly, and our rate was incredibly low, $31 for the weeknights, and $40-something for the weekend. You get some good coupons at checkin for food, drink, and gambling. It is an entire two blocks from the 'Experience' of Fremont St, which I hardly considered a drawback. To get to the Strip, budget an hour, as the 'Deuce' is atrociously slow. They are bringing out an express bus early this year, which should make the trip much quicker. Food at the coffee shop was just okay, but the steakhouse was really good, and the servers were all older women who seemed to know most of the clientele. Gambling was fun, and we both made out okay for total amateurs. The drinks brought to the tables are pretty decent, and if you slip the lady a buck or two, she'll be quite attentive.

It was a dump, dirty and delapidated, in a somewhat scary part of downtown, 2 blocks east of the Fremont Street Experience. The clientele seemed to fit the place perfectly. Smoke poured out the casino door when it opened (we smoke and we noticed the haze inside) and a foul odor hung in the air. Over the years, I would drop in there for a moment just out of curiousity. I noticed that, unlike some other downtown properties which were falling into decay, the El Cortez was spiffing up. Earlier this year, I convinced the better half to come in with me. She had vowed 6 yrs earlier never again. We ended up spending about 3 hours there, and she was shocked at the turnaround (but still skeptical). We got an offer to stay in the new Cabana Suites and (after agreeing with her that we would go elsewhere if it wasn't decent there, as well as researching their remodel, etc. on the web and showing such to her) we booked, opting for a Tower room as the Suites are non-smoking. I'm glad we did, as the Cabana Suites are also across the street, not attached to the main building. The changes are not superficial. Services were excellent all around. When we booked they gave us a room number. We arrived about an hour before check-in time and the room was ready (same room number they had given us a month earlier). Not once did we see a smudge print on the elevator panel, nor anywhere in it (although it is a pet peeve of mine, that nearly every property that has a nice big furnishing in the hall when you exit the elevator has been knicked but good by the maids vacuum and isn't touched up. Same here) . The room was large, clean (no fear of being barefoot as in some other properties) and well appointed. No flat screen TV, but it was big enough. Except for the TV, it looked just like the picture on their website (believe me, many of the other properties rooms do not). Bathroom is kinda small, but that wasn't a problem. Electronic safe is in there mounted near the floor in the closet area. You won't find amenities already in place in the room, but they're available, just call down. She needed a hairdryer and they offered to bring a frig as well. Don't see that happen often. No old noisy heat/cool unit on the floor by the window here. Output and air intake are vented from the ceiling with the control on the wall near the door. And no old 'popcorn' ceiling. Gambling was fun, great mix of new and old machines (there are still coin payouts on some, old Vegas) and the limits are low on the tables ($3 BJ with 3/2 and 25 cent roulette with $1 minimum) which is nice if you hit a cold streak. Casino was very clean at all times in the 3+ days we stayed. It was common to see not just maintenance people picking up around the place, but floor people, servers, and security as well. Machines were being wiped down and no trash and empty cups/bottles laying round them. The air was clear and no odors. Carpet and floors all clean. Fellow patrons were friendly, it has a loyal following. We ate each day at the Cafe Cortez. Great food and a lot of it for cheap (frig came in handy for leftovers). And yes, Jackie is around, he ate at the next table Sunday morning. Didn't try The Flame or the hot dog cart, but heard they were good. If you don't want to stop gambling to eat, they have a service to deliver food to you. We forgot to try that, but saw many people using it. There are still some characters in there, but that's typical downtown. Security is abundant, inside and out. Not once did we see any disturbance. The short walk to the Experience is plenty safe, day or night. We walked one night to Binion's to eat at the coffee shop there (sure glad we did, as unfortunately it will be gone in a couple of weeks) and had no problem at all. But the fact is, we enjoyed the El Cortez so much, that was the only time we left the property. Bottom line, the El Cortez ranks #2 as far as downtown properties go (Golden Nugget is #1, but much more expensive). If your looking for a hip crowd and expensive duds, go to the GN.

The worst thing is ventilation in the hotel - you just can't stay away from the smoke, even in a non-smoking room. Air in the casino is quite bad, even in the restaurants. They do have a section of coin-operated slot machines which I think are for the old-timers who preferred the substance and sounds of coins. Tried both restaurants in the hotel and both were alright with decent prices. Our friend got his room from Expedia at $42/night, 3-night stay special. His room is situated on top of the parking structure on the 5th floor (I think they convert it), kinda weird but has newer furnishings and decor than our room. It's suitable for those who look for good prices. Finally, I must mentioned that El Cortez has 2 parking structures, one attached, one detached.

Their dollar and quarter slots are very, very old and there is almost NO selection in the quarter range. They really need to get these updated! Many of the older machines were very, very dirty. Maybe there are plans to get new machines and this might be why there is no upkeep on them, I'm not sure? I basically just played video poker, but really would have liked to play some quarter slots.

The hotel is Vintage but not rundown it has recently undergone some serious remodeling to the tune of $25million dollars that doesn't mean all rooms or areas are affected but the Restraunt is alot nicer than it once was and the food has always been good with very very reasonable prices. This hotel maxes the amount of money you can spend gambling by reducing the amount you spend on food, amenities etc. The rooms always have fresh linens, don't smell and very clean, the furniture is older and big the rooms are spacious, some have flat screen tv's some don't. I reccomend this hotel for adults not kids or teenagers. The Casino floor is big and spacious the machines are not pushed together but roomy you never feel like its a smoky even though everyone is smoking unlike the Four Queens they push all the machines as close together as possible to put more in and it always feels smokey. Avoid the pavillion rooms as they are outside in the parking garage, go for the Vintage rooms or Tower Rooms or better yet the new Cabanna Suites that look awesome but I haven't stayed in one yet just took a tour. People are mostly friendly and only once has anyone been some what short with me but I attribute that to my drunkeness(lol). Drinks don't come as often as in other casinos unless the floor is really busy they staff according to the amount of people in casino. The crowd is mixed mostly adults and seniors but on one of my stays I had some great fun with some college kids and they liked the place. The El Cortez is a practical, low cost, high player rewards, somewhat loose slots, good poker tables, place with decently priced hotel rooms I would compare to say a Best Western or Holiday Inn Express but roomier.

I have stayed three times in a Vintage room once in a Pavillion room and once in a Tower room, so I have seen it all and over the past two years many improvements have been made inlcuding new carpet, new slots, some flat screen tv's, for pay wifi access, restraunt remodeled, and a gift shop was added that has lots of medicinals you might need and not severely over priced to my surprise. Would stay there again and again. BTW my first stay I won' $200 on a quarter slot, my last stay I won $300 on a 2cent slot machine yes they have those there.

This is supposed to be a standard room, but it looked more like a suite. The bathroom was small, but clean, with old looking fixtures, that worked fine (that's why they call it Vintage).

There was a nice view of Fremont street (without any noise problems, from the street or casino). The food was good, at a great price (for LV). The downers (2): The casino is more like a bingo parlor than a casino (but there are other places to gamble, within walking distance) & you have to WALK up to the 2nd floor, NO elevator (I HATE to walk, but this was no big deal for me to deal with). I almost stayed here my whole trip, but I had other reservations (& paid a deposit) at a strip hotel. I wish I would have eaten that deposit & stayed here at the EC.

I felt like such a fool for picking this hotel for my family and it was devastating when we walked into our room and reality came crashing down around me. I don't know what I was thinking. Unfortunately a big factor probably was TripAdvisor's 4/5 rating and all these people saying how \"not so bad\" it is. Now that should have been an early indicator. This hotel is \"not that bad\". \"Not as bad as people are saying\". Oh that's nice, but is it any good? I mean, how bad were you expecting? Pavillion rooms are above the parking garage. The parking garage where the elevators are not working so you find yourself having to walk up 4 flights of stairs with all your luggage. It's ok, sometimes things break down. Once at your floor, lighting is insufficient and it's dark and wet as you try to find your room. Oh yeah, this is not indoors, the pavillion rooms lead directly outside. The professional photographs are very well taken. When I opened the door I thought there must've been a mistake. It really is no better than your run-of-the-mill cheapest motel. Much smaller than you'd think from the pictures and shabbier. There was a slight odor I'd rather not think about. The bathroom is tiny and cheap. There is rusting at the bottom of the toilet, a fan knob that is literally falling out, and barely enough room to turn around. I have never walked into a hotel and said immediately, \"we need to go somewhere else\". At El Cortez, this took approximately 3 minutes. I call the front desk and after numerous \"we can't do this\", \"we can't do that\", \"we don't offer blank\", \"you'll have to call whoever you booked with\", I pause for a moment and let out a deep breath considering my options when I hear, \"uh... bye...\" *click*. Okay. So I proceed to call Expedia and there are lots of details which I won't go into here, but there are lots of expedia says this, hotel manager/supervisor says that, hotel will have to charge 100% of the 3-day stay, no wait it's just 1-day but we don't know how much that is. Supervisor says if I would've just came down right away maybe we wouldn't have to charge, but it's been about an hour so we have to. My mistake of calling expedia to see if other hotels have rooms available, if this happens to you go straight to the front desk and cancel first. Expedia gets an \"excellent\" rating from me. The rep was a savior and ended up refunding everything except for $1.77 and told me not to worry about the manager's threats of charging for the night and that Expedia would take care of it. After an hour at the Cortez, we wanted the Bellagio or MGM even if it was $200 a night. Unfortunately all the 5-stars were booked. He ran down the lists of 3-4 star hotels that were available and had no issue with providing details and even calling to ask what their internet surcharge rate was. Just FYI, very few hotels offer free internet, even the 4-5 stars, and it's usually $10-$14 a day. In the end, he booked me a 3-night stay at the 4-star Golden Nugget which is about 200 yards away from El Cortez but what a world of difference. $60 at Cortez vs $80 at Golden Nugget for 3 nights. Far nicer room, higher quality everything, thank god a clean bathroom with marble, oh wow actual chairs and tables. I would rate the Golden Nugget as average or above average. How Cortez has an above average rating here, I don't have a clue. Perhaps TripAdvisor should change the wording from \"Rate your overall experience\" to \"Rate your hotel\". You could have an \"excellent\" experience anywhere if you're high on ecstasy. It's great that you had low expectations and enjoyed your stay but let's have some objectivity here. You must rate the hotel as it stands against all competitors. Not just give it a 4 rating because it was cheap and you made it out alive. I've stayed at the many 5-star hotels and I wouldn't rate all of those as excellent but I would rate the 3-star Homewood Suites Sandieg-Del Mar excellent. Value is an important factor. But even considering price, El Cortez is at best, \"Okay, but some problems\". There are much better deals out there. I've been to worse hotels and have had perfectly fine stays. I'd be ok with the Cortez for some situations but not a family vacation. The rating here is misleading and that's the main problem. No matter how good user reviews are, this hotel is a one star for a reason. Just keep that in mind while scanning some of these glowing comments.

The coupon book was pretty good, free drink, $5 off meal at the hotel, gambling coupons, gift coupon, etc. This was a last minute trip for us, and we were on a tight budget. We went for my birthday and to see a concert at the Hard Rock on December 12. I had to be creative with our lodging so the El Cortez it was. Plus I had not experienced downtown in years and my boyfriend had never seen the Freemont Experience. The hotel is easy to find and they valet parked the car. Check in was a breeze. We were given room 1013 (10th floor) and our window looked straight down Las Vegas Blvd. toward the strip. The nighttime view was awesome. The room was huge! Two queen beds with fresh brand new linens (beds are firm but not uncomfortable). Had plenty of storage for clothes between dresser drawers and hanging space. Bathroom is older but well maintained and clean. The toilet and shower/tub are together and vanity outside that room. There is also a loveseat with coffee table and a desk. The desk is a \"secretary\" type you don't see often and was perfect for our wet bar. This room was really huge. We had no problem keeping the room warm or cool with the thermostat. Tv worked fine. Oh, NO BLOWDRYERS! Bring your own or ask for one when you check in. The casino part of the hotel is so-so. It's kind of \"dead\", not lively like the strip. It's hard to get a cocktail while gambling. We played only slots and they did not pay out that well. We had better luck gambling elsewhere downtown. The cafe in the hotel is GREAT for breakfast. They make the best bacon and cheese omlet I've ever had. The lobby bar made a good strong bacardi and diet too. Oh, if you want some good Mexican or Cuban food, go across the street (Freemont) and you will find some darn good food. Can't remember the name of the place, Martita's or something? Anyway, people at the hotel will know the name. In general, you will find downtown to be more somber and mellow than the strip. We are used to the strip atmosphere and this is very different. The hotel catered more to retired and cowboy types. I felt silly wearing my typical Vegas garb out since it seemed over the top for downtown (but would have fit right in on the strip). Downtown is fun but very different vibe than the strip. We did have to go to the Hard Rock on Saturday night for the concert and the cab ride after tip was about $30. Yikes! Once we got to the Hard Rock we felt the Vegas vibe we were used to. Cab ride home was a few dollars cheaper, he took a quicker route and less traffic.

First, the good things: the room was clean again; the staff were courteous; the bellstaff and valets were particularly helpful when my shuttle back to the airport failed to show up, having booked me for \"a.m.\" instead of \"p.m.\" pick up. The bad things: There was not enough water pressure in the shower to wash shampoo out of my hair - all week, despite having reported it on Monday. The icemaker was out for the last 3 days of my stay - despite the malfunction being reported promptly and temperatures each day being over 100 degrees; I had to go to the casino bar to request ice. Most of the electrical outlets in the room were shorted out, and I required one for a CPAP machine nightly. The WORST thing, and the reason why I will not return: I do not drive, so my passport is my primary (and only government-issued) form of identification. Although I was registered with no incident on my prior stay, this time I had to deal with 3 people before the hotel would honor my reservation because the hotel has a policy of NOT ACCEPTING A U.S. PASSPORT OR MILITARY ID for identification purposes. But, my hotel slot club player's card was accepted to permit me to register!! Something's wrong with this picture. There are people staying here from countries all around the world - who, obviously, do NOT have U.S. state-issued photo identification - and their passports are accepted but a U.S. Passport or MILITARY ID is NOT!!!! Additionally, we're being told to \"green up\" our way of living, but we have to have a driver's license to stay at this hotel! I don't think so. In my opinion, El Cortez's policy of refusing to accept a U.S. Passport of Military ID is unpatriotic, un-American, biased, discriminatory, and just plain assinine!

I used the \"Buy 1 night, get one night free\" coupon from the American Casino Guide, for a Sunday arrival. I reserved a Vintage room for these four nights, because the telephone clerk told me that I could add Tuesday and Wednesday nights at the \"Casino Rate\" ($22 per night). FOUR nights, $74 total, before taxes. Wow!! To make it even better, at check-in, I received a voucher for two FREE nights in September! I arrived at 1PM on Sunday afternoon. I was delayed THREE times at the front desk, before I was given a room at nearly 3 PM. This delay was the only problem I had at the ElCo. I did not use the $20 bill trick, because I did not think there would be any advantage among the Vintage rooms. I moved into a room on the top(5th) floor of the Pavilion rooms. This room was VERY large! It was extremely clean, and the bed&bathroom were massive. YES, the Pavilion rooms are in a combination tower and parking garage, but I was very impressed at how well this worked for me! Since I drove to Las Vegas this time, I parked my car on the 4th floor, and my room was just upstairs, a few steps away! The elevators directly into the casino were fast and convenient, opening about 30 feet away from the restaurant. The casino is clean and innovative, with excellent table games, new slots machines, and even vintage coin-in slot machines! The blackjack games are the VERY BEST that I have seen in Las Vegas...single-deck pitch game, with 3:2 blackjack, and a $5 minimum! The Sports&Race book is clean, large, and fully-equipped; I watched five baseball games at the same time! There is Texas Hold-Em around the clock, sometimes with $20 buy-in! It's always easy to get into a game, with a wide variety of player quality. The food is very good. Careful Kitty's is a 24-hour diner, and there is also a breakfast buffet/Chinese food buffet. If you prefer, there is also a Subway. My favorite food, though, was at the small Pizza/Lasagna restaurant diagonally across Fremont Street. Two large slices of pizza and a Diet Coke for exactly $5. The location is convenient. Two blocks from the highway interchange, two blocks down Fremont Street from the Fremont Street Experience canopy, and adjacent to the neon relics of the new Fremont East zone. If you prefer a serious slice of low-rollers, you can look two blocks east to the Western Hotel&Casino. The shortcomings of the ElCo need to be noted. There are no stage shows, but there is a piano bar. There is no swimming pool, and the customer base is very old. This casino is definitely running exactly as it did in the 1960s, only with upgraded air quality. This is an adult establishment, for gamblers. If you need to stay in a hotel filled with \"hot bodies\", fire up the credit card to the tune of $200 per night and stay at the Rio, Palms, or Hard Rock. I'll prefer the Rat Pack-style casino at the ElCo. I will return to the ElCo. If readers need to ask questions, contact me at DrGPadgett@ms.metrocast.net with \"Las Vegas\" in the e-mail title.

Only thing that gave me pause was the door lock: While it's sturdy when bolted from the inside, there isn't a tight seal when you arrive - and gouges in the doorjamb show that once upon a time someone without a key wanted in. Those gouges may be archaic; the El Cortez's neighborhood has improved markedly since my 2001 downtown stay. There's a noticeable amount of riffraff on the streets, but the illumination and guards and tourist traffic prevent insecurity. The friendly Freemont St. vibe feels like a street fair instead of the brassier strip: less crowded, less expensive, more laidback, less youthful energy (good & bad). The slow bus to the strip runs regularly, and does get crowded. The EC's restaurants and locals-heavy casino aren't glitzy; lots of jeans, pullovers, comfort food.

The recent renovations east of Fremont and at the hotel itself has garnered it very good reviews, so I signed up for Memorial Day weekend. I am now a bona fide believer. An early check in was a breeze. I was given an 11th floor room in the Tower, facing the Strip. Rooftops by day, great lights and sights @ night. The room was good sized, with big, manly, oversized furniture. The sofa in the window alcove was terrific. Great place for coffee and a morning paper. The very small bath and kind of awkward tub/shower was functional. Great, new big towels. The king bed was very comfortable. Staff was very friendly and efficient. My 1st stop was the ice machine, which was not working. I called the desk and reported it, asking if there was ice on every floor. They said \"yes\", and in a few minutes I went to the elevator to hit a new floor for ice. When it opened, the repair guy was getting off to fix the problem. The lobby and piano bars are beautiful, with the newest in gaming equipment. The rest of the casino is a blend of new, older and VERY old machines. The deeper into the casino, the more you see the old El Cortez. A bit worn, a bit rough around the edges. But overall, fine with lots of $5 BJ (opened some $3 BJ for a while). Free slot tournament daily if you do a small amount of points on your card. The restaurants were night and day. Roberta's was sensational. Good service and an Idaho trout \"special\". Flown in daily, it was prepared perfectly, with a great bread basket, salad and sides for ------ $14.95. Find that somewhere else!!! The cafe however was the opposite. Prices looked great, but service was poor and the food was worse (except for great desserts!). They had a good, smiling crowd, so maybe I was unlucky. I did not use the buffet. Easy walk to Fremont for a terrific \"Queen Tribute\" on the big \"canopy\". They finally got that right. It was electrifying!! Downtown was packed, everyone was having a fun time, with a very good, live band doing covers of great 70's tunes! I really like downtown.

Checkin was fine- the bellman, William, was super helpful. Food was OK- actually Careful Kitty's is pretty good. The buffet, both the breakfast and the Chinese buffet later were fine, not outstanding, but fine. Housekeeping left quite a bit to be desired, however. All that was done each day was to make the beds and change towels- no straightening up was done by staff. In fact, a dress I'd left on my bed was wadded up and left on the nightstand- I found that odd, and tipped accordingly the next day. Slots were loose- I won/lost several hundred over the course of a day. Remember to cash out when you're ahead! They do have $5 single-deck blackjack, which is where I spent most of my gaming time. Did OK, so nothing to complain about. Definitely a locals place- the only thing I found disturbing was a couple who were trying to take turns gambling with a young child standing just barely off the gaming floor.

He said that he had upgraded us to a king non-smoking room at no additional charge. We stayed in what I would call the old part of the hotel. The room was clean (and I have a thing about that) and well supplied (the bag of goodies that others have referred to) other than the fact that there was no hair dryer.

Access from the interstate was easy, and my weeknight checkin quick and efficient. The El Cortez is possibly the oldest hotel in downtown Las Vegas, and as such is an architectural hodgepodge. The vintage rooms are original rooms from the '40s located directly over the casino, accessible by stair, but not by elevator. The pavillion rooms are on the top floor of the parking ramp which stands next to the original hotel. If one parks near the elevator, these rooms are relatively close to one's auto. The tower rooms are in a separate tower added on to the old hotel. It is a long hike from the parking ramp elevator to registration. I suggest motorists staying in pavillion rooms who choose not to use valet parking leave their luggage in their car, register, then return for their luggage instead of schlepping it with them to the registration desk. I stayed in a pavillion room, which was on the small side, and like all Las Vegas hotels in this price range had nothing in the way of amenities such as coffee, fridge, etc., the idea being that one should be gambliing instead of staying in one's room. The El Cortez casino is a grind joint where they don't expect high rollers, so no room safe. I found the room clean and perfectly satisfactory for a brief overnight stay with minimal time in the room. Pavillion rooms are accessed by outside walkways open to the weather. My room had a great view from the front door, but only a single window next to the front door. Think high rise motel. The pavillion walkways can seem spooky after dark, but are well lighted, monitored by multiple security cameras, and patrolled by guards. While on the subject of security, some previous reviewers complained about the unsafe location. Apparently they think Las Vegas is an urban Disneyland solely for their pleasure, and that all non-tourists should be banished to gulags. I found the area between the El Cortez and the Fremont Street mall to be well illuminated and patrolled. The local (and perfectly innocuous) downtown residents were outnumbered by middle aged tourist couples in stretch pants. I ate in the Chinese buffet; with the $5 discount coupon supplied upon checkin the price was $4. Nothing spectacular, but good value and a pleasant meal. I had a large full breakfast in the coffee shop for the graveyard special rate of $4. Good food, good service. My only complaint is the registration system. I phoned the hotel and was put on hold for ten minutes. After a couple such sessions I gave up and booked through priceline.com for under $36 total for a week night room. Apparently this is the norm--I just finished making another reservation at the El Cortez. The hotel website was down, and I spent five minutes on hold before reaching the reservations clerk--after previously being disconnected--only to be told I couldn't stay for Friday only, that I had to stay Saturday as well. I thanked them, rang off, then booked a Friday night only room on i4Vegas.com for under $65 total. If I'd planned farther ahead I might have gotten a better price, but since my reservation was only three weeks in advance, I find the weekend price increase reasonable. I think the El Cortez is a great value with a touch of oldtime Las Vegas ambience.

IMPORTANT ADVICE: Do not accept a room numbered in the 5502 to 5508 range. These rooms are located near the elevators, the floors are tile, the walls and ceilings are concrete, the sound echoes VERY LOUDLY. Being Vegas, this is an issue, as people are going into and out of their rooms at all hours. People engage in loud conversations waiting for elevator. Rolling luggage makes a lot of noise being pulled over the floor tiles. If your near the elevators (as I was), you'll hear all of it. GOOD THINGS: 1. Price. Got a good price on line, excellent value. 2. Air conditioning and heat (central) worked very well. 3. Bed very comfortable. Good quality soap provided, and they also provided a razor, mouthwash, moisturizer, shampoo. 4. Free parking. Security constantly patrols parking garage. BAD THINGS: 1. Room door, and bathroom door, are heavy industrial grade doors, impossible to close quietly. You'll hear your neighbors open and close their doors. 2. Cable TV featured a very limited selection of stations, notably no Weather Channel. I consider not having the weather channel a big omission, considering your on vacation and you want to know what is going on with the weather. 3. Provided shampoo was really bad quality. I had my own, so not a big deal. OTHER COMMENTS: 1. Hotel staff is not excellent - not bad, but they certainly could be a little more friendly. Would not play Roulette or other tables at the hotel, gaming staff is surly. 2. Hotel Food: Chinese Buffet is mediocre. Kitty's coffee shop is a quality shop. Note the breakfast buffet costs an extra $2 on weekends. 3. The Pavillon Rooms all have 2 Queen beds, and are good for up to 2 people. Too small for more than 2, in my opinion. 4. Excellent access to Fremont street. Felt safe doing the walk at all times. Bus stops to catch bus (The Deuce) to and from Strip are conveniently located. Note this bus takes a good 20 minutes to get to/from the strip. The bus drivers can be cranky. 5. The room is not immaculate. The bathtub needed to be regrouted.

The El Cortez was the lowest priced hotel that fit the bill. I had gambled at EC several years back and remember it as a low-roller casino in a not-so-great area, so I wasn't thrilled. But I read the reviews here and they seemed to be overall positive. I'm of the opinion that a hotel rooms is just a place to clean up and sleep, so as long as it's not dirty, it's fine with me. So I decided to give it a try. I booked a Pavilion Room (much nicer than the super cheap Vintage rooms from what I had read) for $50/night Thurs-Sun. When I arrived I first noticed that the area the hotel is located appears to be much nicer than I remembered (with new condos being built nearby), and the casino itself was quite nice and much more upscale than I recall. Once I checked in, I was happy to find I was upgraded to a tower room. The only downside was that it was a smoking room (I had requested non-smoking), but there was not an overwhelming odor so it didn't bother me. Our room was on the 9th floor and had a direct view of the Strip (well as much as you can see looking straight down Las Vegas Blvd) which was really cool. The room itself is bigger than some others I have stayed in in Vegas. It had two queen beds, plus a writing desk and small couch. The decor was nothing outstanding but nice enough, and not terribly old looking. Beds were very comfy and the pillows and bedding was soft, although the outer bed cover had a couple of cigarette burns. There was a decent sized sink area with a separate small bathroom/shower area. The shower was fine to use, but very low! I'm 6'3\" and I had maybe 3\" of clearance above my head, and the shower head was about chin level for me. But the water pressure was good and it did the job. One complaint was that the toilet was running all night. As long as I shut the bathroom door it wasn't an annoyance, but it's something that should be fixed (especially with a drought in Vegas!). The only other notable thing to complain about was a rattling A/C panel on the roof. I tried to stop the rattling with no success but eventually I got used to it. This, and the toilet running were obviously problems with just the one room and not enough to condemn the place overall. In fact, I'd stay here again in a second.

Originally I considered staying on the strip at one of the more popular Vegas hotels such as Bally's or the Wynn. However, after speaking with a friend who frequently travels to Vegas I was set on staying downtown to avoid the crowds and reap the gambling profits. He told me about a little known hole in the wall family run operation called the El Cortez hotel and casino. At first I was skeptical, particulary after reading the long list of bad reviews here on trip advisor. My friend encouraged me to stay at the El Cortez and check out Orbitz for a great deal on the trip. Sure enough, I found a 5 day, 5 night plus airfare package from Hartford, CT for $315. I was amazed at the deal and couldn't pass it up. I figured that even if the place was a total dump the vacation was still a steal. I arrived at the El Cortez on Sunday afternoon. It isn't in the most visually pleasing neighborhood, but as soon as you enter the hotel a very pleasent (and gorgeous) hostess in there to greet you and answer any questions. There was a small trash can fire that had just been put out when I arrived so it did smell a little like burning plastic. Check in was a breeze and I promptly made my way up to my room. My room was very spacious and clean with two queen beds, a 36-inch plasma tv, and a newly renovated bathroom. The bathroom was generally small, but had plenty of mirrors and granite counter tops. About half of the hotel has been renovated so make sure to specify that you want a renovated room when you arrive. There is no extra cost. The sportsbook is very tastefully done with a pleasent staff. There are about six 50-inch plasmas and quite a few smaller plasmas as well. The sportsbook is not as elaborate as the Strip books, but the leather seats are incredibly comfortable and the odds are actually better than most strip sportsbooks. Unfortunately, the slot machines are still coin operated. The table games however are wonderful. It was never crowded and the dealers seemed genuinely happy when I won. I won over 500 dollars at the blackjack table during my stay. I even played a few hands with Jim, the owned and operator of the El Cortez. He is a big drinker but a nice guy. The Chinese buffet was excellent. It rivaled any Chinese buffet I have been to in Vegas. I also tried out there sit down restuarant, which is immaculate and reasonably priced. I had a better meal there for 30 bucks than the 150 i spent on a 7 course meal at the Wynn during the week. I cannot say enough about the El Cortez. It was truly a pleasure to stay downtown at this hotel. I will be back in December.

I checked in around 6 p.m.; there was no wait, and they had my paid reservation. They put a $50 hold on a credit card for incidentals, which was never used. My room was in the tower, seventh floor. It was clean and quiet. The fixtures are older, but everything worked. Two queen beds, fairly firm. There was enough soap, wash cloths, shampoo, and towels. The sheets and towels were good quality, not super-plush or super-high-thread count. Good water flow from the shower head; the water was hotter at off-peak hours, like early morning or early evening, than at mid-morning, but it was never a real issue. The air conditioner was controlled by an older thermostat. The room got cold when I wanted it cold. I needed a wake-up call one morning and got one, on time, from a live operator. I didn't gamble in the casino except to use my $5 match play coupon in blackjack and for a little poker. The room is fairly smoky, if that bothers you. Clientele is older and of moderate means. \"Jackie\" Gaughan, the hotel owner, was playing poker one morning. I used the parking garage. There was a guard posted at the entrance or on the sidewalk nearby. Valet is available. The area around the El Cortez is being spruced up. There is a condo tower going up next door, and the section of Fremont Street leading to the main downtown casino district was landscaped and a Vegas sign added in a center island while I was there. The two blocks it takes to get from the El Cortez to the other Fremont Street casinos are not great, but the warnings I had heard were overblown. I ate breakfast at Careful Kitty's, the El Co coffee shop, with the $5 voucher in their coupon book. French toast and coffee; nothing special, but fine. Service was good. It's only about 10 minutes to the Strip if you take L.V. Boulevard to Charleston to I-15 South. For a single person with a car, or older people planning to gamble here, this is a good choice.

All the staff at the hotel were great including the poker room boss and Tracy, one of the dealers. Saw Jackie Gaughan a few times playing poker and said hi. Kitty's Restaurant @ the El Cortez did a good vegetarian omelet with spinach but their $3.99 graveyard special sausage and eggs was ho-hum.

Kinda neat although without the free coupon I doubt I'd do it again - maybe. The Slot Club Card offered free coupons (gameside dining, extra point days, free slot tournament - lots of wrist exercise! and $5 in free slot play) No points for the poker tables.

Reading other people's reviews, I feel like we overpaid for a worse room (since others who stayed at the newer tower room paid about the same and had a better experience). But the price discrepancies might be due to seasonal differences, with the beginning of summer. (Our stay was April 28-30, 2007, and the hotel was completely booked). The hotel is in downtown, away from the Strip, but we didn't mind because we rented a car. The hallways leading to the rooms were dark and smoky, but the room, thankfully, was not (although throughout the night I felt the cigarette smoke creeping in the room; but what do you expect in Vegas?). It had nice oak furniture and had a bigger TV than I expected, with basic cable. The bathroom was old, but seemed to be maintained well. Clean sheets and towels saved the day, I didn't find any hair or mysterious stains as I have before in much more expensive hotel rooms! No hair dryer but we brought our own. We walked to the Fremont Street Experience (a block away) at Midnight on a Sunday and I didn't feel unsafe at all, with security guards standing around. Fremont Street Experience was totally awesome, loved the video/audio show. There is a Walgreen and an ABC store right there underneath the Fremont Street Experience dome, selling all kinds of things you might need on a trip, like water, band-aids, etc. All the old school casinos are right there, too! Frankly, I enjoyed this part of Vegas so much more than the Strip. It was so much more easygoing! The Strip was so crowded and awful, I wasn't having fun at all there. And parents, you might want to reconsider letting your kids see the free \"Sirens of the TI\" show in front of Treasure Island. I caught the 11:30 show on a Saturday, bunch of parents brought their little kids, and I thought it was inappropriate for them considering it contained mostly adult (sexual) humor and girls dancing in thongs and bikini tops. Also, the hotel gives you a coupon book with a voucher for a free drink, $5 slot play credit, $5 off at their restaurants, etc. I thought that was nice!

We rented a car and parked in the FREE parking garage attached to the hotel. The first impression we had was of the dingy old elevator which led into a dingier part of the casino. At first, I was kind of nervous. But as we traveled through the casino to the hotel desk, I noticed that they are remodeling the casino one section at a time, so I think it will be all updated within a few months. Check-in was great. We got automatically \"upgraded\" from a pavillion room (motel-style w/ exterior doors) to a room at the top of the tower overlooking the strip. Great view. The elevator up to the tower room was much nicer than the elevator from the parking garage. Marble, brass, etc. We had a smoking room and my husband does smoke, so I can't comment on whether the room smelled smoky or not because Mr. Chimney was smoking half the time, so yes, ours did smell like smoke. :-) The room was a mix of old and new furnishings. The carpet, bedspreads, and wall hangings all seemed very new. The blankets under the bedspreads were very old and not very plush anymore. The wood furniture is solid wood but was also very old. The bathroom was very old. Peach bathtub, peach tile, etc. However, it was clean. I liked the little window in the tub. It opened and let the nice warm desert air in but no one can see in because of the placement of the window. There was TONS of water pressure in the shower. That was great. The rooms are big and even had a couch and coffee table. There was no iron/ironing board or hair dryer in the room. You can call the front desk and they will send them up to you, but if you want them, call way before you need them because I called for a hairdryer and it didn't come and I got bored of waiting and just left to go out w/ wet hair. We ate at the Careful Kitty Cafe and it was good and a good price. The location of the hotel is great. Only one block from the Fremont Street Experience and Walgreens and the Neonopolis shopping mall, etc. It was nice that its not actually ON the Fremont Street strip because I'm sure that can get noisy at night.

I got a non-smoking Tower room, # 1411. At about $50.00 a night it was comparable to any standard hotel room in Downtown Las Vegas including the Golden Nugget and I would stay at the El Cortez again.. My room had a fresh, tropical decor and had a good view of the Strip and even had a small balcony. My requested king room was not available, so rather than wait, I got 2 queen beds, not a problem for me. The beds were comfortable and appeared nearly new, at least the one I used but the other was good for organizing my stuff. In general, the carpet, furniture, TV and fixtures in the room appeared nearly new and showed little wear. Furniture included 2 queen beds, a dresser with new TV, a small foldout desk, a love seat near the window with a coffee table, see the photos. Lighting was good but could have used more light over the desk. Looks like there is a data hookup near the desk. The remote for the TV died on the last day and I checked the batteries and found them original to the TV, e.g. same brand, so I knew that it was a newer TV. Sink, mirror and closet space were in an alcove separated by a door from the shower and toilet. Shower had a small window that opened onto the balcony. Water pressure was good but you stepped up in to the tub and the shower head came to about 5 feet 6 inches above the floor of the tub and anyone much over 6 feet would have trouble using it. The usual small bottles of useful stuff in the bathroom. Ample towels were softer than at the Golden Nugget. Heat and AC worked fine but thermostat seemed older and was hard to read. No fridge but one was sent up with no problem nor extra cost. No iron or ironing board, one could have been sent up but that was not an issue for me. No coffee pot nor in room safe but again not a problem, there is a coffee place near the elevators and a free safe deposit box behind the front desk. In general, the hotel is in good shape and is in the middle of a major renovation matching that of the neighborhood around it. No bugs, mystery stains nor other major issues. I ran into the owner in an elevator, he lives on the 15th floor. Nice older gent with his trademark green tie, I complimented him on the hotel and he wished me luck. Casino had a lot more table games and fewer slot machines etc. than I recall from years past. I was told they are opening it up to avoid the crowded look you can still find at the venerable Gold Spike. Weather was warm, in the 80\u2019s and I missed a pool nor can guests use the pool at the Plaza anymore since they changed owners.. I watched a crane lift large air handling units onto the roof of the casino, once they were operational, I noticed a real change in the air quality inside the casino. Ate a buffet, it was ok but was not great. The Subway sandwich shop was about standard for a Subway. Fun Book was OK but not great. Enjoyed all 3 bars, do ask for the tall glass of Sam Adams at the bar near the check in desk. There is also a fancy round bar with a piano player and a more normal bar near the Fremont Street entrance. Casino/hotel security was tight, including officers watching the sidewalk outside the property. Security cameras in the hotel hallways. Stashed my bag in my friend\u2019s vintage room until mine was ready, it was about as big as a small bedroom in an older house maybe 12 feet square at the most with a painted over window. Definitely go for the tower room if you can as it only costs a few dollars more but is well worth it. In general, the area continues to improve from years past and is much safer than its reputation from the bad old days. Walking the streets at all hours, I was not bothered much at all, just a few panhandlers and other miscreants but no one threatening. This in now called The Entertainment District, extending east to 8th, or the parking lot of the Western Much money is going into civic improvements and there is talk of extending the Canopy down to the Western. Trendy new nightspots like the Griffin and the Beauty Bar have opened nearby. Also old standards like the Atomic Liquors, Bunkhouse Saloon and the funky old Western Casino/Hotel. A new luxury condo (I ask you, is there any other kind these days?) called Streamline Tower is going up just to the north of the El Cortez which will help to clean up the area further. Much road work going on and soon the sort of historic neon signs seen under the FSE will advance eastward. Both lead to some disturbing construction noise at all hours when the window and balcony door were open, but this is part of urban life and should be over soon. BOTTOM LINE \u2013 Although probably not for the Vegas virgin seeking the glitz of the tourist traps on the Strip, with its combination of truly classic old school Las Vegas charm and the new renovations both inside the property and the general upgrading of the surrounding area, this is a good place to stay and I sure would stay here again.", "Date": "April 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "Kupiecb", "ReviewID": "UR7277963", "Content": "Ok, let me tell you.

I wish we had more time to spend there. We did have the breakfast buffet in the morning and it was great. The casino is old, but the dealers and all the staff we ran into were very very nice.

Whatever you specify when you book will go out the window when you arrive, including whether or not you want single or double beds, but I believe the above benefits outweigh the risk. Also, this is a bit of historic Downtown which those at the Bellagio etc will never see. Personally, I didn't think much of the Fremont Experience but the gambling facilities at Binions, the Fitz and the Golden Nuggett are second to none. One last IMPORTANT bit of advice.....the front desk personnel leave so often that they know nothing so ask the guys and girls who work there. For instance, wanted to rent a car for a day. Front desk said 'try the airport!' - asked someone who had worked there for a few years who said the Fitz round the corner had Enterprise Car Hire, and I got nice wheels from there. Also the front desk made a complete mess of.....toooooo boring to relate but needless to say have as little to do with the front desk as possible - just ask those who have worked there for a while. For the price this is one of the best bargains in town. Only gamble at El Cortez if you like smoke, and the poker 'room' is to be avoided, although the guy who runs it is a real character, really old school, looks and sounds like he knew Bugsy Siegal!!

After seeing the reviews and the recommendations.......we chose the El. 2/8-2/12 3pm check in time, but earlier check in was no problem. We had a great room (tower) with double queen beds on the 12th floor (Rm 1207) facing the strip. With our 2-4-1 coupon found in the American Casino Guide (a must to buy, but check the book when you receive it in case there are missing coupon pages if you buy thru Amazon or E-bay) and our meager slot play return, we payed $277.20 for 5 nights for a fantastic stay. Soda and ice machines on each floor. Don't put their Vegas tap water in a water bottle to save $ from buying high cost water on Fremont St or the strip. Tap water tastes horrid but suitable to brush your teeth with. Front desk clerks were sooo nice and very helpfull. They had lost our information on our stay, so thankfully I had brought a copy of our confirmation that was done thru their web site. I recommend that everyone print it out and bring it. We asked for a fridge, which was rolled in on a nice size cart that we were able to set up our own one cup coffee maker on top of. My husband loved that . Also the love seat with coffee table which he loved relaxing on after a long day of walking. The t.v was a bigger than what we saw in the other reviewers pictures and worked great with lots of channels. Again, nice to relax to for the short time spent in the room. Plenty of super hot water, great water pressure (even during peak usage times) and tub drained quickly. No water backed up. The bathroom and large window in the room opened up (4 inches) for ventilation. The beds were soooo comfy & very clean. The curtains darkened the room so we never knew what time it was in the a.m. Housekeeping never bothered us in the morning when we had the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. Great!! We were there 5 nights (including weekend) and thought we had the whole floor to ourselves because we only ran across two people in the hall on our last night. Very quiet rooms. The rooms (rugs, furniture, walls etc) were spotless and believe me, I checked under the mattress for the creepy-crawley things that were found, with pictures to prove it from other reviewers, in nice places like the Bellagio (mice) and the Luxor (bed bugs). Nothing to report!!! yea!!! In case you forget them, they provide shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash & hand soap. I tipped Housekeeping a couple of dollars each day, which I left on the bed with a note so they would know it was for them, and left them more on our last day. Please show them your appreciation. I also left them some 2-4-1 coupons that I had leftover from other downtown buffets which I'm sure they could use because they weren't just for players with cards. We won't be back for another year so no use to us. Feeling safe in the casino and area? Yes....for sure. They had security walking around and I played slots by myself until 3am while my husband retired back to the room to sleep. They also had security on the corner of Fremont & 6th Ave to watch the walkers coming back from the FSE. This is also the corner that we had to wait for our Grayline shuttle back to the airport, so we felt very safe. He actually seemed to know the regulars that were coming and going and everyone was very respectfull. We did Grayline ($14 pp) round trip because we didn't know at the time of our flight booking that the El also provides shuttles. If you use the El's shuttle, please make your rez with them as they request? They're not mind readers and need to know ahead of time of your needs to get you there in plenty of time to get thru the airports security. There's a \"lot\" of constuction going on in that area because the El is fixing up their front door entrance. The road is being torn up, I'm assuming because of the new Streamline condo's needs for bigger water/sewer lines. This shouldn't stop you for going to the El as the strip is also always seeing a lot of construction and it's just a fact of life in Vegas. The gift shop is open 24 hrs with munchies to buy to enjoy before bed. After doing that at 3am every morning, the security at the elevator got to know that I was done for the night and wished me a pleasant beddy-bye and never said \"don't let the bed-bugs-bite\" LOL. Sorry to say I can't comment on the food other than the breakfast buffet. You'll have to find those reviews with the others. The breakfast buffet is o.k. How can they mess up scrambled eggs, sausage, cinnamon rolls and coffee anyway. Our needs are just basic for the a.m........ \"don't stop the coffee refills!!!\" Plenty of different denominations on the slot machines with a lot of the old favorites and new ones. Yes.....even the penny \"Cashman\". They were by far, looser and more available (less people) than the strip but not as loose as the \"Fremont Casino\". One bonus round on a Fremont Cashman gave me $252. Sorry, my secret as to which one. LOL!! More hits on other machines but I won't go into them as this is a review about the El. Sorry again that I can't comment on the card tables, but other reviewers have written about them. Low bets etc. The Duece ($5 for a 24 hr pass and also good on all CAT buses if going to casinos off the strip...Rio etc) is a short one block walk from the El and FSE is a quick 2 block walk. If you ride the Duece and going to the Strip, enjoy the ride from the upper level. If you're 5'7\" or taller, duck your head up there because that's how low the ceiling is. We enjoyd the sick humor of watching people, especially the men, smack their heads when they reached the top of the stairs before they realized the ceiling height.....even though there's a sign stating it. Very funny! LOL I hope I covered everything that you might need to know about the El. I tried to talk about the things \"I\" might want to ask if I was going to try a new place and hopefully covered it all. Go to the El, enjoy its comfort & super clean rooms, feel secure and save your $ for all of the other crazy things to see and do while in Vegas.

Due to Atlanta Airport\u2019s security scare (software glitch) we arrived in Vegas hours late. I confirmed with our internet reservation site (found through TripAdvisor) that our room would still be available. Our rental car had left hours earlier without us, so we hoofed it on the public bus for $1.25 each. It dropped us off 1 block from the El Cortez. Before reserving the room, I read all of the reviews and many reviews of similarly priced hotels. I \"bet\" on the El Cortez due to the location and the price. Pros: Price ($35 incl. tax per night) Location (1 block from Freemont Experience, Public City Bus or Strip Bus) Amenities (Gambling, Small C-Store, Restaurant, Barber shop on site) Ambiance (Classic Vegas as I remember it from years ago) Free Parking (We didn't use it but I saw that it was there) Room Toiletries (Nice assortment of soaps and girly stuff for the Misses) HVAC (No window unit, but a functioning thermostat unit not constantly blowing) Cons: No elevator to our specific room (Older section, we were on the 2nd floor) View from room (Rooftop of casino view with privacy screened window) Small Room (Not a problem for us as we cruise a lot) Due to the time difference and wedding events we were back and forth to the hotel every few hours. I felt safe at all hours. If you are a confident person in you own neighborhood you will be fine here. If you are a Nervous Mervis you will feel \"funny\". Not necessarily because it is unsafe, but because you are just a more anxious person and out of your normal \"safety\" zone. I never felt unsafe and was grateful that such a reasonably priced hotel was downtown. There was police action all over Vegas. I look at it as the police are staying on top of crime or possible crime by being proactive. Any large city will have similar situations. I would definitely stay here again without hesitation. It is best for budget minded people. I'm to understand the more expensive rooms are much larger and have nicer views. Perhaps on our next trip I will upgrade. If you have Strip related business, you must allow for travel time. You can bypass the traffic/crowds on the Strip/Bus and take the Public City Bus that almost runs a loop around the strip. If you are driving, Maryland Ave. runs parallel about 5 blocks to the East of the Strip. Vegas is a fun place to visit for an interesting vacation. Due to the 3 hour time change, the travel delay, jet lag, the bright lights, noises, smells of the city, adult oriented themes, wedding chapels on almost every corner and general humanity it was a Surreal Experience.

The main level seems to be divided into two areas where you can almost tell the old part (front casino, Careful Kittys restaurant) and the new part (check-in, Robertas Steakhouse, Gift shop, etc) - the new areas are very tasteful and hold their own with some of the other downtown properties. The casino itself is a little smokey (not too bad though) and locals seem to outweigh the tourists in the place. The gaming is cheap - $3 minimums on a lot of tables and plenty of up-to-date penny games. Staff are a little curt but I'm guessing that being a Brit they seemed to have a little trouble understanding me sometimes (I doubt there are many Europeans that stay downtown compared to the Strip) - I had issues with the maid leaving the door open in our room (it did not shut correctly and had to be slammed) and an issue with my leaving date (they got it wrong) - apologies were not forthcoming but they did fix it and that was good enough for me. There is a free express airport shuttle from early morning to early afternoon (I'm not sure it picks you up - just seems to drop you off) and the cocktail waitresses look after more than other properties. Poker players might like to know that there is a poker room and it seems the only place downtown which offers a stud game. I will mention the area it is in. If you are used to street people then thats ok - but it is two blocks away from the Freemont Street Experience (and the rest of downtown casinos) and one block from the Strip shuttle buses.

And I was again amazed at the efficiency of their only two elevators. I don't think I ever waited longer than one minute to hitch a ride going up or down between the casino and my 11th floor room. The casino also gets another thumbs-up. However, if you're sensitive to smoke, questionable fashion choices, or some \"fringe\" members of society, this probably won't be your scene. Being a serious slot player, smoker and people watcher, this is my kind of place. Plenty of newer slots (and some \"old\" classics) with loose tendencies - even won a couple of decent jackpots on the same night. Attendants were quick to bring out the paperwork and money and were very friendly. Decent drink service most of the time (and for the love of Pete, remember to tip the waitresses/bartenders. If you can afford to gamble, you can afford to tip a buck a round while you're playing). No, this is not where the beautiful people hang out. But then, I went to many of the Strip casinos where the beautiful people did hang out, and witnessed more of them being drunk and disorderly than the El Cortez crowd. My only complaint about the casino was the the sound system (this time they had some sort of poor quality smooth jazz - bring back the oldies rock!). As for the surrounding area, it's a quick step over to the Fremont Street (not even a 3-minute walk) area and, if you use common sense and keep alert, you shouldn't have any problems. My sense is that those that wig out about some of the locals hanging about (maybe one low profile hooker, one junkie, and/or one homeless person between the El C and Fremont Street) have spent little if any time in a typical city. However, I wouldn't advise walking in any other direction than towards Fremont Street. Take a bus or taxi from downtown to the Strip - do not walk that stretch day or night, no matter what your state of sobriety, physical fitness, or personal weapons. In closing, if you're a seasoned Vegas visitor and just want a decent place to stay and gamble, go to the the El C by all means.

One evening while eating at \"Careful Kitty's\" resturant (btw the food is the worse) in the El Cortez, a drunk patron started a fight, threw his meal all over the counter at others, and screamed he wasn't going to pay (trying to get a free meal) hitting me with food. Security didn't show up for 10 minutes, and when they did, they didn't escort him out, they just made him pay his meal, never asking the other patron, or guests if they were alright. It doesnt do any good to complain, they just don't care, and you are putting yourself in grave danger both in the hotel/casino, and the walk down Fremont Street unlit, bums asking for hand-outs, and no lighting walking outside the El Cortez. Be sure to carry mase, or something to protect yourself, and honestly, i don't know about you, or where some of these people who stayed are trying to fool, but I suggest you read these other negative reviews. Your safety is more important then saving a few bucks, \"especially in this part of Las Vegas\", and there are other hotel/casino's besides the El Cortez. I had stayed for three days prior at Harrah's on the strip with no problems like this, and with it being the weekend, I couldn't just pickup and go to another hotel/casino because they were all booked for the weekend. Also, recall that all hotel/casino's have security cameras everywhere, but what good are they if you don't protect the people. I remember downtown not like this, it used to be safe, and with 5000 people moving to vegas a MONTH, many end up on the streets of downtown, not on the strip. Im sure you've seen the cop show on tv, where do you think the incidents happen? You quessed it. As for the El Cortez, you only get what you pay for, isn't that the truth !! In closing, many many people carry cash in these casino's, and what good is it if your life is at stake? I realize some have had no problems, while others have, but for heavens sake, how many complaints does it take before someone's life is taken over money!", "Date": "October 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indio California", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4001938", "Content": "My father, who passed away almost two years ago, introduced me to the El Cortez back in the early eighties. This is where he and my mom liked to stay when visiting Las Vegas. It has became a tradition for my husband and I to stay at the hotel everytime we go to LV. Recently on our last visit, I walked into the lobby and was very impressed with the new decor. The lobby seemed more spacious and the old carpet had been replaced. At the enterance sat a huge beautiful table with an exquisite flower arrangment. The reception desk, though small, had also gotten a face lift. When we went to our room in the Tower, I couldn't believe my eyes, the room was absolutey beautiful. Beautiful antique furniture, new wall paper and paintings hung on the walls. The comforter matched the wall paper and the theme of the wall art. The carpet was brand new. Even the television was new!! The only thing I was disappointed in, was the drastic price hike. We have never paid more then $39.00 for our room, and now we paid $79 for one night!!!! I guess you get what you pay for. Even the hotel guests seems to be, pardon me, of a more sophisticated class. It never bothered me that the hotel was located in a not so \"good\" part of town. In the many years that we have stayed here, never have we encountered any problems. Kudos!!! We even have a reservation booked for December. Thanks El Cortez for always making our stay a pleasant one. This one is for you Dad.

The room was also very clean and quiet. The carpeting and all furniture were new and nice. The casino isn't bad either although not very exciting. The casino is no longer dark and smokey nor crammed. You can get a free deck of cards or dice for signing up for the slot club, as well as 1,000 points and some other good coupons. We did eat at Robertas one night, which was one of our best meals of the trip. The restaraunt was somewhat plain but still felt elegant and the food was very good. If you have a 50% off coupon Robertas is certainly worth it and still a decent deal if you don't.

That should have been my warning but since I had no where else to go, I was stuck. To say this place is tired is an understatement. Upon entering, it took me about 10 minutes to locate the 'front desk'...which is little more than a recessed kiosk. I got to the elevator and into my room. The room was cavernous...very large and covered in old stained pink carpeting. The doors rattled and the lock didn't seem secure. At night, I wedged a chair against the door for added protection. This was a huge room but the sparse furniture in the room was all set around the walls and made the room uncomfortably large. The bed was set against one wall and the small tv was set all the way across the room on an old dresser. It was so far away, the remote didn't work unless I got out of bed and walked up a few feet. The casino itself is old...old...old. Carpeting is old, stained and tired. Much like the elephant's graveyard, I truly believe this is where gamblers to go die. I played some texas hold 'em there and true to some of the 'press' the owner sat down and played with us. He was a nice enough guy but has some serious health problems and drank himself into a stupor while playing. The drink lady obviously knew him well and had been there for years. She was visibly concerned about his health and questioned his drinking...which just aggrevated the owner. It was not a pleasant scene and was actually depressing. The owner eventually staggered away. While at the table, I struck up a conversation with the guy next to me. We were having a pleasant conversation and this particular dealer ragged on us incessantly about 'table talking'. I like social games and that's half the fun but this guy ragged us to the point that we quit tipping him. The other guy eventually told the dealer to go ---- himself and left and I followed suit. The casino is a block off from the Fremont Street Experience and block you have to cross is a concern. The cab driver warned me not to be out at night in that area. He said there were a lot of crack heads and they were known to mug people. I ended up playing downtown a lot but made my way back before dark each evening. Careful Kitty's is ok. It's an old diner. Food was alright and the service was friendly. There were lots of old tired-looking people hanging around who appeared to have health related problems. I'm truly sorry for these people but I was there to have fun and it was just depressing. I went back there once with my girlfriend to show her the place. She couldn't believe I actually stayed there. She played some slots and then said that the place 'creeped' her out and she wanted to leave NOW... I'll stay downtown anytime and actually prefer it to the strip but I'll never make this mistake again. The room was cheap but I paid a much higher price by sacrificing my enjoyment.

If you are staying in the main part of the hotel, not the motel house, or the extension, but the recently upgraded rooms, then you are in for a treat. The rooms are excellent. Great, tasteful and clean... the bathroom still maintains an old 70's look, and it almost feels like you are in a submarine since the enclosure comes up and over your head. Other than that the deal is incredible and hard to beat. The cost for those rooms are next to nothing compared to some less than respectable hotels on the strip.

Here's the rundown: Although the front desk clerk was a tad cranky (in her defense, the front desk seems to be understaffed), she was quick and let us check in early. We got a room on the 14th floor (Room 1414), which was very large and clean. The bathrooms are tiny, but everything was clean and functional. Comfortable beds, and a very comfy loveseat to lounge on while checking out the view of the mountains. I also dug how the elevators to the rooms are right inside the casino - no hiking through 4 miles of hallways to get to your room. The three nights we were there were quiet. Maid service was efficient and thorough. We only ate once at Careful Kitty's Cafe while we were there. Food was marginal - probably wouldn't eat there again. Didn't get a chance to try Roberta's. I enjoyed the casino. Yes, it's a little rough around the edges, but that only added to its charm. Easy to navigate, and the cocktail staff was decent. I only play slots, and found a good variety to choose from. While I didn't hit anything big at the Cortez, the slots are much looser than those on the Strip. The clientele is mostly middle-aged, blue collar, and low-key. There are a few \"character\" types there, but I found them much less annoying than the look-at-me people and hoardes of college kids learning how to drink at the mega resorts. The casino in general had a relaxed vibe. The location of the Cortez was outstanding - just maybe a half-block walk to the main Fremont Street scene. As for this being a \"rough stretch\" to walk down, I didn't think so at all. I did see a couple of working girls and a homeless person, but big deal! It's a city. Don't bother them and they won't bother you. (However, I would not recommend walking down Las Vegas Blvd. from downtown to the Strip. It didn't appear to be a war zone per se, but there were a lot of vacant lots, boarded up buildings and dealers. Take the bus or a taxi.) I loved how it was just a few steps from the hotel to the Fremont Street action with its plentiful and accessible variety of casinos, food, and shopping. I've always stayed on the Strip before, but the Cortez has converted me to a downtowner. My husband doesn't care for the Vegas thing at all, and even he had a good time. All in all, I'd stay there again. If you're a low maintenance kind of person who wants somewhere clean, comfortable, and safe to stay and play, this is your scene.

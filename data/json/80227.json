We stayed in the North Tower and our room overlooked the water & the northern part of SD (it was so pretty at night). Our room was right by the elevator which worried me at first, but we never once heard the elevator, so it was not a problem! The hotel is right beside the Convention Centre, and is a 2 minute walk to the Gaslamp District which has numerous bars, pubs, classy restaurants, regular restaurants, burger joints, nightlife...pretty much anything you are looking for and more! Hotel is right in front of the Trolly stop, and about a 5 minute walk to Seaport Village, 5 minute walk to Petco Park, 5 minute walk to the mall and to a grocery store, and a 10 minute walk to the USS Midway. No need for a car! Pros of Hotel Stay -room was very very clean (I am very particular about the cleanliness of hotel rooms I stay in) -easy to get everywhere in SD from this hotel -safe available in room -balcony overlooking the water -large & clean bathroom with a large shower -actually get hot water in the shower which is not always the case in hotels -property is smoke free -fridge in room -hair dryer in room is a normal one, not one of the mini dinky ones that are useless -staff very friendly & helpful with directions & suggestions -restaurants & lounge in hotel looked decent and were busy, but we never ate at them; we ate in Seaport Village and Gaslamp District restaurants -coffee in the room is actually drinkable! Who would have thought? Cons of Hotel Stay -wifi is NOT free (this is my first hotel I have stayed at where it wasn't free! wft!)...limited free wifi in SD actually which was a surprise for us -mattress is not the most comfortable, but it is a hotel after all, and nothing compares to your own bed -the trains in the middle of the night are LOUD...woke us up each night; rail yard is just to the south of the Convention Centre...and a train goes right through the city at night honking its horn non-stop for about 10 minutes. We live close to a rail yard and have NEVER experienced noise like this in the middle of the night or even during the day for that matter! -low water pressure...we were on 16th floor, not sure if this had anything to do with it, but shower was lacking water pressure I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. We had a great experience except for the trains at night and the lack of wifi. If we were to return, I would ask for a room that is quieter and protected more from the sound of the trains at night (probably a pool view room would be fine).

There was a great coffee machine, but had to call to replenish the reg coffee on the 3rd day? Also, had to call for more toilet paper..there was not any extra roll anywhere. The last thing (which I really should have reported) was I left a shopping bag on the floor, and looked all over, could not find it. I was upset because I had left all the receipts in the bag and it was gone! I called the desk (again on the 5th day) and she was pretty sure all the trash would be gone but said she would check with head of housekeeping. I actually got a call back that the maid put the receipts on the desk near the computer area! Anyway, the waitress in all the restaurants and pool were nice and efficient.

Hotel is easy to find and in a good location. The pier and marina area behind the hotel is fun to walk at night or day and area in front was easy walk to gaslamp dist, shopping. The hotel lobby was very sterile. They have a business center that is run by ups? There is also a starbucks on property but it has very long lines. The hotel has a very nice pool area with outdoor eating, bar, hot tubs... that look inviting from pictures but is not resort like in person. The overall feel of the hotel reminded me of a very large convention hotel complex that tries to pass itself off as a nice place for a resort stay with the latter just not fitting the bill. Rooms. We were given a two double bed room on the 25th floor with a city view and small balcony with seating for two small chairs and an end table. The room itself was clean, basic and business sterile. Popcorn ceilings. Reminded me of something I would think was extra special in the early 90's. Bedding, furnishing and decor were of course updated but nothing special. Beds comfortable. We were especially tired from a morning at Disneyland and subsequent drive to San Diego and visit to a college. We checked into our room and surved the pool area. There is an area with a bar and outdoor seating/fire pits however this area was too crowded to eat so we ate along the pier someplace. Fun walk around the marina area. Came back to hotel to hot tub but I declined after having to move several beer bottles, plates of food, wet towels.. out of the way. I was very tired and looking forward to a good nights sleep after a busy day. There was a large group party in the room below us. It was only 9:30pm so I was not going to ruin their party by complaining of noise. The party was noisy but not out of control. You do hear the trains but that did not bother me enough to inturrupt my sleep. I had trouble getting to sleep, something I normally don't have a problem with, and awoke at midnight to extreem noise. The people in the room next to me were pounding on the walls, yelling at the party below me and shouting at the top of their lungs. I called and complained at 1am. It stopped for a few mins and then started back in again intermittently for the rest of the night. I'm not talking a noisy group of people here. I'm talking about men in their 20's screaming at the top of their lungs and pounding on walls. I got little sleep and was a wreck the next am. I did complain to the front desk. They appologized and comped our self park after I asked them to. They also offered us a late check out which I was unable to take them up on because we had to drive to Santa Monica. To their defense they did say that the party scene was not the norm and they had over 20 noise complaints that night. They said it is typically a great family place to stay. To be honest I would not stay here again even if I had a good nights sleep unless I had to for business and I did not pay for it. It was just too business convention and sterile with no real feel of resort to me. My opinion of this hotel may be slightly tainted on the negative side due to the crazy sleepless night which evidently is not the norm according to hotel staff.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLovely view of pool and marina!\u201d", "Author": "Laurie M", "ReviewID": "UR125610785", "Content": "Our waterfront room was on the 20th floor, a well appointed room with a fabulous view/balcony.Our original room was on the 6th floor with an enclosed balcony.

Compounding this fee was that we had to walk approx 2 blocks to get to the elevator to our room from parking. Our room overlooked the bay... which also overlooks the pool/bar. And the pool/bar was noisy at night, even late. We had to close the door to the balcony that we paid to upgrade to because that was the only way we were going to get sleep. Finally - this hotel got really busy Friday night - there are lots of meeting rooms and it is next to the convention center. Had to wade through a ton of convention-goers, all with the obligatory drink in hand. The elevators were extremely slow - i had unloaded our car and slogged the two blocks from the parking with our luggage, then had to wait about 8 minutes for an elevator headed up. By this time, quite a crowd had gathered. I got lucky and was standing in front of the one that opened, but quite a few people were left to wait for another one. $20 for a roll-away was a bit steep. All in all, I would not stay here again for a family outing. We liked having Roy's on the property, but that was the biggest benefit we saw.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spring Lake, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cThe View is Wonderful\u201d", "Author": "manger2", "ReviewID": "UR124943042", "Content": "The Marriott is located at the marina and the rooms have a bay or city view.

I had a great room in the North Tower, that had a balcony and a gorgeous view of the marina, Coronado and the ocean. The downsides of the hotel are the number of dining options and the lack of a spa. However, I understand they are currently building a brand new spa and it should be done sometime in 2012. The Tequila Bar & Grill was great for lighter food and had an awesome spot out by the pool, complete with heaters and fire pits. LC's Restaurant was just OK and I only ate breakfast here once. Roy's, of course was delicious and I highly recommend the lobster tail.

Seemed like a good idea at the time. Nice location depending on whether you enjoy constant fire and police alarms, unending din of a foghorn, and last night, of course, loud music from a boat offshore until 2:30 a.m. making the hotel seem like a hostage hostel. Why is that Marriott's problem? Because the glass panes are so cheap that you can hear everything from outside. That and the thinness of the walls allows you to hear your neighbors grunts and groans without needing an imagination. And as to the pillows: your king sized bed comes with three huge blocks of foam covered with cheesecloth, suitable for a floatiation device, along with four pillows smaller than those which used to be found in most US carrier's business class seats, certainly no bigger and far less comfortable. They might even be disposable, sort of like Depends for the bedroom. The notion of a standard-sized pillow is but a memory. And don't bother calling for anything else. Then there is the matter of towels and bath amenities: the towels are cheap and there are no amenities. Cheap soap and shampoo and that's it. You can order robes which might come in an hour or so. Asking for a room upgrade is a waste of time since the opposite tower is closed which is where I was told those choice rooms sat vacant. Why? They're old, just like the ones in the tower open to the public. How old? Your room comes with a neatly camouflaged plunger since the plumbing in the place is falling apart, the water pressure about as vibrant as a 80 year old man's prostate and the soap offered might be fairly mistaken for a large Chicklet. With a price of over 200.00 a night on average it's an absolute ripoff. With so many wonderful boutique hotels nearby in the Gaslight and Little Italy at far less cost, down the street to the far better Hilton and Hyatt for about the same price, or at Harbor Island's Sheraton and Hilton, this dump would be the last choice I would recommend to a friend and maybe not even to an enemy.

I cannot say enough good things about the hotel staff -- everyone I encountered was very friendly and happy to help/answer questions. I was always met with a smile. I had called prior to checking in to request an early check-in and a bay-view room. The hotel accommodated those requests without hesitation. I also asked if a colleague could be placed in a room close to mine and this was also granted. Check-in and check-out went very smoothly. The food at the hotel itself -- DW restaurant and the pool bar -- was mediocre. I ordered tacos twice from the bar. The first time they were fairly good, the second time, I was not impressed. I had asked to order from the \"happy hour section\" on the menu, which is advertised to be available from 5-7 pm. I would have paid more to eat from this section for dinner, but was told that those items are only available in that two hour window. I found the lunch menu at DW to be rather limited. The salad I ordered was average and the service was somewhat slow. The meal I ate at Roy's, behind the hotel, was excellent. I wish I had found that restaurant earlier. I also had good luck with a seafood restaurant further along the bay. The close proximity to the walking/jogging path behind the hotel was great. The pool area could get somewhat noisy at night even though the pool is supposed to close at 11. It never prevented me from sleeping, but I did notice it. My room overlooked the pool from the 12th floor. I would imagine a room on a lower floor would have had more noise issues. One complaint I have, that is not directly related to the hotel, was a very poor taxi driver that was hailed for me by the hotel bellman. I was trying to get to a local park and the driver had no idea where it was. I showed him two maps on my phone and he still did not know where to go. He charged me for the time he took trying to read the maps. Eventually, I requested that he pull over and ask someone how to get there. I was very frustrated. Again, this is not directly related to the hotel, but I think they should be more choosey regarding which taxi companies service the hotel. I would not use West Coast Taxi again.

I was first assigned a room partially facing the city, towards the front of the hotel. I was about 6 floors up, and was immediately aware of the sounds of the bells from the train which runs just outside and along the entire the front of the hotel. For some reason they ring the bells on this train not once or twice but more like, 20 or 30 times as it goes by. Knowing that I didn't want to hear that noise for days in a row, I quickly called and requested a room change. The person on the phone was pleasant and helpful. Within 10 minutes there was a knock at my door and keys to my new room arrived. Unfortunately, the room number was written down incorrectly and I ended up at a room where maintenance was taking place. This was quickly resolved as we discovered that the room number on my new keys had two digits backwards. A minor setback and a mistake anyone could have easily have made. Onward to my room, which was, it turns out, very good. I recommend getting a room overlooking the pool and the harbor if you can. My guess is they cost more than city-facing rooms, but I don't know for sure as I was not charged any more. The views from the balcony are excellent and interesting. I was much happier in this room, although there was a new intrusive sound to deal with, which was the Navy helicopters that fly back and forth along the harbor regularly throughout the day and early evening. While the noise was loud, it usually passed quickly, and it was just so unusual and interesting, it wasn't really a bother at all. The helicopters stopped flying shortly after dark, and with the balcony door closed, were not really loud at all. A couple things about this hotel I really, really liked. One is the bowls of apples that were always available in the lobby. Another is the ice cold strawberry infused and lemon infused water, wich was free for guests and was located in the lobby area. I've never had natural strawberry water before, and it was excellent and refreshing. I loved the Starbucks on site, and ate once at their Hawaiian Fusion restaurant, which was decent. Proximity to the convention centre, the gas lamp district, the walking paths along the marina/harbor and the airport are all fantastic. Staff were always friendly and professional. I would be happy to return here for another conference, or with my family for pleasure. Oh, one more thing. I used the fitness centre every day, and it's quite nice. One thing I loved was - and this happened twice - just as I was getting really winded and tired near the end of my workouts - a staff member came around with cold bottles of water for free.

The temporary entrance was at the North Tower. This made unloading and reloading luggage a challenge, especially since I was in a walking cast during the trip. For those attending meetings at the Convention Center, the South Tower is your best bet since it's the closest to the Convention Center. However, the concierge lounge is in the North Tower (why they don't have two surprises me at this level of a hotel). After a day of walking, it can be the last thing you want. The pool area was under construction as well, but my room was high enough in the tower that I wasn't bothered by the daily construction noise. If your room is facing the city, beware of the train horns and bells during the day and night. It can be bothersome for light sleepers. Overall the staff was good although the bellmen were a bit abrupt when I was trying to simply \"run in\" to check in. They charged me $5 to do that, which was absurd and I told the bellman that much. He shrugged and said it was hotel policy (later, I found out that it could have been \"waived\" but I feel bad for the people who are too exhausted from their trip to really argue or complain about it). Valet parking and self-parking. Well. Because of the construction, I opted for self-parking (the aforementioned walking cast meant that I wasn't up to doing much walking due to pain), since the self-parking was on the South Tower side. Spaces are hard to come by, especially at night. My room faced the bay, which was nice and kept things quiet. Room service was its traditionally expensive self but okay. The menu was the standard Marriott menu. I've stayed at this hotel several times and this isn't the best time I've had. It was mainly due to the construction but the housekeeping staff wasn't consistent with the level of cleanliness. The service in the restaurants was poor as well.

There is a Starbucks in the lobby that is convenient for grabbing beverages and pastries/etc. on the go. However, they do close rather early--7pm. There is someone who shines shoes during the day and he is very good and quite pleasant. The gift shop is fairly typical of a hotel in that there are a limited number of drinks, snacks, and over-the-counter items such as pain relievers and toiletries. Parking is $24/day, also typical of a downtown upscale hotel. There is a very nice restaurant called Roy's that is connected to the hotel. The food is considered Hawaiian Fusion. I ate there twice. The food was very good, but beware as some of the items are pricey for the quantity served--ie. the Cioppino. $25.00 for a bowl that had just a small amount of the broth. I did not eat inside the hotel, so I can't speak to the quality. The location is very good. The USS Midway is within walking distance, as is the popular Gaslamp district.

Their deli wasn't impressive though. I sampled a few items and thought they needed to go back to the drawing board. Other than the deli/items made in the store, I was pleased with the store. Keep in mind, the pool is closed for renovation. They have made arrangements with one of the neighboring hotels for their guests to have pool privileges.

Entering the hotel from the parking lot also creates a bit of an odd experience as I often found myself entering through the pool or through one of the convention halls rather than the front lobby. The elevators were being updated with a \"new look\" during my stay, and while they did have a sign up warning that they were doing work, it seemed that multiple cars had been taken out of service at the same time so that delays were often quite long. With the convention and meeting center space I think this problem is worsened as many guests are all trying to use the elevators at the same time during a break in sessions or at the beginning of their day.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kapolei, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for downtown activities\u201d", "Author": "chisox05", "ReviewID": "UR82184248", "Content": "Stayed for two nights with my wife and teenage son.

It was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153headquarters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel, with some sessions held in the Marriott South Tower and others in the SD Convention Center, next door. My rate was a conference special, below the regular rate, and I opted for the somewhat pricier bay view option. I am a long-since transplanted native San Diegan and wanted to maximize a rare trip to my wonderful hometown. In that respect I was more than happy with my accommodation\u00e2\u20ac\u201da balcony room on the 22nd floor of the North Tower. I had stunning views across Seaport Village to the North Island carrier wall (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Navy vet, too!), and out to Point Loma and Ft. Rosecrans. I could not resist standing on the balcony, camera in hand, trying to memorize that view. Spectacular. Yes, the trains/trolley run right below, but I actually like hearing trains in the night! As far as my accommodations were concerned, I found them clean and comfortable. The bed was inviting, with a flock of puffy pillows. The small refrigerator worked well, there was an in-room safe (although placed too low for comfortable access), and individual (complimentary) coffee service was kept stocked throughout my stay. The TV was somewhat outdated (a CRT model), but serviceable. Since the weather was perfect, and most nights I kept the balcony door open, I did not need the A/C. The tiny (cramped) bathroom was stocked with a generous supply of towels, and I had no problems with water pressure. Given San Diego\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chronic water shortages, that could be an issue. I do agree with others who observed that meals in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants seemed pricey, especially breakfast items. Nevertheless, what food I did have was tasty, well prepared, and service was cordial. There is, of course, a variety of other eateries within easy walking distance. Now, the bad news: Three issues conspired to dampen my initial enthusiasm for this hotel: (1) Elevators ; (2) Inadequate parking; (3) No advance notice of specialized (San Diego-specific) tax exempt forms. Granted, the latter is of concern only to federal government business travelers, but it was irritating, nonetheless, because it was avoidable!. Pathetic elevator response (North Tower) persisted throughout my stay. Wait times of eight to 10 minutes were typical, and when a car did arrive, it either was too crowded to enter, or stuffed by the time I reached my destination floor. With five cars potentially available, there was no sense that more than one operated at any given time. Rumors that one or more were out of service were never confirmed. If that was the case, guests should have been notified (at check in, by posted notice, etc.). Other guests also were remarking on this frustrating issue, confirming that it was not simply my imagination\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat I was spending too much time standing and waiting, feeling crushed against the wall when ascending/descending, etc. Particularly when I was in professional attire (daily), I found the over-packed cars problematic, since damp swimmers, passengers with food, etc., often were among the crowd. While they had every right to be in the car, it was impossible at times to avoid physical contact with wet towels/swimsuits, the possibility of spilled beverages, etc. Issue two: Paid parking as a \"hunting license.\" Please note, I have encountered similar problems at other San Diego hotels, but that does not excuse it at this venue. Returning in my rental car on my first night (around 8:30), I drove in circles\u00e2\u20ac\u201din vain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dattempting to find (1) a legitimate parking space and (2) one in which I could safely fit my car. Open spaces either were marked for \"Marina Patrons Only\" or were encroached upon by other guests lacking the courtesy to park their vehicles in one (as opposed to multiple) spaces. I was increasingly tired and frustrated when I spotted what appeared to be a useful space on the hotel back (bay) side. Only after locking the car and starting to walk away, did I realize the asphalt bore a faded \"boat owners only\" notice. I went straight to the registration desk to ask about this unacceptable situation and was told that hotel parking \"belongs\" to Ace Parking, not to Marriott. I was told I could use Valet Parking (at an additional $12/night), which sounds very close to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bait and switch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moreover, that extra charge would have been out of my pocket since, as a federal employee, I cannot be reimbursed for any \"luxury\" service. The reception desk attendant referred me to the Ace Parking Manager on duty. To his great credit, he was sympathetic, and was obviously eager to find a solution for my dilemma. [Yes, I have written Marriott and acknowledged the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u201dby name\u00e2\u20ac\u201das someone who really seems to understand and practice the concept \u00e2\u20ac\u0153customer service.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd] As a woman who often travels alone, I do not care to roam around hotel parking lots alone after dark. Thus, the manager offered to accompany me to observe where I was parked, and (or) to park my car in Valet at no additional charge for that night. Ultimately, it was decided that the car would be \"okay\" where it was until I could move it, which I did the next morning. Thus, my rental car remained parked (UNused) for most of my stay. I could not face having to repeat the \"dreaded parking hunt\" each night. Tax Exempt Forms: For 13 years I have traveled frequently as a federal employee. When booking lodging, I am obligated ask about the hotel's policy for Federal Tax Exempt forms, since nonexempt taxes must be factored into estimated totals when travel requests are submitted for approval. I did so when I booked this stay, and was told by the Marriott associate that the forms were accepted. I, therefore, prepared my agency's required form and presented it upon check in. Only then was I told that the Federal form is \"not appropriate,\" (WHAT??) and was handed a blank \"San Diego-specific\" form, to complete. Thus, the form was executed in my poor handwriting and I have no copy. Given the ease with which any form can be made available on the Internet (e.g., for download as PDF files, etc.), it would be much more efficient to make this form available at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, so federal business travelers could have it prepared (legibly!) in advance and ensure they have a copy. Internet Charges: Because I now have an \"air card\" for laptop Internet connections, I no longer have to worry about outrageous charges for Internet connections. Recently, however, it has become evident that mid-level hotels somehow manage to offer complimentary high-speed Internet. I find it inexplicable that large hotel chains (not just Marriott) find it necessary to charge guests $10 to $13 (or more) per day for something that is now a mainstream communications mode. So, despite that wonderful view and comfortable room, I doubt I will book this hotel for next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convention. I now live in the Washington DC Metro area, Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hometown,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and have known many Marriott associates over the years. Typically, I would choose a Marriott property over another option, all things equal. But this experience is going to temper those decisions in the future\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI really expect better things from Marriott.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange Co., CA", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel Courtesy and Service Ever\u201d", "Author": "Moltenled", "ReviewID": "UR77884788", "Content": "We chose San Diego Marriott at the Marina cuz' we wanted to have a good view of SD Harbor and a balcony.

So I'll be brief and try to hit the key points for me, during this mid-August 2010 stay. First, location, location... This is tough to beat, especially for a Convention Center event. This hotel is literally next door to the SDCC, requiring merely a walk down the steep entrance way, past lovely flowers and facing the trolley tracks and Gaslamp District, and a short walk (~ 1 city block) to the A-side of the huge convention hall). If distance is critical (limited walking, accessibility, etc.), the South Tower is slightly closer. The hotel, as I read \"here\" before booking, has 2 Towers, and both are fine, straddling a huge pool and the lovely marina which adjoins Seaport Village (great sunsets and several \"artsy\" shops, fresh cookies, seafood restaurants, fireworks on weekends, horse 'n buggy rides, nice place to stroll). The North Tower has many rooms with small balconies, a major appeal to me, and reason I requested this. Savvy travelers have described how the South Tower has more modern amenities (e.g., large LCD TV's) which may be true, but it has few balconies and I was happy with my room's old but empty refrigerator (to stow a sandwich for next day or milk/beverages) rather than overstuffed \"refreshment bar\" one needs to dance around to fit a stick of cheese, or risk paying exorbitant prices for. Only one bottle of spring water to fit that bill, and there's a small store with early/late hours in the lobby between the two towers, selling sundries, snacks, even liquor, along with post cards etc. So it's easy to live close to the room and hotel and do a lot of eating out, as well as storing some food & drink for snacks and packing for day trips. (Did I mention the San Diego Zoo? I will!) I was solo and there for a professional conference so mostly work-oriented, and the convention center proximity was ideal to lug things back and forth. Like many huge convention hotels, the wait for the elevator around dinner time could be fierce, but what can be done? ;-) Parking lot got full which might be annoying to some, but then there was valet parking. I'm sure expensive, but that's typical too. I used cabs or public transportation, both easy. Doormen/concierge - all cheery, helpful, hard-working, quick to pull out maps and share personal knowledge of the area. Gaslamp Quarter is \"just across the tracks\" literally (well, down the ramp, across the trolley tracks, and 2-3 blocks South to the heart of it, the entrance being at 5th Ave). A 10 minute walk to the bus and 1/2 hour ride and I was at the Zoo on my one day off. It's as good as it's reputation. Allow a full day! Other than location, amenities were fine for me, maybe not as decadent as some might expect from a 4/5 star place, but the balcony view of the Marina and Coronado Island made up for that! (Same with the not-state-of-the-art TV which I could not plug my computer into, but that was ok, and was \"forced\" to take my little laptop screen out to the balcony to look at my zoo photos with.) My bed was King, and comfortable, with a massive collection of pillows. Maids when I saw them (my way out) were friendly, one taking pride that her photo was on the desk - \"that's me!\". Always clean, unobtrusive (left my work materials alone, put away the excess pillows, replaced glasses, etc.) Compared to some conference hotels, the pool and marina really screamed \"resort!\" and were both pretty to see and lovely to visit. There's a poolside bar some enjoyed plus several restaurants, lounges, and conference-related hospitality suites and a lounge. The Hawaiian Fusion restaurant, Roy's, sits atop the pool area and its lower floor opens up to tables on the \"boardwalk\" along the marina, another good place to catch a sunset. Bath amenities: ok. Desk: nice. (Bring your own broadband or prepare to pay for it, like most US convention hotels.) Balcony: great. (Mine had two chairs, no table, but was a great place to think, reflect, even try to do some work). Only did room service once - and it was quick (and as is common, expensive after the various delivery and service fees - but still I enjoyed the breakfast I had one morning). I didn't really get a chance to see specifically child/teen/family friendly things, other than the pool (and of course the ease of seeing sightseeing musts like the Zoo and Sea World, etc.) Really oriented towards Convention crowds, but when the crowds thin it must still be a nice place to lounge at the pool, explore the Gaslamp Quarter and elsewhere by night, and use as a base for seeing San Diego. I didn't have much leisure time within the hotel itself, as it was my convention base camp, but staff were responsive and friendly, and did I mention the location? I'd love to return to SD, and would have no qualms about staying here again if I needed to be right at the Convention Center, or nearby. If I had one pet peeve, it was the neighbor who seemed to be studying anvil and pickax use early morning and late night. Paper thin wall, at least with a connecting room, which I should have had the presence of mind to avoid, but forgot.

Pros: Great location Helpful and friendly staff Nice view of the harbor Negatives: Check in process was more than 30 minutes (more like 45min waiting in line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was on Aug. 16).

The low flow/low pressure shower heads that are used are ridiculous. I challenge any of the hotel executive staff members to use these shower heads and then give their honest opinion. By comparison, I bet I used MORE water, because it takes longer to wash off the shampoo and soap. Another pet peeve. The cost of the in room water bottles. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m paying $200/night for a room, so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charge our guests an exorbitant mark-up on bottled water - $4.00 for a bottle. Come on.

We stayed in the North tower and while some reviews have said that it is more dated than the South tower, we still found that the decor was lovely and the beds more comfortable than any we'd slept in.

The most worrying aspect of my stay was a locked emergency stairwell. The elevators are currently being refurbished, so the wait was quite long at times. Being on the third floor, I got tired of waiting one day and decided to take the stairs down to the lobby. The stairwell closest to the elevator (and the designated evacuation route for the rooms on that side of the tower) ended in a locked door- there was literally no other door to get out between the locked bottom door and third floor. Glad there wasn't a fire! The North Tower rooms are aged and a bit shabby. The bed, however, was extremely comfortable. A mini-fridge would have been useful, instead of the empty cabinet where one would normally be. Rooms are also noisy- sound echoes in the halls, and there is a large gap under each door, so you hear everything in the halls. Earplugs were necessary for sleeping. Parking during Padres games is an issue. At $24 per day to self-park, I didn't even try to valet the car. Be forewarned, the hotel sells parking to folks attending ball games at Petco Park, so if you are attempting to return to the hotel around the time a game is starting, there may be no parking. Parking structure for the North Tower is creepy, dark and drippy from leaking pipes. The whole approach to the North Tower from self-parking is weird- you feel like you're in parts of the property that are normally hidden away from guests (stacks of stored chairs outside the tower, trash area, etc). The Starbucks on site is convenient, but they charge double what a Starbucks normally charges. Gulp! Reservation agents were pleasant but a bit hapless. The hotel had a special rate of $149 a night for the Bar Exam. They had mis-booked my reservation and goofed up my email address, so I phoned them to confirm my reservation and find out why I hadn't received an email confirmation, I learned that I had been booked for a stay that was one night shorter than I had requested at booking. The agent didn't even apologize or offer anything to try to fix it. I ended up having to pay the rack rate of $199 for one night. Some sort of apology or recognition that they had screwed up by getting the check out date wrong and failing to send the confirmation email would have been appreciate. The \"high speed\" ethernet consisted of a modem which felt like it was overheating. Noticed that it was actually just a phone line (not an ethernet cable) that came out of the wall and into the modem. At $12.95, it seemed way too questionable, so I opted not to use it. Is it really too much to ask to expect decent Wi-Fi in my room? The \"express checkout\" on the TV (as per the instructions slipped under my door on checkout morning) was actually non-existent. Grrr.

My king room was clean and bright, and the balcony was a nice space-addition, even though it was tiny -- just being able to open the patio door made my room bigger. Unfortunately, the tv is a tiny 22\" CRT. The mini-bar cupboard contained no fridge. And the $12.95 per day internet connection was useless -- a wired connection, it cut in and out worse than any wireless I've ever had. Staff in the hotel were ambivalent but not cold. My room was well-tended and I never felt rushed by housekeeping staff. Only on checkout did I experience a frosty staff person -- grunting his way through my checkout, he at least comped me two nights of internet hookup. Just neglected to talk to me at all through the entire process. Pricing in restaurants/room service were typically high for Marriott properties. Food is very good, however. Fitness centre is enormous and modern. The resort-like pool area is highly popular and cramped, though staff are quick to tend to your needs. Just beware the $11 drinks from the Tiki Bar. Poolside menu is promising but the food was below average. Other restaurants were limited in terms of hours -- even the onsite Starbucks is closed by early evening. All in all, yet another Marriott property that defies the distinction of the brand, and instead just exemplifies mediocrity.

Nothing to get excited over, but you should not feel like you are staying in anything sub-standard, either. A few things to think about before you go to Marriott Marina, and maybe a couple things the hotel will consider for its future guests: 1. South Tower is newly renovated so it has things like flat panel TV and nicer furnishings. North Tower has balconies. So, when checking in consider which would be more important to you. I didn't know I could get a balcony with the North Tower and I would have gladly forsaken the flat panel TV for one. The windows in the South Tower only open about 3 inches, something to consider if you like fresh air. 2. Great fitness room -- very large and it has everything. Also, great space for running and walking along the water just outside the hotel. Nothing beats San Diego weather for outdoor exercise. 3. The hotel claims to be smoke free, but people are smoking out near the front door and the pool area may as well be labeled \"Smoking Lounge.\" It was disgusting out by the pool because you could not get away from the smoke. Very disappointing that Marriott would claim to be smoke free, but then not care about what people have to breathe by the doors and pool. 4. Pet Peeve #37: why can't hotels give a TV channel guide in the rooms? The great flat panel TV is NOT programmed with the TV stations marked, and there was no channel guide, so I had to call to the front desk three times to ask what channel on the TV such-and-such station was. 5. Housekeeping staff was fine, but they could never get my tea/coffee restocked correctly. Every day something was not restocked. Just frustrating when you go to make your tea in the morning and discover there is no creamer, or no stirrer (I used my toothbrush), or no tea at all! 6. The hotel has an airport shuttle for only $6. Great bargain. Leaves every 30 minutes. 7. Gaslamp district is right outside your door. Yah -- it's touristy and all, but it is a great walkable neighborhood and there are some great places to eat. Concierge has maps of the neighborhood. 8. iBahn internet service is $12.95 a day. For that price, I would expect stellar service. However, it dropped me numerous times (and I was hard-wired using the ethernet cable). A few times I was in the midst of a long email, and all of a sudden the screen drops and changes to the hotel website. Irritating. 9. Food was good, but I did have an issue with the pool-side restaurant (among all the smokers mentioned above). I bit into my chicken sandwich and it was not only cold but it was raw. I had already eaten two bites. Yah, gross. They took it back no questions asked and took it off the bill. Poolside restaurant service is not for people on a time crunch, though. Somewhat slow service. 10.

It was so loud in the room, even with the door and drapes closed completely that you almost had to cover your ears. I'm not at all a light sleeper, but I had trouble sleeping due to being awoken every few hours. Our 1 year old didn't sleep very well either, as every time a train would come he would wake up crying. Internet access was $13 per day, which is definitely on the high side (should be free). In the morning, i took a closer look at the sliding door.....it has single pane glass! What were they thinking? Single pane glass in a hotel that overlooks heavily used train tracks? The simple addition of a dual paned sliding door would have made our stay so much better. Another oddity...the rooms (at least in the north tower) are very oddly shaped. Think triangle shaped instead of rectangle. The odd shape, gives the illusion of less \"living space.\" We stayed here years ago and remember the water slide, which we thought would be fun to go down with our 1 year old. Turns out, they got rid of the water slide too :( On the plus side, the staff was friendly, the location was great and the room was very clean. Due to the noise issue, we would not stay here again.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "montana", "Title": "\u201cWonderful service\u201d", "Author": "Countrylawyer", "ReviewID": "UR59961560", "Content": "I recommend staying here.

The hotel is the perfect choice for a special occasion or it could be an excellent choice for any occasion. Probably because my wife is a Gold Marriott Rewards member, we were upgraded to the Penthouse floor (25th floor) of the South Tower which also houses the Concierge Lounge. Our room was beautifully furnished and appeared to have new furniture and carpeting. I believe this hotel was originally built as an Intercontinental Hotel (before they became a part of the Holiday Inn consortium). We had a stunning view of the San Diego bay front as well as a part of the airport. Having the Concierge Lounge at our disposal was a real treat. The first night the offings were chile with build your own nachos, spinach and artichoke dip, vegetables with hummus, an assortment of international cheeses and crackers, deluxe mixed nuts, fruit bowls anda nice choice of yogurts. Later in the evening (beginning around 8:00 PM) the lounge offered chocolate torte cake, cheesecake with raspberries, lemon bars, hazelnut - toffee bars, assorted cookies including raisin oatmeal and chocolate chip. The lounge personnel were very kind and courteous. The lounge itself is beautifully decorated and takes full advantage of the fantastic view of the water. There are two public access computers in the lounge. The hotel houses a Roy's Asian Fusion restaurant that is located along the marina and yacht club. Diners may eat indoors or on the sunny patio outside. One tip: if you go be sure to order the chocolate lava cake. Order it when you are seated as it takes a few minutes of extra preparation. We thought this Roy's had a better ambiance than the Roy's we had eaten at in Hawaii at the Ko Olina Resort Hotel. Our only slight criticism of the hotel was the problem we had getting a wireless connection for our laptop. We simply used the wired connection and left the computer in one place. We also noticed some slight noise from one of the rooms next door. I also feel the $32 per night valet parking fee is unreasonable, but there is really no alternative except self parking which is $22.00. All in all, this is a wonderful property and I think it would be hard to top when staying in the San Diego area. In our opinion it's while worth paying a bit more to have Concierge Lounge access.

There were a few times when I waited close to 10 min. to get an elevator. I ordered room service the first night and requested cottage cheese and fruit and pink lemonade. There was a HUGE plate of fruit which I could never eat and only about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese. I was shocked when they arrived with an entire pitcher of pink lemonade as opposed to just one glass.The cost was $26 for this meal. I felt this was WAY over priced. I ate at Roy's one night and the service was excellent and food very good. I ended up checking out early. I used the in room internet daily but it was impossible to access the wi-fi. You had to be connected to the internet via the cord on the desk which I found irritating as I like to be on the internet while sitting in other locations other than the desk. It was also pricier than most hotels at 12.95 per day. I decided to catch a late flight out instead of waiting until the next morning to fly home. I was pleased when they let me know that if i could vacate the room by 6PM, I would only be charged for 1/2 a day and not the whole night. One of the mornings I took a jog out along the waterfront. It is an easy access from the hotel. The only uncomfortable part was the path takes you through a small looped park and it had quite a contingent of homeless men and as a single lady jogging made me feel a bit unsafe.

We've stayed at this Marriott a few times over the last dozen years with great results, but it's not a luxury hotel anymore. We stayed the night attending an event being held in the Marina ballroom and we called to check availability for an early check-in and were told that the hotel did not sell out the night prior and so rooms were plentiful. I asked for bay view room and was charged an extra 30.00 for the upgrade into the south tower. I pointed out to the desk clerk that we've stayed before and received the same price as the city view as the rooms were available anyway, but with no luck. The south tower is dated but relatively clean. The air conditioner did not work well so in the afternoon, the western sun really heated up the room. Our room had an outstanding view of Coronado and the harbor, but the windows were dirty on the inside (not cool). We went out for the evening and returned to find our bed turned down (which was nice), but oddly enough, the phone had been moved. When we checked out the next day, two phone calls reflected on my bill and I promptly asked to have the charges removed as we had not used the phone. The desk clerk was indifferent to my concerns about someone using the phone in a guest room while the guests are not in, but she removed the charges. DW's pub is horribly overpriced for drinks and it didn't get much better the next day. The breakfast service at LC's was poor, although the waitress was nice, the restaurant was really understaffed and the overall environment was confusing. At one point, the couple next to us got up to go to the buffet and another couple was seated in their chairs by the hostess. The scene that ensued was comedic to watch, but not a happy event for the overworked waitress that had to clear up the mess and apologize to all.

We chose this place based on the pool and closeness to Gaslamp District, Seaport Village and some recommended Irish pubs we wanted to check out. Was looking fwd to a nice place with a good pool/resort atmosphere where we could relax and do nothing but eat and drink and sit at pool. Checked in about 2pm. Bit of a line but moved fast. Check in was easy after straightening out that AAA package included free self-parking. Turns out it was a brand new promotion. Note: print offers and keep with you. Marriott always has good staff. Room was 1447 in the South Tower is a nice king w/view of pool and harbor. Nice if average sized room. Looking down, pool seemed nice but packed. Went downstairs and found absolutely nowhere to sit or lounge for the next 2 hours even with multiple areas. I wasn't surprised as most places are like that, and it was 230pm, but wife was upset that they had who knows how many hundreds or thousands of people staying there and the pools and lounge chairs could accommodate maybe 10% of the guests. I know the pool staff try to free up chairs and keep people from 'reserving' lounges but they just need many more. Lots of folks pouncing on anyone looking like they were leaving was almost comical. We are just spoiled by resorts in Mexico that are huge, clean and inexpensive. This pool area is way undersized, crowded, shallow and VERY DIRTY! Wife wouldn't go in the water (she's smarter than me lol) and sat on the edge of pool on a towel as there was nowhere else to sit. Average depth of the pools was from 3-4 feet but one end I think was 5 feet and very warm from sun. Being 6'3\" it wasn't much fun. Not nice or refreshing. Bottom line would be that if you are a family with little kids, this is a kid friendly place even though the price is a bit high. Tons of kids in and around the pool of all ages. Easily 3-4 kids per adult and about 5-1 in the pool. Not capping on kids it's just the pool could have been twice the size and twice the chairs for the people to be comfortable. This place should have a small extra pool for adults to swim and relax. Speaking of kids-we saw many 5-10 year olds running around alone and in groups all around the hotel. There was even one adorable little 5-7 yo riding the elevator alone sipping a Starbucks frozen drink and chatting on her phone. I can't imagine letting mine run around at that age alone in a resort hotel. Back to the pool: there were lots of empty aluminum beer bottles and drink cups all over the pool area along with empty chip packets and food wrappers that were there when we arrived and there when we left 2 hours later. Again: more help. The plus side was our room. The room was nice and a great view of the harbor. Bed is very comfortable and bathroom was big. We asked for extra towels on our registration and there were lots of extra towels. Loved it! There was even a fireworks show saturday night that we had a perfect view of from our room. The Starbucks had a long line and DW's Pub was OK but way expensive. Molly's was closed for remodel. Internet was $7 for 15 minutes and B&W printed sheets were $1 each. Roy's restaurant looked great but food was just OK and no bargain. $27 +tax/tip for a combo sampler takeout was a huge rip off. 2 pieces each of shrimp/pot stickers/ribs/sushi. I've enjoyed Roy's main courses (which are pricey) but will know to avoid this combo sampler in the future. Hotel gift shops were better than most and reminded me of Vegas hotels. Parking was expensive ($22) and very tight. I wouldn't return unless the price was closer to $125 than $175 plus tax/plus parking etc. I feel I paid for a resort I was unable to use. Bottom line would be: Plus side Good room, great staff (could use more) in all the resort area, great location by seaport village and downtown SD, Starbucks, free printed boarding pass at kiosk in lobby by check in/out (not by Starbucks), allows small pets, easy to get to, try the lounge in North Tower, take a walk on marina at night it's fantastic! Negative side Bad pool for adults that want a clean, cool pool and a lounge chair to relax in the sun. No umbrellas at all. Overpriced but decent food and drinks on site at DW's but avoid Roy's. Parking tight and expensive. NON-SMOKING PROPERTY neither good nor bad but you should know that there is nowhere on the property you can smoke even though I did see trash cans w/ashtrays built in to the top around certain spots.

The bathroom has a toilet and tub/shower combo and little else. The room had a small balcony with 2 chair that faced northwest with a view of the harbor on the left and a view of the city on the right. Looking from the balcony we could see the train tracks. They are active. The 'coaster' commuter rail train seems to run through that part of town every 10 mins or so. The large freight trains run less frequently but when they do...the sound of their air horns is easily heard through the closed windows and doors. Sometimes the windows and glass doors vibrated from that horn. And yes, a train goes through in the wee hours of the morning blaring the horn for 8 or 10 seconds a time. The elevators are slow when they're in heavy use, like when 300 people leave a morning conference in the hotel to go up to their rooms. After the 3rd day I discovered the service elevator....

Great pool area, lots of chairs, a fair amount of towels (not many but they never ran out), very professional service from the valets, room service personnel, and front desk.

The room itself was comfortable, well kept and the window opened for some lovely sea air. It was not special or spectacular but very comfortable and serviceable. Soft water in the showers. Good bed and linens. The best part was its location right next door to the convention centre. I'm not one for breakfast, so I grabbed a Starbucks coffee and croissant and went off to my sessions. for early morning sessions, or returning to the hotel after the Gala dinner the convention centre the location could not be beat. For extra conference excursions it was located right near SD's Fifth Avenue and the Gaslamp area. It was a short walk to Macy's, Nordstrom's and Ralph's and an excellent restaurant area. Notably NOBU, which might have been worth the trip in itself. The hotel also is located on the sea walk area, also very pleasant for lunch or an early morning walk. The DW's bar/restaurant was casual and reasonably priced with generous portions. Roy's Hawaiian Fusion for finer evening dining, excellent as well. On the last day, I did the full breakfast at the LW. I was informed that the buffet was not available due to low occupancy. I was warmly greeted and offered coffee and juice which I accepted.

Bathrooms have the shower and toilet in a separate room and the sink in an open space adjacent to the main room.

Meanwhile, the bathroom itself is very tight so if you're in there washing your 3 year old, there isn't a lot of maneuvering space.

Bath & Body Works toiletries have replaced San Diego Marriott branded soap/shampoos.

The room was clean and well appointed with easy access to electrical outlets. The beds had a soft plump comforter though the mattresses were a bit tired. The HVAC cycles with a loud click but turning the system off solved that problem. The downside here is noise. I checked in on Friday night. There was music somewhere in the distance which I heard through the sliding glass door to the balcony. The trams which run along the nearby boulevard were not annoying, but a significantly louder \"something\" came through in the early hours of the morning - a freight train, perhaps. Also, the plumbing needs some attention as it makes a loud whistling noise in my room when others have their sink or shower on. Since this is California, many east coasters are getting up and showering at 4 and 5 in the morning. The whistling pipes woke me, and I'm a sound sleeper at that hour.

Hotel and parking was expensive, but not on our ticket. I would have loved to have been able to stay longer. Definately recommend. About the cost...after staying in a more expensive (not so great) Sacramento RI this week, this doesn't seem so bad after all.

The air always felt way too damp, and I was clammy even with the thermostat set to 68. It was the same throughout the hotel - not just in the rooms. The bed was noticeably saggy but not hard like some. One problem is the smell that I believe comes from the bathroom sink. When the water first comes on, there's a bad smell. It probably comes from the overflow drain as water going down the drain forces some air out. The hotels should regularly spray a cleaner or disinfectant into the overflow drains since those things never get cleaned. The smell might also be rotten stuff in the trap, in which case the hotels should regularly maintain those as well.

As far as restaurants, the food was fair, but there was not alot to choose from for kids. My son did like the Starbucks that was downstairs, though. The hotel is pretty and the pools are nice. The hot tub was a little small. On one of the nights, they showed a kids' movie by the pool, so kids could swim and enjoy the show. The problem came upon our departure. When we left the hotel, we were homeward bound. Upon landing, my children and I remembered that we had left some souveniers in the hotel room. I immediately called the hotel to see if they had found them. The lady who answered the phone could not contact lost and found because they were already closed. After trying to contact the person who cleaned the room, she found that the room had been cleaned, but the person who did the trash was already gone and they did not have a contact number. The lady who anwered the phone was kind enough to go to the room herself to look for the items. She called me back to report the items had already been cleaned and removed, but that I could check back the next day to see if they were in lost and found. When I called the next day, Marriot contact the man who did the trash for the room and after much conversation with Marriot, it was found that the items were indeed thrown away. To their credit, Marriot did have some people search through the trash as best they could, however the items could not be found. I was very frustrated that a hotel such as the Marriot would so carelessly throw away souveniers. These souveniers were in a DISNEYLAND sack. Easily, if someone had bothered to look inside, they would have found that they were items that were not meant to be left behind. It was totally my fault for leaving them, but I do believe the person who cleaned the room went the easy way out in order to not have to be bothered by taking items to lost and found. One of Marriot's reponses to this was that they are a convention hotel and people are always leaving items they don't want that have been give aways in their hotel rooms. The supervisor over housekeeping did acknowledge that the cleaners should be more observant to what they think is trash. Marriot did offer me and my family a 2 night stay at their hotel in San Diego in case we are back in that area.

So, if the hotel is even remotely busy...guess what... you are stuck paying the $32/nt to Valet (plus tip of course) instead of the $21/nt to self park. We rode around for awhile and found ONE available spot and grabbed it. However the rest of the trip we weren't so lucky and ended up paying the steep valet rate. This hotel seems to be built out of cardboard as it was incredibly loud, even on the Bay side. We could hear every little thing our neighbors were doing, even above us. This included hearing the guy in the hotel room next to us doing his \"morning business.\" It was the loudest hotel I have ever stayed at, and that includes staying in the middle of NYC or Kuala Lumpur. You would think a bay side room in San Diego would be somewhat quiet...not the case at this place! Since there was a convention going on they also gouged people on price and our room (standard king size room with no balcony) was $515/nt. (We didn't have a choice in hotel and if so we definitely would not have stayed here at that price.) So by the time you tack on tax, valet, tips, internet, etc it can get all the more pricey. The other major problem at this hotel was our rude maid. Upon checkout on a Sunday morning at 10am, we found a note on our door that she had written herself that exlaimed, \"Please take down your do not disturb sign so I can cleanyour room!\" Ummm at $515 a night and at 10am on a Sunday morning!? Excuse me!? Bad bad bad customer service. It would have been one thing if it was say 2:00pm, but it was 10am on a Sunday the day we were checking out! Give me a break. And to top it all off we received a grand total of 40 AAdvantage miles from staying here because someone messed up and only included our internet charges when awarding us points. I can honestly say this is about the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and I always try to be optimistic about things too so I will end on a good note by saying a concierge guy by the name of Chris was wonderful.

If you like trains you will LOVE this property. I have never stayed in a louder hotel and I stay about 100 nights per year in them. I was in the North Tower with a balcony looking out over the city and part of the marina. Each night from about 11:00pm to 4:00am large freight trains would make their way through the city. They go about 3 MPH and, due to the large number of crossings, constantly blow their horn. And one night they decided to switch cars and it sounded like an earthquake each time the couplers hit. I used to live close to a railroad track but I have never experienced louder trains. It may be because the sound echos off of downtown buildings. With all of the screwy laws California has I am surprised they do not have some type of noise ordinance restricting the trains to certain hours. Unfortunately many hotels I assume have the same problem since Harbor Avenue is one of the primary streets. The pool area is nice and service was good.

Despite signs indicating it was open, the restaurant was in fact still closed. DW's Pub in the South Tower serves the traditional Marriott bar food and you have the option of sitting in the bar or by the large windows overlooking the pool and gardens. Molly's in the North Tower features an upscale, expensive menu. The wait staff here were very prompt and the sommelier stopped at each table to chat with customers, which was a very nice touch. There's also the standard Marriott breakfast buffet also in the North Tower. The rooms are the standard, older-style Marriott rooms with the upgraded bedding. The desk is a decent size and the lamp has two outlets to plug laptops and phone chargers into. However, if you have more than two things to charge at the same time, you'll be hunting around for unused outlets. The bathroom was moderately sized and featured Bath & Body Works amenities. Housekeeping was efficient and respectful of my \"do not disturb\" request and the concierge was very helpful. I had a King, City View room that did not have a balcony. Although I was close to the elevator, I didn't hear the binging all that much, However, I could occasionally hear my neighbors, especially as they were entering and exiting the rooms, closing the doors with a loud slam. The meeting and banquet staff were some of the best I have worked with in a long time, easily exceeding my meeting expectations. The catered food was excellent and they had no quibbles about bringing in a specialty wine for my event. Keep in mind that this hotel is *huge* and next to the convention center. It's great for families that are traveling since the pool area is nice and there are plenty of places to walk. The hotel's location is nice as well, within walking distance of an open-air mall (about 15 minutes) and a few blocks away from the Gaslamp District. Why settle for hotel food when you have a wide variety just down the street? Downsides to the hotel: The noise. With freight trains and passenger trams on the \"city side\", be ready for clanging at 3 a.m. as the freight passes. Even when I had a Marina View room, I could hear the clanging. You will also probably be able to hear noisy neighbors. Internet access fee. $11/day. As a business traveler, this annoys me to no end, especially when I can go down the street to a Courtyard and wireless access is free. Fitness room not in the hotel. A minor quibble, of course, but you have to exit on the fourth floor and walk over to the convention center. Getting lost between North and South Towers -- As I mentioned, the hotel is huge.

The pool is nice...there is poolside service and a Tiki Bar that plays good music. The drinks are expensive and the Tiki Bar food is terrible, but we were on vacation and it's to be expected! The location of this hotel is wonderful. It's a 5 minute cab ride from the airport...walking distance to Seaport Village (safe at night) and a pretty quick cab or rickshaw ride to the Gaslamp district.

We live in Orange County, California and wanted a nice get away vacation that did not entail having to fly or drive to far. San Diego seemed like the perfect idea as there is so much for families to do. Upon arrival, I immediately ran into problems checking in. I had reserved a city view king room using my rewards points and the room type was guaranteed . The front desk person said that only doubles were available as the hotel was completely sold out. I told her a king room would only work as we had 2 little ones and they would be sleeping in cribs. After spending about 5 minutes working on the computer and making some calls she informed me they did have a nice king room available in the south tower overlooking the pool and bay. She also gave me 2 gift bags for the boys that contained little toys and trinkets. A very nice gesture on her part. In the end we ended up with a nicer room then what I had booked with awesome views. My oldest son was so excited when we saw the room for the first time he kept jumping up and down. He especially enjoyed seeing the boats and trains go by. The room was clean and well maintained. No issues with tired looking furniture or worn and stained carpet as previous guests had noted in their reviews. All in all a very nice room. We enjoyed using the pool and the close proximity to Seaport Village, USS Midway and other attractions. Many guests had noted that they could here people in the rooms next to them and this was not an issued for us until the last night of our visit. We had a hard time falling asleep that last night as kids in the room directly above us were laughing and running around until midnight. Things got quiet once their parents came back to the room. We were then awakened 5 hours later by the people next door getting ready to leave for the airport. Then the guy on the other side of our room woke up at 6:15am and started talking to his girlfriend and burping. So if there is anything negative to say about this hotel it can be noisy if you have loud inconsiderate neighbors. One other downer, do not trust the valet parking attendants. We had $5.00 of quarters stolen out of our cars center console. Overall, our experience was a good one and we will have no reservations staying at this hotel again.

We had a rental car and chose valet parking over self-parking in the hotel's garage. Valet Parking is $26 per day and self-parking is $20 per day. It is better to choose valet parking on weekdays because there aren't as many people in the hotel using their cars (at most a 5 minute wait for the bellboy to retrieve your car). However, on Friday and the weekend the wait becomes much longer due to the influx of short-stay tourists. It might be a better option to just self-park during those three days. Check-in was swift, easy, and polite. We reserved a room in the North Tower, which is basically the \"deluxe\" tower of the two that comprise this hotel. When we reserved the room a few months ago, we asked if there were any things that might disturb us during our stay (such as planes, trains, clubs, etc.). The hotel replied that nothing was there to bother us. However, once we checked tripadvisor and saw the reviews of the \"loud\" trains, we called the hotel back and confronted them about their previous statement. They apologized and promised to give us a room where the least amount of noise was, which was the highest floor of the North Tower (25th floor). The lobby is modern and pleasant. However, there was an unpleasant smell during the day there and in the elevators. It might be from the pool just outside. I definitely encourage anyone to go for a room in the North Tower facing the marina. Each one in this tower has a nice balcony with a beautiful view. The room I reserved had two double beds, both fitted with several pillows. The Marriott beds are very similar to the Westin Heavenly beds. The Room was pretty basic and the ceiling had a few cracks in it. The bathroom is also basic, nothing special. The bathroom vanity had a several cracks in it and the bathtub had a few hairs in it as well upon check-in. The floors were also not vacuumed properly; I found pieces of cookies on the carpet behind the armchair. We did not hear any train noises in our room. The breakfast was served at LC's, and the service was exceptional. The waiters and waitresses were efficient and friendly, as they should be. The food was also delicious. On Friday and the weekend the breakfast room becomes crowded and a waiting list is formed. However, the wait isn't too long- about 15 to 20 minutes. Realize though that the hotel is probably filled at capacity during the weekend. The fine dining establishment is called Molly's. The food is wonderful and the service is impeccable. However, the prices are high. A dinner for three people (without alcohol) cost around $200. The setting is also very elegant and comfortable. There is also a Starbucks in the South Tower lobby as well as a bar in the North Tower. There is also a bar and a stall selling ice cream next to the pool. An outside cafe next to the pool area serves lunch. The pool is absolutely wonderful. But even in the weekdays, it gets extremely crowded in the afternoon and is difficult to find lounge chairs. It is open all day long and the best time to use it is in the morning and evening. During the weekend, it would be impossible to find a chair. The Marriott also rents out boats and jetskis in the marina. My sister used the jetskiis. You have to place a $500 deposit (you get the money back) but you have to pay $100 per hour. Overall, it was a positive experience for her. There was also a problem with the elevators apparently. They broke down twice during my stay at the hotel. I definitely recommend going to Fashion Valley, Soak City, and Chianti's Restaurant. Overall, this is a good family friendly hotel in San Diego.

Bring earplugs. I understand that the trains are an enormous local problem in downtown San Diego for residents, who are organizing an appeal to create a rail quiet zone (a great idea!) to solve this problem. 2) Parking at the Marriott is expensive, and the self-park garage was $20 per day to park a major distance away.

Since it was a large convention, the room cost me $299/night. For that lofty price, you got a decent room but nothing special. My room had a view of the convention center instead of the bay (more $$$). The bathroom was decently sized but the toilet was not in its own partition. Also, the bathroom didn't have any ventilation fan, so it was steamy after a shower. The shower head was a Grohe (expensive German brand), but the volume of water was not very high. I believe a major advertising point for Marriott are their \"perfect\" beds. For me, the mattress was much too soft. They certainly give you a lot of pillows though - two small ones and two larger ones per bed. Some bright points: I had ordered food from room service a few times during my stay. One time, I had ordered a plate of steamed veggies (not enough healthy food while on the road) and what I received was a very nice combination of small squash, cherry tomatoes, broccolini and asparagus - I was impressed. For their beds, they use down comforters instead of plain blankets. There's a gym and small pool system on the bay side of the hotel but I didn't have time to use either. The main reason that I chose this hotel was its location - right next door to the convention center. Given the amount of walking I was doing those days, I was grateful that my room was close by.

Sea World is a 15 minute easy drive. The view of the city was very nice from our balcony. The buffet breakfast was very tasty and fulfilling. The kids enjoyed the pool, mostly because they brought their own pool toys. On the negative side: Four of us were staying, yet we only had two sets of towels despite asking several times for 4, even on the second day when the staff was coming in to clean. The ice machine never worked on our floor. Didn't realize both beds would be doubles which don't work for 4 people very comfortably. We ordered a roll away bed which did come in a timely manner. My 13 yr old reports it was pretty comfortable. It took up what little space was left in the room because it's pretty big for a roll away and the rooms are small. We thought we should just order 4 roll aways so we could all be comfortable. Hope you like train whisles and the dinging of cross arms because you'll hear it every 5 minutes on the city side. The food at the Pub was nasty with very slow service & little attention to anything. My salmon sandwich was a raw salmon which was never mentioned on the menu or by the staff and it's very expensive. I got some weird, tasteless chips with the sandwich which were gross. The waiter didn't know what they were called and said that no one seems to like them. That was just the beginning of the battle with food. There is nothing for kids to eat in the whole hotel(for lunch or dinner), unless they can exist on chips and popcorn from the gift shop. Starbucks closes at 7pm so the hope of eating their sandwiches was shot when we arrived at 8 after a long day out. We ordered from the room service menu out of desperation. The sandwiches looked exactly like the Starbucks sandwiches, only double in price, not to mention the tax and gratuity they add to your bill. The last morning we spent looking out upon the city from our balcony and noticed a Ralphs grocery store a couple blocks away. Wish we had known about it so we could stock up on much cheaper food for our refrigerator. Live and learn.

I stay at Marriott's alot and this was the first time I'd experienced this... was kind of weird at first but handled very well. Otherwise, everything was SPOTLESS.

The trolly to Old Town stop right in front also. Another thing that was really convenient is the computer in the lobby which allows you to print out your boarding passes before you leave for the airport. Saves you having to do it at the airport, so that was a plus! The only negative thing I can say about the hotel is the $25 per day parking fee for valet (self parking is $19). I think that's really high, but all hotels in the area seem to charge around the same amount. And, it was always nice to pull up to the front of the hotel and have one of the valet parkers say \"welcome back... how was your day?\" or always ask if you need directions somewhere before you left.

We rented a car only one day to drive to La Jolla and Torrey Pines (must see), all other attractions are accessible by trolley or short taxi ride.

Pool and grounds are very nice although it was too cold when we were there to use pool, it was unseasonably cold when we were there. Cons: Too Noisy!!! The Marriott sits right next to train tracks. There is a train that seems to run every 2 hours during the middle of the night, I think the conductors job is to wake everyone in the hotel up! Hotel is extremely busy with conventions (it is right next to convention center). The lobby is always busy and full of convention delegates drinking and meeting. Overall I think you can get more for your money elsewhere. While in San Diego, you must go eat in Little Italy a this little place called Fillipe's. Hands down the best italian place ever! It is worth the wait. Also, Fred's in Old Towne has fabulous Mexican Food.

Sure that doesn't seem dangerous but if you were a criminal this would be a great oppurtunity because it so easy to go from balcony to balcony because they are connected. I reported this to managment and got a very generic, weak email saying they would check into the problem. The room itself was fine, though very small, but for the money they charged it should have had at least a mini bar. So if you like to overpay for a room that is comparable to a red roof inn room, with no amenities, and staff that really doesn't give a damn about safety, then definately stay at this marriott hotel,", "Date": "March 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "benellyn", "ReviewID": "UR6899594", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Marriott Marina.

I was very happy to see many healthy selections on the menu including a whole wheat French toast with light syrup topped with strawberries and bananas. I have never seen this on any menu, and it was very good. There is a gym at the hotel. It is actually part of the Convention Center building and attached to the Marriott. You have to walk briefly outside to get there. The gym is very spacious with many treadmills, stairmasters and stationary bikes with high quality TVs attached to each machine. There are free weights and weight machines. The gym is accessible through the South Tower. This would be a bit of a walk for people staying in the North Tower. The concierge was helpful in finding restaurants and entertainment. They provide a great map of the surrounding area and restaurants. There is a Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel.

The next morning we went to purchase our discount tickets to the zoo and the lady asked me where my discount card was. I told her that I had asked for this card twice and they did not have them. She told I needed that, and I could tell from her attitude that she thought I was making this up to get discount tickets. She checked with the front desk and found out that I did have that package and got me the card which stated that I could get tickets to the zoo. Fast forward, we get to the zoo the zoo won't sell us discount tickets telling us that we should have got them from the hotel. I call the hotel they tell me to come back to the concierge desk and they will credit my hotel bill I did return and they did refund the discount but not before I have spent more of my time staigthening out their mess that they so discreetly delivered to me, but I did get plenty of attitude from the lady at the concierge desk with no apologies for the problems. Fast forward again, to check out time and the luck of the draw I get the same nasty woman who had got me the change in rooms. Guess what? Same attitude. A thank you for staying? NO, nothing. The one thing is that I was confronted by the bellman demanding to me what did I need when I parked out front during check out. Now the topping on the cake, they charge me $5 for an Evian water that I did not open and did not drink, but they charged me for it after I had already checked out. I called to ask them to correct this and they gave me some other number to call to get it corrected as they said it was over 24 hours from when I checked out. AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! It's a shame because there were a lot of great, warm wonderful people that worked there, but not enough for me. I cancelled the remainder of my nights at the Del Mar Marriott and ended up moving to the Hilton Garden Inn Carlsbad - Highly recommened.

I was disappointed that I got a Marriott (4 stars, I thought, yea right) that wasn't right near Sea World and that saved me only 75 dollars for the three nights. (On another trip we got the Islandia for $90 a night!). But, I was glad to be getting out of town. My disappointment began to ease when on (very late) arrival the lovely desk clerk upgraded us to a balcony room when I said it would be great if we have a view for our daughter, who loves to be high up. I did not specifically ask for an upgrade, but it was available so she gave it to me. She discussed with me the merits of the various views available and then changed us from our original room assignment. We were given several goody bags for my daughter's amusement and were taken up to the room and given the fridge we'd asked for. The room was nicely decorated with a sort of nautical flair. The throws on the bed were a nice touch. We fell into our exceptionally comfortable beds. (Their advertising is correct -- their beds and bedding are just lovely). My normally restless daughter was asleep very quickly. The view was great -- the marina and its lights to our left and downtown San Diego to our right. I should mention the shampoo and conditioner they offer is terrific as are all the room amenities. We had purchased two-day Sea World tickets on the park's website, but decided to go Saturday so we could just relax on Friday and my husband could get some work done. (I recommend their website -- if the park is busy, you just go to the turnstile and present your print out -- no lines). We had to pay extra for his online access, but the charge was reasonable. My morning mood depends on a double espresso, so when I went to LC's (their casual restaurant in the north tower) with my daughter I asked if they had espresso or should I go up to Starbucks in the hotel and bring it in with me. They said no, they could offer it. But, when breakfast came, they brought regular (weak, awful) coffee apologizing that their machine was broken. I explained that that wasn't going to work for me and they went and got me my coffee upstairs. It took a while, but was done with very good grace. They also brought a bagel instead of an English muffin and hash browns instead of fruit. These mistakes were again corrected with a good attitude. We then walked around -- my daughter was delighted with the ducks and fish in the ponds encircling the tower near the pool. After that we changed and went to the pool, which is a freeform design and is quite large and pleasant. A towel kiosk is right there and fresh towels are always available. After swimming and sunning, my husband joined us and we all ate lunch at umbrella tables near the pool using the poolside dining service, which was basic but good. The Irish girl waiting on us was very busy, but had a great attitude, so the wait didn't seem so bad! With no shade next to the pool it was a little hot, but I doubt there'd be room for umbrellas. My daughter was tired from the trip so we got her an online movie and we napped and read. After a pleasant walk along the marina looking for a restaurant, we realized our daughter was too over-the-hill and opted for dinner in our room. The delivery from outside restaurants had stopped, so we were left with room service. Her kid's pizza meal was reasonably priced and pronounced delicious. She thinks room service is just awesome. I have to agree! We waited to order after her bedtime and had a romantic dinner in the little area between the bathroom and the closet! But the chicken porcini pasta with a tomato cream sauce was excellent and came with a very good ceasar salad. The room service table had a warmer so we could eat our salads and still have hot pasta and dessert. Our wines by the glass were excellent. Next time I'll bring candles for the table! Based on the prices I was seeing on our walk back to the hotel, I think we did just fine. Next morning we did Starbucks breakfast for all of us so we could get an earlier start to Sea World. The Marriott parking attendant gave us a map on our way out and explained the best way to go. We ended up saving bundle of time because we didn't take the obvious exit marked \"Sea World\" but followed his directions. We weren't far at all from the park, and given the traffic, I'm not sure being close would have helped that much. You still have to line up and get into the parking lot. Again, good service, offered in a friendly way from the Marriott made our stay more pleasant. We ate at the park that day -- it is what it is. Our daughter had seen the late nght swimmers at the Marriott and was dying to swim at night, so we ate at the Yacht Club restaurant to save time. Based on the menu I was expecting good things. Her kids meal was fine. The crabcake starter was excellent -- good quality crabcakes well prepared, so I was looking forward to the rest of the meal. But our shared salad and seafood pasta left a lot to be desired. Yes the salad was fresh and the dressings were original to the restaurant but strangely flavored. The house vinaigrette was very sweet and the honey/mustard we got to replace it was made with Chinese, not Dijon, mustard so was overly strong and unbalanced. The seafood pasta also was odd. The shrimps and scallops were very well prepared, but the sauce, which sounded like a classic garlic and oil, was very strongly flavored of lemon -- as if it were for a seafood salad. Big mistake and a real wine killer. My pinot grigio was not as good as the one I got with room service. We didn't have time to replace anything as we wanted to get swimming and get our daughter to bed, but if it had been just the two of us, I think we would have sent both dishes back. The night swim was lots of fun for all of us. The pool was thankfully nicely heated, since a wind had come up off the harbor. The swim plus the lovely bed sent our daughter to dreamland very quickly. That's it. I'm getting her a featherbed! Sunday, my husband and daughter headed to Sea World. I had a tummy upset (I think I can blame that on Sea World's food!) , which gave me an excuse to finish my novel and rest. I then had a lovely swim after packing up our things. We had asked for late check out, which they let us have until 1:30 pm. They stored our bags until my family arrived back from the park. The very nice baggage guy explained that it could take a while to get the bag out of the baggage claim, so to be aware of that. I was able to go call for the bags when my husband called to say they were on their way back. He also advised us to get on the road as the traffic from San Diego to LA can really pile up in the late afternoon /early evening. We did after a quick lunch at Horton Plaza (a nearby downtown outdoor mall with many food choices) and made excellent time. So. I have to concede -- it is a 4-star hotel. Service was excellent, friendly, and courteous. It's a big hotel with a combination of families, young couples and conventioneers. It seems to be bustling all the time. It's part of a chain and a huge hotel group, but it felt as if each person who helped us had a personal stake in our stay and our enjoyment. Requests from the \"at your service desk\" were delivered promptly (extra towels, extra plastic bags, etc.) Advice we received was correct and helpful. The only improvement I could see was in the food at the yacht club and LCs.

Other than the partying conventioneers below our room two nights, it was quiet, which was a huge improvement over our last stay in the South Tower. We still love the breakfast buffet (although $18 is on the expensive side), and the location can't be beat. That's all the positive stuff I can think of. The experience wasn't *terrible, by any means, but there was a constant trickle of annoyances, from a broken shower handle that cut my hand (and was apparently the source of the bloody shower curtain that was there when we arrived....) to the thow-up-the-covers-and-call-it-made approach to bedmaking our housekeeper employed. The refrigerator didn't work and smelled of mildew. The bathtub didn't get cleaned well once while we were there. We didn't get the foam pillows we requested in advance, and our inability to get TWO extra BATH towels, every day for the duration of our stay, requested in writing via the Marriott website (and confirmed) in advance, reached the point of absurdity. By the end of the week I did a commando raid on a housekeeping cart to get the towels. We got six bottles of conditioner, and only two of shampoo, over the course of the week. The pool area, which looks lovely, still, was festooned with little dabs of duck poop from the three families of ducks that live there. Worse, it stayed in the same spots from day to day (ew). The piped-in muzak at the pool was incredibly loud, and the bass was turned WAY up so you got hours of constant reggae beat, full-blast. We'd go ask at the pool shack for them to turn it down, they would, and then twenty minutes later some other shack employee would blast it again. For the money, the Embassy Suites (where we stayed earlier this year) delivers a much nicer facility and better service.

Imagine my surprise when they said yes, gave us perfect directions from I-5. Upgraded our rooms, we had really cool rooms, on the very end of the north tower. We had two balconies, one pretty good size and one small one. Pretty much the seam of the building. Rooms were non smoking, king beds and side by side. Just as we had requested. The bed and shower weren't as great as the Hilton in LA, but we would have stayed at this Marriott a week. Everyone was very friendly, helpful, and when we checked out the next day the girl at the parking booth asked how many people I had with me and she gave me complimentary water (2 each because they were small she said)to take with us.

The hotel has several noteworthy qualities; some are highlighted as follows: 1. Striking architecture and lush landscaping. An almond-shaped tower and its neighboring concave-curved tower, both with dark, reflective glass, are unique to San Diego's skyline. 2. Comfortable and clean guest rooms. We appreciated the bed with six pillows; sofa, chair, and coffee table; and a small refrigerator. The spotless bathroom had thick towels and ample sundries. 3. Variety of food service. We enjoyed the full buffet breakfast at LC's in the North Tower and salads and sandwiches for lunch at the Yacht Club Restaurant. Tasty and generous room-service meals for dinner were delivered in 30 minutes. 4. Hotel maintenance. We made one phone call to the hotel operator to report our broken desk lamp. It was repaired in an hour. 5. Reservations and registration. We called the hotel directly to reserve our senior-rate room. Upon arrival we received everything for which we had asked, and the staff made us feel like welcome guests. Other comments: 1. We arrived when there was a great deal of activity at the city's convention center next door. We were caught in the wrong traffic lane for hotel registration and spent 20 minutes to correct our error. 2. Valet parking cost $25 per day for hotel guests. With all of the activity, we were grateful to use the services of a polite and helpful vehicle attendant. 3. There was loud music from a nearby outdoor amphitheatre on both Sunday and Monday evenings. This could be a positive for some. However, we prefer selecting our own music and listening when we choose to do so. When we closed the balcony door and drapery, the sound was mitigated but could still be heard in the room.

We had a great opportunity to visit several Marriott hotels in the area ( for other reviews from this trip check out Marriott Coronado Island Resort, Courtyard San Diego Downtown, and Gas Lamp Marriott) The Marina Marriott was probably my favorite hotel we stayed at. We always like to have a nice large pool area, this one rivaled any resort. There are 2 pools, lots of chairs and towels, extra room on a near by grassy area for lounging when the pool area gets to crowded. They have a great Tiki bar by the pool and food service delivered right to your lounge chair. Pleanty of servers in the area to get you anything you need. The grounds are very nice, we really enjoyed the fire pits and sitting areas, there is a restaurant overlooking the marina, I think another 2 inside on the lower level, one is more casual, the other is more upscale. There are also 2 bars up on the lobby level a pub type and another more of a chill lounge. The hotel has two towers, the North seems to be a little newer and had a more contemporary feel, the South was also nice but has a more standard hotel feel, perhaps to be restyled, but both are clean and nice. The north side did have balconies on the majority of the rooms however, so maybe just more expensive in general.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a light sleeper by any means, but the first night at 4:40 AM, then the next night at 3:45 AM the train pulled in, and for 5-6 minutes each time, it laid on bursts from it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horn that were LOUD. We took the advise of previous write-ups and got a room facing the bay, but still the noise came through like it was right below us. I love this place, but sadly, I will not return to any hotel in this area until this situation with the train horns is resolved. $250 a night is a rarity for us to pay, but this was our anniversary and the hotel, by itself, is definitely worth it. But I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay $50 a night to stay somewhere when I know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to be jarred awake in the middle of each night. This hotel, along with others in the south part of the Gaslamp Quarter all suffer from the same affliction. They need to either lower the tracks or build bridges over them so that they can fence in and isolate the trains and eliminate the need for the use of the horns. In the meantime, my only suggestion would either be to wear earplugs or leave the TV on as loud as you can bear it and still sleep.", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, FL", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Fabulous\u201d", "Author": "UCFTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR4983959", "Content": "I stayed at the San Diego Marriott and Marina for a large conference.

Like other readers wrote on here, the South Tower had no balconies (some for some rooms), but most didn't and even though they probably had a great view too, they didn't seem as nice. The pool was a nice size but we didn't spend much time there because it was only in the high 50's this week, yikes! We walked (not far) every evening to Seaport Village which had little shops and great restaurants. Upstart Crow was my favorite coffee stop because they had great coffee, pastries and books to sit and read (or buy). There was a homemade cookie stand that was great too. The Fish Market was at the farthest end of the village (a nice hike), next to the SS Midway ship. We sat outside (on the lower level) right on the peer and had the best PRAWNS in cocktail sauce. Saw the sunset...etc. really good food. Negatives? Well, someone wrote before about dust behind their dresser and even put a picture on here. I too felt they needed to really concentrate on those little details. They needed a good vaccuum to go along the baseboards, etc. I complained to the concierge and he made sure they vacuumed really well the next morning. The bathroom was nice, and the area with a mirror, sink and closet was around corner not to disturb sleepers around the corner. Yes, I heard the trains, but no they didn't bother me at all. We didn't sleep with the door open, even though we could have, but it was a bit chilly. So, we barely heard them. I can see if someone faced the street side, then it could be a big problem. There is a Starbucks on the lobby level, fresh cold drinks in lobby, great bellman, gift shops and those brave enough to try the trolley, it was write in front of the hotel. We just couldn't figure out the trolley (it was really the train), and gave up and drove to places. Parking was too expensive, ($24), but all the hotels charged about that. Valet's very fast though.

The hot tub was very nice and felt wonderful. The location absolutely can't be beat. You are literally steps from Seaport Village (lots of great shops and restaurants). You are also right on the edge of the Gaslamp District. It's walkable.

After realizing they didn't connect, I had to argue with the front desk clerk who insisted they did. When she finally conceded the point, she asked couldn't we just stay in adjacent rooms? Although a parent's dream perhaps, I think that's called child neglect. The concierges were quite variable; some fabulously helpful, while others were downright dismissive. One day the valet presented a family member with the WRONG CAR! They couldn't find the correct car, so we had none of the car seats for that group. This nearly ruined our outing that day. Some of us were charged for both self-parking and valet parking. One family member received her bill a day early and called to say that wasn't her checkout day. They agreed she was indeed booked for one more night, but insisted she would have to move rooms anyway. This was the last straw. Only when the brother who made all the reservations called and lost his cool did they finally admit alll their screw-ups and 'allow' her to stay in her room.

I had the Wild @ Work Package which included breakfast, bayview room, free parking, and a discount on restaurants (which we didn't use) We arrived late from the East Coast on the 1st and were given a balcony room on a high floor in the North Tower, as I requested. We were very hungry, but no restaurants were open (it was about 10 pm), so we had to order room service. It was pricey, but not ridiculous for room service. The room was clean and nicely decorated. However, as we went to bed I noted that it had a pass through door to the next room, and the person next door was clearly watching TV. It was very loud. The elevator was also close by and you could hear a 'whooshing' sound. The next morning, I went to the front and desk and asked for a quieter room. They mentioned that about half the rooms had pass throughs, but found me one on the 16th floor that did not and was slightly further away from the elevator. We set up there and that room was much quieter. I also liked that the beds faced the open balcony, so you could actually see the Harbor while lying down. The rooms have refridgerators which is a nice touch, also--there is a grocery store (Ralph's) two blocks from the Convention Center to buy soda/water at. I also announced a few minor cleanliness issues--some dust accumulate, etc. Nothing major. The decor in the rooms is modern and fresh and looks fairly new, as does the North Tower lobby (where there is a fairly bad lounge singer on weekend nights). Two problems areas: Elevators and parking. I'm not sure if all the elevators were working, but in peak times the waits could be bothersome...10 minutes or so and very crowded. Self parking was also a problem. I'm not a fan of valet parking and my wife and I like to go out and back a lot (plus self park was included), but space was pretty tight and at times we had to fight with other cars for spaces (like at the mall during Thanksgiving shopping week). Perhaps when the hotel is less busy, it isn't a problem. Also, you have to give your room number and name to the attendant and wait while they look it up (problematic if you change rooms like we did the first night)--I wish they would install a device where you can just insert your room key and go. That would be much simpler and faster. Breakfast each morning was very high quality. The package included the full buffet which featured the standard Marriott omelette and waffle bars, among other goodies. However, since it was Labor Day weekend it was very crowded. Servers were friendly and trying hard, but I don't there were enough to handle the crowd. Wait time was around 15 mins for 2 people, plus a decent sized wait up at the buffet. Still, I'm a picky eater but the food was excellent and I would recommend this, especially if you have a package. We didn't eat at the other restaurants because of all the options around San Diego. The location of the hotel is fanstastic...adjacent to a board walk that includes the Hyatt and Seaport village. Its an easy walk down to the USS Midway, which by the way was an outstanding attraction. Its also just a short stroll over to the Gaslamp Quarter, but the setting is nicer than the hotels there because its a little more sedate and relaxed setting. The grounds of the hotel are quite nice and tropical. There is a large pool, but as another reviewer noted it was quite busy with kids during the day. At night it was very nice (though San Deigo weather makes it a little chilly). The jacuzzi was crowded at night (they could use a larger one) and a bit too hot for my tastes, but my wife liked it. Overall, this is a very nice hotel. We did look around the city at other hotels and ended up being very happy we went with the Marriott Marina. We were also considering the Gaslamp Marriott which is only a few blocks away, but that new property is very 'chic' and didn't strike us as anything special. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel despite a few minor flaws.

It took several calls to the front desk to get these issues resolved, and even after multiple attempts, the room was not clean to our satisfaction (and I don't think our expectations are unreasonably high).

We were there during Labor Day weekend, so the pool area was VERY busy (getting a lounge chair after noon was virtually impossible) and the pool was full of screaming, splashing kids, but it was pleasant during the weekdays before all the weekend guests arrived. Parking isn't cheap so it's a good idea to look for a package that includes it. The hotel location is great and overall, it was a reasonably good experience. I would stay there again if they dealt with the cleanliness issues.", "Date": "September 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new zealand", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Location\u201d", "Author": "jasper1", "ReviewID": "UR3704717", "Content": "The Marriot was great and far surpassed our expectations from the service to the location.

The rooms are a bit larger than the usual downtown hotel and on the harbor side of the hotel they each have a balcony with a nice view of Coronado across the bay and the yacht harbor below. The desk was convenient for working with cable access available. My room had a safe large enough for my laptop computer. The North Tower contains the breakfast restaurant (Las Cascadas) which has an excellent breakfast buffet, and the lunch/dinner restaurant (the Yacht Harbor) with outdoor and indoor eating. By my third breakfast, the restaurant staff knew me and vice versa. I felt the hotel staff was friendly and proud of this beautiful hotel. One waiter was very rude on one occasion, and I reported this incident to the restaurant manager, who sincerely apologized and went out of her way to be extra nice to me throughout the rest of the stay. Apology accepted! I ordered room service one night and it arrived in just 20 minutes. The hotel is just a five minute walk to the Convention Center. Here is a tip to save a minute or two getting there. When wallking to the Convention Center, instead of walking out the front door of the hotel and turning right, instead, go almost to the end of the lobby on the South Tower side (near Starbuck's), and then take the escalator down to the parking lot and from there the Convention Center is a few feet away. This might not sound like a shortcut, but it is. The Gaslight District is walking distance away from the hotel - about eight blocks. This hotel is the closest hotel to the SD Convention Center and there are many places in the hotel lobby to meet informally with other conventioneers. The price was a bit steep at $255 per night plus taxes, but this is a clean, professional, spacious, and architecturally attractive hotel.", "Date": "June 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cAmateurish,unprofessional treatment\u201d", "Author": "Grundoon", "ReviewID": "UR3510975", "Content": "A really nice facility, great location, everything in good repair; but...

Reservations lady announced she did have a non-smoking room for me after all, and that they could keep their promise. Absolutely not the way a supposed four-star property should do business. On the local level, management needs to be reminded that front-line employees such as bellhops give guests the first, and possibly only, impression of how the property is run. In this case, the head bellhop needs to be taken behind closed doors and sternly taught/re-taught how to treat guests.

This hotel is ideally situated between Seaport Village and the Gaslamp Quarter. You are in easy walking distance to Petco Park to see the Padres play baseball. I would also suggest taking the Marriott ferry across the bay over to the Coronado Marriott. We had a great time walking around Coronado too.

The noise from the nearby train is not horrendous, at least if you are on the bayside and used to urban sounds. The pool area is quite beautiful, but there is no view of the bay. And seagulls and ducks are the most frequent swimmers in the pool. It is not quite disgusting, but knowing the germs such birds carry, I would personally not allow my children to swim in such a pool.

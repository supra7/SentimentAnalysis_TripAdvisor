The decor is urban modern, and the bathroom mirror gives the wildest highlight reflections to your pupils. The continental breakfast was nothing special, but the price was right.

We checked in around 7ish I think it was. I forget now the name of the person that checked us in, but it was a very pleasant experience. I went ahead and played the birthday card and we were giving a nice upgrade to one of the junior suites. Room was gorgeous. We really didn't need the kitchenette, but it was well laid out. We were on the 4th floor of the annex building looking out over Broadway. Having lived in the city before, the noise never bothers me. The hardwood floor in the main area and the tile in the bathroom really gave it a great touch. And the shower. Wow, just wow. Love the rainfall shower head. And the rich dark colors of the wall tile really worked well. The bed was wonderfully comfortable. Being as we were out late and sleeping in, we didn't partake of housekeeping during the stay, but we had a moment to chat with the lady, and she did seem quite nice. Really just did not want to leave the room. As my friend commented, one could practically live in it, as it was about as large as the average studio apartment in Chicagoland. Departure day was very smooth. We over slept a little and when I called and asked for a late checkout 1hr past normal time, it was granted very cheerfully with no hesitation. Working in the hospitality industry myself, I always tend to be very judgmental when I stay somewhere. This hotel met, and in some cases exceeded my expectations.

For personal reasons, this trip we needed to stay in the Lakeview area of Chicago. There aren't many hotels in that part of town to choose from and, more or less blindly, we selected the Hawthorne Terrace. From the moment we arrived we were impressed. The welcome from the front desk was friendly and efficient. The room, while on the small side, was way more than adequate. The bed and the linens were amazing for a hotel in this price range. The bathroom was totally new, with good water pressure, terrific lighting and plenty of counter space. Two bottles of water were provided each night, complentary, and the internet was complimentary too. It wasn't opulent luxury like a Four Seasons, but the bed, the bottled water (for which Four Seasons charges $5-8), the internet service (for which we've paid $12-15 per night),and the bathroom amenities made us wonder why we stay at Four Seasons properties for 4 times more (at least). We checked out to drive up to Wisconsin for a family reunion. Two days later, as we were planning to fly out of O'Hare to go home, all flights were cancelled due to a pending blizzard. Rather than stay at the airport, we chose to go back to the Hawthorne Terrace. They remembered us, felt sorry for us in our plight, and gave us the same rate we had had over the weekend and upgraded us to a lovely suite, complete with kitchen, dual sink vanity in the bathroom, and a spacious walk-in shower. We had another great bed with quality linens and toughed out the storm. Two days later we were able to fly out and, as much as we were anxious to return home, we were actually sorry to be leaving such a terrific find. The location was great, with plenty of restaurants, clubs, and fun shops within walking distance. I would give this place an A+ in just about every aspect.

I last stayed here more than 6 years ago and was surprised by the changes. While the bricked outdoor terrace and small lobby seemed to be almost the same as I remembered from our last stay, the rooms had obviously been renovated. Our room was on the 3th floor near the elevators but hardly ever heard any noise. Gone were the old fashion looking wallpaper, beige everywhere, with cheap looking curtains, fake pressboard furniture, the typical polyester comforters and circa-1990s TV. Instead, the room was in warm browns, the curtain was replaced by plantation shutters, there was a 42in flat panel LCD, nice wood furniture with actual headboard, and nice plush bedding with duvet. The room also had a small refrigerator with separate freezer, two complementary daily bottles of water, as well as a microwave and a Kurig single-serving coffee maker with various flavors. The bath was also renovated with matching tiled floor and tub/shower surround, rainshower, and even a nice, large back-lit mirror. I wish I had taken pictures of the hotel to upload so you could see all the improvements! I didn't get a chance to see what the continental breakfast looked like, nor the fitness room with jacuzzi, but we were busy having fun taking in the neighborhood with unique shops, a variety of restaurants, and the nightlife of \"Boystown.\" Not to say that everything was all great. It's still a small hotel with limited in-house amenities. They couldn't see my reservation because it was not booked on the Best Western website (just showed the front desk person the e-mail confirmation on my phone and it was all good), and the tub drained pretty slow, but what can I expect from a building that's probably 100yrs old. The room rate was somewhat more than the below $100/nt deals I could have gotten for similar or even nicer hotels in the Loop or Michigan Ave, but the location was ideal for our purposes of nightlife and restaurants as we walked to everything and probably saved a small fortune on cabs. This is Chicago after all, and parking is scarce and once you park, you almost never want to move your car. Fortunately, parking was only $22/nt (it was valet parking in the garage was next to hotel with in-and-out privileges) compared to $40+ at downtown hotels. There are two red-line train stations, each a 5-10min walk if you want to brave the winter weather, which we did. There are many good restaurants in the area. Don't miss Ann Sathers across the street for a good breakfast place. Down the street is Joy's Noodle and Rice Restaurant for Thai. PingPong was also down the street--very popular contemporary Asian restaurant populated by the mostly younger and trendy crowd, waits for a table even during the week may be long without reservations, and somewhat loud with the blaring music.

Other than Wrigley Field, there's really nothing else \"touristy\" to do in this area, however the \"L\" stop at Addison is a convenient way to get downtown. The room was fairly comfortable, and I felt it was decent value for what we paid. My only negatives would be 1) the air conditioner, and 2) the maid service. After playing around with the air conditioner for a while, we determined that when set at 70 degrees, the air conditioner would pump such cold air into the room that you could store meat for long periods of time without concern. For a hotel stay however, it was way too cold. The unfortunate thing was that once you turned it up just one degree to 71, the air temperature quickly made us feel as though we were in the southern Caribbean. There was no comfortable temperature, it was either extremely hot, or extremely cold. We finally just unplugged it. Our second complaint was the maid service. We left the room at 8:30am and placed one of those \"make up the room please\" signs on the door. When we returned at 4:30pm, we were disappointed that they did not make it to our room yet. Finally at around 5:15pm the maid made it to our room, at which point we told her not to bother. Definite room for improvement in that area.

My room was a queen way at the back of the hotel (literally; my window looked into the courtyard of the apartment building behind the hotel) on the 4th floor. It was a small room but perfect for one person. The bathroom was big and bright and the bed had 5 pillows. There's a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker in the room and a safe that will fit a standard size laptop. My only complaint about the room setup is that it's not possible to watch TV from the bed because of where it's positioned. This may be unique to the queen rooms, though. One piece of advice: I've never seen a hotel with slower housekeeping staff. I went to a Cubs game and got back at 4:00 pm and my room still wasn't made up. They were working on the room across the hall so I just gave them my trash since I didn't really need fresh towels after one night. On future mornings I put the \"housekeeping please\" sign on the doorknob and it was done before I came back. I did hear them working on rooms as late as 5:00 pm which seems rather slow when there were only 17 rooms on the floor. The continental breakfast is another weakness. It was instant oatmeal, pastries, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs. I've stayed at many Best Westerns and other mid-price chains and this was probably the least substantial breakfast I've ever seen. There is also no dedicated breakfast room...you can eat in the lobby, on the patio, or back in your room. Despite these minor complaints, I would certainly stay here again.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cCentral Location\u201d", "Author": "arabhammerhead", "ReviewID": "UR36543711", "Content": "The strongest point about this hotel is its location.

The decor of the room. The room had that nasty green BW carpet, the wall paper looked like something from the waiting area of an Old Country Buffet, the internet (wireless) was very spotty and dropped quite a few times, the safe did not fit my laptop, the contraption that help the tv was in faced west and the bed was facing north south so one could not lay in bed and watch tv. That is all the negative that I have to say about the hotel. I was located in room 215. This is on the second floor all the way down the hall going east. The room was quite roomy for two people and if I do say so bigger then what I am used to for hotel rooms that I've had lately. Not a complaint just an observation. I found the staff to be casual and very nice. I didn't feel I couldn't ask them for directions and what not if needed. To the north there is a Treasure Island (a Euro grocery store which kicks azz!), there is also a 24 hr Jewell grocery store. Go to the south a few blocks and there is a Walgreens. Location wise at least for me this is a great place! My favorite coffee place Intelligentsia is only a few blocks, the red line for the EL is also a short walk to either the Addison or Belmont stop. I got a really great rate on this hotel about 92 usd a night. Rates for this hotel being so close to Wrigley can go up to 200 usd a night so do your research and don't be afraid to ask for a sighs lower rate. That is what I did and got 10% knocked off that. Oh SNAP! I almost forgot the best thing about this hotel. THE PILLOWS!!!!! OMG!!!!! I rarely if ever go right to sleep when my head hits the pillow. I am usually still laying there 30 or so mins later but not staying here. I was out in prob 5-10 mins at the most.

Decor is ok. Check-in and check-out were both quick and easy. The included breakfast buffet is really weak, but Ann Sathers across the street is amazing so no need to eat at the hotel anyway. We stayed three days/nights, including the single rainiest day in Chicago's history. I took it for granted that a hotel that bills itself as an \"elegant boutique hotel\" would have umbrellas for guests to use. Our bill averaged over $300/night with taxes - for that money I would definitely expect some umbrellas sitting near the main door or in the room. Nope. Not a single one. I had to run down the street in the pouring rain with my 11-month-old to get a cheap one at a local store. And here is my other hotel-related rain complaint. The ramp that comes into the hotel is fully visible to the front desk staff. It's curvy and takes a little while to navigate with a stroller or the luggage cart. There were numerous times when I was trying to navigate a stroller with one hand while carrying an umbrella with the other hand. Approaching the lobby door, the 2-3 otherwise unoccupied people at the front desk would be watching this. Never once did one of them come around to help with the door. It wasn't just me - they never helped with the door with anyone else either - old people, people loaded down with luggage, etc.... NOT what I would expect for $300+ a night.

They would be wise to add a second tv for the other side of the room though. The hotel is situated in the \"boys town\" area of Chicago so if you are not a fan of alternative lifestyles you may want to pass on this hotel. The ceiling/floors are pretty thin and at 2:00am you can hear any lovers quarel within a few rooms. Not the hotels fault for rude/unruly guests, but I was very offended by what I heard. Hotel management gave the standard theres nothing we could do although it went on for more than 30 minutes. Parking is impossible so prepare to hand your keys over to the garage next door although you can come and go with a ticket from the hotels front desk. Beds were very comfy and extra pillows were already in the room. Breakfast was standard fare and kids don't mind that! Would I go back? Yes because of location although I would ask for a room on the top floor and deal with the terribly slow elevator.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, IL", "Title": "\u201cVery Cute Hotel!

We were visiting Chicago as a little getaway for my birthday! We had tickets to a Cubs game and this hotel was perfect because it is only like 5 Blocks from Wrigleyfield. The hotel is in a great location if you want to experience Chicago without all of the hustle & bustle of being downtown. There were several little bars and restuarants all within walking distance and Lake Michigan was only about 2 blocks away! We actually spent alot of our time just walking around the neighborhoods and enjoying all of the views of the old homes & historic buildings. The hotel itself was so cute! It was very small and had a more of a bed and breakfast feel about it. I would reccomend this hotel to visitors young and old! It was a great choice!", "Date": "September 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evanston, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cIf you love Ashtrays and poor customer service\u201d", "Author": "ebking22", "ReviewID": "UR3754527", "Content": "This was the worst hotel I stayed at in Chicago! If you are looking for a hotel to smoke in, this is your dream hotel. If you want a manager who is all about making your stay the worst possible experience Manager Stephen Hampton is your guy. Rather than write an essay about how terrible my experience was here just do your self a favor and stay at another place. If you want something in this neighborhood with great service, clean rooms and quaint charm I recommend the Majestic Hotel just up the street (528 West Brompton).

First of all, the location is excellent. The hotel is located in the heart of Japantown, which is a great combination of interesting and safe. The restaurants and shops are plenty and good: definitely worth exploring. It is also blocks away from the stylish Filmore street where you can find excellent restaurants, bars and upscale boutiques. BART and many of the areas' most popular tourist attractions are a short bus ride away. Second, Hotel Tomo has large, clean rooms. The king-bed room that I stayed in was large enough to accommodate two adults comfortably and came with a good-size bathroom (unlike those tiny little ones found in many of the SF hotels), plenty of workspace, and FREE in-room wifi (for which many other hotels charge an exorbitant fee). The room was clean when I checked in. On one of the days of my stay, the maid did a sloppy job of cleaning it, but it was good the rest of the time. The decor of the room and the hotel is fun and quirky. If you are a fan of anime/manga, you will love it. If you prefer a more \"traditional\" hotel decor, you might feel a bit puzzled at staying at a room that is decorated like a bedroom of a Japanese teenager. I personally liked it. Although I am far from a teenager by decades, it was nice to stay in a room that felt more like a bedroom in a home than an impersonal/bland hotel room, especially when it had all the comforts of a hotel. Third, the value is great. It was cheaper than the B&B (as lovely in a vintage-sort of way as it was) I stayed at in my last trip! The restaurant in the hotel serves both \"American\" and Japanese breakfast options at a reasonable price (I enjoyed the Japanese option, which was excellent). Fourth, the staff at the hotel were efficient and attentive. To me, this is important. One tip: Although the hotel offers parking ($25 plus parking tax), you can park your car at the nearby Japan Center parking lot for much cheaper ($19, including the tax). I didn't find out about this until the last day, but now you know!", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGood value and comfort\u201d", "Author": "deranieri", "ReviewID": "UR125757411", "Content": "The Hotel Tomo is a great value in a city that has a tendency toward great hotel expense.

They apparently have a problem with their irons being stolen and I found it quite annoying to have to try and iron with the iron tied to the ironing board. The Japantown location isnt great. Its not really in walking distance to anything. However, the number 2 and 3 muni bus stop is right across the street and comes about every 20 min. providing access to Union Sq. If you are coming from the airport contact the hotel for shuttle transportation ($16 one way). Otherwise, tthe BART is $9 to the nearest station to the hotel and then $2 for the bus to the hotel-- much easier and quicker to take the shuttle. I did not find the hotel restaurant to be very good. However, there is an excellent Thai restaurant right across the street on Buchanan St. that offers very good food at reasonable prices.

We put on the table 40$ and waited for 15min for the change! Once they realize we are not leaving without our 10$ they brought the change. After this we didn't even think of leaving the tip. Additionally, we were served like: eat and get out. To make it clear it's a Japanese restaurant so the staff is Japanese (at I assume so). Except us there were few Asian families. They were served and left in peace to eat. We were served and once one of us finished (me that one small bun) they took away from me the plate, than the cup were I had tea - all made us feel like \"just eat, get out and leave a big tip\"...

I didn't expect her to know which room had scary art; I just wanted to know whether I could come back and change rooms if I found that the art work was not suitable for young children.

Another staff person was present and she commented that there's lots of availability, so I can keep looking until I find a suitable room.

Right on the edge of Japantown is a blocky, almost brutalistic Best Western Hotel circa the late 1960s/early 1970s, complete with popcorn ceilings and metal doors. But it seems that someone came up with the brilliant idea to go way left of center with the inevitable renovation. Rather than aspiring to some kind of zen retreat ala the nearby Kabuki Hotel, why not do something cheap but fun? Instead of dark stained ebony, use knotty pine. Instead of images of geishas and crashing waves, why not channel kitschy Harajuku and manga fabulousity? The result is something that is less Akira Kurosawa and more Akira, the animated manga movie. The Hotel TOMO! was born. The room itself was very large, especially by San Francisco standards, and was quite comfortable and stylish, including a flat screen TV, a hanging George Nelson ball lamp and free wi-fi. The restaurant served Japanese-style fare (big surprise, I know), and in typical Japanese fashion, the portions were tiny but tasty.

Overall, it is a decent budget hotel, but with a few key flaws. Personally, I will not come back here again. Pros: - decent size rooms for an OK price (~100-120 per night); - the hotel can accommodate 4 people, so it may be good for families with kids; - small fridge in the room. Cons: - location. The hotel is in a pretty safe area, BUT it is about 1-3 miles from any place you would want to be. If you are disinclined to walk for half and hour to an hour to the spot you actually want to walk through, you're stuck taking 2-3 buses each way. Munis are good (run every 10-15 minutes normally), but by the end of the trip I got sick and tired of taking buses everywhere. There are hotels in about the same price range in MUCH better locations. - Wifi (free in-room) is horrendous. My e-mail took 1-2 minutes to load. Most websites didn't load at all. A few other guests I chatted with had the same problem. Ethernet was only a touch faster. In this day and age, having such slow internet is inexcusable. I travel a lot and this is by far the worst connection I ever had to use. Other issues: - the hotel is tired, everything is well worn and / or dirty. The pillowcases were torn in several places. The sheets were slightly stained and worn through from the wear. The mattress covers... don't get me started. - decor: I know they're going for something hip and original. Unfortunately, the decor comes off silly and ugly. The rooms are dark. the bathroom light is so dim you can barely see anything. The toilet and bathtub/shower is separated from the sink (makes for filthy door handles). The whole thing - a turn off, though personally not a deal breaker. - customer service (lack thereof) and security. I do not appreciate a friend of mine being able to get a new key to my room without even showing id. Pretty much anyone off the street could get access to my room. The next time he tried, he was asked for id. But consistency in security policies is essential.

We were on the top floor and could not hear any noise from neighbors. The location is reasonable, as long as you can stomach (or avoid) Filmore street where there is obvious poverty and it looks like a rough area, and as long as you don't mind asian food, since there is not much else in the immediate vicinity (except for Filmore St). There is a large IGA at 5 minutes walk where you can stock up on stuff for breakfast and right next to it there is also a laundromat. On the negative side, the windows are old (original) single pane, sliding, with metallic frame. Ours was facing west so there was quite a bit of heat gain, even with the curtains closed. The air conditioning does not work, regardless of the setting of the thermostat in the room, until someone complains to the front desk staff. Then, they turn it on. The official spin is that it needs to be \"reset\". I think management is just trying to save on electricity costs and they turn it way down for the whole building.

The hotel has a car-park attached, parking was $20 for a night. I didn't see any valet, it all seemed self-park.

And if you are walking to the shopping district, there's a friendly sports bar on the way where you can stop off, have a drink and watch English football.

It was both good and bad, hence the middling rating. It's obviously an older best western re-done in a cute J-Pop style. The bedrooms themselves are funky and bright in an Ikea-meets-Japan sort of way. Very clean. Although, for reasons I can't understand, someone thought painting a windowless interior bathroom dark grey and adding an opaque dark gray shower curtain and installing a single low wattage florescent bulb was a good idea. Unless you're a fan of prisons, it wasn't. However, the shower had good water pressure and lots of hot water. Beds, linens, and towels and such were all of the quality I would expect of a mid-priced hotel. When we first checked in at the front desk in the late afternoon, the desk clerk was indifferent. He gave us the key card and we headed up to the room only to discover it wasn't what we had booked. We'd paid for an upgrade to a upper room with a balcony. So we schlep back downstairs. He gives us another room key to the right room. It was a very long traveling day so we decide to just get snacks at the market (nice to have one nearby!) and settle in for evening of being couch potatoes and watching pay-per-view. Except the pay per view movies didn't work. We call down stairs to inquire what the problem could be. Mr. Personality at the desk says he doesn't know, and \"I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to tell you.\" When we indicate that it's really kinda his job to know these things, he tells us his colleague who actually knows something about the hotel systems will be in a half hour. As promised, a half hour or so later, the competent employee shows up. He fiddles with the cable box, indicates that it is indeed broken and offers to move us to yet another room. So we switch rooms for a third time. In fairness, the nighttime employee was very helpful and accommodating, he apologized, brought a cart to tote the luggage and gave us a free pass for a couple breakfasts at the hotel dining room. That was nice, considering the day-shift guy's attitude was \"hey, sucks to be you.\" While the hotel offers free wireless, forget actually trying to use it for more than a couple minutes at a time. It's intermittent at best and drops out constantly. They outsource the service and it took multiple phone calls to get the service running. Even with help, it's not consistent. If you actually plan on doing some work, you will be frustrated. The next day, again, we come back to the room that night to find that TV and lamp in the desk area isn't working. We fiddle with the surge protector under the desk to no avail. We call down. Guy comes up. Apparently the surge protector has to be \"jiggled\" just right in the outlet. I can only guess that the maid accidently unjiggled it while sweeping. (frankly the wiring and multiple extension cords all looked like a fire waiting to happen) On the day we left, we went to the house computers to print out our boarding passes. Attached to both the computers were \"out of order signs\" indicating that they wouldn't be fixed until the next day. The woman at the desk was nice enough to log on and print out the passes. That evening, I I had to go to three different floors to find a coke machine that actually worked. No exaggeration. So we met two very good employees and one very indifferent one. The room was nice, the bathroom was creepy and there were multiple issues with the amenities. The front desk did eventually make some monetary adjustments for all of the inconveniences, and that was nice, of course. I don't expect perfection, but I do expect problems to be corrected, alleviated, or compensated, which eventually they were. But equally, they would not have had to make such concessions IF items just worked as they are intended to in the first place. While the hotel is cute and it's in a nice location, but they really need to put some money into their infrastructure.

(Seniors unfamiliar with San Francisco should be aware that the senior rate is 50 cents to ride anywhere on the bus.) Service at Hotel Tomo was really excellent. Several times we called for replacement items of Kleenex, etc., and housekeeping was at our door within minutes. There were at least two people manning the reception desk at all times, so we never had to wait in line if we had a question. Two additional bonuses: Free wireless internet (or the desk will also provide a cable), and a very nice \"Little Gym\" with a rubberized floor, mats, free weights, a treadmill, an elyptical, and a bike. There were only two very minor things that were a bit less than satisfactory to us.

The bathroom was a typical Best Western bathroom and the shower area was very dark. The room was fairly clean, though, and it was a different experience. The bed is comfortable and the linens are decent. I'm a fan of the location - safe area with many eating choices, supermarkets, bus stop right in front of the hotel, away from the bustle of tourists. The hotel provides complimentary hi-speed internet access, but the wi-fi was unusably slow.

I anticipated having the same problems - rude service, slamming doors, lousy wifi connection, and fickle heating. However, given the uniqueness of Hotel Tomo, I was willing to give it a shot. I honestly can say that this hotel far surpassed my expectations and catered to all of my needs for my trip (efficient service, quiet floor, clean room, cool environment). Having said this, readers should keep in mind that this hotel IS a mid-range Best Western, and is neither a five star hotel nor a hostel. You won't get room service or ear-to-ear smiles from the staff, but you needn't worry about comfort, cleanliness, or safety. The service was great - I checked in quite late without any hitches, asked directions and questions of the front desk, and requested taxis from the staff. As my return flight was at 10 pm, the staff was quite amiable about storing my luggage, and actually refused a tip upon retrieving my bags! What prompted me to give this hotel an \"excellent\" score was the fact that a personalized letter from the head housekeeper was left on my desk, and the \"guest experience\" manager left a message on my phone to call her extension if I needed anything during my stay. During my visits to much higher end hotels, I only received these types of gestures when doing business with these properties. As just a \"regular\" guest, I found their messages quite personal and reassuring. The wifi worked perfectly, as did the tea kettle, alarm clock, A/C, and in-room safe. Yuzu-bergamot toiletries and the cushy robe were nice touches, and it was nice waking up to my own music on my ipod. A printer and two computers are available in the lobby for printing out boarding passes, maps, etc. Location is a bit far from the touristy parts of SF, but dead in the heart of Japantown. It was nice to be able to grab take-out ramen from Tanpopo and be back in my room within 5 minutes. A great Korean spa is only a few minutes away as well. A few minor CONS: Housekeeping staff did come knocking at my door at 8:30 am. Fortunately, I was already up, but for those wanting to sleep late, remember to hang that \"Do Not Disturb\" sign before you turn out the lights. Free breakfast may be too much to ask for, but putting complimentary coffee/tea/fruit in the lobby would be a nice touch. Overall, I would definitely stay here again. If you're not a fan of anime or don't have a sense of humor about the Tomo's decor (i.e., you're \"scared\" of the room murals!), I would advise you to look elsewhere.

When I travel I don't like to stay in touristy areas (so boring and monotonous), but at the same time I want easy access to wherever I want to go. Tomo didn't disappoint. There are plenty of MUNI bus stops just steps from the hotel. Cabs are pretty easy to come by as well (or the front desk can call one for you). With its location, you're also just 2 blocks from Fillmore St., where there are some great shops and restaurants. I also loved Kinokuniya Bookstore across the street from the hotel, in the little mall. My room with a king sized bed was really cool (loved the mural, the furniture, and the wood grain carpet!), but more importantly it was very clean. The only minor thing, which I knew ahead of time from reading TripAdvisor reviews, is that there's a daycare or something with kids right by the hotel.

It was super convienant. The rooms were nice. We had two queen beds, and they were nice and stiff. Very comfortable. I slept really well. Since there were three of us staying in there, I was going to get extra pillows, however, when I opened the bottom dresser drawer, there was a pillow waiting in there and in the 2nd drawer a feather comforter. :) The \"Do Not Disturb\" signs were really cute. They did call and ask when we left it up for more than a day if we were sleeping or wanted our room cleaned. Oops. haha I loved the giant bean bag thing. I think it was called a Fat Boy. That was nice. The window seat was really lovely. It was totally hard, but nice. We would set up the table by it since the table only has 2 chairs and play cards there at night. They had wireless which was really nice to be able to use the laptop. However, if you don't have a laptop, they do have computers in the lobby you can use. The restuarant was alright. We had breakfast there one morning. I got pancakes. They were ok. The service was very prompt though and friendly. Parking. The ramp, we could use one of the two nights we had a car. It was cool, I'm just glad we had a compact car though! The second night, we parked across the street at the mall ramp. That worked out well. It was only like $15 for overnight, and the spaces weren't so cramped. Japantown seemed very safe and was pretty convienant. I liked it. For the price, you really can't beat hotel tomo. It's simple, clean and fun. The staff is extremely helpful and knowledgable. The front desk booked shuttles for us to get back to the airport. All three of us had different flights. They let us split the room three ways and pay at all different times the day we checked out. It was very cool of them to let us do that so we didn't have to worry about that.

The hotel itself is okay, it was recently redone so everything was very new looking, and the decor is exactly what you would expect from this type of place. If you are staying a j-pop themed hotel, don't expect antiquity or that nothing will look like plastic. I thought that the rooms were very spacious, and the bed was a good size and comfortable. The location is just okay, but we chose this specific hotel in mind as it is within easy walking distance to the Fillmore. There's obviously plenty of great Japanese restaurants around here too.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat location if you like Japantown\u201d", "Author": "Family_from_NJ", "ReviewID": "UR16036704", "Content": "The room has IKEA like furniture, simple, modern and serve its purpose. The bean bag chair is not as comfortable as it looks. It has a ipod docking alarm clock which my daughter likes and a LCD TV. It is located right in the Japantown, so it is very convenient if you like Japanese food at reasonable price. Japan Center has other stores too. It is a fun experience to browse and walk around. When we came back late one night, the hotel parking was full so I had to park at the Japan Center. With the receipt, the hotel waive the over night parking fee. It is a very short walk and I find it safe walking at night. There is a Japanese cafe right across the street from the hotel. We had the breakfast there. Many locals stop there so you get a local feel. The bakery makes mochi (rice cake) there. It is delicious so we bought a box to go. The bakery has been in busuiness for many years. The price is reasonable. It is clean and convenient.

Our stay was fantastic. Every person we dealt with at the hotel couldn't have been nicer, our room was immaculate and simple. A perfect combination of Japanese and Western design, very comfortable and pleasant. The greatest was the parking. The hotel charges a modest $20.00 per night parking fee, a bargain in San Francisco. If their small parking lot is full as it was one night they send you to the public parking lot aroung the corner and reminburse the parking fee. They have a small restaurant in the hotel, we only had breakfast there but it was very good.

The prices were as great as the service. Location was great, right inside Japantown with a bustop in front headed to downtown(really made our 3day passes worth it). It's also not too far from the California St. Cablecar. Check-in was quick and easy and went straight to the room. Rooms were everything we hoped for and more. We were on the third floor and both rooms were clean, cozy, and had nice views of Japantown. Never had a problem with the complimentary internet(had two macs with us) which was great. Doors closed a little hard but no big deal. Even a few friends from SF came to visit were impressed enough to decide to recommend it and also plan to stay themselves in the future. Service was great all around, we left a jacket there that somehow got stuck under the mattress/bed and they flipped the room upside down to find it. Dara and Gill were extremely quick and helpful in contacting me.

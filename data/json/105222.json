Upon entering the room we were shocked that this place had not been shut down. How anyone could charge people to stay here is beyond me. I would rather stay in a box on the street, at least then the air would not smell like sewer. Holes in the walls, dirty bed, bathroom, and carpet. We have stayed in alot of motels all over the country, and have never seen anything like this. We were in the room about 2 minutes before leaving the room keys on the bed and walking out back around nearly naked man. Luckily our car was still on the parking lot with all tires and wheels attached, no joking that was actually a surprise.

First of all, the elevator squeaked, rattled, and felt like an old cardboard box hauling us up to our floor. It even shut on my husband as he was entering it just after the door had opened. There was urine outside of our door which I stepped in. As soon as we entered it smelled like a thousand car air fresheners, the floors had not been vacuumed, the toilet paper was an old roll, the toilet did not work, the side table was burned and stained, the TV cables were next to the TV (not child-safe), the bath tub had black spots in it, as did the shower curtain, the walls were so thin that the man coughing and hacking next door sounded like he was in the room with us, and I refused to touch the bed. Shall I go on? After laughing hysterically at our situation, we used our computer to find another hotel (Holiday Inn in West Memphis- OMG it's wonderful!), we left within the hour. My husband was so disgusted he didn't even want us to ask for our money back, he just wanted to leave lol I insisted and went to the front desk. The woman didn't even flinch when we requested our money back or apologize. This didn't come as a shock since she obviously feels comfortable enough to work at such a place, knowing what her guests are in for. It's seriously bizarre that they haven't been shut down!

Then I arrive right off I 55 and the building looks dilapidated and run down. Adjacent to this motel are boarded up houses, a closed down factory, and a closed down motel. The area looked blighted. The building I believe was built in the 1950's...renovated in areas but renovations were very inconsistant. Checkin took 15 minutes as the person was slow in dealing with the people in front of me. I checked in and went up the elevator which did work. I did see the pool which was cloudy which meant PH was way off. The room had a television that did work, plumbing and air conditioning worked fine..Bed seemed okay..but furnishings seemed worn, plaster falling slightly from cieling...Internet reception was poor. Then behind the bed was a hole in the wall which the concrete frame showed. I was going to reluctantly stay until my friend that was with me insisted otherwise. I was affraid I would not be able to get my credit card credited back from the staff. I looked online in the hall for another motel and decided to stay at the first Best Western I could find in the area. As soon as BW indicated a room was available I decided to check out. I attempted to ask for my money back to my credit card and the clerk spent 30 minutes checking another guest in and was unable to enter their license. So I waited there. Finally she did credit my account. Now I feel that bugs and rats are a bit of an exaggeration. Stuff in the room did work but the environment was unacceptable and the condition of the building and pool and internet service was very poor. I was uncomfortable there while my friend refused to even let us stay there. Unfortunatley when booking online you risk this sort of thing. So reading these reviews may be the best way to assess the situation. because of this I will steer clear of Super 8 and when booking with Days Inn will only use Days Inn or better names under Windham.

It was as if the cleaners had moved them to clean behind them. Unfortunately, they appeared to have not been bothered about doing any cleaning & had either forgotten or been too lazy to replace them from the centre of the room. The towels were old and ripped & the smoke alarm hanging from the ceiling by its wires, quite probably non-functioning. I felt like I was in a scummy backpackers in a 3rd world country, although, having travelled extensively in the third world, few places I stayed in were as appalling as this. On checking out, the girl at reception met me with a cold, blank stare, took my room key without a word, and didn't offer any thanks or basic niceties.

The room was very clean, and you could smell the furniture polish. All of the tables had just been freshley wiped. The room seemed like it had just been remodeled with fresh paint and carpet. You can tell that the hotel is older due to the older style elevators, but they worked fine....just smaller than new elevators. My room had a microwave, but did not have extras like notepads, pens. etc. I can do without these. You can rent these rooms by the week, and save major money. The pool was clean, and my kids really enjoyed it. As for the other reviews about a green pool, I asked the hotel about it. They said their pool is ONLY open during the summer months. The only drawback I had was the ice machine. It was usually empty, and I found out later why. I saw families filling their huge ice chests with ice, which of course left none for the rest of us.", "Date": "July 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palatine, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWe'd stay here again.\u201d", "Author": "booterlean", "ReviewID": "UR3434155", "Content": "The location was a bit rough, but very convenient--under 5 mins to downtown, and close to the highway for easy access.

We would recommend skipping the shuttle to downtown unless you plan to drink, because parking was much more reasonable than the staff advertised ($1 per hour in the garage we were at).

We took a young man who has cancer down to see a ballgame and the sights. Unfortunately, the sights ended up at the motel. The other reviews are right...powdered sugar hard donut for continental breakfast, nasty pool, scary little elevators, etc. The mattress straightened my back out though...permanently. The door had to be opened by force. The desk mgr. had a spotlight out shining it on rooms, yelling for some people to get back inside. It was awful all the way around. The address is deceiving as well. I would recommend this hotel to someone near frostbite, and that's about it.", "Date": "April 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, California", "Title": "\u201cUtterly horrible!!\u201d", "Author": "boxjelly", "ReviewID": "UR3008582", "Content": "Arrived in the evening, but had no worry of losing room as this dump was literally empty. Right near the bridge that goes over to Arkansas. Since we arrived late we assumed we'd be stuck in a room facing the screeching non-stop traffic. Fortunately we were placed in the back of the motel. This alone did not help our experience. First impression of this dank and dark room was the overwhelming toxic smell of bleach. Although this would give the impression of cleanliness, too much of such smell is also nauseating. Bathroom ceiling was so low I thought I'd have to amputate my legs in order to stand in the shower and I'm not that tall. The clorox stench gave no comfort as the pulling back of the comforter proved to be very UN-CLEAN. Stains, bloody galore or whatever it was. Carpets seemed gritty. Just afraid for all personal hygiene. Even though we had driven all day we wanted to get out for any reason not to stay in the room. Went to downtown Beale St, nice area. Passed Sun Studio and Graceland but came back reluctantly as fatigue wore us down. At least we'd get some rest. WRONG! In the middle of the night, the power to the hotel seemed to have been turned off and our heater as well. Woke up in shivers! Woke up early, checked out and discovered we were charged slightly higher rate than from internet. Felt it wasn't worth complaining about even though it was sub-standard comfort. Drive away from this place FAST!!", "Date": "January 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Savannah Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cWorst part of fun weekend\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2289369", "Content": "July 4th Weekend was great! The super 8 was not. The carpet was so dirty it stained our socks! The tv remote did not work nor did the repeated attempts to replace it! It was miles from Graceland and not within walking distance of Beale st. The staff was very unresponsive and don't think of swimming in the murky pool. One of the bedside lamps was not working. The toilet lid was unattached. and it is located in an industrial part of town. Please see Memphis but do so from any other lodging beside this one. I have a high pain threshold for complaint but I am taking the time to write this review to warn others.

The Kiings Inn on Hotel Circle is a vintage \"California Style\" Property in that many of the rooms wrap around a very pretty pool area, with towering palm trees, some of which are spotlighted at night. Best of all, the pool is actually heated to a comfy temperature.....I get really tired of hotel pools reminiscent of the film \"Ice Station Zebra\" but this one is wonderfully warm at least most of the year. The beds are not \"lumpy\" but are very comfy, though the pillows are tired, to be polite. One big caution is that the bathroom is verrrrry cramped, with tight access--the property cant change this, as even most mid-century houses had smaller bathrooms than one finds now--just be prepared, as there is no way to accomodate a wheelchair, at least in the rooms I have had, for example. Parking runs through the complex, so one is usually parked close to the room. Yes, there is a computer in the Lobby for Guest use......kinda chintzy as most properties have a computer that is free for guests, but this one costs and it's cash only. The big \"BUT\" is that the rooms do not have refrigerators, and so many competitors now do supply an in-room refrig. So be warned--you may miss cold soft drinks in the room, etc/ All in all, a lovely mid-century property with a great pool, comfy beds, and very friendly front desk......just dont bring home restaurant leftovers or soda drinks as no refrig.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "Melissa B", "ReviewID": "UR126639585", "Content": "This was a normal hotel and for a short stay it's a good place to stay.

As you can tell by the name, it is an inn not a hotel. I wasn't expecting it to be any better than 3 stars but surprisingly, it was better than the last motel I stayed at. Please read my prior review for more details. What attracted me was the manager's special during the weekdays. A king size bed with pool view was 50% off plus you you get coupons to their own restaurants. Like most other hotels, this inn is pretty close to the freeway but I did not hear any noise from my room. The pool and jacuzzi are heated. Even though I didn't go in, I did put my hand into the pool to make sure the the water is heated as advertised on their website. The room was fair with heating and ac by the window. However, air unit is automatic once you set your temperature on the digital thermostat. There is a small coffee table with two lounge chairs and a ceiling light hanging right above it. It simulates a bistro or a lounge. There is a fair size flat panel TV, most likely LCD, with basic cable. The bathroom is not so spacious. Tub shower and toilet is in its separate room while the sink is outside. Other amenities such as hair dryer, ice, vending machines, basic cable, and wifi is present. When I come down to San Diego, I don't plan to spend much time in the hotel. I spend most of the time doing things and going places, and the hotel is just a place for me to put my luggage and rest through the night. That's why I don't need an expensive place to sleep. I would recommend this place for people who just need a night rest with little noise, fairly inexpensive, and close proximity to many popular sites. With the special, I paid less than $60 per night and that includes all taxes. I hope you see this review helpful.

I've booked 3 and 4 star hotels in San Diego for around that price before so I THOUGHT I was getting a good deal. boy was I in for a surprise!! This was definitely NOT a 3 star hotel. Don't get me wrong, the staff upon check-in was nice. I know others have stated how friendly the staff is. No problems there. However, there is no way this hotel should be listed as 3 star. They try to pass their antiquated furniture of as \"Vintage Classic Style\". It just means the owner is too cheap to upgrade his furniture from the 70's. The TV is a small 25\" that was also purchased decades ago. They don't even provide the standard amenities that ANY quality hotel should provide. There was no iron and ironing board in the room (and it took them an hour to bring me one), there is no in-room coffee service, and there wasn't even a remote control for the Television (apparently there was supposed to be, but when I asked for one to be brought up to my room I was told they didn't have one to bring me). The hotel seems to be VERY family friendly (I'm sure the rates have something to do with it) and you'll be made very aware of it as I could hear kids runnign around and screaming VERY early in the morning. Sound insulation is something that does not exist at this hotel. I could even hear the guy next door snoring when I laid down to go to sleep. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again and am furious at Expedia for selling me this hotel as a 3 star. I could have probably gotten better accommodations at a 2 star hotel for less money!!

In fact, if you are a person of size, you might have trouble shutting the door while you are sitting on the toilet.

But, this hotel is definitely a cut above other 2 and 3-star facilities. This hotel is the third or fourth oldest in Mission Valley, according to the manager. Built around 1960, its decor is dated, but that is also what gives this venue its charm. More importantly, the rooms are very clean and the staff is exceptionally dedicated to providing its customers with friendly service. We were initially assigned a room in one of the attached buildings. However, the room had a musty odor (possibly due to recent flooding following unusually heavy rains) and was cramped for our family of three. For an additional $10/night we were able to have a room in the main building, which one enters from the inside. (Rooms in the attached buildings are entered directly from outdoors.) This made a huge difference, particularly since it was cool and rainy during much of our stay. Due to special dietary needs, we did not eat in the restaurants, but, for an extra $5/day, we were able to have a refrigerator in the room, which was larger than the usual cube-sized models. The beds were comfortably firm (no significant sagging) and the shower was outstanding. However, this is not a fancy hotel: there are few electrical outlets in the rooms; there is no counter in the bathrooms in the main building on which to place toiletries, and there is no elevator to the second floor. The toilet is an old-style, slow-flush, which often requires two or three flushes to remove paper. Still, for the price paid, these are minor inconveniences. Staff at the reservation desk offered to carry luggage up the steps for me (not needed) and were as knowledgeable as any concierge about how to get to local venues.

First thing to consider is that there is no free breakfast, which I knew, but paying for breakfast every morning adds up and breakfast at the hotel is not cheap. There have been rave reviews about the breakfast on property, but I found it average and overpriced. We went to the local Denny's which was better and less expensive. Bottom line is factor in the price of breakfast when making your decision on which hotel to stay at if you are on a budget. So, check-in went well. We checked in at about 1030pm and were the only ones in there and were treated nicely. Went to the room and found that it had a wired smell. Probably because it was old and outdated. The chairs were so stained and filthy that if they were in my house they would have been placed in the trash years ago. The television was small and old, the and the bathroom had no ventilation. The linens seemed to be clean and the housekeeping service was good. Something that was hard to get past was the filthy carpets! We have two little kids who like to roll around and play on the floor and it was gross. No joke if you walked around barefoot and stood in the bathtub there would be black...I mean black footprints. I also saw the biggest bug on the floor and it crawled beneath the bed before I could get it. It seriously looked like something in an alien movie. It was 4 inches long and fast, didn't tell my wife or she would have freaked out. Kids love the pool, but this pool was cold and tasted like salt water. We went once and I could not handle a second try. There were some sketchy patrons at the hotel. Hate to say it but I would not be surprised if more than a few drug deals occurred there during our stay. The location was not bad. It was right off of the highway and seemed to be a safe location near many other hotels. There is a general store about a mile away to buy some food if you want, but there is no place in the room to keep the food cold. So, in closing if all I said would not bother you then stay there. I do plan on going to San Diego again, but I promise you that I will not stay there again. I will gladly pay the extra money to stay at a nicer and cleaner place. I was surprised by how much a hotel can effect your perception of a city and your vacation even if your only sleeping there.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greensboro, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cMY MISTAKE\u201d", "Author": "mral5", "ReviewID": "UR77402434", "Content": "This is TAMMY and i recently wront a good review on priceline regarding the hotel BY MISTAKE because it was meant for HOLIDAY INN.

I called the front desk in the wee hours of the morning and was told they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d send security to check on it. The next morning we ate breakfast at the on-site Waffle Spot (just ok, nothing special) and saw carloads of high school seniors checking out. Unfortunately, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a light sleeper and I found this hotel (and its guests) to be quite noisy both late at night and at the crack of dawn. The parking area echoes so voices are amplified through the non-soundproof rooms. One plus that attracted me to the hotel is it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nonsmoking. On the downside, tons of folks were smoking outside our room section, apparently in violation of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy. The room was rather dark and dingy but the bed was surprisingly comfortable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even though the sheets were the wrong size. Lighting is poor in the room and the TV is very small.

Everything looked old, and not very well cleaned. The carpet was dark and not clean, the closet shelf had paint peeling, and the shower still had hair in it.... gross. The sink had almost no room to put our toiletries, and the bathroom was so small that i had to step into the tub so I could shut the door behind me. Even the TV was tiny, looked like a 13\" or so.. To get an iron & hairdryer I had to go to the front desk - Looked like these items have been through a couple wars. We really didn't feel comfortable staying in those beds after looking over the rest of the room -- but it was late so we got some sleep, on top of the covers. The next morning I immediately went online and found a different hotel, I drove down to the Ramada Plaza (only 1/4 mile down the road) and they let me view the rooms before making the reservation. We checked out of the Kings Inn and called Orbitz for a refund. The rest of the stay @ Ramada Plaza was very nice, and very affordable.

Despite the location of our room (right over the driveway, overlooking the freeway), it was relatively quiet and we were able to get a good night's sleep. I should also say, I was thankful for the room being non-smoking!

Of course, it also says in small writing \"we'll forward your requests to the property, but there's no guarantee the request will be honored.\" Nice.

The chick who was helping me wasn't really paying attention, so there I stood, knocking on the door, trying to get back in to complete the check-in process. It just seemed to me that they could have either waited until everyone who was checking in were done or have the person who locked the door stand at the door until everyone was done. Plus, the chick who was checking me in was all pissy because whoever was supposed to be coming on shift was somewhere else taking a personal call on her cell phone.

The trolley is quick and efficient and with the bus and trolley you can be at Old Town transit station in as little as 15 minutes (for more buses and other trolley lines as well as Old Town State park) Old Town state park is great, loads of cool little shops for mexican style souveniers and good food to be found there as well. Shop around for boat and city tours, though the visitors centre (5 mins from USS Midway) sell discounted tickets for tours and also Zoo and Seaworld.

What do I mean by that? Read more below... First, the staff were unfriendly and almost resented having to work. That was the first tip off that something was wrong. The second tip off was the strange smell in the lobby. A super disgusting and cheap room deodorizer that smelled like it came from the 99cent store (in some flavor like LILAC or something very old smelling and too floral). Awful. Okay, I was tired and needed a place to stay and couldn't get on the internet. So I was a walk in. The outside of the place is deceptively retro and tropical. The inside is nothing like that! MAJOR mistake going here. I paid almost a hundred dollars for a room (using AAA -- who by the way should NOT be recommending this dump to anyone!). I was totally ripped off. After I changed rooms from a room that was next to the noisy freeway and which had a window that opened up to a blank wall (nice architecture! .... NOT !)... I was then given a room that was worse. I was told it would be a King and it was a double queen. I was tired and didn't feel like changing rooms again. Started to unpack, went to the bathroom. Saw massive peeling paint and mice feces! (took a photo) There were also strange stains on the carpet that splashed up onto the closet mirrors (and which seemed like it had been there for a while). Unbelievable! No, I am NOT kidding! I tried to ignore it and NOT walk around barefoot for obvious reasons. The room smelt horrible too. Like somebody had died in there. But housekeeping had obviously sprayed OVER the smell with that same gag-inducing air freshner from the lobby! I woke up at 2 am and was choking on the smell and physically got ill from it -- so I had to open a window to air the room out. I KNOW somebody had to have died in this room. It was THAT smell. Horrible. I went down to the soda machine area by the pool to get a soda to calm my stomach and was ripped off by BOTH soda machines which stole my quarters! I finally got one soda after paying for TWO. Obviously someone has rigged the machine to drop coins down into the machine and not into the proper coin area (I noticed this only after I had put in the coins). I know! This is unbelievable. But this is what kind of place this is!I feel COMPELLED to warn people to say away from here! Absolute nightmare in every respect.

Dinky little towels that are more like bath cloths and just absolutely unclean and smelly. DO NOT STAY HERE! Unless you are a transient, homeless person or someone who has absolutely no standards.

The hotel is easy to find, just off highway 8 interstate 163. On hotel circle which is signposted on the highway. The reception staff are very helpful. They were excellent when we checked in and gave us some discount vouchers for the Waffle Spot & Amigo. He also gave us a voucher for Macy's giving us 11% off for the five days we were there. We asked for directions a few times while there and each time they gave us a little card with exact directions from the hotel to the place. This was excellent and a really good touch. The room. Pros: Basic but clean. Comfy bed. Thick curtains, quiet, good size, air con. Cons: TV reception wasn't the best. Air con a little noisy. The bathroom door didn't shut properly The pool was large and during the day was really quiet. It did get a little noisy in evening, and is open until 10 so you might want to ask for a room away from it. The Waffle spot had basic food, however service is very slow. They have internet pc's that you need to pay for by the minute .25c for 5 mins. About a few min drive away there are two great shopping malls, Fashion Valley & Mission Valley. These have different styles of shops. The former having the more expensive ones but were both excellent. There is a cinema at the latter one. We went to these malls most evenings as open until 9pm. Seaword & the Zoo are easy to get to as is downtown San Diego although we found parking downtown was difficult. Overall for the money this hotel was brilliant and I would recommend it to anyone who is comfortable with basic hotels.", "Date": "October 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middlesbrough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOk, just\u201d", "Author": "MaxReheat", "ReviewID": "UR5927474", "Content": "As the previous review mentioned the 1st thing you notice about the room are the rather musty smell it has, not awful but noticeable still. The rooms were also very dark most of the time and you had to substitute light for privacy. Also if you walked around in bare feet they ended up filthy. The Hotel itself was a bit tricky to find from I8, especially if you followed the hotel circle signs, we found it easier coming off on the following Taylor St exit. If you are staying on the Hotel Circle it is definately an advantage to have a car. Taxis cost about $20 to Downtown and the beach areas although there is a bus stop right outside the hotel. On the plus side the hotel reception staff themselves were very helpful and gave us quite a few tips on activities in the area. The onsite restaurant The Waffle Spot was also a good place to have breakfast. The pool and hot tub area also looked quite nice although we never had time to use it. Hotel Circle is also out of the way of the bums and beggars so no hassle from them either.

The only disapointment was that there were no coffee pots in the rooms. We ate at the waffle spot one morning. The food was good, but the service was extremely slow. The prices were a little on the high side so we got fast food after that. The front desk was awesome the night we checked in, they were friendly and made sure we were comfortable in our rooms.

Yeah, okay it had some problems, the room did smell a little musty at first, but that disappeared quickly once the air was going!, and the room was a bit small, so what? The pool was great and the hot tub was a decent size, I however am upset that I cancelled my other three nights there to move over to the Marriott Mission Valley and paid so much more!!! When I called back to the King's Inn to see if I could get a room for another night they were booked!!! This was a good location, the price was good, call in person to get the AAA rate, you can't get it on the internet. My only gripe about the pool was that it closed at 10:00 p.m., that is too early when you are gone all day and just want to come back and relax, you just get in the pool/hot tub and have to get out, they come around and lock up the gates at the pool area. No free breakfast but you can get a 10% off coupon to eat at The Waffle Spot right inside the lobby and the waffles are GREAT!!! The staff was so friendly!!!

The location was ok although noise from the highway was quite bad. Actually that didnt seem to bad once we moved rooms come to think of it. We started off on the upper floor in a corner but the noise from pipes or some creature in the loft was too much and we moved rooms at 3a.m!! The guy at reception was really helpful, gave us a key to another room and said to just move our stuff in the morning. We were then on the ground floor near the pool, actually this room was much nicer, slightly bigger and much more natural light. Maybe bear this in mind when booking a room. Funny decor, well it made us giggle anyway, lovley blue bed covers and curtains with nice pink roses on!! Very clean and comfortable though. We used the waffle spot for breakfast which was lovely. We did venture into the bar one early evening, but ,mmmmmm, well how to put it..........have you seen 'My name is Earl' on t.v? The laundry room for guests to do their own washing was very useful.

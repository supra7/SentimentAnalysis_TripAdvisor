Second...I am a pretty no frills type of person. I stayed here during a hunting trip with a couple buddies. We just wanted a roof over our heads between hunting days. We got the roof, but not much else. This was the single worst hotel I've ever stayed in hands down. Filthy room, stains on carpet, stains on sheets, pillow-cases, and the mattresses themselves looked like they were dredged from the bottom of a river. The room smelled pretty bad on its own, but even worse since they used a febreeze-like spray to try and cover it up. The door to our room had about a 3/4\" gap under it...open to the elements. The bathroom was a mess...door wouldn't close, mold & mildew growing in the common places (shower tiles & fixtures) and also in some uncommon spots (light switches, electric outlets, etc.). There was some questionable activity going on all night as well...a pretty steady stream of people showing up in groups of between 6-10 at a time, loitering around in the parking lot, and hanging out in front of the rooms (which were occupied by guests...including us) at ground level and on the 2nd floor balcony. This hotel was definitelt a gathering place for some reason...not sure what though. There was a goup leaning aginst our window drinking and smoking from about midnight until 4:00am. We considered telling them to scram, but it was a bit intimidating having large groups of people who weren't hotel guests loitering about and we weren't interested in getting into any confrontations (it looked like things could get ugly quickly if we did). It was very dirty and I felt pretty unsafe here. This place was really, really bad. I agree with the other reviewers...I would seriously prefer sleeping in my car than to ever stay at this hotel again. Bad, Bad, Bad. On the plus side though...I did not get lice or bedbugs (perhaps because this hotel was too dirty for even the lice and bedbugs to stay).", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cPLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BOOKING!\u201d", "Author": "GROSS7777", "ReviewID": "UR108851246", "Content": "Sleep in your car if you have to but NOT this place.

I should of listened to my gut, I've always had bad experiences with Econo Lodge's....yep never again. The check in was easy, but when I took all my things from the car to the room and started to look around I noticed cockroaches dead on the carpet, I kicked their bodies under the bed, and towards the walls to make a path to the bathroom. I then noticed all the dead roaches around around the toilet and also spiders, however the spiders where alive till I stepped on them. 17 hours driving and I just did not want to deal with moving rooms or complaining...I just wanted to sleep so I checked the bed and it seemed fine. The AC unit was okay as far as cold air but so old I do not think it worked all that well. So I opened the refrigerator to help cool the room down. The TV remote had a good battery but was not programmed to the TV so I just went to sleep. When I woke up that was when I noticed that this place was bad. There were thousands of dead bugs in the bathroom light/fan unit. So I went to turn the bath water on and it came out black, obviously it had not been run for a long time. Immediately when I turned on the bath faucet water came out of that light/fan unit above the toilet. I turned the water off and it stopped, I turned it on again and it started again to which I shrugged and took my shower anyways (too bad if this place burns down was my thought). I did complain and showed the girl the photos, she gave the typical response of why did you wait to complain!!! Obviously she has never driven for 17 hours. She told me a manager will call me later...yeah right. As soon as she told me that a Pakistani came out of the back office to which I pointed at and said \"He looks like he can help me\" knowing it was probably the cheap owner. The most he would do is $10.49 off bringing the total to $31.46. Still pretty pricey for a hole in the wall. Oh, and I did show him the photo's and he did not care. He even asked why I waited, technically I did not use the room till my fully paid time (I had 5 hours left as checkout was at 11am) but to him I used the room till the end, he also said I might of put the bugs there...really dude from the reviews here it looks like you are just another cheap foreign motel owner. Yeah, I carry bugs around to save a whopping $10.49. Maybe that is how it is handled in Pakistan but I have a feeling most Americans do not try to con people in that manor. He refused to go to the room with me to see it so i could show him the leak, the bugs and what not...why not go with the customer are you not concerned? Oh, wait you knew the room was awful so there was no need to go look at it. Heck I stayed in a hole in Dominican Republic but you expect that there....not here in a modern country. I know people will read this and say why did you stay, I guess having lived in 3rd world countries like Pakistan I have thick skin. However enough is enough and I was happy to pay $64 on my way home...I'm too old to save a buck, and really did I save anything!!! I would think the board of health would be interested in this place. I'm still thinking of doing a charge back on my credit card and providing them with the photos....one of the few times I think the Motel needs punished and no better way then doing a charge back.

The hotel could use a major update and renovation. Our room was fair. I have stayed in worse but I have definitely stayed in better.

There was a half bar of soap at the small ledge at the top of the shower and housekeeping fails to vacuum under the beds - upon arrival I looked under the bed and there were crumbs and a candy wrapper underneath. The hotel is quite dirty inside and out; the siding is filthy and could use a good powerwash. The breakfast runs from 5:00 am - 9:00 am. My brothers and I came down at 8:00 am and they had run out of waffle batter and most of the pasteries/bagels/bread. Upon inquiring about a refill of the breakfast items I was told that they had run out. The hotel should stock enough breakfast supplies to last the full four hours that it runs. The breakfast area does its job but is very small and with only an air conditioner unit similar to those in the rooms. It was like a sauna in there but I turned on the A/C during breakfast. The upside to this hotel is that if you are not looking to spend a fortune and need a room just to sleep in (not to relax/enjoy) then this would be a fair hotel. I love that it is pet-friendly, too, and there is a grassy area to walk your pet. It felt safe and the location is GREAT - right off of the expressway and only a mile or so from the mall and the campus.

Unfortunately, the hotel was not a four-star in our book. We should have realized that there might be a problem with the room when we saw a set of complimentary earplugs on the sink. Maybe it was just this room, but the wall was paper thin on the left side of the room and we heard continual noise from our neighbors. Also, the street noise on Saturday at night was annoying even though we were on the fourteenth floor. Other than that, the location of the hotel is excellent for exploring downtown S.F. The room was clean, the service was good, the view was beautiful, and an inexpensive continental breakfast was available in the lobby.

The rooms seem to have been refurbished a few years ago, which is OK, even though they are a bit heavy on the beige. The reason for that is probably so it blends in better with the stuff from the orginal design, i.e. bathroom fittings. But why no safety deposit box, no minibar, no slippers? In that category, I would expect those. I would have advised them to do something about the hallways, they're simply uninviting, utilitarian. But the club lounge is awful: you get the same great view, but it is simply too small and has no style. The small catering area is absolutely crowded, even on weekdays, and the stuff struggles to keep replenishing the dishes. And the food on offer is more the kind I would expect from a motel. It's clear that the hotel management treats the lounge as a cost factor only, not something that would enhance the quality of the stay of their patrons or a differentiating asset, which is sad. And be advised: don't take room 3109: it's right next door to the kitchen of the aforementioned lounge, with the door always open. So unless you don't mind getting up at 5 am, pick a different room. The final touch: the second day the water was lukewarm, and when we called, the answer was \"Oh, OK, no hot water at your room ALSO. I will call engineering and get back to you.\" They never did, but later on there was hot water.

My parents worked for the diplomatic core, then I worked for the diplomatic core before my career in education and counseling; so hotels have been a mainstay in my life. I consider myself a novice connoisseur of hotels - self appointed of course. A counseling convention brought me to Parc 55. Upon my arrival, I was greeted with sleek, modern lines, vibrant wall art, and a welcoming 'hello' by every hotel employee who crossed my path. The lobby area was airy and open, very suiting for the San Fran area. The front desk quickly check me in and I made my way up to my room. I'm a Wyndham rewards participant, and had requested a room on a high floor; so I was very pleased with my 23rd floor assignment, offering an expansive view of the city and the beautiful bay. The room was clean, open and accommodating. The bathroom (a pet peeve area for me) was spacious, clean and spa-like. I didn't hesitate to put my things on the counter, nor did I ponder before stepping into the shower. Whew- thank God for small blessings! Within an hour of my check-in, a complimentary tray of fruit, and my preferred beverages of sprite and bottled water were delivered to my room. Now that's how you welcome a guest! My stay extended over three nights and four days. My room was always clean, and fresh. The nightly turn over service was like clock work - and always done with a smile and small talk. The room service, was delivered with the same level of warmth; although I felt the menu options were a bit lacking for the San Francisco area, but they were able to accommodate my requests. The room offered a soft hum from the city, but it was welcomed as it served as reminder of being a new place. Not once did I see any signs of untidiness in the hotel, nor was anyone every rude or impolite. I think my visit to the hotel markets sums up the quality offered by Parc 55 Wyndham, San Francisco: Having flown for 8 hours, with a connector, and a 2 hour delay due to rotting fish - I was tired and my ears had not yet acclimated to being on the ground again. Every word that I said echoed loudly in my skull as if my it was empty, cavernous. Every attempt to dislodge the trapped air was met with shooting pain. I needed the warm end of a q-tip and of course I didn't pack any. I made my way down stairs to the hotel market. I was greeted by an aging man with a youthful smile. He welcomed me and asked if he could help me find anything. I explained my dilemma, and we began dialoguing. Before I knew it, we had shared our professional journeys, our travels, and our passion for inquiry and people - he was so gregarious and joyful; respectable traits to someone who was intrinsically introverted. His exuberant small talk made you feel hopeful about the world... a big statement for such a small act I know. While paying for my travel sized pack of q-tips I noticed that we hadn't even exchanged names. I looked to his name tag. \"Nice to meet you Warren. It was a pleasure speaking with you\", I said with a grateful smile. \"The pleasure was all mine Ms. Graham. You have a nice day and enjoy your conference.\" The warmth infused into the simple task of helping a customer find q-tips is not at all uncommon at Parc 55, and I think that's what make this hotel exceptional. I love quotes, and I recently came across this one, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Truly great friends are hard to find, difficult to leave, and impossible to forget.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I visited the store one more time before leaving, with no intention of crossing Warrens path again, but I would be remiss in saying I wasn't hoping to get a little bit of his sunny disposition before heading back to the east coast. He wasn't working that day, but the experience provided by Warren and the entire Parc 55 staff is \"hard to find, difficult to leave, and impossible to forget\".

Having visited San Francisco several times, we are familiar with the city, and thus decided to save a little by bidding via Priceline. We got the Parc 55 for $160. per night. Not a huge savings, but considering conference/convention season is in full swing, we were happy with the price. Upon arrival the doorman and bellhop greeted us and offered their service. The woman assisting us checking in was also friendly and polite. The only (slightly) odd thing about checking in is that you enter the lobby, then go up one floor. We soon realized having a separate lobby from the check-in & concierge made sense because this hotel frequently hosts conferences, meetings, tour groups, and is used by many different airlines as crash pads. This kept the check-in area free from the large groups clogging up the space. The airlines even had their own self-check in kiosk. We knew that booking via Priceline often means getting the least desirable rooms. That's why when we use that service, we only bid on the highest star-level available. With those hotels, the least desirable room is still usually better than an average room at a lower-star hotel. At the Parc 55, we were given one of those rooms, #814 (standard non-smoking King). Our room looked into the \"courtyard\" aka looking out at the back of the other buildings. I consider that a \"plus\" because those rooms are usually quieter than street side, (if I want a view, I don't use third-party booking agent). Pretty much everything about the room could be described as standard and comfortable for the star level. We found the bed to be a bit firm, but otherwise it was your average hotel pillow-top. The only thing that made the room sub-par was that the maid's access hallway ran right behind the wall our bed was against. So, from the time we checked in (around 6:30) to the time we left for dinner (8pm) we heard the trolley carts rolling like thunder through that hallway several times. When we got back from dinner, around 10pm, we heard nothing until around 9am the next morning, well after we were already up. This was no big deal for *us*. We live in an urban setting, so we're used to some noise. Plus, our sleep habits were not interrupted, and we didn't spend much time in the room by day. That said, I can easily imagine this room could be a nightmare to others with differing habits. The hotels seems aware of this, and a pair of earplugs are provided :) The bathroom: Average sized, Bath & Bodyworks products are nice, hot water comes on quickly and seems a bit hotter than normal (yay!) and the shower is fantastic. The only downside is poor lighting over the shower. I like a well-lit shower for shaving. Overall: Yes, I would book again via Priceline, and if the price was right, direct with the hotel.

The breakfast offered was very substantial (2 fresh cut fruits, yogurt, granola, cereal, hard boiled eggs, toast, pastries, juices, coffee & tea). A quiet lovely environment with outstanding views. Also enjoyed other Club amenities - appetizers and wine, and later desserts and wine. Most definitely worth the extra money, especially considering the prices in SF. The staff in the Club room (especially Sergio!!) were gracious, friendly and extremely accommodating ~ loved them all. Our room was on 29th floor with stunning views both morning and evening. City noise didn't bother us, as no matter where one stays in the heart of SF, city noise is a way of life. Ample space for 4 of us in the room, very comfortable beds. Nice products in bathroom. Staff at front desk always polite, friendly, and genuine. Congierge Staff was extremely helpful and quite delightful personalities. On way to Alcatraz Tour one morning, Congierge made sure we knew our transportation options, food & beverage rules of Alcatraz, then reached in her purse and gave the 4 of us See's Candies suckers to wish us a fun day. While discussing evening and dinner options one evening with another Congierge, an impatient man behind me interrupted us and was extremely rude to her about wanting \"his time\". She handled it like a pro and never made me feel like I was taking too much time to discuss options with her. She was a star; only sorry now I can't recall her name ~ she deserves kudos for sure!! I had read earlier about this hotel being a block from The Tenderloin district ~ clearly nothing to worry about, so don't let that concern you. We took BART from SF airport to hotel, exited at Powell St station and were a 1/2 block, if that, from hotel. Convenience plus!! You do not need a car in the city whatsoever if you are there for sightseeing.

The hotel is basically at the intersection of Market and 4th-5th street. It is right outside of the entry location for the cable car. The hotel has an awkward entrance. When you enter the hotel you are on the ground floor where only a bell hop station is located. You have to go upstairs to the second floor to registration. If you have luggage, it's easier to go around the corner and use the elevators to get upstairs verses using the escalators. The only complaint is that the hotel doesn't have a door man to offer assistance when you arrive. I stayed in a Club Room King which puts you on the upper floors and gives you access to a club lounge. The views from the upper rooms are worth the extra money. I stayed in a corner room on the 31st floor that gives you a front and side window. If you can book room 3107 you won't be disappointed. The onsite work out room is well equipped with a lot of machines and free weights. There is a Starbucks on site as well as a roomy restaurant and a side bar. The food was good and the Martinis were excellent. When you rent a club room, you get a continental breakfast every day in the private lounge on the 31st floor. Sunday through Thursday the club room offers a full highline bar, hor'devours and desert from 6pm until 10:00pm. This is worth it. As for the hotel room, it is updated with marble and wonderful beds and coverings. The bathrooms are well appointed and a nice size. I would like to see more pressure from the shower. I was really impressed that as busy as the hotel was, the elevators were always available and quick even while staying on the top floor. A few pointers. Attached to the hotel right outside the door is a coffee and donut shop when the lines at Starbucks are to long. Internet is pricey at $14.05 per day, but you can purchase a weeks pass for $49.00.

The front desk staff were extremely friendly and gracious, especially the nice person who gave us free in-room wifi access (which would normally cost a ridiculous $15 per day). A few of the fittings in the bathroom were a little loose or aged, but nothing that had any real impact. My only major gripe concerns the hotel's practice of putting 2 bottles of water in the room and then automatically adding the charge ($9 for two 1-liter bottles!) to the bill. Luckily, I hadn't drunk the water, and I noticed the charge on the final bill, so I had the charge removed (immediately and without any argument, to their credit). Still, I just think that's a scummy practice, and I hope no one else gets suckered by it.

You can get to Fisherman's Wharf easily from Union Square. Most of the major shops are on your doorstep, so you don't have far to deposit your shopping bags. I even had to buy another suitcase and I was still overweight at check-in!! I had a room on the 18th floor which had fantastic views. The bed was nice and comfortable and had lovely fresh white linen. The bathroom was quite large, spotlessly clean with lots of lovely white towels. The reception lady on checking in was very courteous and friendly. As others have mentioned - you can hear street noise below, but that's city life for you. The Hotel have very helpfully provided ear plugs which worked like a treat for light sleepers like myself. I did not try the Restaurant as there were so many other options in Union Square and I was only there for 3 nights. The Airport Shuttle bus, stops outside the hotel several times a day and you do not have to pre-book it. I left on Superbowl Sunday and was slightly concerned that the city would come to a standstill and the shuttle bus would be delayed. This did not happen and I made the airport in plenty of time. I found the Hotel lived up to the positive reviews on TA and I would definitely return. Another thing I would highly recommend, is purchasing a travel \"passport\". This pass allows you unlimited travel on the cable cars, trolley cars, buses and BART. The scenic trolley cars (the ones with outside seating) are $6 per trip one way. So getting the passport is extremely good value for money, in my opinion.

You might see the bay to the south, you might be staring at some of the most beautiful architecture, but it won't matter because you'll find yourself peering down at this magical city with awe. I like the layout of the hotel, the color scheme and the zen vibe. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. On several occasions, we chose to extend our stay (because we actually DO love staying here) and they bent over backwards to make it happen even during a \"sold out\" weekend. The reception level is beautiful and inviting with high ceilings, wood flooring and gorgeous orchids. Don't pass up the citrus infused water near the bar/restaurant entrance. If you want to grab a cocktail before venturing out, the bar has some great 2 for 1 deals on wine and specialty drinks. We have not tried the concierge/upgraded package yet, but plan to do so soon. When we were checking out last weekend, we noticed a different key card on our agent's desk. She explained that the tippy top floor rooms have special amenities that include breakfast and cocktails in a spectacular viewing space. I can't wait to book that package on my next trip. The only negative I can point out would be the beds. Although comfortable and elegantly dressed in fine white sheets with large Euro pillows, the mattresses aren't top of the line. You can tell that they are springy and not plush. It isn't a deal breaker though. Being near the Powell St. BART station has its pros and cons. It is lovely to go direct from SFO and be about 20 steps from your hotel, especially when toting a lot of luggage. The slight downside is dealing with people hanging around the BART entrance, both the panhandlers and the crowds of tourists buying tickets for trolley rides. It can get quite chaotic and loud, but once inside the Parc55, you don't hear the street noise below. You'll be hard pressed to avoid any unwanted street activity at most SF hotels anyway. Walk across the street to Nordstrom, their cafe is yummy with gorgeous views back toward the Parc55. Take a jaunt down Market street to the amazing Ferry building, especially on the weekend when the Farmers Market is bustling with energy from both locals and tourists. Our favorite secret find is jumping on the Sausalito or Larkspur ferry for only $5 (with a Clipper card) and boating across the water to have a reverse view of this amazing city! I have stayed at a wide range of SF hotels- from budget to luxury, but I will only choose the Parc55 from now on. It has everything I want for a wonderful San Francisco experience.

Upon check in we were given a room on the 25th floor, went back to reception and were advised there were no king beds in the club rooms but were told all the hotel rooms were exactly the same except club ones are on a higher floor. This was slightly annoying as on the website we booked on we selected a king room opposed to double and paid slightly more so thought it was guaranteed. In the end we settled for 2 doubles on the club floor. If you're a couple I wouldn't recommend this though as they are smaller than UK doubles. I personally would say the rooms are slightly nicer having seen both and you get amenities such as dressing gowns, complimentary water etc which you don't in the standard rooms. Breakfast in the club lounge is nice, however they only provide tiny saucer size plates which are even too small for a slice of toast which is a bit impractical. Breakfast is served every day however hors d'oeuvres and dessert are every evening EXCEPT Friday and Saturdays so we only got to experience them one evening. Also if you have a connecting door like we did be aware the sound proofing is pretty terrible, on our last night we could hear a couple talking loudly mid evening and then were woken at 2am by them having a rather heated discussion! Could even hear them flush the toilet. However I think if it was a normal room without the door it wouldn't have been an issue but if you are a light sleeper make sure your room isn't a connecting one. I've stayed in many hotels with connecting doors and never experienced that level of noise from the adjoining room. Other than the issues we experienced the rooms are clean and offer fantastic views, would consider staying here again but probably just in a standard room as I don't think it's worth the extra money for the club one.

Not a great selection of beers on tap as well. Concierge was very good. If you don't visit the city often, this is important. You must be able to get good tips on eating places, and also areas to avoid. For example, the Tenderloin area is a short 2 blocks from the hotel. As we know the city well, we know how to avoid this area. But my wife and I often wonder how new tourists to the city fare if they mistakenly walk through this area by accident, especially in the evenings. It is a dangerous area, and one you definitely want to know about and avoid. A good concierge will do this for you, as well as guide you to great restaurants, make reservations (some of the fine hotels have connections that can get you a table that you might no be able to secure on your own), and popular attractions.

Almost $5 for a bottle of water in your room, $14 for wifi and it is per device so $28 for your laptop and phone for 24 hours. Thay's just wrong! But let's go back to location. San Francisco is a great city - and with the hills and streets some places are just naturally better starting points than others. This hotel is exactly where you would want to be. BART outside, you are right at the key point for shopping and Union Square and the trolleys are at your doorstep.

So we checked in nice rooms, however the room my daughters were in had an adjoining door? I rang down was told no adjoining room that night however there would be adjoining rooms available from the next day and we should talk with guest services and they could make the change for us. Long story short, we were moved 3 times (we move ourselves each time) as each time they allocated two adjoining rooms when we arrived at the rooms there was no adjoining door!! 1/12 hours of our holiday we can;t get back!! Finally I said we had to go as we had a tour booked and could they sort out the rooms and when we got back later in the day I would collect the keys. Guess what...... arrive back after a massive day of sightseeing, allocated new swipe cards and arrive at rooms which are not adjoining. To be honest we could have stayed in non adjoining rooms, but now it was a matter of principle, don't tell me I can have an adjoining rooms, make me move my suitcases 3 times and still end up with two separate rooms!!

It seemed quite apparent that the hotel knew that and we were stuck in a room which looked directly at another hotel. We asked whether we could get a room with a view of the bay and were told that we'd be given one in a few days which despite following several times, never eventuated. The room itself was quite small and not that special (surprisingly, in comparison to a very sexy 44th floor Manhatten hotel room that we got a few weeks later on). The hotel itself is very well situated if you want to go exploring SF, though you do have to run the homeless person gauntlet every time you leave, though this is pretty much the norm everywhere). In short, the hotel was ok, a bit overpriced and I'd recommend booking directly with the hotel so you can leave if unsatisfied. If you intend on it being a romantic getaway, request a bay view room and ensure you get it because the view from the other side isn't that crash hot.

The price one pays for being in the middle of the action! The major issue we had was with the elevators. There is one bank of six elevators that services all 6 floors. For some reason, they take forever to come. On our second morning (weekday), we waited 15 minutes for an elevator. One showed up every 5 minutes or so, but they were already full. Finally, we ended up walking the 12 floors down to to the street level. The elevators were slightly more frequent for the remaining of our stay. The front desk told us that \"engineering\" was working on a \"problem\". Not sure we bought this given that all six elevators were in operation. Seems more like not enough elevators to handle the traffic, or very poorly programmed algorithms controlling the elevators.

We decided on Union Square or downtown area and this hotel did not disappoint. We took advantage of a great special that allowed us to stay in this fantastic city for five nights. It also gave us a high floor room as we both love nothing more than a gorgeous cityscape. The first thing either of do when we enter the room is; walk over to the window and whip open the window coverings and admire the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offerings of architecture. LOCATION: we were so happy with the location. There was a Walgreens around the corner on Powell where we could buy our water and breakfast protein shakes. The hotel was within a few blocks or less of Union Square, the cable car turnaround on Powell, the trolley on Market, the main tourist branch office and BART. There were many restaurants including a Japanese, Indian, Italian and a great Dim Sum restaurant all outside the back entrance to the hotel. In fact we ended up eating at the Dim Sum restaurant many times when we wanted a quick lunch or dinner it was nice and had many dumpling choices and also offered a full Chinese menu as well as the Dim Sum. It was just under $50 (+tip) for a cab from SFO. You could easily walk to Union Square, ChinaTown, Financial Dist & Nob Hill from this location (careful: Nob Hill is an uphill walk). We did walk to FW and North Beach as well but our legs hurt. It was just the right number of blocks away from The Tenderloin where we felt the Hilton was just close enough that we would have felt unsafe at night if we stayed there. It was just one street too far over. We looked at staying at The Fairmont and the Intercontinental as they are such beautiful poperties but that uphill walk everytime we went back at the end of the day when you are so tired, would have been painful. You would have to take a cab home at night if you were staying there. STAFF: The front desk staff was nice, professional and helpful - everything they should be.

There were always many bellmen and door staff to help with parking, packages, bags and calling taxis. The valet parking was expensive at $50 which is in keeping with the rest of the city. We did have a car on our last night and they did a great job. The housekeeping staff was extra special. We requested some special pillows and a gentleman came to our room as we were getting settled and he brought us pillows, more coat hangers and friendly service. We asked for extra towels and everyday it was like towels were breeding in our bathroom. ROOM: The room was nicely decorated, comfortable and functional. It was very clean and well kept. Bed was nice & comfortable which is necessary after long days. The TV was nice HD good picture and good selection of channels. Excellent bathroom, good setup, makeup mirror, nice bath products. The soap was really cute it had bumps on it like a massage bar which was so nice to massage your feet with after a long day tackling the SF hills. The shower and toilet water pressure was nice and strong. I would have to look for a complaint about the room, we were very satisfied. The view in our room on the 24th floor given to us by Mavis made us very happy. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll attach some pictures of the great view. There were numerous elevators and you never had to wait long. The lobby and elevator area had a great setup in regards to entrance/exits.

Reading other reviews on here, I realize we paid substantially more than some others. This clouds my view as I'm comparing it to other almost $300 per night hotels I've stayed in. But, we wanted to go during this weekend and were willing to pay the higher hotel rates. My husband and I decided to stay here because of the location. However, when we go back, we will pick another location. This is in the heart of the touristy areas and very close to shopping (Forever 21, Nike town, etc.) but mostly stores that are all over the US. It is true that it does get loud due to the location - you hear sirens, etc. throughout the night. We knew this going in and therefore weren't disturbed. The hotel does provide ear plugs which is a nice touch. The room was small, but sufficient for both of us. We stayed on the 10th floor and looked out onto a pretty ugly view, but our sliding doors opened and we had a tiny balcony which was nice. The bathroom was nice and the bed was so-so. The front desk staff were courteous but we didn't find the concierge to be helpful (or particularly friendly) at all. Overall, the hotel was ok and didn't add anything to our trip in San Fran.

I like extra towels for the bathroom and it so happened housekeeping was next door and i asked her if i can have extra and she gave me more than enough. My bedroom was fairly warm for my liking and immediately called maintenance to look at AC and adjust temperature. Not only did they fix it, they provided me with a small fan just in case it still wasn't cold enough for me (well more for my bf - he likes it tundra cold!) I believe maintenance guy's name was John.

We stored our luggage for our last hours in SF before we had to return to Europe. When we picked it up it was kind of a little chaotic - bags here, staff there. In this muddle we carelessly left our camera with all the holiday photos on it behind. We realised this on the plane and this was too late. We called the hotel right after landing but no one knew anything. We wrote three emails desperately trying to get the photos back - not even the camera and added a reward. They did not even bother to answer one of the emails. This was so disappointing - although it was our mistake of course - that we will certainly never come back or recommend this place.

On my stay I paid big bucks for a Club Level room. The room was decent, but the Club (3 floors up) was disappointing; primarily the food. The evening fare was sparse: a cheese assortment, a lettuce only salad, and meatballs. Later in the evening they offered just two desert items that were virtually identical. Compared to other hotel club offerings, the food variety here was mediocre at best. But the real outrage was the fire alarm testing that occurred on several floors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c obviously mine. Upon checking in this was NOT mentioned. When I got to the room there was a written notice, but it implied that sometime between 11am and 3pm, someone would need to access the room and check out the alarm siren. In reality, the alarm siren IN MY ROOM (incredibly loud even with ear plugs) went on and off for 4 hours. Work or rest was impossible.

They are easily, EASILY #1...im a very frequent traveler to San Fran and ive stayed everywhere...ever since the Parc, i havent looked back. Ive stayed there 17 times this Summer...the rooms are huge, and if you get a small room, its not \"small\" at all. its normal size...excellent rates, with wiggle room sometimes. You just have to ask at a hotel for a discount...there is a fine line between the hotel staff/front desk being overly nice (and seemingly fake, i hate that) and hotel staff being not nice. This staff from top to bottom seems very attentive,which i attribute to the managers because all shifts are cool.They wanna know how you're doing, is everything ok, etc...but they do it without bothering the [---] out of you and being phony and overly nice (which happens alot in the hospitality industry..again, i hate when people are phony) So yeah...the Hotel is great top to bottom with all the Bells and Whistles....cant find a better location, its in the heart of downtown San Fran...Theres a super Posh shopping district on the East side and a super seedy neighborhood called \"The Tenderloin\" on the West side if you are into that kind of stuff. No worries about safety here, big burly security guards everywhere with the suits and earpieces (which is a bit much for me, but im sure the Simpleton traveler will feel secure)....the price of the hotel may seem a bit high,but compared to other hotels, especially the lower starred ones, its a great bargain....The drawbacks of the hotel is parking is expensive, but unlike other hotels and garages, you get to go in and out, so its not bad. The hotel store is a bit small (and they are aggressive trying to unload their goods...just say \"hey man, i want a pack of smokes and THATS IT\" to offset this)...stay here for sure, if you dont you are blowing it..... i might look like a plant or a mark with this rainbows and waterfalls review, im not.

This is a very large hotel with the feel of a busy airport. The ground floor restaurant/bar lacks any kind of atmosphere or intimacy.

But paying over $200 (with taxes), I noticed that the carpets in our \"clean air\" room were stained and when I turned over the cushions on the 2 chairs, it was obvious that the undersides had not been vacuumed recently. The bathroom electrical outlet was grubby, although when I called housekeeping, they were ready to change it immediately. When I pointed out some small black dots on the edge of the bedskirt, we were moved to a Club room. Why? Because the management of the hotel takes even a remote possibility of an infestation very seriously. I have to give them full credit for this: they offered to launder all our belongings (not necessary, since we had just arrived), and sent someone to move our luggage to a new room. We were repeatedly told that they take this issue seriously and we could see that this is really the case. Several men wearing gloves came into the room as we were leaving, and proceeded to take the room apart. I think that their quick and decisive actions were admirable and speak to a high level of operational efficiency. We LOVED the Club room that they upgraded us to; it also included evening snacks, desserts and an honor bar, as well as a lovely breakfast in the 31st floor Club Lounge with a gorgeous view of the city. I would totally recommend paying $30-40 more per night for a Club room; it's well worth it!

Every other direction is fine, as Union Square is just to the north/northeast and the mall is right across the street eastward.

Funny that a friend of mine staying in the same hotel on the same dates was switched from a 1 bed room to a 2 bed one with no issues. I suppose it's the luck of the draw on who you get at the check in desk. Our room was okay, typical hotel room. The high speed internet had issues and my husband (who was working from the hotel room for the week) had to call tech support because the connection kept dropping. The ability to have a wired connection was the main reason we chose this hotel and the connection was still unreliable. I should add that this hotel charges for high speed internet access, which is terribly annoying since most places offer it for free these days - and to have it be unreliable only added to the annoyance. The area of town (Union Square) is noisy as I found staying in the area last year. The hotel provides earplugs in the bathrooms as an amenity. I found a sound machine app on my phone worked better than the earplugs. The walls are also paper thin in this hotel. We didn't hear much during the week - perhaps our neighboring rooms were quiet business travelers or unoccupied. Come the weekend, though - we heard EVERYTHING in the rooms next to us. I even knew the cell phone ring of the occupant in the room next door and could hear every word of his conversation. That's no fun, especially when your neighbors come in at 1AM from a night on the town and want to loudly tell one another stories. Not a pleasant way to be woken up in the middle of the night. One more thing - the internet charge is not per ROOM, it's per DEVICE that you use to connect to the internet. We had two laptops and had two charges on the bill and had to get that resolved. I even called down to the front desk at the beginning of our stay to confirm that the charge was per ROOM and not per DEVICE. The phone was answered by someone who did not understand the language well and she just kept saying \"Yes\", so I repeated my question and just got a \"yes\" response. Upon check out, I explained my conversation, cited the date and the extra charge was removed. I am still annoyed greatly that (1) there is a charge for high speed internet access (2) the connection was unreliable at best and (3) the charge is per device, not per room. I think that's a bit greedy, if you ask me. Oh, and our TV didn't work, so we had to call for assistance with that, too. The cable was bad or something to that effect. It was still annoying.

The hotel would run specials for certain dates, I ended up getting my room for $125 a night. Sounds good to me! If you coming to San Francisco, the Parc is the best hotel if you want to stay in Union Square where everything is. It's right at the Powell train station, up the stairs and you walk across the street you are at the hotel. You have to look carefully when booking rooms in expensive cities such as SF, especially if you feel you need to get a car. If you are coming for pleasure and are staying in Union Square, you don't need a car. The parking in the hotels garages are very expensive. You have the trolleys cars, the Muni, sightseeing tour buses, and if you like walking you don't need a rental car. I can go on and on, but overall, that was my first time in the city and third time to California. I love SF and Parc is my choice for when I go back.

There was an LCD TV (to which you would expect paying over $175/night for a hotel). That's about the jist of the good things. Here's what it didn't have: We booked a room with a king bed... yeah, they didn't have any available. We were stuck with two full beds. Wi-fi was extra $15 per day, parking was an extra $50/night (had no choice), the hotel is also centrally located to a gang of ambulances. Understandably, this isn't the hotel's fault, but being on a higher floor (floor 29), you would expect it be less noisy. Not the case. We were both up a majority of the night every 20 minutes because of this. No fridge, no microwave. Bathroom and shower were fine, room was okay size, elevators were good. All in all, it was nothing that you couldn't get from a travelodge for a hundred bucks cheaper per night. The staff were kind and friendly, as were the valet guys.

Only other note I'd make is that the front neighborhood was fancypants, but if you go around the back, you're in the Tenderloin, which is...colorful.

I arrived in the hotel a 11pm on a Saturday evening only to find the entrance level empty of all apart from one rather aggressive homeless man who had clearly wandered in.

I was leary in making the reservation at first because I hadn't had any experience with this hotel, but it was a last minute trip and options were limited. The rate was significantly lower than the other hotels we usually choose, but the pictures looked nice and it was definitely in the area we were interested in staying. Upon arrival, valets were super friendly and very helpful, and so was the help at the front desk. In fact, ALL of the personnel we encountered on all levels was VERY friendly, and accomodating... a definite FIVE-STARS in that department! The room was nice (very tasteful and modern decor)... spacious bathroom with granite countertop. The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the shower. Nothing luxurious... not even a tub... just a standup shower. Even had a handicap seat in it. The gal at the front desk told us that all rooms with 1 king size bed had a \"handicap shower\"... and all rooms with 2x double beds had a tub/shower combination. I also didn't love the fact that our room had a \"buzzer\" outside it for \"handicap reasons?!\" IF someone chose to push it, a siren sounded INSIDE OF OUR HOTEL ROOM! And, our room was RIGHT next to the elevators... so all evening I was preparing myself for the SHRILL of someone playing a game and pushing the button. lol! Luckily, it didn't happen... but I really couldn't figure that one out. Our room was on the 28th floor and had a SPECTACULAR view of the city AND of the Bay... it really doesn't get much better. Also, our room smelled like smoke when we arrived (YUCK!)... and when we complained/asked about it, we were told there were no other rooms available. The front desk gave us a $25 coupon (which was unneccessary, but VERY kind!) good in their restaurant/lounge and said they'd move us the next morning. They also sent a air purifier to our room which actually helped the situation... totally cleared the smell in a matter of an hour... so we ended up not switching, and appreciated their attention & concern to the situation. The hotel was in easy walking distance of great shopping and eating! HATE the \"oversized vehicle\" charge of $66/day for our SUV... but I know parking is a premium in the city. We love San Fran and will be heading back often. I'm not 100% sure I'd stay here again as I like a little more plush a hotel.

For the work portion of my trip I was only 5 blocks walking distance.

The hotel is somewhat across the street from a Westfield Mall and Market Street where there is a lot of shopping. The hotel is also around the corner from the GAP flood building which my wife loved. San Francisco has great transit and this hotel is close to street cars, cable cars and the BART. My recommendation for the cable cars during lower season is to go up near union square to get on the cable cars. This is how the locals do it and they skip the entire lineup scene. You can simple pay for your ticket once you hop on. This will NOT work during peak season as the cars seem to be jammed right full. Service Other than check-in I did not interact with the hotel staff much. They were pleasant. Value This was a part-work, part personal trip. The value was pretty good for the area.

The rooms were clean and well appointed. I had forgotten my toothbrush and the front desk gave me a small kit with a new toothbrush, a small toothpaste, and a flossing pic. My room was much quieter than my parents room. It almost seemed like my room had newer windows which blocked the outside noise. I was able to sleep with the city noise and my parents had a much more difficult time with the noise. Actually, watching tv in the evening before dinner was much more pleasant in my room than in theirs. There really was that much of a difference in noise and, like I said before, we were only a few rooms apart. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant and it was delicious! All of the entrees that we ordered were outstanding, as was the service, and desserts were delicious. We would return to the hotel again to eat dinner there. Breakfast, on the other hand, was almost inedible. Actually, I was not able to eat my waffle. Parking was not cheap, but we expected that. I did get the rooms for $200 each on priceline, which was a savings. I had looked at other hotels in the area before bidding on priceline and this was a decent deal. 3 star hotels were going for more than this for the same night, so we were happy. I have read other reviews of this hotel where the staff was noted to be less than stellar, this was not the case for us. We were extremely happy with the front desk staff, valets, and the concierge.

A fridge is available but costs $35. Internet is reasonably priced at $14.95 for 24hrs. Previous reviews complained about the street noise. Whilst we could hear traffic throughout the day and night it wasn't bad enough to effect our sleep or request another room like other people have done. It is a central city hotel after all so expect some noise. We used the gym daily. There was a good selection of cardio and weight machines. Whilst the cardio equipment is okay and serves it's purpose, the machines are old, noisy and in need of an upgrade. The hotel is ideally located practically in the center of the city. The BART and trams are nearby, the Westfield shopping center opposite the hotel and Union Square is a 5-10min walk. The only issue we had with the hotel was Hanif the concierge. We found him to be rude and unhelpful. We initially thought he must be having a bad day but we encountered this behaviour a further two times on two separate occasions. Overall we found our stay to be excellent and highly recommend the hotel to others.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurora, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in the Heart of San Fran\u201d", "Author": "bucket_list30", "ReviewID": "UR115573628", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend.

Last time we stayed at the St. Francis. It was running about $400 for a room with a view for July 4th weekend, so I started looking for something more reasonable downtown. Park 55 sounded great. We booked through the hotel website and upgraded to a \"view room\" on the 24th floor. We took the BART from the airport, which has a stop right in front of the hotel. That was very convenient. Renting a car, driving in horrible San Fran. traffic, and paying crazy $50 parking fees didn't interest us. We spent about $60 in cab fare getting around the city for the entire 4 days. Anyways- Check-in went smoothly and the woman at registration was very pleasant. We headed to the elevator bank and waited with about 50 other people. After finally getting into the elevator with around 12 squished people, it took about 5 minutes to drop everyone at each floor. I thought- Uh Oh! My boyfriend is not a patient man... We arrived at our room, set directly behind the elevator and ice machine. I was a bit worried as many reviewers complained about the noise level. (Indeed there are a set of earplugs offered as an \"amenity\" in the room.) The room itself was fine- tastefully though blandly decorated. Our \"view room\" gave us a view of the city, though it looked out on the not so nice side of town. The bathroom was average- nothing special. The outlets and wallpaper look to be 25 years old, but the fixtures where relatively updated. After dropping our luggage, we went down to get a bite to eat. Another 10 minutes in the packed elevator, stopping at every floor.... and we were down. Cab service was convenient and always available out front. Overnight- The bed was comfortable enough. We didn't have any problems with elevator or ice machine noise, but there are always sirens at night from emergency vehicles. I think this is more prevalent as we were so close to the not so nice part of town. I am happy to say the elevator situation became much less busy during our stay, so either there was a big convention that left or maybe some elevators had been out of service. Who knows.

We were kind of frantic when we arrived at the hotel because we were due to return our rental car any minute (we had just arrived from Sonoma), but we wanted to drop our stuff of first. The staff helped us unload the car and get in and out quickly so we could take care of business. While some people on here claim that the hotel looked dated, it looked nice and modern to me, but hey, what do I know? The room was a size that you would expect for a major city, maybe even a little bigger. There were no king bed rooms available yet when we arrived, so I took a 2 double bed room rather than wait. It was less comfortable, but it was my own choice I guess. There was some street noise (we were on the 14th floor), but no more than you would expect from staying in a downtown area of a major city, and not anything that would keep you from falling asleep if you're at all acustomed to urban living. If you want total peace and quiet, why on earth would you stay in downtown San Francisco? The location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing. The cable car, street cars, buses and the BART are all within a block of the hotel. You can walk to Chinatown, Union Square and City Hall. It simply could not have been easier for us to get around the city. Some people on here complained about the neighborhood. San Francisco has a homeless problem. It's not a secret. From what I observed though, the problem is all over the city, and not just in the area surrounding the hotel. If you exercise common sense and ordinary street smarts, you should be fine. Or you can just stay in a hotel by Fisherman's Wharf and not leave Fisherman's Wharf (but why on earth would you want to do that?). Or you can just not go to San Francisco. There were a few things that irked me. On the first day, housekeeping inexplicably took all of our towels but didn't replace any. We had to call down for towels. This did not happen again, though. Also, I am a Wyndham Rewards member, and should have been entitled to perks like free wi-fi, free domestic calls and a welcome basket. None of that was given or offered to me, although I admit that I didn't ask either. We did have a good experience with the conceirge. My husband wanted to go to this restaurant he had seen on the Food Network. All he knew of the place was that it was on Food Network, they served roast beef, and the outside is colorful.

The lobby is strange (on the second floor), but very nicely appointed. We had a room on the 7th floor that wasn't huge (which is to be expected in SF), but space was used very well. We had a decent view considering our room was on a lower floor. The room was clean, comfortable (great bed) and even a bit stylish. While we never ate at any of the on site restaurants, we heard good things. The reason we never ate on site is due to the location. It's very good. It's immediately adjacent to the Powell St. Transit hub (BART, Muni Metro, F-Line- Buses and yes, the Cable Car all right there). It's a great jumping off point for tourists, and also ideally located for business travelers. It's about 2-3 blocks to Union Square and shopping. A nice, easy walk. As has been noted, the Union Square area quickly transitions into the seedier tenderloin. While I never felt unsafe at the Park 55 (the entrances are strategically oriented towards Powell Station and Union Square while turning their back on the Tenderloin), you'll encounter some panhandlers (who congregate around transit hubs and busy areas) without a doubt. This is true no matter where you stay in San Francisco. It should be noted, that the Tenderloin isn't as horrible as it's often made out to be. I've been to a few good bars over there and had some great eats (late night tacos without going to the Mission). In fact, I'd go so far as to say it has a unique flavor/character all of its own. Still, it's not what most tourists want to see when they visit SF and it IS right next door. A bit of advice. San Francisco is a walking city and has good public transit. Parc 55 is right on a transit hub too. Parking in downtown SF can be expensive. I would suggest NOT renting a car for the duration of your stay (you will pay $35+/night to park downtown) and renting one only for when you need it (i.e. a 2-day window where you head to Napa or down to Monterey/Carmel). There are a bunch of car rental places (everything from the big chains like National, Budget, Enterprise, etc. to smaller, local companies) within a block or two of the Parc 55. Save money on nightly parking and only rent on the days that you NEED a car. When you're in the city, you won't need one.

However, once we got to our room we realised we were on the bare minimum floor to be considered a \"view room\" (25th) and because we were the first room off the elevator and in the wing of the hotel, our view was half obscured by the adjacent wing and our privacy was close to nill! When we went to the window to admire the view, several times the room next door had people standing looking out their window too, the rooms across in the other wing waved at us. There was no privacy. We called down to front desk see if we could be switched to a different room due to the view blockage, privacy issue, etc... all they offered is the room directly below ours, which wouldnt be considered a \"view room\" which we paid a preimium for, or a room with 2 double beds on the same floor, which also was no acceptable as we were there for our anniversary. We were so disappointed as there was no way the hotel was full and we were there for 5 days and paid ALOT of money to stay there. The view and location we good but there are other choices that would be comparable. The lobby is beautiful but once you get to the rooms, they are standard, nothing special, except for the view. We feel there was no perks staying here and felt nickel and dimed. They charge a ridiculous fee of $15 a day for internet access that you can get at a hostel or Comfort Inn for free! Seems crazy that a hotel is still charging for what has become standard service in most other hotels. Also they charge $4.50 for the Aquafina bottled water in your room. Parking $50 a day. We were disappointed with there in room coffee as well as it is individual 1-cup-at-a-time deals and ordering a pot of coffee in was over $12! Breakfast prices were outlandish. I made a direct long distance call home (Canada) and for 69 seconds I was charged $12! The walls between rooms are really paper thin. Several times we were woken up by the neighbouring room flipping over in bed. There is alot of noise from the street below, but we didnt mind that as it is apart of the city life we came to experience. The king bed was fine, but they give you 3 standard size floppy pillows and then 3 ginormous cushions that are far too big to try to sleep with and we ended up chucking them on the floor everyday. All in all the hotel is fine, but not worth the $$ they charge, and then to be charged for every extra thing that comes standard in many other places, left a bad taste in our mouth. We were really very disappointed that they didn't try to be more helpful with finding us a better room considering we were staying there for a good stretch of time and we made it clear we were celebrating a special occasion. I was also put off by the $15 a day internet charge, charge for local calls, charge, charge charge. On general principle I refused to pay for the internet and went to the mall right across the street and used their FREE wifi.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texarkana, Texas", "Title": "\u201cSan Francisco\u201d", "Author": "Kimberly2010_10", "ReviewID": "UR109541561", "Content": "Just got home from a sisters trip to San Francisco. \u00c2\u00a0We stayed at the Parc 55. \u00c2\u00a0Upon arrival we walked right up to the desk \u00c2\u00a0with not wait,and Daniel Jones checked us in. \u00c2\u00a0Daniel was very helpful and informative. \u00c2\u00a0He instantly upgraded our room to \u00c2\u00a0club level, and gave us a list of great restaurants and thing to do. \u00c2\u00a0 We stay on the 28th floor in room 2814, the goal was to stay on the highest level possible to reduce the city noise. \u00c2\u00a0The room was nice for San Francisco, and we had a great view of the city. \u00c2\u00a0 Being on the club level was nice because we had access to breakfast, snacks for lunch, and cocktail and dessert in the evening free of charge. \u00c2\u00a0 The only problem that I have with this hotel is the $48.00 charge for parking. \u00c2\u00a0During our stay we had a total of a little over $300.00 in parking charges. \u00c2\u00a0I think that this is a rip off. \u00c2\u00a0 In a conclusion I would stay at this hotel again only if I got free parking or a reduced rate in parking. \u00c2\u00a0Although everything else was good, the parking took the cake. \u00c2\u00a0So beware if you are parking your car there.

When I told her the booking was correct she looked annoyed and then proceeded to give us a room set up for disabled clients without telling us - I phoned down to complain as we were not willing to stay for our six days in a room with no bath tub and hand rails all over the place. Guess what we got the same clerk who huffed and puffed about the hotel being short of king bedded rooms and then allocated us another room this time with a connecting door - which I find really creepy - again without tellingus and making us feel she was doing us a big favour. We asked to be moved again and again over the next three days and we're given the run around - on the third day I was promised a call from a manager - never happened though.

We weren't familiar with them and after looking at some of the reviews on trip advisor, i have to admit, we were a bit concerned.

She called parc 55 and explained her need for thos things plus a quiet room since and they put us in one of their 'pure' rooms.

They also delivered a minifridge minutes after we asked for it. Thanks to Winnie For helping to make our stay a great one! Pure Rooms- very clean, very comfortable bed, decent layout, great views.

Upon checking in, the front desk clerk said I was a club guest but then proceeded to put me on a NON-club floor. The interior decorations look very 90s, the bathtub is out of the 60s, so I called to ask if there was a renovated floor. The operator said all the rooms were recently renovated (yikes!), and only the club floor rooms are bigger. Telling him my room was small, he said that I was not on a club floor. Then told him I paid for a club floor room, he checked my reservation, said I was correct and put me in touch with someone in the executive offices. She quickly told me I should have gotten a club floor room and would send someone to move my belongings. A bellman soon came to the door. My belongings were waiting, basically in easily movable form, and he told me he wouldn't move my shoes. What? He told me I had to pack them up. He had a giant travel cart and couldn't put my shoes on it? So I took a laundry service plastic bag and packed them up. He finally took them. I arrived on a Thursday night, so I enjoyed the gym and then got some sparkling water in the club room. It is then that I see the placard stating that EVERYTHING except breakfast is UNAVAILABLE Friday through Sunday. No dessert, no free soda, no quiet views - nothing that I paid for except breakfast. That should be stated in large letters before one books through the website or any vendor. Finally, to add insult to injury, I woke up Sunday morning around 9:30 am and got to the club room breakfast at 9:45, 15 minutes before the place was closing. The pickings were slim. No more bagels, no more croissants, the dregs of yogurt. So I asked if there were any more croissants, and the Wyndham employee looked at me like I had asked him to donate the contents of his wallet to me. It seems to me that I paid for this breakfast, and everything should be available at the end of the meal time as it was at the beginning.

Also the first elevator I have ever seen that stands up for a cause...it is repectful to vertically challenged people...the numbers go in opposite directions on each side. One side starts at 1 and goes down and the other side starts at 34 and goes down...confusing to us tall people at first but once I figured out I wasnt crazy I thought it was very cool and caring to others.

Although we enjoyed the convenient location of union square, we find the hotel accomodation and service disappointing for the following reasons: 1. Upon arriving at the entrance, we were told by the valet staff to \"unload your bags and leave the keys\". there were no concierge staff or luggage carts to assist. Better service would have been a hotel staff member with a luggage cart meeting us at our car to help with our luggages in. 2. Checking in was smooth until we got to our rooms and discovered that the rooms had one king bed each instead of two queen as requested. we called the front desk and were told by Jeff, the manager, that there were no other rooms available and the options were to have another bed brought in or stay where we were and got changed the next night. we told jeff the choices were unacceptable. we were then told to wait in our room until concierge call us back. after half an hour wait, we went down to the front desk, waited in line for another half an hour before talking to another manager, Tasha. she then was able to change our rooms without any problem. Instead of the run around, better service would have been to switch us at our first request. 3. A club room stay included continental breakfast between 6 am to 10 am. At various time, the room was packed with no seats. There were people standing with breakfast in hand while eating. ?Requests to take breakfast to the room to enjoy was denied. Better service would have been to use a larger room for breakfast or allow guests to bring their breakfast to their rooms or have more than 2 hotel staff to clean tables and have them ready for next guests. 4. I used the gym once at 5 am during our stay and was disappointed at seeing used towels on the floor. at that early morning, the gym is empty but should have been clean. Better service would have been a staff attendance to clean the machine and pick up dirty towels. A nice touch would have been a water dispenser or some kind of refreshment corner for guests to enjoy. Instead, the hotel had a vending machine. Guests usually don't carry money when going to a hotel gym to exercise. 5. Room was comfortable, limited storage place, had two 12 by 12 inch drawers for clothes storage. Better service would have been more than 2 drawers that size. We ended up using our luggages as storage. Internet use was $13 /day. The hotel boasts its reputation for business/leasure travelers. Better service would have been free internet. 6. Upon checking out, we found out that the hotel charged us for parking anyway, despite confirmed reservation for free parking. The staff was quick to fix the error, but again, at our inconvenience of waiting in line for a resolution. 7. Security was poor. Anybody from the streets could have walked into the hotel, taken any elevator to any floors. Room access requires a key, but the hotel halls and bathroom facilities are open to all. Better security would have been a room key access at least to the elevators.

Along the bottom of the windows in the room there is a lever to open and close a narrow space if you wanted fresh air, and perhaps those folks who found it noisy had that open without knowing it. The thermostat in my room worked perfectly if I wanted more heat on a cool night. The location couldn't have been better and very safe for walking to restaurants, theaters, shopping etc. The tenderloin is just West of the Hotel and I would avoid that area as there is nothing to see there anyway, [except for a great restaurant/bar 'Farmer Browns' close to the hotel] and as is the case in SF panhandlers are out in force around the West side of Union Square but only want spare change and will not hassle you if you pass them by from a distance. They are a fact of life in that part of the city. The Hotel service staff were skilled and very friendly. At times I could see a line up to check in at the very large hotel but it moved quickly. For such a large busy hotel there was no waiting time for the elevator and the common areas were not crowded or noisy. I had the breakfast buffet there twice and it was very good as was the service. The only criticism I could think of was that the Wi-Fi in the room could have been faster as it was slow during peak periods, but I was able to use it just fine.

I stayed here for two nights over the recent Columbus Day holiday weekend with my partner. I had another reservation at an upscale hotel in FiDi (twice the rate of the Parc 55 but was still considered a fantastic rate for that particular hotel) but in the end, I chose to stay here. I thought I would regret the decision I made. I thought the Parc was going to be too large, too impersonal, and overall, just not live up to my standards. I was ready to be disappointed and regret my decision to stay here...boy, was I wrong! Valet parking was a breeze even though the hotel was booked to capacity on the dates of my stay. The cost of parking for a SF hotel was reasonable ($41 + tax per day). Check-in was easy as well. The hotel lobby was nice and spacious. When we got up to our room, we'd found that we'd been given a handicapped room. It would have been fine but we found the sliding bathroom door did not close all the way. Since I was traveling with my partner and this was only our second trip together, I did not find this to be acceptable. I went downstairs and the front desk staff was apologetic and searched for another room. Within a few minutes, they were able to locate another room (higher floor, same bed size, corner room! upgrade!!). They also rerouted our refrigerator that had been sent to our original room to our new room. There were no hiccups with our special request and they never acted like I was bothering them at all. Our new corner room had two windows, a large TV, and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was large and very clean. The shower pressure was awesome! We never heard another peep from the neighbors except for the occasional door closing. We did hear sirens from the streets below (we were on the 23rd floor) but this was to be expected. This was not an extremely large room but for traveling with one other person, this was a good size. No complaints here whatsoever with our room. For such a large hotel, I never had to wait long for an elevator. Even though the hotel was bustling (a good feeling), it never felt crowded. The valets were quick to respond and extremely pleasant and helpful. We never had to wait long for our car to be pulled around. Staff was also helpful with organizing cab rides at the taxi stand conveniently located near the entrance. The concierge was also helpful with directions and maps. The front desk graciously gave us an extra hour to checkout as well. Finally, the hotel is conveniently located to the 80 freeway making it very easy to get in/out of the city. I've been to SF many times over the last 15 years and have no worries about staying near the Tenderloin. As long as you don't make yourself a target, walk briskly and confidently, and don't walk through there at night, it's not a problem. I know this has been mentioned on here so I just wanted to put my 2 cents in... I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city. Fantastic value for your money and first class service all around!

Our room was a corner king on the 21st floor. We were upgraded to a room with Club Access. The room was very spacious with views of two different parts of San Francisco. It included a small couch by the window that provided a very pleasant atmosphere. Overall the room was very clean and the maid service was excellent. The one complaint are TERRIBLE pillows. Very difficult to sleep on. I would advise requesting extra pillows or inquiring about better pillows. Club Access includes a complimentary breakfast, evening snacks, cocktails and desserts. Club Access is a very good option for travelers with children because the breakfast offering is very diverse and includes fruit, pastries, various sliced breads, cereals, cold cuts and juices. The house coffee is Starbucks. Internet/Business center Wireless in the room is $15/day or $44/week. The business center is fairly small but has enough computers and printers. Health Club Health club is very well equipped, with free weights, machines and numerous cardio machines. The cardio machines have personal TVs, but not all of the TVs work. Cityhouse restaurant We ate there twice and the food was good, but pretty overpriced. The late night scene at the Cityhouse is very lively and it is a great place to grab a late night meal and drinks. Keep your eye open for celebrities that walk in. Room service We ordered room service one morning and our bill was $70 for two omelettes and a pot of coffee.

Overall it was a very good experience. As noted in several reviews, its location is terrific being central to the BART, buses, and cable cars. The BART from SFO is $8.10 and has a stop at the hotel near Powell St. We walked everywhere and to Chinatown about a 1 mile and up to Nob Hill. Our car rental was through Enterprise which was located across the street. Valet parking is $45 per nite which was the standard for the area. A very touristy location with plenty of high end shopping (Nordstrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Saks etc) and the very large Westfield Mall, all a few steps from Parc 55. This is a very large hotel 1,000+ yet the service both at the front desk and housekeeping was very good. We booked directly through the hotel and their special 20% off for 3 nites worked out to $120 per nite. The room was a king deluxe that was good size and the bath was large with strong shower and all the amenities with good quality towels. HD TV was in all rooms. In house safe was complimentary. The room was made up on a timely basis. The elevators were fast and for a hotel this size, (it was sold out) never had to wait. The 4th floor business center had complimentary internet with a bank of 5 pc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and there was always a free one. In room internet was $12.95. One foul up was our room on the 9th floor had a distinct smell of smoke that required an aerosol that was promptly delivered by housekeeping. The front desk offered an upgrade but we were so tired passed on their offer and the aerosol did wonders to correct the problem. We did take them up on the offer for our last nite and got a Club Concierge room on the 27th floor which came with continental breakfast. The front desk was very accommodating in some of our minor requests as well.. There is plenty of places close by to grab a coffee in the morning. There are a fair amount of homeless people in the several blocks around the hotel so be aware when walking.

Now for the rest of the review: You could hardly do better than Parc 55 in terms of location. Right next to BART and the turntable for the cable cars. By taking a gamble on Priceline it was priced right. I would not have paid published rates. Due to such high traffic all the carpet and common areas look soiled and well worn. The place is so sterile and gray it seems fairly institutional and depressing - very stark. My children had a hard time believing we were actually in a hotel until we made our way to the room. If you're not planning to hang at the hotel all day - who really cares? The location really does make up for a myriad of deficiencies. The room was nice and of a decent size with an excellent view from the 16th floor. If you do have children who seem to be more interested in the hotel pool than they are in the Golden Gate Bridge - this may not be the place for you. Although, knowing there was none, we didn't hear the constant usual nagging as to when we might be able to swim. It seems they are very short staffed on housekeeping. We'd been gone from all day - 8a-4p. When we came back, no one had been to tidy up at all. At 4:30 they finally showed up and wanted us to leave so they could clean. 4:30? Really? We politely told them never mind but they kept interrupting us every half hour until about 7 to make sure we really meant it. Bottomline: If you can get it at near half published rates go for it.

They also rang up later to see if we were OK which was nice. The room on 24th floor was perfectly adequate if not as cracking as the website, it was of reasonable size, great beds and linen, good tele, coffee maker, desk, nice bay window with slight glimpse of water through buildings and small table and chairs. The bathroom was a good size with good shower and fitments but the bath was very low indeed which made it difficult to use without flooding the floor and there were bath requisites with soap bars rather than shower gel. There was very little drawer space which didnt matter too much to us on a short trip, there were two suitcase frames for suitcase living. There was a connecting door but this didnt impact on us. The decoration was a little tired as were the public areas, we saw a lot of cleaning going on but I dont think the colour scheme helps.The room was quiet (high floor helps) and we slept well. We taxied in quite reasonably from the airport, and the hotel luggage attendant offered us a stretch limo back for a little extra. A couple of niggles about unneccessary meanness : there were 2 bottles of water in the room which were charged at quite a high rate, complimentary wouldve been a nice touch: The room wifi charge was high, OK for business users on expenses but annoying for poor tourists, there was a free business centre with 6 ish PCs and 2 printers and a further 3 or so and a printer in the corridor but it was generally clogged with facebook refugees from the room wifi charge. I had to join a queue at various times including trying to check in, might be worth designating a pc and printer for checking in like other hotels. Also it would be nice to have more seating by the door area while waiting for taxis tours etc. The location was great being near Union Square but also near the vintage cable car terminus and the interesting trolley buses stop, both for Fishermans Wharf. A favourite trip was trolley bus to either the Ferry building and/or Pier 39 and then cable car back from the Mason Street terminus.

Our room was on the 10th floor at the back of the hotel, which meant that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much of a view, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffer from any traffic noise that some reviewers had commented about. The room was also larger than I had expected with a king size bed, large flat screen TV, desk, sofas (one of which was a sofa bed). It also had a wardrobe which contained the typical safe and also an ironing board and iron which was a first for me. The bathroom was clean and adequate and the shower was nothing special. It is also worth mentioning at this point that it seems that this hotel is favoured by airline companies. We have noticed large groups of staff from BA and Lufthansa waiting for their rooms . We enjoyed a buffet breakfast at the restaurant which was very good. It had a selection of cold meats cheese, cereal, juices, smoothies and also a selection of hot food with egg, bacon etc. Just behind the lifts were 3 computers which were free to use, with access to the internet, which was very useful. The hotel location was great near all forms of transport, almost on Market Street, which has all the top end shops. It is near the Westfield shopping centre, near Union Square and near the tram that connects Market Street to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Warf, which is a big attraction for tourists. Just one note I would like to make here. If you are new to San Francisco please look up the areas that you should stay away from (its easy to do with your search engine), as for some reason the top end hotels seem to be in or next to areas that are not very nice and you wont want to take a wrong turn to these places which is easy to do.

Review: In the middle of the summer in a tourist city like SF you more of less expect to a bad hotel experience because it's the crowded high season. I was pleasantly surprised to find the Parc put out the extra effort and make our stay actually pleasant and memorable. The staff was universally friendly and accommodating. They were not fake or snobbish or constantly shaking us down for tips, which I have experienced in other SF hotels. Although there were times when the staff seemed disorganized, they worked to correct mistakes instead of offering glib apologies.

How can this even happen after my effort of informing the hotel? As it was late at night and we were tired from our 20+hours flight, we had no choice but to take up the room with 2 queen beds. The front desk staffs were not very understanding and apologetic, basically he was trying to tell us to take it or leave it. I believe our case is not a single incident because when we came down again to grab some food after checking in, I overheard that there was this couple at the front desk facing the same problem again. Further, I would add that there is no free wifi in the hotel, the internet would costs $12.95 per night. As part of the Wydham group hotels, I do not think this is justifiable. There is also always a queue for checking in, checking out and concierge service. I do not find the staffs particularly friendly, other than this chinese girl at the front desk.

We attempted to muffle the sound by putting items along the floor at the foot of the door, but there was discernible effect. We Pricelined it, we had 2 double beds, only used one & it was cozy, we were across the hall from the ice machine/vending/elevators & an employees area that they like to congregate at and have full volume conversation.

Priceline lets you know that there may be additional charges, but if you knew the size of the parking fee you might not bid. Of course you have in and out privileges, so its a deal.

I've never used name your own price before but figured this was a good time to start. I was concerned because there were 5 of us, and the hotel wouldn't pre-book anything when I called them after they had my money. All their connecting rooms connect 1K to 2D. Nearly all of their 1K rooms also have a pullout couch. Their rooms with 2D are so small they can not take a rollaway. They told me a rollaway in a 1K room would not be a problem. At checkin, they didn't treat me like a priceline deadbeat, they put me in the rooms we needed with no problem. By mistake those rooms didn't have a pullout, so by asking very nicely we were offered a free upgrade to one of the rooms to a minisuite, which was fantastic. The hotel is pretty much at the edge of the Tenderloin, the sketchy part of town - the area to the west and perhaps south is 'iffy'. If that bothers you, you're not likely to avoid 'sketchy' by paying more for another hotel in another area. The area to the north and east is the heart of downtown SF, which is why you're here. Walk 1 block to the cable car, take it to fishermans wharf, and enjoy the world's most beautiful city. The hotel charges $53/night for parking which is insane even for this area. I found Best Parking at 525 Jones St for $20/night - had no problems. Jones St area is a tad sketchy but I don't worry about such issues. Note that is you are flying in from out of town, it would be insane to rent a car to travel into SF - take mass transit instead. You do not drive around SF or to or from the airport - take bart, muni, whatever.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Stay!\u201d", "Author": "Iwouldratherdrive", "ReviewID": "UR67071447", "Content": "My wife and I stayed 1 night at the Parc 55 on our way through San Francisco.

We then went up to our room and while it did have the \"city view\" that we paid for the bathroom was extremely awkward with a sliding door that did not lock or shut well along with rails everywhere.

Am I glad it was accepted by Parc 55 Wyndham. For the purpose of our trip, which was to be a quick get-away for an extended weekend for my wife and I, it was perfect. Before leaving for San Fran, I checked the property's reviews here, as I always do, and was somewhat daunted by some of the reviews which gave me the impression I may have made a mistake. I hadn't. Having never been to San Francisco before, I wasn't sure about whether the location of the hotel, among other things, might not be suitable for us. My doubts turned out to be unfounded. The location of the Parc 55 allowed us easy access to every important public transit mode available there, which is important if you're not driving. The BART took us directly from SFO to within a block from the hotel (and to Oakland later) and back to the airport again later. The cable-car turn-around is in the same location, and trolley and major bus routes are an easy walk away. Every major store on our list was within an easy few block walk, as were restaurants of almost every description, from Subway, to pubs, to classy Italian restaurants and some intriguing far eastern restaurants. Many attractions are also close at hand, Union Square chief among them. The accomodations were more than adequate. The lobby and supporting common spaces were modern, well lit, clean and spacious. The business centre is easily accessible and with properly functioning computers (free of charge to guests). The fitness facility is state-of-the-art with new machines of every description, bright and airy, they even had a bowl of fresh fruit (apples, oranges and bananas) which was often replenished (nice touch). I didn't get to the meeting rooms, which were busy during our stay there. The hotel never seemed too crowded. Elevators were always quick to arrive. The room we had was a king, non-smoking on the 16th floor. It was spacious, nicely appointed and VERY clean. The bed was comfortable with quality linens. The bathroom was modern, roomy and perfectly functioning. Water pressure was almost too strong. They are smart to have pressure modulating valve controls on the shower (you preset it from low to high), but the water comes out at very high velocity in the sink. You have to manually adjust the pressure to suit your needs. Yes, the sounds from street level were audible, you ARE in the centre of a large urban area. But the fresh air slots at the bottom of the windows can be closed which mitigates it somewhat. We set the A/C unit blower on high at night which provided some white noise, partially neutralizing the street sounds. We never encountered the seedy element I've seen mentioned by some other reviewers near the hotel. If I hadn't read about it here, I still would have no idea about the Tenderloin district. It never registered with us at all. Every city has some degree of that type of area, and one has to be a bit prepared when entering into the centre of a large metro zone. There were the inevitable homeless people around the BART station, etc., but with the exception of one slightly annoying panhandler they were almost polite. We always felt safe at any time of night or day.

Check-in ======= Be prepared to hand over your credit card, they wouldnt take a cash deposit for our room - I've never had a problem at any other hotel before (if you are travelling to multiple destinations you know how annoying it can be if all money is tied up in pre-authorisations). What was most concerning is that the check in lady simply started swiping away and charging my card before she'd even told me what she was doing or what the amount was Then on checkout we saw the fineprint on our bill that the hotel policy is that the funds dont get released by the hotel for up to two days after you actually checkout. Rooms ====== I STRONGLY suggest you ask for a room on a high floor or you wont be able to sleep. The rooms were clean and neatly appointed. Other things worth noting ================== Gym - Really good - good range of machines and free weights, all brand new. No Pool No Guest Laundry No in room safe - small deposit boxes (passport size) are available at reception Location ====== Generally good, the hotel located close to shopping in Union Square, Westfield San Fran Centre, cable cars, and street cars.

The BART station is right in front, the cable car turnaround is a block away and there is a streetcar stop right across the street. All your necessary means of transportation are at your disposal. Though I do see what some reviewers said about it being on a \"seedy\" part of town, I never felt unsafe walking around, though the latest we were out was around 10PM. The outside/public areas of the hotel are gorgeous. They have these amazing San Francisco \"scenes\" (cable car, painted ladies, gg bridge, etc) carved into the walls outside by the entrance behind the valet parking attendant. The lobby is also very big and modern. The service is ok. The staff are polite enough, but not overly personable. If you are looking for that, I wouldn't stay here. That doesn't bother me so much, so it wasn't an issue. I did, however, feel that because we were \"pre-paid\" customers, that we weren't \"worth\" getting our room request. It ended up working out in our favor but felt a little snubbed, lol. Another note, this hotel has smoking rooms. I'm not sure if this is the norm in San Francisco (I thought the city was generally about good health!) but that surprised me. We almost ended up with one but luckily a non-smoking room turned up! (Phew). Ah yes, about the noise, we asked for a room AWAY from the cable car turnaround and heard nothing at night or during the day. Earplugs not needed! The rooms are ok. Very clean, which is super important. Modern-looking, really very typical. Big enough, it had a small double couch in it, though made it feel a little tight. A few things though. The room did not have much drawer space at all. There is a closet to hang stuff but only a few hangers. It also did not have a safe, which really surprised me. I had thought that was the norm in hotels these days, maybe I'm wrong. The hotel does have safe deposit boxes at the desk but seemed annoying to have to go up and down to get things so we didn't bother with it. Actually, housekeeping was great and didn't really throw ANYTHING away unless it was obviously supposed to be so I actually had no problem with leaving stuff unlocked (though I didn't leave it out in plain view, of course)! There also isn't a fridge in the room. This may be expecting too much. But when we walked in, the TV is on a huge stand that when opened looked like a fridge should have been in it, but just had open space. Maybe it was supposed to be there? No idea. Anyway, overall this hotel isn't a bad choice. The location is great, the rooms are clean and the staff is polite enough.

Everything was pretty good when I got there. When I first checked in I asked if they had any rooms on a higher level and they had one. When we got to our room we found out that it was a handicap room. Neither my girlfriend or I was comfortable with that. It would have been nice if he had told us that before he gave us the room. I called front desk and they switched it. We got a room that was on a lower floor but that was ok. The last night we stayed we decided to order room service. I saw on the menu that they were going to close pretty soon. When I called down they said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153its good that you called now because we were going to close. Giving me no indication that there was going to be any problem. I ordered the ceaser salad and some cheeseburger sliders. I am serious when I say it only took them from when I got off the phone to when that brought up the food less than 10mins. I just thought they had really good room service but I was wrong. It seemed like they took a half of a head of lettuce and cut it in half and put it on a plate. Now with the burger, I started to eat the burger and I noticed it was really juicy. I looked at it and the inside was RAW. I looked at the other ones and they were all raw and only cooked on the outside. I called down immediately and I was transferred over to the restaurant manager. She said she was really sorry and she would take the bill off the room. I asked if she could cook them again because I was still hungry but she said she could not. She said everything was put away and she did not know where anything was. I was not too happy about that. And yes I do have pictures The next morning when I went to check out the lady there did not seem really sorry about what had happened. I told her that I do not think I will stay at this hotel again and she said that was too bad. So just a reminder to all, if you stay at this hotel do not order room service when they are about to close because that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cook your food\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.

We decided before the trip that instead of taking a taxi, we would take the BART. It was more than half the price cab fare would have been and it was fast, easy to use, comfortable and convenient. We noticed that a lot of other travelers were also using the BART. If you take the BART to the Powell Street station, the hotel is just across the street. It doesn't get more convenient than that. Check-in at the hotel was a breeze. Mavis helped us with our room and she was very friendly and chatted with us about our stay. She put us in a corner room on the 17th floor with lovely views of the City through the two large windows on two sides of the room. The room was spacious with a large bathroom, closet with an alcove for your luggage, large flat screen TV, writing table, coffee table, and couch. The bed was very comfortable and after long days spent walking around town, it felt really good to sleep on such a comfortable mattress. The shower was very good too with a massaging shower head and plenty of hot water. The room was always kept in excellent condition by the cleaning staff. At night there was street noise like police sirens and car horns honking but it was never so bad that you couldn't fall asleep. It was more like background noise than anything else and didn't have any negative impact on our trip. The hotel was very modern looking, clean and impressive. The elevators were always very fast and you never had to wait long for one. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is close to everything - BART, Municipal transportation, cable cars, shopping (Nordstrom, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Tiffany, Bloomingdale's ... just to name a few) and restaurants. Everything is just steps from the hotel which made the location ideal. We went to see \"Wicked!\" our second night there. During the daytime, we had walked to the theatre to see how far it was from the hotel It was a bit of a walk and we wouldn't have minded walking there to see the show but we noticed that along the way, there were many (and by many I mean A LOT) of homeless people and people smoking pot. For some reason the theatre is located in a very shady neighborhood. This is coming from someone who lives in New York City and sees shady people on a normal basis and thinks nothing of it but what we saw there took it to another level. In fact, there wasn't a single day where we didn't smell someone smoking pot or where we weren't standing near someone who reeked of it. It was nasty. Also, we've never seen such a concentrated mass of homeless people anywhere either. Anyway, not too many of them approached us or bothered us but a word of advice would be to take the BART from the hotel one stop to the Civic Center and get to the theatre that way. That's what we did and that's what many other theatre goers did as well. It's cheap, fast and safe. If you plan on going to Alcatraz and booked tickets, you can go right onto Market Street by the hotel and take the F-line Streetcar right to Pier 33 where the ferry to Alcatraz is located. When you get back from Alcatraz, you can take a short walk to Pier 39 (Fisherman's Wharf). There you can find shopping and a whole lot of restaurants. Then when you're done, just take the F-line Streetcar back to the hotel. If you plan on going to the Golden Gate Bridge, you can take the Municipal Bus there and just ask your bus driver for a transfer ticket although they really do automatically give you one. The transfer ticket is good for a few hours so you can hop on and off buses until it runs out. Not bad for two dollars. You'll need to take the 45 bus (we hopped on while in Chinatown) to Chestnut and Laguna and then get off and transfer to the 28 bus. The 28 bus will drop you off a few steps from the Golden Gate Bridge. That's what we did and it was pretty easy and convenient. We walked part of the bridge until it started to rain and we had to turn back. When going back, be aware that there are two 28 buses that stop there. You need to make sure you get on the 28 bus headed to Fort Mason and not the one headed to Daly City. The Fort Mason 28 bus will bring you back to Chestnut and Laguna where you can get off and transfer back to the 45 bus. As for food, we didn't have the best of luck finding good food while in town. We ate at a Chinese place by the hotel called Tian Sing. It was the most expensive dim sum I ever ate in my life! We had one plate of vegetable lo mein and about 6 different dim sum and a pot of tea and it cost us about forty-five dollars! I almost fainted. In NYC that would have cost us like $20 maybe. So yeah we wouldn't recommend eating there. We also wouldn't recommend Blondie's Pizza. Being from NYC, we know what good pizza is and Blondie's was inedible. It was too doughy and had practically zero tomato sauce. We had pizza another night (because nothing else was open) from Pizza Prada and that was much better. It wasn't too doughy and had a decent amount of sauce. I know this is going to sound absolutely insane but it's so true ... the BEST pizza was at the airport! I swear to you. It was from Firewood Pizza and it was amazing. They make it fresh to order and it was like brick oven pizza with a thin, but not too thin, crackly crust, a flavorful generous heaping of sauce, mozzarella and fresh sliced tomatoes with basil. I know ... the airport?! But yes ... the airport. Crazy but true and trust me ... you have to try it! Okay so back to town. We also ate at the hotel's Thai restaurant (Siam Thai) twice. The food was good but sometimes they could have used some more spice or something to make the food more flavorful. They could have also used more sauce in their pad thai because it was too dry. We ate at Boudin Bakery where we both had bread bowls filled with soup. One word - Amazing. The bread is fresh, flavorful and so good and the soup was just delicious. My fiance had the clam chowder and I had the rustic tomato. If you're going to eat anywhere, we positively recommend Boudin Bakery. They have a location at Fisherman's Wharf and another location bu Ghirardelli Square. There was also a location by the hotel and on Friday night we wanted to eat there so badly but when we got there at 7:00 it was closed and we were so devastated and that's when we went to Pizza Prada. We also ate at Bellini and had the bruschetta, garlic bread and the capellini pomodoro. The food there was really good and was actually much better than I thought it would be. We wanted to see the sea lions but while we were there, reports on the news stated that the sea lions were gone and that scientists believed that they left due to the dwindling food supply. In the end, we would definitely recommend the Parc 55 Hotel.

Got the room for $62 a night through priceline. After reading reviews of the hotel, I knew to ask for a corner room on an upper floor -- we were given room 1301 which had windows on two sides and beautiful views of the city -- especially at night. the staff was friendly and accomodating. The room was large, with LOTS of bay windows all around, a spacious changing room, and a good sized bathroom. Good selection of TV channels. A previous review said there was no coffee maker -- there's actually a one-cup coffee maker hidden in the console below the TV. The complaints are minor -- the bathroom could use more counter and towel rack space. The curtains didn't always open in a direction that allowed the best possible view of the city. The TV set was positioned directly across from the bed -- for most hotels this would be perfect. For a hotel with these kinds of views, it blocked some of our city view while lying in bed. The \"easy chair\" in the room was not very comfortable. However, relative to the value we got from the hotel, these complaints are all minor. When you arrive, check with the concierge about which parts of the neighborhood to avoid -- when you go in one direction, everything's fine. In the other direction, it gets dicey very quickly. The gym is fantastic! Lots of treadmills and ellipticals, along with weight machines. mats. balls, etc. The only complaint here is that the view out the gym windows is obstructed -- would have been nice to watch the goings on below while working out. I had read that parking was expensive, so we came prepared. My companion is handicapped and has a handicapped permit -- we parked at UCSF for free and took the N-Judah directly to the hotel. (the stop is 1 short block away from the hotel). The hotel is also about a block away from the Powell cable car, which goes to Fisherman's Wharf -- a fun ride and destination. I noticed on Saturday morning at 4:30 that some of the local businesses receive deliveries. I guess this explains the free ear plugs they have in the bathroom.

We normally do this every year and have stayed at various hotels, however, this hotel became a favorite of ours in the city. We found awesome rates on the web and decided to give this hotel a try. We live about 2 hours south of San Francisco and decided to stay for the weekend in downtown. We stayed at the Parc 55 Hotel and I was simply amazed how nice it was, and how close it was to almost everything! This was our first time staying there, and we truly enjoyed our stay . Upon check in, the woman that assisted us was very kind and informative about the hotel. This hotel was recently renovated and re opened a couple of months ago. What was even more nice was she even upgraded our room to the 28th floor belonging to the Executive Level. Having a room at the Executive Level provided awesome views and complimentary breakfast at their clubroom on the 31st floor. The rooms had a nice contemporary look to it, plenty of space, and were very clean! The beds were very comfy as well! The hotel is situated in a widely popular centralized shopping area. It's right acoss the street from the San Francisco center and Bloomingdales. And right around the corner, not even a block away, is Powell St. which leads you to Union Square as well as Market Street. So you can imagine all the shopping and dining you can conquer being that the hotel was so close to everything! At night we walked up about 2 blocks up Powell Street to the Sir Francis Drake hotel where they have a nice dining lounge at their very top floor with amazing views of the city called the Starlight Room. There are also so many others that are only a walking distance away! The only downside we experienced was the valet parking. It was way too much. They charged $45 a day. So even though we felt we scored awesome rates staying at this hotel, the cost of valet makes it even more costly. But that's usually what you should expect in the city. There are parking garages nearby for half the rate, however they're not as close as you think and you'd still have quite a walk to the hotel. Overall, this hotel is awesome.

The room was clean and comfortable. I wasn't crazy about the mattress but the kiddo and hubby didn't mind. We ate at the Italian resturant right next door, Puccini & Pinetti. We all really liked it.

We had a club room located on the 29th (out of 33) floor. Judging by the pics I've seen of rooms on here, it doesn't look like the Club Room was all that much bigger than a regular room. But they are on higher floors to help keep you away from traffic noise and get's you access to the Club level which serves a continental breakfast, hor d'ouerves (sp?) in the evening and desert starting at 7pm. The hor douerves were only so-so in my opinion and seemed to be the same every night. The deserts changed nightly and some of it was very good. The Continental breakfast was rather basic, but plentiful enough to make sure everyone gets plenty to eat. Given a choice between the continental breakfast and going out to a restaurant/diner for breakfast, I'd take the continental. Given the extra cost of a Club Room, I was expecting a few more amenities like a small fridge or free internet access but overall, I can't complain as it was still far cheaper than comparable rooms at other hotels. The main draw is the location. It is right across the street from the Powell Bart/Muni Station (note: Go up the stairs to the left. The escalator will point you in the wrong direction) And you're within one block of the Powell street cable cars and various Bus/street car lines. As we were relying strictly on public transit to get around, this hotel was perfect. The hotel does tend to nickel and dime you for services that you might get for less of free elsewhere. Internet access has a daily charge. They have a mail service that charges $8 per package (in addition to the shipping cost) They have 2 computer rooms, but even those charge you per 20 minutes and charge you per page printed ($1 for B/W and $3 for color if I recall) The staff was very helpful. The concierge was able to answer all of our public transit questions. We were flying out on Virgin America. While the hotel does have computers (free of charge) set up for people to check in and print their boarding passes, for whatever reason, the Virgin America site was partially blocked making it impossible to print out the boarding passes. The front desk print out the boarding passes from their computer for us. We had the \"Do not Disturb\" sign on the door one time when housekeeping came around. Housekeeping called and said we could call them anytime and they'd come up and take care of the room.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv", "Title": "\u201cVery good choice\u201d", "Author": "IdoTLV", "ReviewID": "UR47967452", "Content": "Pros: - Beautiful rooms, especially those on high floors with view of the city - Great location at Union Square - Well maintained and clean - Airconditioned rooms (which is not trivial in SF) Cons: - Staff isn't that friendly (especially front desk) - No fridge in the room - No safety deposit box in most rooms (there are deposit boxes at the front dest for free) Overall, a very good choice for visiting SF.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cOnly let down by the little things\u201d", "Author": "JeffBarnes", "ReviewID": "UR47893762", "Content": "Great location, clean rooms etc but just lacking a bit of class and thought.

Airy, large bright rooms; pleasant staff; cozy bar; good location. We came to SF for the Outside Lands music festival and stayed four nights here. Everything went smoothly -- from checkin (early, at 1:00 p.m., with no fuss), checkout (late, no charge, again no fuss), larger room than expected (corner), charming and pleasant staff from desk clerk to housekeepers to doormen. Our room, on the 12th floor, was our base for exploring and for take-out food at night. The room was very clean and well-maintained (one evening housekeeping brought a bed bolster that we never knew was missing). Large LG flat-screen TV was fine, on a credenza with multiple electronic media outlets and two cables in drawer. View was reasonable and nicely lit up at night. Loveseat/sofabed combo, small coffee table, desk and desk chair all allowed comfy seating and relaxing/snacking. Water bottles provided in room at $4.50 USD for 1 liter each were pricey: instead, run to the corner and half a block east to Walgreens and grab a sixpack of H2O. We didn't use the small coffeemaker, but ran to Starbucks and local coffee places each morning (expect 15-20 minute waits, coffeehouses stay busy). Air conditioning (internal unit) was responsive, audible but not too loud. By the way, there are vents under each window that roll open to allow fresh air in! I didn't notice these until the third day. We didn't visit the hotel restaurant but it looked elegant and the menu was appealing. There are numerous restaurants within a block or two: Indian/Pakistani, Thai, sushi, Irish, Italian, pizza, etc. (Punjab was our favorite, on the southwest corner behind the hotel.) The bartender did pour generously on our visit to the bar, and the space was welcoming with relaxing chairs and careful lighting. The Parc 55 is located near the Powell Street transport station, so it's near buses, underground, surface rail, and streetcars. Easy walking distance to shopping, museum area, Union Square, and a bit longer hike to Chinatown. Taxis are queued for longer trips. On noise: San Francisco is a busy city. You will hear traffic, fire engines, police sirens, and sometimes loud voices frequently during the day and night, no matter WHERE you stay.

I am a regular traveler, staying in hotels about once every other month or so for several days, and I have stayed in several other hotels in SF that are rated the same as the Parc 55. The biggest difference between these hotels is that the Parc 55 really doesn't seem to value customer service. There was a convention going on during my stay, but from what the staff said there is usually a convention going on. This might have had an effect on my service, but if conventions are a regular event, then I doubt the service improves much from week to week. The good: I got a Club room on the 29th floor and the room and view were beautiful. The breakfast was delicious and varied and I was very glad I upped my reservation for this alone. The bad: The service in general was awful, but be especially wary of the bell staff. When I first arrived my luggage was loaded on to a cart and taken up to meet me at the 2nd floor registration. During the 5 minutes of travel time a small bag containing cash and other valuables went missing. When I pointed this out I was asked to check my car, person, etc. to make sure I had not misplaced it. I did and the bag was just gone, but I know for a fact it was on the cart. This was dismissed by the staff when I brought it to their attention and I was not even offered an apology. Then, on my last day, I had a bellman up to my room to collect my bags and AGAIN during the trip from my room to the bell staff area downstairs THREE items were lost. I was again told to check my room, person, etc. to make sure I hadn't lost these items. Unlikely, as the missing items were a fedora hat, a foam pillow and a t-shirt that was on the pillow. I did as I was asked, but my items were nowhere to be found. I was then berated by a bellman who insisted that I had lost the items on my own. I asked repeatedly for the bell staff to check the service halls and elevator for my missing items, but I was told they were not there. I spoke with managers, bell staff, housekeeping, everyone they could shunt me off to, but no one was helpful at all. I finally had to leave without my items, but I took the names and phone numbers of those involved. I called the next day and spoke with another manager who SHOCKINGLY said, why yes, those items are sitting here in our lost and found. I had to drive nearly two hours to pick them up because the hotel refused to mail them.

For $100/night, this was a great value. The Good: - Fabulous location. One block from the Union Square Cable Car stop, 2 blocks from Union Square, 5 blocks from the Moscone Convention Center. - Room was clean, spacious. Had a double with two full beds. - No functional problems with lights, heating/cooling, internet. The Not-So-Good: - Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at noon (completely understandable). I was told by the attendant that a room had been set aside for me but needed to be cleaned; I should return at 3pm. When I returned at 3pm, I was checked in by a different attendant, who informed me that the first guy had never tagged the assigned room for cleaning, so the room was still not ready. After a short wait, however, she was able to find another room for us. - They have a limited number of small storage lockers in which guests can lock their computers when leaving luggage on your check-in or check-out day. However, if all of the lockers are already taken, they would not take the responsibility of checking my computer bag, and I was stuck lugging it around hilly SF on my check-in day while waiting for my room to be ready. I made sure to check my computer bag early on my check-out day to avoid a repeat of that situation. - No minibar/fridge. Very small in-room safe. Very limited drawer space, though the closet was sizeable. - it's never a good sign when the hotel purposely provides earplugs in every room. Having read the prior reviews about thin walls, the sight of the earplugs was worrisome. However, I never had any problems with noise during my stay. The Just-Plain-Weird: After an extensive recent makeover, you would think that this reasonably handsome hotel would try to exude a cooler vibe. Yet, on my various trips through the main lobby area, my ears were greeted by songs like the theme from Footloose. While I don't mean to insult Kenny Loggins, it just seemed odd for a hotel in an enviable location in a chic city - nothing wrong with this, just odd. All in all, I'd stay there in a heartbeat if I could get a similar rate.

The cable car stopped just around the corner from the Parc 55, and other public transportation was just steps away. The staff at the Parc were very friendly, and I cannot say enough about Rieki (spelling?), the concierge, who knew the city and it's public transportation system so well. She was great! We felt safe and relaxed during our entire stay at the Parc. Our room was spacious and compfy! I had a medical emergency on our third night. My wife called 911, and while the EMTs were on their way, Gene from the night security staff, came right to our room to assist in any way possible. Both my wife and I were panicking, but Gene, the front desk staff, and the EMTs were all super helpful. (Thankfully, the medical emergency ended up being a minor issue, and all went well.) Our only complaint is that our room check in was to be at 3 PM, but it was another two hours before our room was ready.

Our weekend started out rockey, cancelled flights, placed on stand-by, missed a lunch cruise but, our stay and weekend was perfect. We stayed at Parc 55 this past weekend for the 3rd and 4th of July 09. This was our 4th wedding anniversary. Deciding to stay at Parc55 was decided after a few calls late night calls to the hotel with questions, and each time we were transferred to the front desk staff and based on the helpfulness of this staff I booked two nights. The questions I asked were not just hotel matters but, on items such as getting around and things to see and do. They made recommendations for Breakfast, Lunch even Dinner, none of which disappointed us. Although they will not grant early check-ins, I was told that I could check bags with the Bell desk for keeping if we were going sightseeing until we checked-in. We arrived back later that afternoon (Friday July, 3) at the front desk and to my surprise the hotel had upgraded us to a premier view suite with a balcony on the 30th floor due to it being our wedding anniversary. The room was five stars all the way with everything down to the Turkish bath robes to the King bed with feather pillows with chocolates. The front desk person was one of the most pleasant people I met during our entire stay in San Francisco. The people at the front desk really took the time to provide the care that is not often found with a large hotel especially when they cater to a large volume of business from airlines and conventions; CISCO was having a convention at the time. Although I was extremely satisfied with the staff of the front desk and bell desk and quality of the room... I cannot say the same about the hostess and host in the Cityhouse restaurant / bar, our waitress was wonderful. I typically wear Jeans and Polo shirts with jogging shoes and can afford to dress however I like and have no need to impress anyone, the Hostess especially, made us feel like I she was advising us that I may not have enough money to eat or drink in their restaurant and could I afford it? The Host just ignored us than looked the other way and walked away almost offended? Go figure, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll spend more on lunch than he makes in a week. We chose to have a couple of glasses of good red wine and eat at one of the upscale restaurants in town. I am giving this hotel a 5 star because the view from our room was wonderful, the staff, excluding the hostess / host in the restaurant, were first class and the beds were amazingly comfortable. Also, the location the location could not be better. The F-Line electric buss go to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Warf and the Powell- Hyde cable car line is across the road which gives access straight to Union Square (only a quick walk away anyway) right down to the piers on the waterfront for $5 a ride (if you are in San Francisco more than a day buy a mutli-pass 3day ticket it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $18.00 it is not sold on the cars only at a ticket window). Tourist Information office is just adjacent to it too, as is the giant five floor shopping mall with many upscale stores in it. Going to and from the Airport is a fun ride on the BART for a round trip cost of $16.00 and takes about 60 minutes. The BART Station is a block away from the hotel.

We had a king suite next to apparently noisy people who stayed up until 4am talking loudly and drunkenly probably.

Our room didn't have much of a view (was on the 13th floor) but we didn't expect a view room with the price we got on the hotel's web site (109/night). The beds were very comfortable and the room was very stylish. We had a flat screen tv which had a nice variety of channels, including HBO. The bathroom was large and even had a phone in it.

If you are coming to SF without a car, this is probably one of the best places to stay. It is next to the Powell Street Station so you can catch the MUNI or the BART without a problem. I was on this trip without a car, but parking each day is probably around $45, which seems outrageously expensive, but in all honestly, this is average for a SF hotel, especially in the Union Square area. There are parking lots within walking distance that are cheaper, but since I did not use any, I cannot recommend a specific one. If you're taking the BART in from SFO, it will cost you less than $6 to get to the hotel. Since it is close to this hub of public transportation (including the famous cable cars), and surrounded by the major shopping area of the city, you should be aware that there is a lot of city street noise through the night. If you are a light sleeper, you will need the highest floor possible to get away from the hustle & bustle. If you are used to it, or can sleep through anything, you probably wouldn't even notice the noises. However, the hotel does provide ear plugs if you need them. Some people seem confused by the lobby being on the second floor, which is understandable, but don't forget this is SF and buildings are built into the hills. There are signs all over the place to direct you to the correct place to check in and elevators to get you to the second floor. There's also a great staff to assist you if you come in on the ground level, which is still under renovations. Or if you're feeling spry, you can always walk up the hill to another entrance and take a short flight of steps to the second level directly. Also, if you are on a lower level, do not expect a great view of the bay from your room like they feature on their website. You are, after all, surrounded by other tall buildings, block after block. If you really like the views, I would ask the front desk for the highest level possible upon checking in. The room we had was one of the recently renovated from floor to ceiling so everything looks great. For me, the bed was too firm, but I am used to sleeping on foam so all traditional beds are less than comfortable to me. The room featured flat screen tv's & a safe, but no fridges, unless you're willing to pay for it, and also no free Wi-fi. There is a business center and a 24 hour fitness center, both of which I did not frequent.

I protested a bit letting the clerk know that she really should not charge one's credit card without their knowledge. It is unacceptable to inform me AFTER the fact. With that she said she would reverse that charge, and just have me pre-pay for the room. I still don't know what that was all about. But I did not feel too comfortable with all the charging and reversing she did on my credit card, so when I got settled in my room, I called my credit card company to see what just went on.

I was exhausted and sleepy and so there was no point arguing here, accepted a smoking queen bed on a lower floor, requested the hotel ppl to see if i could get a nonsmoking king deluxe room the next day if possible. Was very dissapointed but was powerless here. Next day called hotels dot com again and they were sorry for the inconvinience and gave me a fifty dollar voucher for future use with them. The hotel gave me a great room on the 20th floor with superb bay views, king non smoking at around 2pm the next day, so was happy for the next two nights. Asides from this experience, the hotel has a superb location right next to the cable car and the powell station / union square with easy access to all public transport, i had a car and did not use the hotel valet parking which is 44dollars a night and used a nearby garage at 20 dollars a night with in and out privileges, the housekeeping was very efficient, bathrooms and rooms were very clean, bed was very comfortable, did not have a microwave or fridge in the room. It is more like a business hotel, but good for tourists too. They charge for everything including bottled water, health club and internet access and even local calls! So beware while using any of those services.

The location is extremely convenient - it is around the corner (less than a block) from the Powell St BART station and the beginning of the cable car route (also Powell St)! Taking the BART to and from SFO was SO EASY and definitely recommended at $5.35/person each way (much less than taking a shuttle or taxi). Union Square is only a few blocks away and Market Street is a half block (not even) to the south. The hotel staff was very polite and accomodating. They were very helpful in booking a rental car for us for the one day we left the city. We had a GREAT room on the 31st floor (2nd from the top) - with an amazing view of the city and the bay! The room was clean, plenty big enough and the (king) bed was very comfy! The only complaint is the lack of drawer space, but we made it work! The bathroom was also a good size and very clean! Also since we were so high up, we heard barely any street noise, with the exception of the occasional sirens. They also provide travel books/magazines in the rooms with GREAT suggestions for places to eat -- we found some of our best restaurants in them! The lobby is still under construction, however aside from having to head to the 2nd floor to check-in (which is very easy to do), you wouldn't know it! I never heard any noise or encountered any issues! The 2nd floor lobby area is very nice and looks as though it is supposed to be there! The restaurant was nice, but we didn't eat there - just stopped in for a drink one night before heading up to our room. Drinks were about average price for the area. There is a great bar/pub a block up from the hotel - Foley's Irish House - we frequented this place the 2nd half of the week - great beer and they ususally had live music! Overall, this was a great, convenient place to stay and we would recommend it to anyone! Insider tips: 1) Buy the Muni Passport (I believe they come in 1, 3, 5 or 7 Day passes) - it pays for itself very quickly (Cable Car ride = $5 each way)!! We used the cable cars, trolleys and buses every day - which is a very convenient way to get around! 2) Although the lines get pretty long at the cable car turn-arounds -- they usually move pretty quickly - or you can head up a block or two and jump on!", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hollywood, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Rate, Great Location, Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "hjmover", "ReviewID": "UR27892272", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel from 4/10/09-4/12/09 over Easter weekend. I landed the hotel on Priceline for a rate of $72 plus taxes and fees. Parc 55 webrates were in the mid 80's so I saved just a few bucks. The hotel was very busy when I arrived and the hotel front desk said the property was full. There was alot of activity but I am always surprised when my Priceline bid is accepeted at a hotel that says they are full. The hotel entrance is located right near the Powell Street BART so its very convenient to take the subway from the airport to the hotel. It costs $5.35 each way for about a 30 minute ride. It is is very easy to use. I got off the part and walked across the the street onto Cyril Magnin. The hotel entrance is right on the corner and one has to take an elevator up from the Cyril Magnin Street entrance to the registration desk on the second floor. I had to wait a few minutes for an elevator since their was a line. Their was a small line as well waiting to check-in but I only had to wait a few minutes. The clerk was very gracious and greeted me kindly. She made no mention on Priceline and honored my verbal request for a room on a high floor. I knew from reading tripadvisor.com that a room on a high floor would be less noisey with a nicer view. I was assigned room 2957. I was a bit disappointed when I got off the elevator to see my room was very close to the elevator and right across from the ice and soda machine. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the door to see a sleek, well appointed room. The room had a large king bed with nice sheets and a quality duvet. There was a flat screen tv, a small couch, a desk, three telephones, coffee maker, and a large window that had a partially blocked view of the bay and civic center area. I could see what I thought was Alcatrez. I was even more satisfied when I laid down on the bed. It was very very very comfortable. Since I am diabetic and did not see a minibar to place my insulin, I called down for a refrigerator. Housekeeping brought one to the room very quickly for no charge. I quickly umpacked my clothes for the weekend and noticed there was not to much drawere space for clothes. There were a few hangers in the closet along with two robes, but storage would be a problem for a longer stay. I checked out the bathroom which had all the stardard amenitites, a free bottle of water, a nice tub and three large, fluffy bath towels. Some of the bath amentities included ear plugs for noise and mouthwash. After checking out the room and the view I hooked up my computer via a wireless connection for $12.95 per 24 hours. The connection was strong. After checking emails, I went to the gym, which is free of charge, to work out.. The fitness center was great, It has lots of aerobic equipment, free weights, and weight machines. The room was relatively empty and I had a great work out. After the work out, I headed via BART to the Mission District for some burritos. The tacqueria's in the Mission make great, really large burrio's. I grabbing a carne asada burrito at El Farolito near the 24th and Mission BART stop for under five bucks. The burrito tasted amazing. Although there was a chill in the air I took the long walk back to the Parc 55. It took about 35-40 minutes. I walked along Mission to Gough to Market whcih is a very colorful neighborhood. Maybe there is shorter way but it was great to exercise after the filling carne asado burrito. I got up at 9 AM the next day and planned for a free City Guide walking tour of the Yerba Buena area. The tour started at 11 AM in front of St. Particks church by the Contempary Jewish Museum. I drank some fo the in-room coffee, took a long bath, and planned for a fun day exploring San Francisco. Yerba Buena Gardens is a short five minute walk from the Parc 55 so after getting dressed I headed outside. It was a bright sunny day and Union Square was packed with people. I made my way over to the St. Patricks church and there were a few people waiting for the free walking tour. The tour started at right on time and the guide was a local resident of the area. She had a real love for Yerba Buena and it showed it her presentation. She explained the history of the area and how it went from an inpoverished but nuturing community with many single occupancy hotels to a thriving area with large hotels, museums, shops, and a dynmic public garden. The tour lasted about one and one half hours and was terrific. I decided to go to another City Guide tour of the Embacadero area. It was such a nice day so I walked down to the Embarcadero. The walking tour started at 2 PM so it gave me time to grab some lunch. The pier has lots of places to eat and is very touristy. There is a fresh farmers market in front of the pier building and I would have been wiser grabbing some fresh fruit from a local merchant. Instead I went to the San Francisco Sea Food Company stall and had some fish chowder and fried oyster loaf. It costs abit over $16 and was less than enjoyable. After finishing up lunch I headed under the clock to meet the tour. There was a lot more people waiting for this tour and the area was pretty crowded with people. The guide was not as vibrant about the area but did his best to describe theis salty,sea port area of SF. This neighborhood has a colorful history and has gone through significant redevelopment. We walked in and around some of the buildings near the Embarcadero but I did not find the guide very engaging. I left the tour after about one hour and headed back to Union Square. I wanted to check out the easter flowers at Macy's which were really spectacular. Then, I headed back to the hotel to prepare for a facial appointment I made a LeBelle Day Spas which is located at 233 Grant Avenue. I had a facial at LaBelle three years prior and it was fantastic. The facialist Stella has great charisma and it was the cleanest my face has ever felt. I thought about that facial for years and could not wait to go back. I was excited for a similar experience. The spa has three levels and is not quite as male friendly as I would like. The male changing room is small but once you are ready, well, LaBelle is very pampering. After changing, I went to the waiting area where my feet were placed in a bowl on hot water. I ate some sweet honeydew melon as I waited for Stella Relaxation started to overtake me. My facial was fantastic. I am not sure how Stella does it, but my skin felt clean, fresh, and hydrated. Although, this was a bit expensive at $150+, well, it was worth every penny. It truly was two hours of bliss that ended with a clean skin and a relaxed mind. I walked back to the Parc 55 as releaxed and comfortable as I have ever felt. Later, I grabbed a quick dinner at King of Thai Noodle Shop. The duck and rice plate which was under ten bucks was fantastic. I headed back to the hotel for another quick work out and then to read before bed. It was a truly great day between the walking tours, facial, and inexpensive, delicious dinner. I slept soundly again. I woke up at 9 AM and drank some in room coffee and watched morning TV. Slowly I got up and began packing for my weekend getaway was soon heading to an end. I did have one more place I wanted to visit, so after packing most of my clothes I headed out to Chinatown to grab some dim sum at a small take out place I read about called Delicious Dim Sum. Its located at 752 Jackson Street. It was a long walk up a steep hill via Powell but I made it to Jackson. You really need to have stong legs to make it up that hill. I found Delicous Dim Sum which truly was a small little hole in the wall. I order shu mai, har gaw, and some sticky rice. It cost $5.40 which I thought was a bargain. The woman put the dim sum in a container and gave me a fork as I walked outside. I walked across the street and sat on the curb by a small alleyway. It was really interesting to sit on the street corner. watching people walk through China town as I ate this really delicious dim sum. The har gow and sticky rice were very good and the shui mai was some of the best I ever tasted. I was smiling brightly as I walked back to the Parc 55. I got back to my room and finshed packing. I looked out at the beautiful view and tried to breathe in the last parts of my nice weekend as I left my room. It took a while to finally get from the 29th floor to the ground floor with all the stops but the sun was shining as I headed across the street to grab the BART to SFO. It was a nice weekend and the Parc 55 really helped in making for a very pleasant, affordable stay.", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cGreat central location for BART and MUNI\u201d", "Author": "egyptdragon", "ReviewID": "UR27862240", "Content": "I was trying to do a bargain trip for Spring Break, but did not want to get stuck in a one star hotel in the Tenderloin. So, I booked on Priceline and got an amazing rate. I'd never even heard of the hotel before and am really glad I took that gamble. Their list price is about $200-250 a night, and I paid less than that total for 2. Their website did have some specials very near to the rate I got on priceline, so poke around to find the links to the coupons and special rates. I liked it enough I might intentionally book through their own site. The desk clerk let me check in early! I was very happy about that since I had read other reviews indicating that they would be unhelpful in that regard. I also did not look like their normal clientele, but did not seem to get treated differently at all. Most of the people checking in and out were wearing suits and fine designer dresses, and I showed up with a backpacking backpack and REI fleece. This was my third trip to SF, but the first time staying in a hotel-- I used to stay at a friend's place. Some of the reviews here complain about the noise level, but, the noise level is about the same if you are staying in a residential area. San Francisco is just noisy at night. I came primarily to see Wicked again and to see the Bhutan exhibit at the Asian Art Museum. Both of those are one stop on the Muni. I also took the bus system to the Legion of Honor and once again, this hotel was a really good central starting place. It also helps that the websites for all these locations have muni directions on them from multiple places in the city. The only complaint I could make is that if I paid the full price for the hotel, the room seemed rather small. But once again, in San Francisco, there are so many people crammed into such a small area, this might be pretty standard. The Westfield Mall is right across the street, so you have plenty of restaurants. I went to the Bristol Farms grocery store at the bottom level and stocked up on fresh fruit and tea.

Only suggestion with that is to remember your room key (that is your access) and to get there fairly early since they don't restock often. 2) The location is fine, and is one of the best hotels to use if taking BART into the City. It is right across the street from the Powell Street stop near the Cable Car turnaround. While it is true that if you walk the other direction from the hotel, it may get shady but it is very obvious that all the good stuff is toward Union Square. 3) The on site restaurant was being renovated, we had lunch there and it was fine, although it did kind of look like a cafeteria. There are plenty of places to eat outside the hotel anyways. 4) The one negative was the terrible elevator service (sometimes a stop on every floor down) and the check in (nearly an hour).

( I should explain that when you book a deluxe king room through Priceline, you can get a room only up to the 18th floor. The rooms above that are more expensive \"view\" rooms.) It was only 12:30 p.m at that point, so we went to lunch at Lori's Diner down the street and enjoyed a lunch at a 50's theme diner, very fun. Lori's is a great spot for breakfast too, $11.25 for a huge breakfast with eggs, potatoes, pancakes,sausage, bacon. When we returned to check in at 3:30 p.m., the room still wasn't ready, so they upgraded us to a view room on the 22nd floor. Wow! Really nice, big room with big bay window overlooking city. The bed was oh so comfortable, the bathroom fantastic. Even a couch,and a flat screen tv with HBO. We loved the room. During the course of our stay, the concierge gave us helpful tips on visiting places, and they even printed out our boarding passes when it came time to leave. Very helpful and courteous, as was the rest of the staff. The maid kept the room sparkling clean, absolutely no complaints at all. Now, for the bad. The main entrance to the hotel seems to be where the garage is. You enter where the bell man is located, then have to go up 2 floors to reach the main lobby. Very weird, and it takes away from the impression you get upon entering the hotel. If you visit the Westin St.Francis, you'll notice what an amazing impression the entrance area can make. Now, there is a side entrance, which seems to me ought to be the main entrance, but people just stay outside those doors to smoke, and the doors don't even have real handles to pull the doors open, just strange knobs. Fine, this may be an unimportant criticism, but the location of the hotel is a legitimate beef. I know that there are tons of hotels right next door to the Parc 55, including the Hilton, the Abri, the Bijou, and many others, but because of the ridiculous number of homeless in the area, and the proximity of these hotels to the Tenderloin area, I would not choose to stay in any of these hotels for a leisure vacation. The homeless problem is terrible in this area. If you just move east a couple of blocks, the area becomes substantially less seedy. Hence, the title of my review. Don't get me wrong, the area is close to everything, restaurants, shopping, cable cars. Very convenient location. In fact, having looked around San Francisco, I am very glad I didn't book a hotel in the Financial District (too sterile and business-like) or Nob Hill (the hotels like the Fairmont or Stanford or Mark Hopkings are amazing, but I could not face the hills each morning) or the Wharf (too touristy). I like Union Square, however, I just would like to be a few blocks east of where I was. Now, would I stay here again? For business, definitely. The rooms and service are fantastic. And, the hotel seems to cater to quite a few airline crews and business meetings. But, for a vacation with the family, I think I would pick something further away from the edge of the Tenderloin.", "Date": "April 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Forest", "Title": "\u201cNice but not cheap!\u201d", "Author": "ff7099", "ReviewID": "UR27218473", "Content": "The location is great as it is right by Union Square.

We were celebrating our girls 16th birthdays. Our late flight put us at the hotel at 12:20 a.m., no problem for the front desk, we were checked in and unpacking our bags within 20 minutes of arrival. We stayed on the 32nd floor, with a sweeping view of the city, I could see the TransAmerica building, the water and a bit of the golden gate bridge. I am a light sleeper, but the room I was in was quiet & I never heard my neighbors. No clanging dumpster noise at 5:00 a.m., something I've experienced at other properties in San Francisco. The room is tastfully remodelled with light duvet covers, and very comfortable beds that felt like new mattresses. The beds are doubles, so for 2 adult women with teen-age daughters it was a bit on the cozy side, but I expected this. I am a substitute teacher on a budget, so I will trade close quarters for a great price. Our room included a hospitality room on the 31st floor, staff was friendly, efficient, and promptly restocked fresh fruit, strawberries and the chocolate croissants that my daughter and I became addicted to. Staff helped me plan my sight-seeing, and I want to personally offer a shout out thank-you to Robert for suggestions on restaurants and the seam-less service he provided during our stay. We did not have a car, but I've never understood why you would want one in a major city. Cars are a liablity in a major city in my opinion, so I would suggest you dump the rental car after the Napa wine tasting. You always pay through the nose for parking, no matter what the city. So maybe if you need cheap parking and that is a priority, you might want to shop around. The Bart system is right around the corner, cable-cars and muni all conveniently located. Muni drivers should be commended for their polite answers about transferring etc. since there are no bus schedules and they have to constantly put up with tourists asking how to get around. Mr. Newsom might want to look into resources here, since tourism is the 2nd biggest industry for San Francisco next to Financial. And it looks like financial is in for a bit of a dry spell. This hotel is in a terrific location, heart of shopping, 10 minute walk to Chinatown. cable-cars on the next street. Which leads me to safety. I was travelling with my 16 year old daughter, we are suburban people and I never felt frightened around this property. Are there homeless people in San Francisco and occasionally in front of our hotel? Yes. And the doorman and attendants do a fine job of keeping an eye on things. I am also not going out for a stroll at 2:00 a.m. along Geary street. We did however, stay out until around 11:00 p.m, walking back from a financial district restaurant. The lobby remodel was completed on our last day, there are large groovy white light fixtures to admire. Front desk held our bags for 4 hours while we did some last minute sight-seeing before our flight. I have stayed at many of the Kimpton properties in this city and typically prefer a smaller boutique type hotel.

This is clearly a hotel made for meetings, conventions and airline staff. Us other folks were pretty much ignored or stared at by the staff - somewhat disconcerting. I went looking for the hotel restaurant one morning, taking the escalator right next to the bell station and the four or five bellmen there just stared at me as I went up, and then again as I came down a few minutes later. Here is a thought: instead of staring why not mention that you can't get to the restaurant that way? Why not move the big sign for the restaurant from next to the escalators and put it next to the elevators, as that is the only way to get there? I also got the stare when I tried to find a way into the hotel from Ellis Street. In fact, despite seeing lots of people struggling with their bags, the only thing I ever saw the bell men do was stare blankly at people... If you are going to stay, try and get a high level floor. I was on one of the lower floors, which provided a lot of traffic noise and no view. I am used to that so I wasn't too upset by the former, but the view provided gave me a direct look into the apartments of the people across the street. Another problem with low floors is that it is impossible to get on an elevator on your checkout date. I waited for almost half an hour, watching full elevator car after car go by, unable to get me and my heavy international suitcases in. I finally ended up taking a car up and then coming down again. All of those things are sort of expected in a hotel, so I could put up with them. The one thing I did wish was fixable was the thickness of walls.

Not only did we not receive one apology for the hotels mishaps but we were treated this terribly from the moment we stepped foot into the lobby to the time we checked out this morning! * 11/14/08 arrived at hotel with itenerary in hand and the woman at the front desk did not have our reservation. *we were booked in a deluxe view room with a king bed, and they had booked all those and took that room away from us and gave us a standard double queen room with a view that seemed smaller! * once she found the reservation (5 minutes) she gave us the two room keys to room # 2520 * we had been driving a while and were thirsty so we went to the hotel bar on the 2nd floor = when we asked for the check the waitress stated that our names were not in the computer and gave us someone else's name on that room number 2520. * we walked up to our floor 25 and our room 2520 and when we tried to open the room it would not allow us to. we were confused and tired and had to go back downstairs to get a new room?? a new key?? * when we came back downstairs there were several people in line which we had to wait for 15 minutes to get a key and new room. * when we were helped the woman (a different one this time) did not really apologize and just said something that the original agent must have made a mistake and gave us our new key to a new room #2570 * when we finally got the right room number and room keys we went up to our room there was absolutely nothing in the room that indicated that it was our anniversary or any special items left for us to enjoy... there was even no refridgerator!! It had been stated in the original booking that it was our anniversary and to make us a more romantic weekend - but not one \"happy anniversary\" or anything! *I came down around 3am to talk with a manager because I figured there would be no wait at the front desk. the night manager said that I should mention my concern to the daytime manager and also mentioned that booking with expedia you are not guaranteed your original booking... which I thought was completely absurd - shouldn't the hotel take good care of every guest - no matter who made the reservation???!?!!?!? *while staying on the 25th floor we got thirsty for a sprite - so I walked down the hall and put 2 dollar bills and one quarter ($2.25) for a sierra mist out of the vending machine and the money was stuck - so I called the front desk as referred by a hotel staff that noticed this, I called and was rudely told that I would have to come downstairs to the front desk and ask for a refund and you don't think that's sort of an inconvenience?? I would have bought a soda at the store if I had known there would have been such a problem! *for an evening of trying to make a terrible weekend turn a key - we decided to stay in and get a bottle of red wine to enjoy while we watched the view. I called to have some \"Kim Crawford\" pinot noir, it was listed in the menu in the room, I called room service and was told that they don't have that wine but they had \"Chalone\" pinot noir and that the bottle price wasn't listed but that it would be $40.00, when the bill came with the wine it was 55 dollars and was never informed what the $15.00 overcharge was for. Overall I would never recommend this hotel to anyone and would give very bad reviews to where ever we can to let people know that we were guests but were made to feel like outcasts at this Parc 55 hotel!", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, UK", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant location, excellent hotel!\u201d", "Author": "jenquack", "ReviewID": "UR21818797", "Content": "We stayed here from 3rd-10th November whilst visiting San Francisco for a holiday and were not disappointed. We booked late- the night before so got a great deal. We arrived with not having had the best start to the holiday as my partner had lost his wallet on the plane, and the staff could not have been more helpful. They were so friendly and polite, and our room was upgraded to a king room with a view straightaway. The room itself wasn't huge, but plenty big enough- with an unbelievably comfy king-size bed. The view was just amazing- from the 24th floor we could see Union Square, the TransAmerica Pyramid, etc. The bathroom was very spacious, and the shower pressure was amazing- nearly knocked me off my feet! The only thing slightly disappointing was that internet access was charged for additionally- but that's a small point. We also had a large flatscreen TV, excellent climate control, and tea/coffee maker. Went to the hotel bar once, and the waiter was extremely friendly, and drinks were not expensive. However, DON'T eat in the hotel. The food was VERY poor quality for what you paid. I ordered the sea bass and I could swear I was given cod instead - didn't look at all like sea bass and my partner's pizza seemed to have been microwaved and he could not finish it. The restaurant itself is a tiny room at the back of the hotel- much like a disused conference room, and freezing cold. I recommend skipping this and going to one of the nearby restaurants- there are hundreds to choose from all at the same or better prices! The location of the hotel was excellent- literally seconds from the Muni Bart station, the cable car stop, the streetcar stop, and bus stops. Several resturants across the street from the hotel all reasonably priced and good food, or go to Union Sq 3 blocks away (10mins walk) for plenty more restaurants to choose from. Italian on the corner of Ellis St is very nice. You cannot go wrong with this location! Transfer from the airport on BART is $5.30 one way, and takes around 30minutes. Very convenient given the proximity of the hotel to the station, and much cheaper than a taxi. The streetcar stops less than a block away from the hotel, and goes all the way down to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and the Ferry Building etc. Shopping nearby is excellent- less than a block away from Bloomingdales at the San Francisco shopping centre, and 3 blocks away from Union Sq with Macy's, Tiffanys etc...", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at convenient, well-priced hotel.\u201d", "Author": "jw263", "ReviewID": "UR21804474", "Content": "Just returned from a two-night stay at Parc 55 Hotel in Union Square, San Francisco, CA and it was wonderful.

The desk staff was very friendly and efficient--it took <5 minutes to get our room. Once upstairs, we were pleasantly surprised. Our room w/ king-size bed was nicely sized and everything from the carpet to the furniture looked clean, modern, and tasteful. We were on the lower floors so there was no real view but ample sunlight in mornings nevertheless. The bed was comfortable and the towels were fluffy, relatively new (old towels are a big pet peeve). An attendant even stopped by 20 minutes after we check-in to make sure everything was okay with our room. Hotel prices were as expected for 4-star hotel. Internet access was $12.95/24 hrs, room-service continental breakfast $16.95. My only (minor) concern with our stay was that the hotel's surrounding area could be pretty noisy at night (something the hotel acknowledges given the provided earplugs). It didn't really bother us but those who may have trouble should consider requesting a higher floor. Being in Union Square just off Market Street, the location was as convenient one could get in San Francisco for tourist and business-types.

Our sitter scored the excellent room: When we checked in and mentioned that she would have our kids for quite a few hours in the evening, they upgraded her to a deluxe room that was huge. She had plenty of room to entertain the kids without going completely bonkers. The beds were very comfortable, the bathrooms were nicely appointed, and in general the decor was pleasing. There was no minibar/fridge in the room, which was disappointing, but not a big deal since we were staying just one night. The room was quiet, which is always a plus. AMENITIES The hotel lobby itself is fairly small, but there's a lobby bar upstairs that looks nice. (We didn't have time to linger there, unfortunately.) Other common areas were clean and well-kept. The workout room was rather large by hotel standards, and in good condition; I managed to get a decent workout in. We ordered room service for the kids and sitter; the food was good and service was prompt. Mind you, we were ordering for kids, so I don't know how good some of the more complicated items are. In general, the hotel had everything we needed for a one-night stay. STAFF Staff was very good - as good as or better than that of other SF hotels we've stayed at. The treated us and the kids very well. Reception/front desk staff was particularly helpful. Bags were deliverd and picked up promptly, and we didn't have to wait long when our car was brought around. Since we'd already made all of our plans before arriving, we didn't use concierge services, so I can't comment on that. MISCELLANEOUS Parking was outrageous, but you expect that in San Francisco. Still -- ouch. SUMMARY We liked it, and would stay there again. We paid a significantly reduced rate through Priceline, and it was an excellent value. We had no problems, the staff was helpful, the upgraded room was a nice surprise, and although nothing stands out as particularly excellent, it's a nice place to stay.", "Date": "September 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cFairly Decent Stay\u201d", "Author": "coachj14", "ReviewID": "UR19707617", "Content": "I took my wife to SF for our third anniversary becuase she always said she wanted to go there. Having been only a few times and not really knowing the lay of the land, we chose to stay at this hotel based on reading other reviews and realizing that this area was ,at the very least, not one of the places to avoid. We purchased a flight and hotel package from Expedia, so I am guessing we paid about $230 a night for the room. As I understand it, that is a decent bargain for SF hotels. On the basis of that price, I would recommend this hotel. However, I wouldn't ecpect it to be anything special. In the past, i have stayed at the W and thought that was a great hotel. This isn't the W. But for the price, it isn't a bad stay. The Hotel is large. The lobby isn't grand, but who really cares. The employees aren't the friendliest, nor are they particularly helpful. However, I found that to be the case for most San Franciscans anyway. Even the people who live here will tell you that the people are \"cold\" and \"rude\". I would agree, but having parents from New York, it didn't faze me. The room is a basic typical hotel room. No fancy furnishings. No extra special amenities. One thing I found lacking was a safe, which would have been nice to have. Another thing it lacked was an interface on the TV for checking your bill or checking out. I found that odd. Finally, it had an internet connection, but you need to have your own laptop to get it it and that was inconvenient. Normally, I am not much for using the internet on vacations, but I found that having it in a place like SF is necessary for making reservations at restaurants and pulling up directions to things before you head out. Needless to say, they charge you $13/hr for it anyway, which is rediculuous. They should provide that for free. The bed was a bit uncomfortable, as it is a cheapie and is very bouncy. Everytime my wife woke up to go to the bathroom, I woke up and vice versa. They also don't provide very nice blankets - typical foamy blanket. I will say that I was SHOCKINGLY SURPRISED that the sheet was a FITTED sheet, and not a flat sheet that comes off the bed at night. That was the first time I have EVER seen that. All hotels need to do that. I would suggest that if you do stay here, you get a floor up high like we did. It was very quiet for a noisy city. The location was fairly good. It is right across the street from the BART, the cable car turnaround [which goes up Powell], and the F line [which goes to Embarcadero and Fisherman's Wharf]. After touring around most of the SF downtown,I can say that this area is probably the better area to stay in. Fisherman's Wharf is definately not the place to be [tourist trap], and other areas don't seem to be in places near stuff. This place is near a lot of things, or is near the transportation that gets you to everywhere. Overall, I would recommmend staying here for this price. If you pay more, then maybe try elsewhere.", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Central Location\u201d", "Author": "Sammyt27", "ReviewID": "UR19624811", "Content": "I picked this hotel because I got a good deal on one of the travel websites. I wanted to explore the city outside of Union Square but I stayed here due to their easy access to public transit- the BART station is about 50 steps from the front door of the hotel. I also chose this hotel because it was one of the few in SF that didn't charge you to use the gym ($10 to $15 a day to use a gym for a few days adds up!). The gym had new equipment, lots of cardio machines, and was clean. Each cardio machine had its own TV- better than the view outside the window, which is a view of the side of an old building. Overall, the stay was above average. I was on the 10th floor- I wish I had asked for a higher level or a courtyard room as SF is a very noisy city- I think sirens in this city go off 24 hours a day and are 10 times louder than normal sirens! Luckily, I brought my own earplugs but the hotel provides you a pair in your room. Don't stay on the 5th floor- that is where the gym was and so there was alot of foot traffic there! I had booked a room with a king bed but they only had a room with two doubles available- luckily I am short because they are small beds! I did not have a fridge in the room, so the only way to have cold bottled water was to buy one for $2.75 from a machine on a different floor! There was one drawer for your clothes, so be prepared to leave all of your clothes in your suitecase. If you like to unpack your things like me, you may have a hard time with that. I thought this was odd, as the TV stand could easily have been both a TV stand and a bureau with drawers as other hotels have.

Check in was fast and efficient and as we walked into the main lobby we were suprised at how grand it looked. The room was lovely and spacious with two large queen beds. We had our towels changes every day and the place and room spotless. The location of the hotel was great as it was only a couple of blocks away from Union Square. The cable car stop is only a few blocks away too and within walking distance. While you are staying in San Fran, you must go to Alcatraz, it was actually the best thing about San Francisco. We managed to see the whole city in two full days, but that was not done at a leisurely pace! Also, the Golden Gate bridge was spectacular and Longbard Street was cool too. Visit Pier 39 to see the sea lions and look round the shops and attractions. The only thing I didn't like about San Fran was the amount of homeless people on the street. Me and my friend wanted to go out for a bite to eat one evening and no sooner had we left the hotel and walked a couple blocks, we were harrassed by homeless people. I am usually confident in large cities like this, I have been to many places, but I have to say that in San Fran I felt very uneasy. We ended up getting a subway sandwich and eating it in the hotel room!! This was a shame as we would have loved to have sampled the food in China Town etc but as two young women, we did not feel safe at all. The hotel was lovely though and if they could pick it up and put it in another location it would be ideal.

Oddly, there is no dresser. There is a flat screen TV but no HD channels were in the lineup and the reception was very poor.

We chose the Parc 55 through Priceline and were excited to get a pretty good deal with naming our own price. We normally stay in 2 or 3 star hotels, and were excited to try a beautiful 4 star hotel! After our flight was delayed, we arrived at the hotel late and checked in, only to walk in to a room that was already occupied, with the occupants in bed! After returning to the front desk, we got a new room but no sincere apology for the mistake and were disappointed once we were settled in. The rooms with two beds are very cramped, the windows were broken and we had to keep the shades drawn the next day because of window washing. The bathrooms have horrible lighting and almost no ventilation. I believe the fee for internet access was around $15, and although they did offer two large bottles of lukewarm Aquafina in the room for $4.50 each, there was no mini-bar or refridgerator. The beds were comfortable, but it was a little gross to find long blond hairs on the bedspread in the morning, considering that everyone in our party is a brunette. Also the fee for parking with tax is $50/night which we thought was pretty steep. All in all, we were disappointed with our stay. The location is OK, but definitely not the reason to stay at this hotel...... as far as the rest of the trip, we stayed at Ramadas and other common hotels where the rooms were clean and spacious, with amenities like free internet, parking and fridges. We ended our stay at the Westin in Seattle for two nights, and I highly recommend it.

Upon checking in, we found out that parking was $45 plus tax per night (more than a third of our nightly rate!) so we parked down the road at a parking garage for $20 flat per night. The lobby is fine, though very bland...reminds me of a typical business hotel. Everyone was very courteous and business like. At the front desk, I requested a corner room due to previous reviews of such rooms being larger, and the woman was very helpful in pulling a high floor for me and reserving it even though it had yet to be cleaned. Later when we were able to get our keys, we walked into the room and it felt more like a suite. Upon walking in there is a small room without furniture and a very large bay window. To the left around the corner is the large bathroom, next is the closet, and then beyond is the bedroom with a bay window at the end of the room and a very large bay window over the desk. There were views in every direction.

As I'd read other reviews that indicated noise was an issue (I had absoluetly no problems during my stay), I found it interesting that the bathroom amenities included a pair of ear plugs! Staff were friendly and helpful. I found the breakfast buffet to be over-priced for what it was - even in SF - but the coffee was delicious and the service outstanding.

Check in only took literally 30 seconds as the receptionist just swiped my credit card and gave me my room key. When booking, I opted for a room on one of the top floors as previous reviews have mentioned about traffic noise. The top few floors are named as an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexecutive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 section, and as such this allows guests on these floors to enter the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexecutive room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the top floor that has a small self service honesty bar, serves a continental breakfast in the morning and has a great view across the city. The room itself was very large, clean, fresh and in an excellent state of repair. I was fortunate enough to have a room on a corner of the hotel so had two large windows that gave me two different, but good views of San Francisco. The room had a large comfortable bed, large bathroom/shower, large wardrobe (and iron), sofa, TV and desk/chair. Daily maid service was excellent as was the turndown service. The room was quiet, and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience any noise either from in the hotel or from outside. Checkout through the TV was simple and I just dropped off the key in the box in the lobby on the way out. I have to admit that aside from my speedy check in, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interact with the staff at all as everything was to my satisfaction and all of the services that I used could be self activated and were easy to understand and follow. I guess the only downside is that, as mentioned in a previous review, the amenities in the business centre are very expensive. I used the internet, which was somewhat pricey, but had no intention of using the printer which had an outrageous price per sheet. San Francisco is well known for its homeless population, and a great number congregate around the BART station area just around the corner from the hotel. Whilst they may be an annoyance, I found them to be harmless enough and not in the least bit aggressive. In fact, one of my evening forms of entertainment was going to a convenience store around the corner from Parc55 to buy some chocolate and join in with the banter from the people hanging around outside. This may not be everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cup of tea for an hours entertainment in SF, but it demonstrates that these people are approachable and not out to kill us all. Parc55 is in an excellent central location. As mentioned, it is very close to the BART station, so great for the airport, and is also close to the trams that take you to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf and the cable cars for exploring the city.

Stayed at the Grand Hyatt last year (also club floor) and paid more than twice this price and I really feel the Parc 55 is superior. One reason being that I had a rental car for both stays and where the Grand Hyatt you have to pull up in the street in a lot of heavy traffic to hand the car over to valet parking, the Parc 55 has a circular drive off of the street and it was a cinch. Yes, parking was $40 a night plus tax plus I tipped them each time I got the car out, but it was still cheaper than staying at one of the other hotels, given the $111 Club Level room rate here The Club Level breakfast was teriffic! Bagels, cereals, croissants, etc. Even sliced meats for breakfast if you wanted them. Couldn't have been any nicer.

We found it to be a nice hotel. Its courteous staff and superb location prompt me to give it a 4 star rating. As just noted, one of the hoteIs best assets is its location, which is conveniently situated to easy access to Union Square, BART, and the nearby conference center. That being said, however, the rooms are not well sound-proofed, and as the hotel is in the 'heart' of things, it can be a very noisy place to stay. During the night, we heard not only street noise (sirens, people shouting, garbage trucks) from our 16th floor room, but we also heard other guests coming and going (one particularly loud party woke us from a sound sleep at 2:15am). If you are sensitive to noise, you may want to consider asking for a room on a higher floor or taking earplugs with you for your stay at this hotel. Our room was comfortable, especially the bed. However, the decor was somewhat dated and didn't feel at all 'fresh.' The even more dated, large hotel bathroom somehow felt a little grimy -- perhaps because of its dated fixtures and circa 1980s tiles, but it also might have felt that way as a result of the the fact that some of the floor tiles were dirty. I like things really clean when I stay in a hotel (my husband would say I'm too picky), so the dirty floor tiles bugged me. We were unable to locate the safe in the room, but otherwise found everything we needed, includind hair dryer, iron, and coffee-maker. The staff we encountered were very courteous and professional, and this included everybody from housekeeping to the concierge (Rob was especially helpful) to the bell hops. After calling the front desk and asking for a nail file, as I'd forgottent to pack mine, one was delivered to my room within 5 minutes by a nice man. This expeditious, friendly service was a nice bonus. I would stay at this hotel again for its location and friendly staff, but wouldn't recommend it to someone who is really sensitive to dated room decor, somewhat dirty bathroom floor tiles, or noise.

We had breakfast at the Club room each morning and it was wonderful with great service, they also had drinks etc. in the evening with a fabulous view from the 31st floor. The concierge desk is very helpful with all your needs and directions for what to see being taken care of. The only down side was $40. a day to park. We flew in so that was not a problem and after our stay we headed back to the airport rented a car and finished our trip to Napa,Reno and Tahoe. We figured we would not need a car in the city. Also if you will be there a few days or more get a pass for all the transportation for a flat rate. It was $18 for 3days, where as just a cable car ride one way was $5. so a very good deal.

Upon arrival to our 19th floor room we were astounded with the sweeping view. From Union Square to the financial district to the bay beyond, it was stunning. Our reservation also included a king size bed, not the queen sized that came with this room. We decided not to request a room change for fear of losing the view. The room was spotless and the housekeeping staff was quick and efficient. The furniture was a bit out dated but showed no signs of scratches, dents or other guest trauma. I would recommend staying on the highest floor you can manage to mitigate the traffic noise from the street. On the 19th we could still hear passing sirens and the clang of the cable cars. The location of this property is fantastic. Two blocks to Union Square and a block from Market. World class resteraunts and shopping are just steps away....however.

The TV was large and the picture was clear so my hubby was happy. We kept the do not disturb sign on the door so I can't comment on the maid service. We ordered room service one night and were satisfied. We also had an overpriced buffet breakfast with okay food on last morning. There is a shuttle service that comes every 15 minutes to take you to the airport and I think it was $16.00 per person The location was great. If you plan to explore the neighborhood on foot, DO NOT make a right when you walk out of the main lobby. I think that is the Tenderloin section, a ghetto part of town. A block over to the left of the main lobby is where you catch the cable cars. Some tips and things we enjoyed: The best was watching the sea lions at Pier 39. If you plan to cover a lot of the city in one day you can pay $11.00 for unlimited rides on the cable cars, buses, and trolleys. A one way trip on the cable car is $5.00 so we cabbed it a lot. It was cheaper to take a cab from Parc 55 to Fisherman's Wharf. We had a great meal at Sauce ( It's on Gought St. I think it's in the Pacific Heights section) Alcatraz was cool-we happened to go on their annual anniversary event so there were scheduled speakers (former inmates, guards and family members that lived on the island) Before we went I searched a calander of events for things going on and found a lot of time specific things to do. i.e. The Nihonmachi Street Fair in Japantown. I think [--] has a list too. It was worth it to take a cab over to the GG bridge.

The entrance to the hotel is not striking; as a matter of fact we spent time trying to figure out where the front door was! The lobby is elegant, although in kind of a wierd layout. In the room things were clean and the furnishings were nice and looked new. The bathroom was serviceable but somewhat small and the amenities were basic (soap, shampoo, creme rinse, no shower cap.) On a low shelf in the bathroom was a one-cup coffee maker that you apparently put on the bathroom counter and plug it in there if you want in-room coffee. The two full-sized beds that we requested and got were comfortable with lots of pillows. The TV remote did not work. As far as I could tell, none of the rooms at the Parc 55 have a breathtaking view - it's mostly rooftops and other buildings. The biggest thing that I didn't like was the inconsistency of staff coverage. When my parents drove up into the valet driveway, there was no one there to come and take their bags. So we had to commandeer a cart, pack it with the luggage and bring it inside (which we later found out was \"against hotel rules\", putting us in a no-win situation.) Another day, we needed a taxi. But there was no one at the valet station to call one for us. We ended up walking down the street until we found one. These are not horrible things, but they are basics that I expect from a 4-star hotel. On the upside, the hotel is in a safe location to walk to Market Street, including the cable cars, the \"Union Square\" Amtrak bus stop and the Powell St. BART station. From this hotel, you can ride transit and get just about anywhere in the city. Just be careful not to walk west of the hotel via Ellis St.: it will take you straight into the Tenderloin neighborhood which is not safe. Would I stay here again? If the price was right and I didn't want to bring a car into the city, I'd say yes.

I found the front desk staff quite helpful, although some of the rest of the service staff were found wanting. I flew in straight from Hong Kong to San Francisco. My flight arrived early and so I arrived at the hotel at 10am. I was told that check in was not until 3pm so I had to leave my bags and walk around. That was fine - the excellent location of the hotel meant I could walk to AT&T park and see a Giants game (Bonds went 0-for-5, sadly). When I returned at around 5pm, I got a room, and asked for my bags. The bellhop got me to go into the storage area with him, and then grabbed my bag, walked past me unnecessarily into the lobby, plonked my bag on the ground and looked at me expectantly. If I had wanted that service, or if he'd brought my bag up to my room, I might have tipped him, but that was a bit much. When I got to my room, I discovered that there was no remote control. I knew I'd be up in the wee hours, so I wanted to get my remote before I fell asleep, exhausted. I went down to the front desk to ask for it, and they said they'd send it up right away. After an hour, I called and asked what had happened. They said that they would bring it right away (again). I waited another 45 minutes, wondering whether the surly bellhop had blackballed me, and fighting sleep back at the same time. Finally the housekeeping staff came with my remote and I was able to drift off to dreamland. The bed was comfortable. I was able to survey the room better when I awoke at 4am. The room I had got was large. However, the bathroom was a little bit of a let-down, with 80s style bathroom tiles.

My overall rating mostly reflects a very comfortable room in a great location (right at the Powell Street BART station on Market Street, near Union Square.) Room 2763 is a very good size, with two double beds looking towards Union Square (visible a LITTLE bit between the buildings) and the Coit Tower in the distance. Nice-size bathroom with many toiletries -- but no hair dryer that I could find. Spotless housekeeping. The desk (chipped on the edges) could be a good work surface, and there is an internet connection (with an ethernet cord in the room) for $12 a day. We paid extra for this room with entitles the guest to the club lounge, breakfast, and evening snacks. While not bad, I'm not sure I'd upgrade again. The lounge itself is nice enough with an excellent view (same as our room, but on the 31st floor), tables and lounge chairs, nice continental-plus buffet breakfast of pastries, cereals, fruit, juices, etc. The evening has cocktails ($6 for wine) and hors d'oeuvres, which were not that impressive -- small assortment of hot hors d'oeuvres and really mundane cheese selection. There were a few complimentary newspapers around to be used in the lounge (I think, since there were so few.) Like any Club lounge I've seen, it can get a little crowded at some times in the morning. I could deal with these minor imperfections if not for the issues with the Club lounge management. When we first stopped in, the manager and assistant seemed more concerned with talking to each other than greeting guests. We would also find that guests often had a problem with their pass key-cards to enter, which often meant guests would knock (pound) on the locked door. Rather than assume that these were guests with key problems, the attitude seemed to be that these were Club-crashers. This could easily be verified since Club guests have a different color card. But no -- the Manager scolded anyone who might open the door, but he was VERY slow in trying to come to the door -- leaving the guest outside pounding the door, and those inside having to listen to it. Couldn't an assistant manage something? Further, I believe that the staff should be able to have their meal break, but this sometimes meant that NO ONE was minding the door -- again resulting in a guest, sooner or later, pounding the door. Also: the evening hors d'oeuvres were scheduled to go until 7:30. When we stopped in at 7:10 to grab something quickly, the food had all been cleaned up, and an evening dessert was not out yet. The slips continued. I met my sister at this hotel, where she would check in the following day. I reminded the staff about this at my check-in. Supposedly they entered her name. The following evening, I stopped by the desk to remind the desk staff to expect her later that evening. When they checked, there was no record of her name. They dutifully re-entered the information. When she checked in later, there was STILL no record of her name, which resulted in a late-night call to the room to give permission to send her up. To top it off: they gave her a room key-card that did NOT correspond to a Club level -- which resulted in problems at breakfast the next morning in the Club lounge until we got it corrected. (Also \"funny:\" the desk clerk mentioned, \"You don't have the same last name as your sister,\" I think questioning her story. We are in our 50's, and I'm married. Are different names of married sisters so surprising???!!!???) The hotel has a nice, sunny second-floor public lounge, bar, and restaurant. We didn't eat here or have drinks, but it could have been a nice possibility. There are free newspapers for guests in this area -- stocked much better than on the Club lounge!!! The take-away: we'd be happy to stay here again since the room was like a good Marriott-quality place at a better price, and the location is excellent if you want to use the BART from the airport and be convenient to Union Square. I'd still check other options for price/value, but I could return here and be pretty happy if I could overlook the service slips. I understand the need for security at any hotel, but this place gets a bit undiplomatic ans slipshod in trying to manage it. Further, the Club lounge was not very impressive, and there are other good-to-much better alternatives for breakfast, drinks, etc. nearby.

Anyone who can't stand noise should take a country vacation. Housekeeping does like to knock a lot, to check whether the room is ok. It seemed like overkill to us. Breakfast in club lounge was adequate. Fresh fruits, meats and cheeses, hot and cold cereal, bagels, breads and danish. Starbucks coffee was a real kickstart in the morning. The afternoon snack was ok, no where near what other hotels put out in their concierge lounge, but the Parc 55 also cost a fraction of what those other hotels charge.

A coffee/tea maker was also in the bathroom and supplied daily with coffee/tea bags. The club lounge had nice views of the city and was a relaxing place to have a drink. Breakfast was continental but rather limited and the lounge was closed from Friday evening until Sunday evening. We got the room for a good rate so werent too worried however would not pay a significant amount to stay in the club room as the lounge facilities are not great. No internet access in the club lounge or the business centre although you can pay for internet at an area near the bar on the 2nd floor. There is a good little coffee shop located next to the hotel great for grabbing a quick coffee/hot chocolate and a donut etc and very cheap. The location of the hotel is fantastic for accessing transport including the cable cars and the Bart system and lots of shopping nearby and a quick walk to Union Square. There are a lot of homeless around the area and in San Francisco in general however we never felt threatened. We would return to this hotel but mainly for location the hotel itself is average but the location increases its appeal.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201creservations needs work\u201d", "Author": "midliferDallas_Texas", "ReviewID": "UR8063020", "Content": "Made our reservation online and took the precaution of printing out the entire reservation confirmation and taking it with me as a result of reading other travelers' experiences.

The fitness center was good - many machines to use - it was crowded in the morning but due to the size of the hotel I was not surprized. They provided towels and fruit for you to eat after your work out. Check-in and out was a breeze but again there are a lot of people at this hotel so be wary of the time of day you do these things - the potential for a line is good. We ate at the Pub in the hotel.

When we checked in we were on two different floors. This was handled quickly and changed so we could be near eachother. This is not a big deal at all however, the employee that checked me in was quite rude and either inexperienced or just didn't care. The employee that checked our friends in was quick and friendly and resolved the issue. Our check in was pretty quick, about 15 minutes, however this hotel caters to the airlines it seems and there was always a large amount of flight crews there. Numerous days we saw check-in lines at least 20 deep and only 2-4 employees working. We heard numerous people complaining about waiting over an hour to check in. So only problem seems to be the check in. We had a room on the 27th floor with amazing views of the city. There was noise in the room but what do you expect when you are in the middle of a large city. We heard police sirens all night long but once again what do you expect! The room was amazingly clean and we always had turndown service with a chocolate and the next days weather left on our bed. This was wonderful. The shower had awesome water pressure and it seems that they are still using the Marriott soaps and shampoos. Our room included free breakfast and afternoon snacks. The breakfast was simple but great. Always had free juice, water, and soda. There was always fresh bread and some pastries. There was meat to make a sandwich and lots of cereal with fresh fruits. The afternoon snacks were not bad. We only went up there twice, once was chicken wings which were ok and the next time there were little pizzas. I thought that alcohol was included in the afternoon snack but it isn't, they have an honor bar. The workout facility at the hotel is not bad. An area of barbells and a couple multi exercise machines. Several treadmills. Nice towels to stay clean and that have a steamroom. THe only thing that is missing is no pool or hot tub. The hotel location is awesome. I would say the best around. You walk out the front door and take about 100 steps to the cable car, or BART. The booth to buy the MUNI tickets is right there at the cable car so just wait and buy it there. You are within a block of all the major shopping stores and walgreens and what not. Parking is expensive, $40.00 per day plus and extra $5.60 per day tax but it is very nice to have your car safe and right there at the hotel. THe valet employees were excellent, friendly, and brought the car very quickly.

This is not a boutique hotel-- it's a high-rise with a large lobby and hundreds of rooms. 3. It is right by Union Square-- homeless people are a staple for that area and not a fault of the hotel. Now, to the experience-- hotel is very centrally located (right by Powell BART station-- take it right from the airport for a fraction of the taxi cost!). Restaurants, shops, museums, the cable cars, (and yes, even the homeless people)-- it's all there. The lobby is spacious and can look deserted at times. We had no problems with staff. Rooms are much larger than usual for Union Square-- we had a sitting area with a couch in ours and a king size bed. Spacious bathroom, fantastic linens and even complimentary ear plugs ( we were on the 10th floor and could not hear the street noise but appreciated the gesture anyway.) We did not use room service but stopped by at a hotel bar on the second floor-- a typical boring sports bar on a smaller side with an ambiance of a moth ball. In summary.

Let me say first that I pride myself on finding travel bargains. I'd much rather spend my money on good food and wine than on a hotel room. San Francisco has always been an expensive city for travelers, and finding an above-average room at a bargain price can be a challenge. I began researching SF hotels back in December and found the Parc 55 on Trip Advisor and Expedia. I always book directly with the hotel, as the rates are often equal to or lower than the travel websites and you can always cancel the reservation if you find a better rate elsewhere. I booked a king deluxe room on a high-floor and requested an early check-in (1:00pm). When I originally booked in January, the rate was $149. In mid-February, I re-checked the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website and found the same room for $95, so I rebooked and cancelled the first reservation and saved enough money to buy my wife and I a very nice dinner. I called the hotel 3 days before our arrival to confirm, and informed them that our flight had been changed and that we now expected to arrive around 10:00pm. They assured me that our room would be held. When we arrived at the hotel at about 10:10, the desk clerk informed me that they had no record of our arrival time change and that my king room was no longer available, but that they could put us in a queen deluxe on the 20th floor. She did not apologize, or offer some kind of complimentary perk. After a long day of travel from the east coast I was too tired to negotiate with the manager, so I accepted the offer. The room (Room 2001) was clean, comfortable and very spacious for a big-city hotel, with lots of windows and great views. The closet was large, with plenty of hangers, but no safe for storing valuables. The bed was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c firm mattress, lots of pillows and nice linens. The bathroom was large and clean, and included a one-cup coffee maker. There was no mini-bar fridge (which I would never use anyway). Internet access was available (for a fee), but I carry a Blackberry for emails and leave my laptop home when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m traveling for fun. I noted that some travelers complained about the city noise, even on high floors. Folks, this is a large city, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear police and fire engine sirens, as well as some street commotion. If you want silence, go camping. Otherwise, use the free earplugs provided by the hotel. The Parc 55 is primarily a business/conference hotel, but there was very little business activity because we stayed Thursday to Sunday. While some people have complained about the lobby furnishings and somewhat \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd look of the public areas, I thought the hotel was more than adequate for leisure travelers. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153charm,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd try the Serrano Hotel or The Orchard, a few blocks away.

So I cancelled my reservation on Mariott's web site, and recieved a cancellation email and number. Then I got my February credit card bill and found a charge for one night at the hotel. I dug up the cancellation email and called. My first call was after business hours, and I was told to call back during business hours. The next day I called during business hours and explained the situation to someone in the accounting department. That person told me that the problem was my cancelling on Marriott's site rather than calling them. I never understood why that was a problem, since I cancelled well before they dropped off the Mariott's system, but in any case I expected that they would credit me immediately. Instead I was told that it would take several days to research it and I should call back if I did not receive the credit. It would seem to me that if the Parc knew they were having a problem with cancellations on Mariott's system, that THEY would take the initiative to research no-shows. Instead, I find that it is taking a considerable amount of my time to avoid being charged, when the hotel seems to be at fault for losing the cancellation - and that is in spite of the fact that they are apparently well aware of the problem.", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, FL", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "sfbness", "ReviewID": "UR6940899", "Content": "Parc 55 had everything we needed, easy access, spacious room and bathroom.

For something special, my husband and I treated my mom to a 60th birthday trip in San Francisco. I wanted a special hotel, but could not afford the W. The price was right for this place, the location was EXCELLENT - around the corner from the cable car, across the street from the BART station and the big, new Westfield shopping center, and a few blocks from Union square. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable - soft pillows, feather comfortors. I even had room service bring tea - a charming Chinese gentleman delivered it with new years wishes and lots of giggles. BUT - and this is the big BUT - we were not given our room until 2AM!!!!!!! We checked in at 9 PM. Fortunately, my mom and I checked in the day before, so we were able to put our 2 young sons to bed in her room. My husband and I waited 5 hours in the lobby, mostly standing in line with about 25 other very hostile guests, waiting for our room. There was a couple who had spent 25 hours traveling from Caracas, VZ, a man with Parkinson's disease who desperately needed rest, and a long list of other stories. In addition to all of this, the hotel staff repeatedly double assigned rooms. They would send a relieved guest up to a room, only to have them return to say someone was already in it!!! Can you imagine how mortifyingly embarrassing that must have been for both parties???? This happened at least 4 times by my count. When we were given our room assignment, we made the staff call the room before we went up. The other part that was so awful was that we were told 3 times that our room would be ready in 30 minutes, and to come back. It took at least 1 hour to get through the line. My question is, why didn't the staff let people know what was going on? They knew the rooms wouldn't be ready, with only the small night cleaning staff and a number of very late check-outs (Singapore Air has a regular contract, I guess). Really unconscionable!

We decided to give it a shot and were absolutely impressed and satisfied. LOCATION and TRANSPORTATION: Renaissance Parc is located in Union Square and I discovered that it was close to many forms of transportation including both the BART and the MUNI. And while cabs are scarce in San Francisco, I was pleased to see that there were usually at least 2 cabs waiting outside by the street. If there aren't any cabs there, I know that there were always a line of cabs outside of the Westin Hotel a few blocks away. Literally right outside Parc hotel is a shopaholic's dream. It's blocks away from Saks, Macy's, and other department stores as well as unique boutiques and stores along the way. There's also a new Westfield Mall right by there on Market Street which has a Nordstrom and Bloomindales. I also took a walk to Chinatown from there, and while it's not that far, make sure to wear comfy shoes. Somewhat southwest of the hotel further down Market Street, the area gets a little bit shadier and seems to crawl with even more homeless people (San Francisco as a whole has a huge homeless population), but it's nothing to be wary of. As for places to eat by there - we ate at a dim sum place called Tian Sing right outside which was great! The place was clean (cleaner than the ones I saw in Chinatown) and the service was very attentive. We also ate at this trendy spot across the street from Tian Sing called First Crush. The place was okay, but not exactly worth the pricey tag. I'd just go there again for drinks or a cocktail. SERVICE and CLEANLINESS: We checked in around 11am and found out from the hotel desk that official check-in time was not until later at 3pm; however, before even asking, the woman checked to see if there were any available rooms and checked us in to a 14th floor room. The man who brought up the luggage to our room was very helpful and pointed out what was what right from our window (whichwas a breathtaking view!). The room was clean. The bed was very comfy and cushy and had a plethora of pillows! The bathroom was big and absolutely not cramped like some hotel bathrooms I've seen. The only problem I seemed to have was with their shower curtain- no matter how much I tried to close the curtain, it seemed as if water would always be seeping onto the floor. BOTTOM LINE: The place was exactly what we wanted. A clean hotel with genuine and friendly service right in the heart of the city. As for price, it was mid-range, but well worth it.

I called again and they said the modem was bad and would be replaced. It was 8 PM Sunday. I went off to my meetings Monday morning (still no modem) and finally when my husband went to the front desk and requested a new modem they sent one up. The second problem was the phone lines. There was some kind of feedback on the line that made it hard to hear. I had to resort to my cell phone for the tech support calls. I tried participating in a teleconference on Tuesday morning on the hotel phone (800 call-in #) and the sound quality was so bad I had to disconnect and use my cell phone again.

Unsure of how difficult it would be to find the hotel we were pleasantly surprised how easy it was to find and get into. Check-in was quick and efficient. The polite lady gave us the details of the hotel and directions to places that we inquired about. Our room was on the 26th floor and had a wonderful view of the city. The room was very large and clean. The bathroom was big and very clean. There were more towels than we would use in a week at home. The hotel if very close to the cable-car (about a half block to a block). There was a long line for the cable-car but well worth the wait to get to Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel is also in an excellent shopping district (found a wonderful shoe store about 2-3 blocks away, that my hubby wishes didn't exist.) We went into Barley 'N' Hops Sports Bar located in the hotel for a quick bite to eat and had so much fun joking with the waiter / bartender that we stayed for 2 hours. The food was very good and not expensive (1 burger w/ fries, 1 chicken sandwich w/ fries, 1 soft drink and 1 beer) at about $20.00. The only problem we had was when we checked out we paid for the Valet parking at check-out. When we went to get the car, the people at the valet parking office tried to charge us again even though we showed them we had paid at check-out. They were rude and told us this was not the correct way to do this. They even asked us to go back inside and get the money, we refused. Because of this they were very slow in getting our car and when they did, the driver got out of the car and stood with his hand held out. We loaded our own luggage and the guy continued to stand with his hand held out. My husband shook his hand and said, \"thank you.\" After the way we were treated we did not feel they deserved a tip. However, I must say that when we arrived the valet staff was very nice and helpful. They quickly came to the car and opened our doors and helped us get all of our belongings out of the car and carried them inside to check-in for us.

The bed was very comfortable, with a nice comforter and plenty of pillows. The bathroom was OK, but didn't have much counter space.

Fast Forward to check in: there was no one in line at the front desk however none of the agents even looked up. Two of them were having their own conversation. When she finally did look up she just asked us our name and for our credit card, handed us our keys and told us where the elevator was. She never once smiled or even said hello. I felt this was a bit off-putting as she was so not friendly. We get up to our floor and surpise surprise our room is 2 doors away from the elevator and no foam pillows. I didnt complain because in reality it wasnt going to hamper my stay but the fact that I asked for these things and was given the complete opposite unnerved me a bit.

I have traveled to San Francisco more than 100 times over the last five years and sampled just about every major upscale hotel in the area. I would stay anywhere but this place. The disappointment begins with the area that the hotel is located in, which, although centrally located, is the seediest part of the city and abounds in threatening looking characters. I felt at risk just stepping out of the hotel! The overall ambience within the hotel is gaudy early-eighties and an absolute assault to the eyes and senses. Rooms are small, even by San Francisco standards, and missing the nice balconies that hotels like Hilton and Meridien have. The overall feeling is of clutter and claustrophobia, exacerbated by windows that don't open adequately and leaflets touting all manner of hotel services. The beds are comfortable but nothing unique to the upgraded beds available at almost all major chains today. By the way, almost every pictures on the hotel website is highly unrepresentative of reality. Hotel infrastructure is in need of serious upgrading. Heating and air-conditioning system is ineffective and noisy. Water pressure is weak and hot and cold water mixing is problematic leading to uncomfortable showers and shaving. To cap it all, the hotel charges a usurious rate for internet service and only offer service from noon-to-noon regardless of when you check-in and check-out. Bathrooms have a dated feel and look. And there are marks on the wall of amenities that were once attached to walls and are now gone. Hotel staff service levels are nothing special and a little below average. The concierge lounge is absolutely below standards of typical hotel properties and closed on weekends unlike most other major upscale hotels in downtown SF. Overall, the quality and feel of this hotel is a better fit for Fairfield Inn than Marriott's top-of-the-line Renaissance brand.

There is also an abundance of stores with wine, food, etc. all around the area if one wanted to get supplies or perhaps their own wine/beer. One disappointment however was the absence of an in room refrigerator and mini bar which made having any cold snacks or beverages on hand impossible.

Since we were so late in making our travel plans most hotels were sold out or were asking top $$ for their rooms. We tend to stay at either Marriotts, Hiltons or Hyatts so I was a little surprised when the Marriott Renaissance Parc 55 showed availability at a decent price. What was even a bigger surprise was that I was able to use my Marriott points which left us more money for shopping! We arrived at the hotel around noon and fully expected to leave our bags with the bellman and check in later in the day. To our surprise a room was ready and we immediately checked in. The front desk could not of been more helpful. Our room was non-smoking as requested with two very comfortable beds. We were given a room with a \"bay view\". We were on the 17th floor and the view was of the bay but not much of it. Too many other high rise buildings in the way blocking the view. The higher you go, the better view but this was not an issue to us. The room was comfortable and the bathroom was just fine. They could use more counter space for storage. The biggest drawback was the ability to hear people in the rooms on either side of us. I wonder if the guests in those rooms knew that we could hear their early morning conversations about getting ready for their flights or their late night giggles, etc. I was surprised that we did not have evening turn down service, this would have been a nice touch. The location of the hotel was perfect. Just around the corner from Union & Powell streets you were at the beginning of the cable car system or just steps from the BART station. You are also within walking distance of all the shopping around Union Square. The front desk and bell desk was very helpful with maps, where to go and where not to go (the tenderloin district) and dining options. We never did dine in the hotel so I cannot comment on that. Too many places around the hotel to eat so why bother with hotel dining. It was suggested that we buy a 1 day pass for the cable car which we did. It use is good for the cable cars and the bus system. It was also suggested that on our return trip to the airport we use the BART system. Since we had to pay a $42 (incl. tip) cab fare to the hotel from the airport on our return we used the BART system. $5.15 one-way. It was great! Only drawback to this is the ticket machines don't really have instructions on them and most people are either too busy to help you or are in the same boat as you. We did find a nice lady that was getting her own ticket to help us out only to have a very rude lady come up from behind and start yelling at us because we were holding up the line!

Afterwards, we had dinner at the Italian restaurant across the street from the hotel(Panetti's)and it was very good. I recommend the eggplant parmesan. The second day we attended the 2pm performance of the San Francisco Ballet's Nutcracker at the War Memorial Opera House. This is an experience you don't want to miss. Beautiful scenery and dancing, it was truly breathtaking. I think we should have stopped with those two events, because the last one (Holiday Lights Tour) on the motorized cable car was a bummer. First, the only holiday lights you see are at Union Square (which is where we boarded). It's the standard (canned) tour of the city, nothing more, which we may have enjoyed more during the day, but at night, you miss a lot. Not recommended.

The Club Lounge on 31st floor is unusually open 7 days a week and provides a good continental breakfast buffet, all day coffee and a small evening finger buffet and a limited selection of deserts. Good views from the lounge due it being several floors higher than neighbouring buildings. The only problem with the club lounge is the lack of tables for breakfast, as it is laid out as a lounge with sofas and low level glass topped coffee tables. It gets busy in the mornings as it caters for 3 executive floors as well as overspill from lower level rooms when the exec floors are overbooked. Check-in was a bit slow due to lack of staff at the front desk, (only one check-in attendant) but checking out was fast using the express checkout facility. 6 express lifts, ground to 31st floor in about 30 seconds and very little waiting in lobbies after calling for a lift.

The bed was wonderful and the sheets and pillows were quite good as well. The bathroom was huge and well laid out. I had limited interaction with the staff but starting with the accomodating receptionist, everyone was very polite, professional and knowledgeable. I asked the concierge to find me an address of a nearby shop and he wrote it down on a map, making it very easy to find.

We arrived at the Parc 55, tired after driving 14 hours in from Seattle. Being so tired, it really helped that the service was superb! The valet and front desk employees were extremely courteous and friendly. We booked a standard room with the government discount and was pleasantly surprised to have been upgraded to a huge, beautiful corner room with windows all around. We had an amazing view fronting Union Square! The room was well appointed and clean. Perhaps the only flaw in this room was that we booked a room with a King sized bed and instead got a room with a full size bed. This of course was overlooked once we saw the size of the room and the view! The bathroom was clean and had a few nice touches like a heater which came in handy since it was cold at night, a phone and a movable vanity mirror. Directly outside of the bathroom in front of the closet was a seperate changing area, which I thought was a nice touch. For those of you who love to stay fit, this hotel offers a 24-hour fitness center free of charge. Also, there are restaurants on the property which offer a variety of genres. My favorite meal there was breakfast in the hotel restaurant, prices were reasonable for San Francisco and tasty and of course service was superb. Location wise, you couldn't find a better place. It is so centralized! It is right across the street from shopping and in walking distance from Union Square. If you go out late at night, past midnight or so, don't go to the left of the hotel towards Larkin st. Not exactly the safest feeling in the world with the number of homeless people and prostitutes but what else can you expect from any big city. Valet parking was $38.00 plus tax...pretty high, but the going rate for San Francisco. If you don't mind public transportation, don't get a car. You can see most things on foot patrol or via cable cars. It was pretty rough having to pay almost the same amount for parking after our three nights there as it was for one night's stay.

The daily maid service keeps the room very clean. The checkout time is 12 noon, so I suppose I can't complain that our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 2pm, and had to wait an hour and a half. It's well located next to all the big stores, cinemas, restaurants, public transport and car rental locations. The cable car terminus to Fisherman's Wharf is nearby, but always crowded. You could wait up to an hour at busy times. Here's a tip - they don't always fill the car up at the terminus, so go to the next stop up the line and you'll probably get on the first car to come along. After you've done the calble car thing once, you'll probably find the Market Street tram or the #30 trolley bus the best way to get to Fishermans Wharf and the Ferries to Alcatraz. You definitely need to book the Alcatraz trip in advance (via internet), but another great day out is to hire a bike from Blazing Saddles and bike the bridge to Sausalito.

(2) In our new room, we turned on the tv, and within 2 minutes, the tv shut off and started smoking. We had to then wait for a new tv to be put in. The hotel's asst. manager called to do the standard (but nice) apology. She asked if she could send something to us like a bottle of wine. She did (it was nothing too special and nothing accompanied it, like some fruit or cheese or something). We were paying only $142/night for our room, so you would have thought they would have comped a night, given a free breakfast or even moved us to a nicer room for the not 1, but 2, inconveniences. Oh well - the only reason it wasn't too big of a deal is b/c we didn't plan to be in the room much and we DID get such a great rate.

Even when nearly full, the atmosphere is quiet and adult. Oh, yes, the beds are nice and comfortable with both small and large pillows to choose from. The rate was extremely reasonable for the quality. I could only find two things to quibble about. First, my room was humid and warm on a cold day - due to all of the sound deadening insulation and the solid windows - but that was fixed by using the air conditioner. Second, there is no coffee maker in the room, but on check-in I was told about the free morning brew on the second floor. There were muffins and fruit rolls for sale for only $2.00, much less than you would pay at a nearby Starbucks. Finally, with big hotels like this, using the valet parking is often a problem. It tends to take a lot of time and it can be difficult dealing with the parking staff. That was not the case here, the staff were very professional and swift.

In fact, I had a friend visit for about 4 hours one evening and they charged my room the full $35 charge. First night I arrived, I checked into my room (had requested a king/non smoking) and upon entering my room, it was a double bedded smoking room. I booked this room through my corporate travel agent (not a discount agent like Travelocity or Priceline). I called the manager on duty and explained that I had booked a non smoking, and told him I didn't care about the King bed, but I really wanted non-smoking. He explained that other guests had paid a premium to guarantee a non-smoking room and that he had nothing for me. Moving on. Went down to the lobby to get a dinner recommendation for a local restaurant a the Concierge. One problem, they were on break. Break? How does a Concierge take a break in a 1,000 room hotel at 8:00 pm? The rooms are equipped adequately. Decent beds. There is no \"scene\" or action in the lobby. You have to go up to the 2nd floor for a drink or for the \"lobby bar\". They do have a pianist that plays, which was nice. The decor is very dated though.

Our room was on the 16th floor--the view was o.k.--but the street noise was bad(Cyril Magnin side). The maid's were attentive and friendly. That is more than what I can say for the front desk. When we checked in (as per other posting) we asked for room on 27th floor or above. We were told they were booked (hard to understand lady, she was curt and had bad accent) so we settled for 16th floor. When we got to room called down and asked if could be upgraded and told 50.00 extra a night. So what is the truth---are they booked or not. We rode down the elevator--couple who just checked in pushed button for 28th floor and we asked how they got that room? The told us they said they were on anniv. and they gave them upgrade. So we went down and asked again and were told best they could do was 26th floor--we said no thanks. Desk clerk's get below average rating. The hotel does not have pool, the resturants are average at best, no views or dining from the top floor, and the hotel location is average. The Homless report: The problem is mild. There are street people, it does mar the image, they do ask for money. The hotel is 1 block from market street station where they seem to hang out---not really a problem everywhere else. We were out late one night and walking around in that area they were more aggressive than in day. Reccomendations: Stay in a hotel that is on or very near Powell street (this is the cable car line). Buy a multi day Muni pass to ride buses and cable cars. Rent a car only the days you want to travel out of the city. Don't need or want a car for city. Hard to park and parking is expensive.

I travel on Business and usually like to stay in Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. This Hotel is owned by Marriott so that ment it would meet a minimum acceptable standard for me. Some general thoughts about the hotel. 1) Star rating - the hotel is listed as a 4 star hotel. I think it is a little shy of that - maybe a 3.75 star. Only a little better than a standard Marriot. 2) Room was good sized, clean, comfortable bed, and quiet. 3) Staff - not too bad. Cleaning ladies came by often to see if room was cleaned. Concierge messed up and was supposed to have flowers in the room BEFORE we checked in - but came up afterwards. Food was okay. 4) Views - ask for a room on the 12th floor or higher to get a decent view. They gave us a corner room on the 12th which was pretty good. 5) Bums and Panhandlers - In general, SF has a lot of homeless people. Be prepared where ever you are walking around to be asked for money. They are not mean or aggressive - but they are every where - not just around this hotel. 6) Location - right next to the Powell Street Bart station. Was able to save money and just take BART to hotel. Again - the Bart Station has alot of bums, but during the day there are plenty of regular folks too - so it was safe. Also this hotel is kind of on the edge of the \"Tenderloin district\". Know where you are going when you head out for a walk - talk with the bellmen. However, you are right next to an upscale mall, and the cable cars, shops and resturants. Bottom line on this hotel? Good value for the money. Clean, comfortable, above average. Looking for something more upscale and willing to pay (double/triple) for it? Look to the Mandarin. Also let me share quick thoughts on SF in general. City is a little dirty - to much trash in the streets. To many bums. Commercial Architecture is a little boring. Restaurants - If you can afford $75 per person - try Aqua and Boulevard. They were FANTASTIC. Go on a NAPA valley wine tour. Bus will pick you up at Hotel. Loved it! Go on a bus tour to Muir Woods and Sausalito. We went to the Muir woods in the morning but they were only going to let us spend 30 min in Sausalito. Get off the bus in Sausalito and spend the afternoon there- take a ferry back to the pier warf. Skip Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Warf for site seeing. Sausalito is MUCH better. One last thing - If you are looking for an alternative trip - instead of SF - come to Chicago !

Don't worry about the homeless in San Francisco, they are everywhere - the states problem - but noone bothers you and we felt safe both walking and taking public transportation.", "Date": "June 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!!\u201d", "Author": "AdAgencyWoman", "ReviewID": "UR2111089", "Content": "I absolutely loved this hotel.

I had read the postings on this cite and made sure to ask for a corner room. I was assigned a terrific corner room on the 29th floor with views that included part of the Golden Gate Bridge. This hotel is walking distance to both Union Square and Chinatown and has a very helpful staff. Some of the previous posts have warned about the homeless problem in the city. If you are uncomfortable around the homeless then you should not visit San Francisco!! This city has a very large homeless population and they can be found in many different areas throughout SF, not just near this hotel.", "Date": "April 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colts Neck, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "scasci", "ReviewID": "UR1783273", "Content": "I did alot of research for a S.F. hotel and was not disappointed. The location is 1 block from Union Square (and some of the best shopping I've ever encountered!), steps from the tourist info. office and 1 block from the cable car. Within an easy walk are numerous tiny restaurants with fantastic food. The hotel is very clean and modern with great \"curb appeal\" i.e. you think \"wow this place looks really nice!\" It is 32 stories high with great views from the upper floors. Rooms are spacious with a sitting area by the window. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of fluffy towels. I sure wish we'd been able to find the $50 deal - we paid $139.00, but I was able to get a good deal on worldweb as a $32 breakfast voucher was included for each day which was good on the buffet in the Veranda restaurant or room service. By the way, the hotel has a lovely lounge on the 2nd floor with internet access and continental breakfast available for those who want something lighter. You really can not go wrong with this hotel.", "Date": "April 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cthis place was great!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1770104", "Content": "Flew up to San Fran for a weekend and stayed here. It was great!! Nice room, fantastic location (right near Union Square and start of cable car), great amenities (gym with sauna, restaurant, sports bar). There was no \"homeless\" problem at all here. Yeah you do see homeless in the city who are in any major city but they weren't around the hotel, which I should add is always bustling with cutomers, valets, tour people and other employees. The hotel rooms have amazing views, either of the bridge, the bay or the skyline. Also, the restaurant is very good and the employees are very helpful and friendly. They even have a great tour desk to book sightseeing tours, which will pick you up and drop you off right at the hotel! I got a great package deal online for this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.", "Date": "April 8, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Parc 55 Wyndham", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d81192-Reviews-Parc_55_Wyndham-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$190 - $453*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">55 Cyril Magnin Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94102</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "81192", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cd/57/29/concierge-lounge.jpg"}}

However we were able to find rooms at the Jameson Inn Indy South, and based on the reviews we felt pretty lucky! The location is really great; you're not in downtown Indy but its close, and there are lots of shopping options, food, etc. When we walked in the room, there definitely wasn't anything special About it, but we knew we had a place to lay our heads and that's all we needed. However the second I took my shoes off, it was clear that they had not swept the floor because I was stepping on something that we did not bring in with us. Gross. We also got a room right by the interstate, so sleep quality was not the best. However the curtains block out all light and we were able to sleep in; loved that! The shower does have little cubbies for you to place your shampoo/conditioner in, which was very helpful! AWFUL towels. Bring your own (I'm kidding, but they really are bad). It's our last night; we just walked in, and they only cleaned a 1/4 of our room. We had two beds; one was made, the other wasn't. And my bed has the old pillow cases; I can tell because there's still mascara on the pillow from the night before. Really? Is it too much to ask to get new sheets? Especially since all the bars here allow smoking in them so everything we own smells like smoke. Listen, it was a GREAT location and like I said, we just needed a place to sleep. But it was not worth the $500 a night they charged us because it was the super bowl (total rip off) and we will not be returning.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, good facilities\u201d", "Author": "Adrian C", "ReviewID": "UR119677035", "Content": "I just spent last week at a local woodworking school.

The aforementioned check-in man seemed genuinely willing to assist us in finding somewhere to go for dinner for our one night there, and to that end, gave us a 10%-off coupon for the Cheeseburger In Paradise down the road. I would certainly stay here again, especially when traveling with a pet, as my family did during this trip; the fee for a small dog is only fifteen dollars.

Its location is at exit 103 on interstate I-65 just south of Indianapolis, IN. This exit has a generous number of motels and fast food restaurants for travelers. The property is well maintained with clean rooms, and a friendly and very helpful staff. Natalie Beavers, the general manager is very helpful. The hotel is close to the highway. I would suggest you ask for a room facing away from the two highways, and away from the dumpster. When we went to our room on arrival, it faced the interstate. I asked for a change of room which they did immediately and a staff member was at our room almost immediately to help with moving our luggage. Hot buffet breakfast was very good. All and all a very good stay for a traveler. We came back through the area on May 6 and stayed again. Things were not so rosy this time. This hotel chain is \"pet friendly\", meaning you can bring your dog or cat in the room for a small fee. The hotel chain has rules about size of pets and not leaving pets unattended in the room. I realize it is difficult for hotel management to control the behavior of some guests. A rude guest left their three dogs unattended in the room directly above us with the window open. One of the dogs was a large Labrador Retriever. Those dogs barked and howled at the window and the door for four to five hours until about 11:00PM.. Several guests complained to hotel management. Management tried to help but there was little they could do until the room occupants returned. Other similar rooms were not available. This one thing made our stay on May 6 very uncomfortable. Other than that I would rate the hotel as four stars. If you are unlucky enough to get a room near barking dogs, or facing the highway, two stars is generous. Averaging the two visits, I gave it three stars. This is a good quality and well managed motel but one or more rude guests can make a stay uncomfortable.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Embu, Brazil", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Value in Indianapolis\u201d", "Author": "Neptuno55", "ReviewID": "UR107673202", "Content": "I have stayed in this roadside Hotel quite a few times when attending classes at nearby Marc Adams School of Woodworking.

As everyone knows, trying to second-guess what an actual room/hotel will be like can be quite difficult based on pictures and online reviews. To say the least, we were delighted with this hotel. So much so, we cancelled pre-departure reservations at another hotel and booked that night here also. The hotel and rooms are spotless. The bed was nice and comfortable. Staff is non-intrusive, but courteous and attentive. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!", "Date": "July 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "White House, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cPrecious Memories\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3488756", "Content": "My wife and I had not been priveleged to visit our son on his territory in years. We traveled from Tennessee to Indianapolis with anticipation to be with him but not sure as to where we would stay. Signature Inn had a nice ring to it's name and the price was very reasonable. We took a chance and wow! we were amazed at the awesome personal service and concern provided by the staff. They knew just when to clean and refresh our room. They didn't know how important our visit was but you would have thought they planned our little family gathering. One morning we were a little late for the motel furnished breakfast. The biscuits were all gone although gravy was still available. A marvellous young lady (Melissa Oburn) attending the desk alone took the time to cook our son biscuits. The atmosphere and kindness of the Signature Inn made our threesome reunion a lasting precious memory.", "Date": "May 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rantoul, IL", "Title": "\u201cBugs in the bed!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2526805", "Content": "We have never experienced anything like this before, bugs in the bed!!! We came home after staying at the Signature Inn at (4402 East Creek View Dr) Indianapolis, In, and noticed that we were itching with welts from bug bites. We called the hotel right away and was told by the clerk that a manager would call us back. That was 2 days ago, and never received a call. During our stay as well, we were out of some necessities and was informed that they did not have room service and we can come down and get them ourselves.

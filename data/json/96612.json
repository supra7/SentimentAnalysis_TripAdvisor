The lady that checked us in was so nice and helpful. She honored the internet rate I had pulled up on my phone. Also upgraded us to a bigger King with a sofa. We had stayed here a few years ago, glad we came back to it. The only thing that we were disappointed with was the breakfast buffet. Not hardly anything at all on it. Biscuits w gravy, both not very hot and almost gone, cereal, bread laid out for toast. I saw a couple come in and walk out immediately b/c they said they were out of waffle batter. They weren't happy. Also didn't have a single pastry. Few more items but nothing at all like we usually get when there is a full hot breakfast offered. Never saw an attendant to help and restock the breakfast. We would return again because the location of the Inn, and the customer service in the office is superb. The hotel also had a prayer request card in the room, which I thought was awesome. They gather them and get together weekly to pray. Almost forgot, the property is very well maintained and the 2 pools looked nice and clean and one of them was much bigger than normal.

I will say that as a hotel that markets itself as a conference center, the internet/wireless service is lacking. Sometimes it would work just fine, other times not at all. This seemed to be the consensus around Branson, so it's possibly out of their control. The hotel is easily accessible and close to many popular Branson attractions. We have enjoyed walking over to Little Hacienda for a Mexican fix of food and margaritas without having to drive. I will say that this past time, I saw two spiders in the room. I know it's common especially with the warmer winters and unseasonably hot spring/summer, but ONE of them was a Brown Recluse.

We just grabbed the extra blankets and threw them over the bed, so we wouldn't have to actually touch....the bed. Not too comfy, but better than the alternative.

The breakfast was nice - cereal, biscuits and gravy, hot belgian waffles, fresh fruit, oatmeal, milk, juice, and coffee. Also, there was always hot coffee and fresh cookies to snag in the lounge. We didn't make use of the outdoor pool as they had just filled it Memorial Day weekend so I don't have an opinion about that.

The only complaints about the room would be the mini-blinds on the window and a few of the pillows were lumpy. I will mention there was a group of seniors there, so we were the only family with children. The entire place was quiet as a mouse and we always had the indoor pool/hot tub to ourselves. The hot tub was nice, and HOT!! The pool was small but the kids didn't mind since they were the only ones in it. I also feel the need to mention, that while we were at the pool, my daughter pre-flushed the toilet since it had toilet paper in it, and it overflowed onto the floor. I called the front desk and after about 30 minutes, they plunged it but DID NOT mop up the floor...so DON'T FORGET YOUR WATER SHOES!!!

Well, the idiot did not use the card that I had paid my bill with, rather they used the one I had used the previous year.

I found an internet coupon for a free breakfast buffet every morning of our stay. The first thing I can say is that the staff was extremely friendly. I called them a few times prior to our trip to double check things and make some special requests. Not once did they seem tired of hearing from me. The location is good. It is very close to the strip (and Celebration City) but away from the strip. The Imax Theater is right next door as is Ray Stevens' place. It has a quaint cozy appeal when you approach the parking lot. Our room was 558, a non-smoking first floor room located by the outdoor pool. We had requested a crib and I was suprised to find it to be a full size crib instead of a playpen. The room was very spacious, but I cannot say the same for the vanity. We (4 of us) had a difficult time putting all our toiletries on the limited space provided. We wound up moving the coffee maker and ice bucket to add space. We managed. My chief complaint was our bathroom. The tub seemed to be dirty which made me cautious about giving our 1 year old a tub bath. I also noted there was a very large yellow discoloration ring on the linoleum. I am guessing it was only due to wet towels lying there for a lengthy time. The shampoo is in \"packets\" rather than plastic bottles. Make sure you open prior to shower or you may never get it open. We never noticed any noise, but we are typically the ones making the noise rather than on the hearing side. The blinds they use on the windows - beware- are light filtering. It wasn't a bother to us, but for people who need darkness to rest.... Other than this, our room was clean, spacious, and satisfactory overall. They only offer a breakfast buffet in way of food and not for late risers. The buffet stops serving at 9:30. It will cost you approx. $5.00 per adult and $2.00 per child. The offerings were coffee/juice/milk, canned fruit cocktail, tomato slices, some fresh friut, french toast sticks, bacon, scrambled eggs, ham, smoked sausage, sausage links, potatoes, cereals, donuts, toast, and english muffins. The scrambled eggs and canned fruit were the least satisfactory. The cereals were generic brands and the donuts were \"okay\". The rest of the breakfast was on the good side. I believe the continental breakfast comes free of charge. Both of the pools were clean and being used frequently. Parking was easy.

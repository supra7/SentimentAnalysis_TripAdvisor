The hotel has a very hip feeling and the staff are welcoming and friendly. The location is perfect for taking a stroll to nearby stores or coffee. I travelled for business and so the only complaint I have is the charge for wifi which I think nowadays should be free as standard. I mean if McDonalds and the Hampton Inn can offer it for free then surely hotels like the Softel which proud themselves on service can! I travel to LA regularly for work and stayed in a variety of hotels over the years but I think it's safe to stay I have now found my LA hotel! The rooms are spacious and clean and as you expect from a top hotel provides added luxury which makes a stay memorable.

In many ways this is a five star property - especially in regards to service. Everyone we encountered was absolutely delightful, smiling and helpful. However, the room is just too darned small. I was traveling on business but with my 13 year old and we had a king room. There is just enough room for the bed and side tables and nowhere to sit besides the bed and the desk chair. Even if you sat on the bed to watch tv it was uncomfortable as the picture on the wall is hung low so your head will be pushed forward. Normally we enjoy room service but we didn't even try (besides some coffee) as there was just nowhere to eat. The bathroom, on the other hand was large and spacious and gorgeous. The pool area is tiny and not very attractive. We were on the 8th floor and the noise from the street was very loud even through the double paned windows. This was especially annoying when some group across the street was picketing and every car that drove by honked at them. Not relaxing.

Compared to other, similar starred hotels in the area, the pool was pretty rubbish! The rooms were nice, great bathroom & fab view of the Hills & Hollywood sign, although the bed was really strange - oddly made-up & not that comfy. The main issue I had with the room (and other parts of the hotel) was the dust & dirt. There was literally a pile of dust in the corners of the rooms and on all the skirting boards. Also the rooms were never properly made up, with drink facilities, toiletries & towels not replaced. When issues were raised with reception nothing was done! Another complaint was the charge for WiFi which is ridiculous when most budget hotels offer it for free - there are plenty of places nearby that do offer it for free.

The staff were, to a person, totally delightful to deal with. I think it's the best service I've had in a hotel, perhaps ever. From doormen to reception staff, concierge to room service, everyone seemed genuinely eager to help, positive and approachable. It was really great! Well done Sofitel! My room was well-appointed, with an AMAZING huge bed (the bed was super fluffy, yet supportive - it was really great!), huge TV, desk and decent-sized wardrobe. The decor was pretty bland, however, and accounts for my half a star off. It wasn't offensive, just - beige/brown/yellow colour schemes do nothing for me. It was very International Hotel. It may be that not all rooms have the same decor (I was so jet-lagged I couldn't be bothered asking for a different room). The bathroom was big enough to set up the ironing board, and had some good amenities (L'Occitane products, emery boards, loofah, shaving mirror, slippers and robe) and enough counter space for a cosmetics case or two. Room service was pretty good - prices were not outrageous, and delivery was really quick. The location is really handy for shopping - the Beverly Centre mall is right across the street, and there are a few interesting boutiques around (my fav is Scent Bar, an amazing perfume boutique on Beverly). I walked to LACMA, an easy three-kilometre stroll. I will say that the hotel doesn't have the buzz that other LA hotels have - so don't come here for a party. Come here for a friendly welcome and a really good sleep! Overall, I had a really pleasant stay here.

Our room was located on the 4th floor facing the Beverly Center. That said, not once did we hear any noise from the street. Hallways do resonate sound, so I would recommend staying away from the elevators. We did not eat in the restaurant, but did go to the lounge a few times. The lounge area is nicely appointed with comfortable seating areas for you to enjoy cocktails with friends. The only major drawback that we experienced was that our visit coincided with the annual testing of the electricity and fire alarms. We lost electricity briefly after 2 am, and the fire alarm began going off at 9:30 am. However, the hotel was very good about notifying us in advance of the testing by leaving a note in our room with some glowsticks. The hotel also left us note reminding us about daylight savings, which I found considerate. The hotel only has valet parking, which at the time of this review was $33/day.

Since my husband got sick on the second day, we ordered a lot of food from the hotel (which usually we don t do): everything was very good and the service was extremely kind. The concierge of the hotel was very helpful assisting us finding restaurants and trips.

They also have a free coffee bar that is opened very early in the morning, which was very helpful, due to our being from the east coast.This was our first stay at the Sofitel and we choose it solely based on being the closest hotel to the hospital, so to have such great experience was such an added plus and I hope that this recent review helps you in choosing the Sofitel for your next visit to Beverly Hills and an added plus, is a great shopping mall directly across the street.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Base for Exploring LA\u201d", "Author": "Shan_and_Jase", "ReviewID": "UR124993270", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel twice during our trip to the states in Jan/ Feb 2012.

At check in, the receptionist was perfectly polite and helpful and offered to give us a room with a balcony. Upon entering the room...no balcony. I was also looking forward to a long bath but no bath tub (unusual for a large hotel) The concierge were quite unhelpful, we asked a question one morning and got a slap happy reply until he saw cash folded in my husbands hand and then fired up a conversation and answered all questions. Another concierge remarked to us one morning to \"not forget your umbrella today, its going to rain\" , very helpful information but could have been more helpful if he added to that statement that the hotel offers complimentary umbrellas for guests We also purchased the internet for one night.....don't bother as it was soooo slow, we rang and told them to take if off our account as we had to sleep for an early flight. The receptionist on the other end understood our issues and immediately took the internet charge off our account. The main problem I had with this hotel was that I had made 2 reservatiions, the first for 2 nights, the second for one night. All prepaid through expedia. I emailed prior to our arrival to have the 2 reservations merged, I also confirmed at check in that the 2 reservations were to be merged, however on our seond day (the end of the first reservation), we had housekeeping knocking on our door asking when we were checking out, I went to reception and they said no promblems and took another imprint of our credit card. After a full day out we arrived back at the hotel to find our room keys did not work.....off to reception again we go, they reissued yet another 2 guest room keys. Surely it does not have to be that hard!!! On the upside the rooms we nicely decorated clean and the bed was so amazingly comfortable and we slept like babies Would recommend this hotel, they just need to iron out a few bugs and train their staff a bit better.

It was an okay stay. Service was competent (a previous reviewer noted that there were a surprising lot of bell staff and I have to agree) and the food in the restaurant was just outstanding, everything, from breakfast (where you served a delicious, complimentary mini-smoothie) to lunch (fantastic pizza) to cocktails on the ingenuously designed outdoor patio that almost makes you forget you're at the crossroads of two massive L.A. boulevards. The nightclub/bar, which is adjacent, frankly looked like something from the early 1980s, and was rather creepy, anything but enticing. Our room was just so-so. First room I was given was tiny, with a shower-only bathroom (I'm a regular Sofitel customer and I don't understand why I was given a crappy room to begin with when clearly there were other, better rooms in my price category). To its credit Sofitel moved quickly when I asked for a bathroom with tub, and the second room, along the same corridor, was much larger. Pleasant but unexceptional with one particularly oddity: There was no headboard and a framed print was placed where your head would rest if you were reading in bed. Literally the framed hit the middle of the back of my head. Bizarre and uncomfortable. The bathroom was adequate but nothing special, even with the aforementioned bath, which was one of those 1970s models that's shallow. The view was terrible -- we looked out on the Beverly Center parking lot. Depressing. I don't think I'll go back to this hotel again -- there are too many better options for the same money in L.A. It reminds of the Miami airport Sofitel, which also could use a cash infusion. But the big difference is that at the airport the pickings are slim.

Sure, so they \"show\" you the room as if you've never been to a hotel and stick around to make sure you are satisfied, until you take out a bill from the pocket will they leave. Room: interior nothing too spectacular. The bath room with both tub and shower is quite nice and spacious. But also makes the rest of the room look like its from another hotel. Our room was located on the 3rd floor with window looking directly out at the hotel's decorative exterior.. not the greatest view. Plus with the curtain being few ft away from the window..odd. Never mind the looks, but for the first two nights, me and my friend already noticed we were not alone, but occupied by other flying friends as well. We simply ignored it because it was late and we were tired, and had to wake early to help prep for another friend's wedding. However, on the last evening returning to the hotel, I couldn't believe I found a DEAD MOSQUITO on my pillow. It was nothing too small either! Again, we were too tired to make a fuzz which would probably have cut into our few hrs' nap already. I ended up waking up with five extremely unattractive and very noticeable mosquito bites on my face and forehead. I informed the concierge and showed them my face, and they simply gave me an insincere apology and said will have someone \"look into\" it. To my knowledge, of the many hotels I've stayed at, they always do follow-up's if/when problems occur. No follow-up's, no calls, no emails. So ended up I had to send in a comment form myself. Facility: Tempted by the pictures, I wanted to check out the gym and spa. But to my surprise, I was pretty much ignored for a full 5 minutes, with no help offered. The staffs were just happily chatting away. They gave me one quick glance, seeing that I'm looking into the brochure and they quickly went back to their conversation. No introduction, no offers of help or explanation. Great service there. Overall: Visiting LA, most people would drive, so there isn't a really inconvenient location depends on ur itinerary. What's good with Sofitel LA, is there's a mall right across and only a few minutes drive from all the shopping and excitements. Just be ready for the heavy traffic all around during rush hrs. Taking side roads can be an option. For the same price, I'm sure better service in similar location can be found. I'm not sure if I want pay this particular Sofitel another visit.

Bedroom was spacious with walk in robe and the best bed I have enjoyed in a hotel for many years. It was divine and I slept really well every night! The bathroom was also large and modern, rainwater shower head, big bath with tv in the wall and very fancy window which you could block out if need be. We had a view of the Hollywood hills and could also see the observitory and HOLLYWOOD sign from our window/balcony. It was a great view to wake up to. Really try to get a room facing the Hills as the other side of the building gets a view of a shopping centre, definitely not as nice. I am so grateful they gave us the Hills side. Make sure to ask for it. The bar downstairs was very modern and trendy. Drinks about standard prices but a very cool place to be and had great atmosphere. We didnt get a chance to eat at the restaurant so I can't comment on that. Their were a few issues though that bugged us. The cost of valet was expensive, the most expensive we have ever paid. At $33 a day plus tax, it adds up. Three nights cost over $100 which is a good money maker for them. The room does not even include wi-fi internet. It costs $10 per device, per day, so be careful of that. This is the only hotel in our four week US trip that didn't include free wi-fi. Very disappointing. Lastly, it would have been nice to put our own food and drinks in the fridge, but it was stocked with their own drinks electronically so we couldn't even take them out without getting charged. A few disappointments but not enough to spoil or outweigh the sensational location, room and view. Breakfast was a little pricey so we went the the Urth Cafee about 2 mins drive away each day. Breakfast was amazing. We tried six different options in our three visits, each being tasty, well priced and well portioned. Its a definite if your in the area! We would definitely stay again.

From the moment we walked in to the time we left I felt like I was in as close to a 5 star hotel as possible - without actually paying for one. Unbelievable holiday decor - modern and orignal. Our first room did not have windows that opened, so all I did was ask and they put us in a room 2 floors up with \"french doors\" - which opened to the tiny balcony and was a very nice touch. Apparently all the rooms with 2 beds face the Beverly Center, but I didn't mind because everything else was so great! I think our first day there LA got about 5 hours of steady rain - and even with the doors shut, the water seeped in onto the carpet. I don't think LA in general is equipped for heavy rain so I considered it a fluke. Coming from Boston this is nothing. The bathrooms were very nice - lovely glass enclosure - rainmaker shower, L'Ocittane products, hairdryer (without having to ask). The Robe was so so comfy too! No fan though. I thought that was weird. The beds Crazy Comfortable! Feather beds and soft sheets were such a nice luxury away from home. The hallways were lovely. The Concierge / Valet so helpful. Complimentary umbrellas for the rain. The Restaurant Bar very appealing for both Dining and Drinks. The gym was fully equipped with machines and food/water! Le Spa is a \"Must Do\". We got a $25 off with our reservation which was a nice surprise. Very decadent. The pool is so-so compared to all the other ones in the area, no view and sun fades away by 1pm due to the Beverly Center blocking it. When we were there the pool was out of service, so the hotel allowed guests the use of the SLS pool which is supposed to be excellent! This location was perfect for me. Facing Beverly Center, 10 min walk to Robertson St and the Ivy, 25 minute walk to the Grove. Close to public transportation if necessary. 5 min walk to Hertz rent a car, 5 min walk to Melrose Ave. Across the street from the tour bus pick-up (Starline and others). We actually even walked home from the Comedy Store one night from the Sunset Strip! About 30min walk downhill. I really loved this European hotel, and the luxury it exuded. Normally I am not in the room a lot while traveling due to sightseeing, plans etc - but here I didn't want to leave! We were supposed to get the \"I love chocolate\" package, but we never did. I was so impressed with their other services, hospitality and room service though that I forgot about it until after I left. They allowed us late check out which we really appreciated. Overall I would absolutely stay here again - highly recommended for just about anyone.

When I explained my situation the front desk staff provided me with a solution that worked for both of us. They suggested I check out of my room at the normal time and they would hold my baggage for the day. I was also offered at no charge the use of the Spa at the hotel for a change of shower and a change of clothes at the end of the day. This solution was terrific as it saved me paying for another night. The rooms at the Sofitel are great as they are not the typical box square cookie cutter hotel room you normally get, yet they manage to incorporate all the aspects you require without the loss of functionality. As my luggage had been lost in transit I asked housekeeping if they had any amenities for me to be able to use. They were extremely helpful in providing personal grooming items delivered to my room within a very short space of time. The WiFi in the room was easy to connect to and had fast transmission rate. The bed was comfortable and had easy access to side lights and clock radio. The only negative in the room was a lack of tea & coffee making facilities. I would think that this is almost mandatory in hotels these days. I had breakfast in the Simon La restaurant which was a very pleasurable experience. As mentioned earlier, it is the small things that make a great hotel. As I sat at the table the Ma\u00c3\u00aetre de noticed I was wearing dark colored trousers and asked if I would care for a black napkin rather than the white one on the table so the fluff wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show on my trousers.

The room was nicely furnished and glad we had a room type we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accustomed to experiencing. We went to our event and upon returning we thought we take a quick shower and go back out. The room was so peaceful and the shower was very refreshing with Hermes bath products which smell divine.

The room was facing the Hollywood Hills which was a peaceful view, not showing the hustle of Los Angles and we both agreed that didn't seem like we were in LA. The two TV were good size and very clear, loaded refrigerator and you can request an empty one for free and walls were solid for noise control.

The gym is not manned and access is gained with your room key. I noticed that a lot of guests were from Australia/NZ/Asia and on their home time zones and the gym was starting to get busy at 9pm (morning time in those time zones) so it would have been great to have extended use of the facility.

It is located at the edge of West Hollywood and B Hills. Neighborhood somewhat marginal - a stretch of seediness along La Cienega detracts, especially an \"all nude\" bar.

Decor and ambience shouted \"cutting edge\" but clientele was mainly ordinary folk, like us, or at least people with means but more traditional lifestyles. Nice diverse group from gay couples to what looked like a high school cheerleading group. Staff was friendly and professional for the most part. Room was smallish for the price. Room was nicely decorated - the bathroom was sweet. Room was also very clean. I must say that one of Sofitel's selling points - their specially designed beds - were a disappointment. Turned out to be a downy top on what felt like concrete. In fact the entire bed was a bit awkward - haven't slept without a headboard on my bed since college. I guess that was a \"cutting edge\" touch. Right. The emperor has no clothes guys - your beds suck. Room service was fast and good. Prices were fair. However, the wet bar is a money sucker. Best to just go to CVS across the street, buy snacks and soda, and use Sofitel's delicious free ice instead. Of course, if you really WANT and CAN afford to spend $10 for a small pack of peanuts, knock yourself out. Also, valet parking is $32 a day. Prompt delivery of car to door and very nice doormen, but this is a money sucker also. By all means DO NOT USE the map you can print off their web site for anything like true directions to anything. For instance, if you were just going by their map to other locations, you'd think the Chinese Theater was about 9 blocks total away from the hotel. It is more like 30.

Firstly let me say that we had trouble booking a hotel at around the price you can get to stay at this hotel (tip - use the tripadvisor rates tool to get the best rate at that time, it's awesome and saves you heaps of time), it seems Los Angeles has a lot of budget hotels that are poorly located or low quality and then a lot of high priced hotels living on past glory. The Sofitel shone out as a beacon in between these groups for us. The hotel. Vey comfortable, clean rooms with modern decor and the most comfortable beds ever! The bathrooms are very clean and modern with the toiletries and large shower with ceiling rose head highlights. The gym is commercial quality and nobody ever seems to be in there, the pool area is a little exposed to traffic noise (being at ground level) but heated to a nice temperature and with nice amenity and the heakth and beauty spa is a little pricy but exclusive (as you would expect with the West Hollywood location I suppose)and we had nothing but amazing service there. One slight negative is that there is not free wifi in the rooms, but this is counter acted somewhat by free use of 3 computers and printer in the Lobby. The hotel lobby, bars and restaurants are modern and very well presented, with the breakfast in the restaurant a highlight and something we highly recommend (Martha is amazing and will make you feel at home every morning). Now that I've touched on the staff I will continue. From our favourite Martha in the restaurant to Johnny the head of security all of the staff were great. The Concierge is always willing to help and very informative, and we found it best to book everything through them as with restaurants especially the Sofitel name seemed to open some doors in LA we couldn't. We had a little cab trouble (some of them don't like to put on the meter and/or claim they can't take credit cards as their machine is 'broken') so the front desk hand picked a cab for us the last day for the long trip to Anaheim and we had no problem (there are cab ranks right outside the hotel on each side of the road by the way). Great service in general we found. And the location, what a great spot. The hotel is located directly opposite the Beverly Centre, a large shopping centre with many exclusive shops and a place at which the Starlite hop on- hop off bus stops at every half hour from 9:30am (definitely worth using to get around the city, very affordable and visits all the must see places, with commentary), which is very handy. There are many great restaurants in walking distance (Jerry's Famous Deli, Koi, Urth Cafe, Bazar to name a few) and an abundance of other shops (including a 24 hour CVS pharmacy) and eating spots (Taco Bell, Corner Bakery, Tea Leaf and Coffee Bean etc) in walking distance as well. The rooms at the rear have a view of the Hills and Santa Monica Boulevard is a short walk to the north. I think I've covered everything, in all we ahd a great stay and would definitely stay again if back in LA.

Just to make this clear, we never got any tea or cookies at all!!! We had dinner in the hotel restaurant. The service was very good but the food was lousy and not worth the price. I had Risotto \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as we come from Europe we know how Risotto should taste but it seems that the hotels high rated cook doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know it. The rise was cooked and then made thick with some binding agent. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also how the Risotto tasted, like paper. The rooms are nice but you can go somewhere else. The neighborhood is not specially nice. Even we had booked mountain view, we got one room phasing the parking house next to the hotel. The hotel is - for US levels - expensive but does not at all convice and fullfill the level they promise. The hotel is close to Universal, La Brea Tar Pits and Beverly Hills.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clovis, California", "Title": "\u201cThe best welcome back ever.\u201d", "Author": "alacson", "ReviewID": "UR108132371", "Content": "I would like to congratulate you all on a very memorable weekend at Sofitel.

Wow I didn't even remind them, they just did it. The room was pretty spacious, very comfy big bed, and the shower is very nice, you don't want to get out. I didn't eat in the restaurant , but I did order room service it came faster than expected and I will definitely recomend the caprese salad. YUM. I pretty much stopped in the bar everynight on my way out. The bar has a very nice atmosphere, well it's more of a nightclub than a bar. Definitely a hot spot in L.A. Drinks are a little pricey, but if you can afford the hotel than 14 bucks for a drink isn't that bad which is what you are going to pay in any trendy night club in L.A.

This place just oozes class. I managed to find a great deal on a Prestige Suite, which was still quite pricey, but worth every penny. Having arrived at LAX at like 6:30AM, I arrived at the Sofitel at around 8AM, and unsurprisingly, they did not have a room ready for me. That was fine, I didn't expect one to be, but they happily took my luggage and invited me to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant. I chose not to, but instead had a bit of a walk outside in the surrounding area. It's not the in the best or most convenient location, but it is located literally across the road from the Beverly Center - a large, VERY upscale shopping centre, which did not open until 10AM. I walked back to the hotel at around 11, and to my amazement, the room was ready. The man that took my luggage and showed me to my room was so excited for me that it was my first time in the States and that I was staying in such an awesome room. This put a smile on my face, that's for sure. The suite is split up into 3 rooms: the dining/living room; the bedroom; and the spacious bathroom. The suite contained two big HD LCD TVs, numerous couches (including a sofa bed) and places to relax, and an AMAZING King sized bed. I had read previous reviews that claimed sleeping on one of these beds was like sleeping amongst the clouds, and I have to say - they're right! I didn't want to get out of bed! The bathroom was incredible, especially for someone who has never stayed in a 4-5 star hotel before. The prestige suite contains a nice massive soaking bath - like a hot tub but without the jets, but the real star is the shower! The shower head is literally the size of a dinner plate, and you feel as if you're standing under a waterfall! I got room service on my first night there, and I all I can say is YUM. The food was delicious, very high standard restaurant-quality food. Another perk of staying in the suite: I could see the Hollywood Sign from my window/tiny balcony. That was awesome. My parents and sister stayed in a standard room about a month after I was there, and didn't have the same kind words to say about their stay. I'd say this means that there must be a clear and distinct difference in luxury between the standard rooms and the suites. If you're willing to splash the cash on a suite, you won't regret it... but with a standard room you might?

Not sure how it was awarded a 4 1/2 star rating.... it deserves a 3 at best. Preface: I was a mom traveling alone with 2 kids. (we are a family of frequent travelers, and have been on many international and domestic trips in the past -- the kids have enjoyed the big city bright lights in places like SF, Vegas, Chicago... we often stay downtown to be able to walk out to things. Kids have enjoyed the action and excitement of a city. We were in LA for spring break. After spending a few days at Newport Beach going to Disney and getting in some beach time, we decided to drop off our car and spend 3 days in LA to visit the American Girl store and take a hop on hop off hollywood tour. We chose the Sofitel because of the great TA reviews and for its central location. We wanted a clean, comfy, somewhat modern place with a nice pool and easy access to the Grove. Service: Not much to rave about. We pulled into the front area in a cab - with all our baggage. 4 men stood around chatting while the kids and me lugged all the bags out of the cab ourselves. No one asked if we were checking in, nor if we needed any help. Check in: The check in process was smooth, and the manager was very helpful. He said that the double room we had booked would be small and he would look into accommodating us in a larger room. There were none available... since we needed 2 beds, we stuck with our initial room type. We were given a room on the 8th floor with the 'best' view for the 2 double room type. Room: It was the smallest room we had ever seen, other than a motel we once stayed in Flagstaff, AZ. The view was of a parking lot and a CVS -- drawing the curtains to block out the grey depressing sight, made the room feel even smaller. The bathroom did not provide a great deal of privacy, and had no ventilation system. Shower was a joke -- I am not a tall person, can't imagine a taller person showering. Windows could not be opened, making the room very stuffy. Comforter had a dead bug on it, when I called to report it they sent a new cover not a new comforter. The person who brought it up, did not appear to have clean hands, and walked all over the carpeted room in his shoes, to change the duvet cover (not sure why they did not just change the entire comforter). When he left the room, his shoes left behind a sticky black residue all over the carpet. It was gross. Pool: With such a small room, we thought we would be able to relax a little at the pool. It was a warm afternoon in LA. Well, the pool was at the very end of a long, dark hallway on the second floor. When we accessed the pool area, it took us a while to find the pool, as it involved climbing down a creaky fire escape to access. Not inviting to say the least. The pool was cold, no jacuzzi or hottub. The area around it was dirty and cramped, Not inviting at all, even on a warm LA afternoon. My kids are impossible to get out of a pool, and they did not want to spend any time in here. Since the room was too small and cramped to relax in, I suggested we spend a little time at the poolside. But it was too depressing to spend more than a few minutes out there. The shrubbery behind our deck chair was dusty, and I swear I heard 'rustling' in the bushes right behind my head. It was impossible to relax. How can a 4 star hotel get away with such a terrible poolside? Most best westerns have a better poolside. That was the deal breaker for me. I asked if they had reciprocal privileges at another hotel, and got a snooty sneer. Any jacuzzi tub on the premise? Another sneer - maybe it's not the french way, but this is CA - hot tubs are the norm! Concierge: The concierge looked at me strange when I mentioned that I didn't have a car with me (LA is a driving town). She was very inconvenienced when I asked questions about tours, transportation and dining - not a smile for me nor a hello for the kids. When we got back after dinner, and stopped at the front desk to ask if there was a larger room available, we were told that we could be upgraded to a presidential suite for an extra $800 per night. Who pays that much for a hotel without a decent pool? For half that price, we could be at the Four Seasons! To top it all, I did not get a good nights sleep as the bed was lumpy, and the room was airless. I awoke stiff and unrefreshed. We also felt nickled and dimed at every step - $9.95 for wifi -- per device -- so you either share your computer with your family/ partner, or pay per device! (makes it hard to plan your day); no in room coffee, nobody ever offered to hail us a cab. It was not the chic, zen, urban oasis we had hoped for. We checked out the next morning -- it wound up being a time consuming affair as we booked through expedia and needed to get the refund authorized from the hotel... expedia was very helpful though. I'm glad we made the effort, and we moved out to a hotel in Beverly Hills with a 31/2 star rating . Despite the lower star rating, we were given a much more spacious room, free wifi, the place has a beautiful pool and tennis court, free car service within 3 miles. For the same price of what we paid at the Sofitel, we were upgraded to a 1 BR suite. when we told the concierge we were going to the Grove, she said their car would take us as a complimentary service (turned out to be a Mercedes!), and we were driven out there in style -- just like one would hope for in LA! I use TA for all my travel planning, so wanted to get this out for all the expedia and TA users out there. My first review, and sadly for a hotel i did not enjoy at all. Not sure why this place is so highy rated and reviewed. People might have a better experience if they were upgraded to a better room, but that pool is scary. Not in keeping with a four and a half star rating. Not sure if I will try the Sofitel brand again. I love France and LA, but this place did neither justice. No So Cal hospitality, no French class.

It's also very convenient to the freeway system. The room was very comfortable, the bathroom and shower were particularly AWESOME!

I travel from the east coast to the west coast at least twice a year and will certainly stay at The Sofitel again.

They placed us in one of the deluxe rooms on the third floor that has a private outdoor patio with two chairs and a table. Although the room (341) was not huge, it was very comfortable. The bath felt larger due to the large picture window in the shower, looking into the room toward the tv or the patio, that is electronically controlled to be opaque or clear, depending on the wall switch setting. Cool! Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was superb. They start the meal with a complimentary glass of a fruit smoothie and bread basket. For $9.00, they served a fine American eggs/sausage breakfast. Very good value in a day when most hotels seem to gouge you with high breakfast prices. Service by the receptionist, bellman, and restaurant servers was very friendly and helpful.

Although a family member volunteered to watch the kids we did not want to travel far so we looked to book a nearby hotel for some R&R. The Sofitel is five minutes from my house so it seemed like a wonderful option. Jetsetter was having a sale on rooms at the Sofitel but suites were not available, so wanting to splurge (our first time away-alone) we used hotels.com and got the Opera King Suite for twice the price of a regular room on Jetsetter. We arrived for our two day get away at the hotel and we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who began checking us in. He then called over the manager and without saying anything pointed to the screen. The manager (M.) then pointed elsewhere on the screen and the receptionist replied \"But...\" and pointed again to the screen to emphasize his point. The manager simply replied \"Over there\" and once again pointed to the screen. Not being a complete idiot I began to realize there must be an issue with our reservation and asked if something is wrong but was assured that my reservation is \"in order.\" The manager walked away and the receptionist asked if we've ever stayed in the hotel to which I replied \"no\". He then sent us up to \"our\" room which, as I suspected, was not a suite and was a regular room which I could have reserved for half the price on Jetsetter that very day (no tub no balcony etc.) But the cleaning service did make sure to forget a dirty rag on the coffee table (I snapped a few pics of that too.) It was now clear to me what had transpired and what all the screen pointing was about: all suites were booked and the receptionist asked if we've ever stayed there before hoping I wouldn't notice that the 300sqft room he sent us to was not 800+ sq ft nor was it a suite- perhaps he crossed his fingers hoping I would mistake the sink for a small \"soaking tub\". I called down and said I was not sent to the room I reserved. To which the receptionist replied \"I'm so sorry but all our suites are booked out\". I said that is fine but I do not appreciate being treated like an idiot and perhaps you could have told me that before confirming that my reservation was \"in order\". I then asked for someone to come up and get our bags so I could check out and get a refund and go down a few blocks to The London (great hotel!!). He apologized profusely and asked for ten minutes to try and straighten it out. We waited anxiously to hear back as we had a dinner reservation we had to make a week in advance (valentines day). A half-hr later we were escorted by the manger (M.) to a room that \"should be to your satisfaction\". We were brought into a suite (room #1002 which they insist is an opera king suite but if these pictures are correct it most certainly wasn't http://www.oyster.com/los-angeles/hotels/sofitel-los-angeles/photos/opera-suite/). As we were in a rush to make our reservation we agreed to stay in the suite we were shown to. As the manger left and we put down our bags I noticed the room was filthy, pieces of bread and plastic around the bed and a sticky substance all over the marble floor. I called the manager again and said the suite you showed us to is filthy to which he again began profusely apologizing. He said he would send up room service asap and asked if we would accept free parking on account of our experience. As my wife felt bad that I was so disappointed she urged me to accept and to leave asap so we could make our reservation. We missed our reservation. Aside for a malfunctioning shade and a really PATHETIC SHOWER (an actual rain-shower has more pressure) the rest of our stay was without incident. As we checked out I was presented with a bill which (you guessed it!) included parking as well. Being in a rush to get back to the kids I paid it, planning on calling for a refund. First I called hotels.com and was told by the rep I have to call Sofitel and that there is nothing they could do. I then called Sofitel and asked to speak with a manger and was put in touch with a lady from Accor (sofitel's parent) who apologized profusely and assured me I would receive a call back asap. Over a week went by and I did not hear back so I called Accor directly and spoke to the global reservation desk and with a lady (J.) who again apologized for the lack of response and assured me once again I would hear back asap. Nothing. Dear hotel patrons - if you are considering Sofitel for you LA stay you might want to consider a Motel 6 unless S&M is your thing. Dear business owners: As a business owner myself I always appreciate when a customer gives me the opportunity to fix an issue before posting negative reviews.

One did tell me that most of their guests use limo services ! When we left the hotel, one bellman quite disinterestedly asked me if I was waiting for something (obviously).. I said yes, a car to go to the airport.. he walked off.. my husband then spoke to him and said we had a limo booked, and he took more interest.. After we checked in, one came up and asked if we needed any help. I told him that we had managed to get 4 cases out of the taxi on our own, so would get to our room... we were not given any special service on check-in or later. I asked if we could have a late check-out, and was told till 4pm only. I offered to pay a half-day rate if we could stay till 8pm, but was told no. Another guest I spoke to paid far less than us, and got a 4pm check out easily.. and wasn't an A|Club member. The room (apparently an upgrade) was a weird shape, very little space for suitcases, and no bath. I asked for a kettle and 2 cups, the kettle came (tip given), no cups. I had to call again, cups came (another tip). Paying $10/day for internet access is outrageous - and that's if it works. The sofitel hotel compendiums all refer to an internet service that is NO longer used by any of them. When I tried to connect and couldn't, I called the number provided and was told that they no longer provided support or a service to Sofitel Hotels. (2 of the 3 computers in the Business Centre required a password, and one mouse needed replacing.) I wasn't given the complimentary drink voucher, nor a welcome gift until I asked about them - then the staff person told my VIP status wasn't flagged, which was strange considering that I put it in the booking. The noise in the restaurant and bar was so loud that we left dinner early = it was also almost impossible to read the menu in the restaurant, or hear the wait staff. Our room was quiet - the only plus. On the afternoon we were due to leave, the phone rang around 3.15pm, but nobody answered me. When we did leave 3 staff were sitting in the corridor outside the room.

The line was long for check in at the front desk but the staff was very efficient, appropriately apologetic and very welcoming. Wedding gift bag in tow, we headed to the elevators through a very nicely appointed lobby: modern and sleek but not cold and formal. Up the room - which smelled like old baby diapers. As in, probably the guests before us had stayed there with a small child and since the windows don't open, even after a proper cleaning, the odor lingered. It was impossible to ignore, so we called down to the desk. Matthew answered, we explained the situation, and he told us to stay put...housekeeping would come up to \"deal with it\" and he'd look for another room for us. WIthin 10 minutes, housekeeping came up and asked what the problem was. Oddly, he couldn't smell anything but since we were already waiting for a new room, he poked around and then left. Moments later, another of the staff came up with new room keys and many apologies. He wrinkled his nose and said \"I see what you mean\" and we headed out. Upstairs two floors to the exact room without the smell (ahhh!), and we settled right in. Reason for pointing this out? Hotels handle things like this in many different ways, and the staff at the Sofitel was efficient, gracious, and extremely accommodating. What could have been a headache was merely a small bump in the checking in process. The rest of our stay was delightfully uncomplicated. Important things worked: wonderful water pressure, soft bed (but not too soft!) with luxurious linens, products from l'occitane in the bathroom (yum) and a lovely view of the hills. Didn't hear any hallway noise, the elevators came in a timely fashion, and our car, when retrieved from valet, appeared in a very reasonable amount of time. The fitness center is very well laid out with ample equipment, soft towels (not the usual gym scratchy variety!) and complimentary water and fresh fruit. There is free internet access in the lobby with a printer that works - another bonus. WIthout the option to rate 4-1/2 stars, I'm giving this hotel 4, but only because they charge $10/day for in room wifi which, in this day and age, seems somewhat unreasonale. Cable is free - why not the web? Additionally, the rooms aren't well laid out to handle luggage (no valet in the closet) and therefore our stuff was everywhere and that was a bit of a nuisance. Really, though, a 5 star stay in many respects, most noteably due to the outstanding service from the bellmen to the housekeeping staff to the front desk. Would highly recommend.

I felt our room was well appointed (hairdryer was average though), clean. well maintained and had a good layout The room was not huge but a good size for two with a heap of luggage.

I got booked the room over the web on a special, and felt we got good value for money. The breakfast was outstanding in the resturant downstairs, as were the wait staff. The bar downstairs (not owned or run by the Sofitel) was fabulous on the Saturday night with a lovely waitress who was very friendly and helpful and chatted to us for some time about travelling around different parts of the USA. One thing perhaps worth mentioning there was an extremely unhappy guest who was a sofitel member and had specifically asked for a certain room and was not given it. He was quite diplomatic about it to begin with yet the front desk person was very unhelpful with his request.

I didn't have to request prior to my arrival. Anyway, was asked to wait for about 2-3 hours before I could check-in at about 1pm. Was assigned a city view room which was extremely noisy. So, requested for a room in the hills which was quieter but had to wait for another 1-2 hours. We told them we were happy to wait before receiving a call about 10minutes later that there was a standard room available. We took that eventhough it was a standard room because we were tired.

We then asked if there were any trains that go there. The response we got from the concierge, in a rude and annoyed manner, was \"you can waste your time!\" Honestly, I think that was unreasonable and rude. He could have said \"there is a train that goes out there but it will take much longer.\" We managed to find a cheaper and fairly convenient way to get to Anaheim after speaking to a representative at the tourist information centre. We took a taxi to a bus stop and it only cost us $40/way eventhough the journey was an hour longer. However, we managed to see the outskirts of LA. Concierge also didn't know much about day tours and had to go around to look for brochures, etc. Come on, aren't queries about local attractions and day tours frequently asked questions? Please do not book day tours from the concierge. It is much more expensive than booking it directly from the tour operator at the Chinese Theatre. We were told by the tour operator that the hotel gets a cut off it! When checking-out, the two reception staff were chatting as I walked up to them. They saw me walking up but continued chatting until about 5 seconds after I got to the desk. I was then given a bill that was $60 more than it should have been. I queried it and she checked the system before giving me the correct bill without apologising. There weren't coffee/tea or even kettle in the bedroom either. It was only available upon request. Nonetheless, despite the cost we paid (just a little over USD300/night), the beds were comfortable. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to ANYONE!", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cConfirm before booking your room has been soundproofed - or don't forget your earplugs!\u201d", "Author": "Coffee4Kate", "ReviewID": "UR89021001", "Content": "After 2 weeks of great stays with Sofitel hotels on the East Coast, we had a very mixed experience at the Sofitel Los Angeles. I booked a luxury room based on Trip Advisor reviews and learning it had recently been refurbished. The hotel is located across from the Beverly Centre and reasonably close to other great shopping in Beverly Hills. The central location coupled with the non-existent sound proofing of the rooms leads to one HUGE problem - exceptionally high levels of road noise. The cute juliette balcony doors of our luxury room faced Beverly Boulevard and amazingly were just standard, single glazed windows. We ended up sleeping with earplugs in attempt to block out the traffic noise. The next morning we spoke with reception to arrange a room change. They didn't seem surprised that the noise was a problem and were more than happy to move us to a room on the other side of the building. They advised us they were in the process of soundproofing the rooms. After heading out for the day we returned to the hotel at 6pm to be informed the room was not ready and that we were welcome to head back to the old room until our new room was available. The other services at the hotel were mixed. The fitness centre is huge and has a great range of equipment, however it didn't appear to be cleaned regularly and supplies of towels/water had not been replenished. Room service was prompt & friendly and the quality of the meal was of a high standard - try the mac and cheese! Would we recommend or stay here again? Yes - providing the hotel can confirm the room had been soundproofed!!", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDoes the small things very well\u201d", "Author": "spiderpig01", "ReviewID": "UR88563199", "Content": "This is an incredibly high quality hotel.

And for the $20 you save (over a four day trip), it is absolutely not worth it for the attitude they give you! It is certainly worth it to book directly with the hotel. Dina, their customer service manager, was as arrogant and pretentious as I've ever encountered. It literally took hours on the phone before she would acquiesce to the same family package as stated in their website package. At one point, I wondered if I was speaking to a live person or simply an automated line. Finally--and only after I was forced to be in touch with hotel management--Dina \"guaranteed\" that we would be offered the family package with FREE BREAKFAST for the children. Upon check-in, I was told that it was \"no problem...your breakfast charges will be credited at checkout.\" Of course, I was never told that breakfast only included 5 items, i.e., \"Captain Crunch cereal,\" with no beverage, and that it had to be in the restaurant. Also, be aware that the \"wireless package\" that is supposedly included is actually $40 per week. Then, when I attempted to log on the next day, I had to pay an additional daily rate of $10. If you end up staying here (and I don't recommend it!), you must scrutinize every charge on your bill! I've never had the experience that I had yesterday where I had to question nearly 50% of the charges, and then they had to print out multiple corrections. Even then, I still have notes to speak to \"Dina\" about several charges that she promised would not be charged. Now I have no choice but to dispute the charges via my credit card. This hotel is certainly the coldest, most impersonal hotel we've stayed at in quite a long time. Also, be very aware that this is NOT a family-friendly hotel AT ALL. It is a very adult atmosphere and not at all appropriate for even young teens. Even though we were on a higher floor, the pounding music from the lounge on Friday night kept us all awake.

The breakfasts were very impressive and well presented with incredibly personalized service (the wait staff remembered where we were from and took time to ask us about our travels and stay). The corned beef hash was incredible and very popular. The complimentary berry smoothy shooters from the Chef, as well as the basket of pastries with fresh honey and jams were a nice touch.

Front entrance has four or five staff on arrival but they are more interested in parking cars than helping guests in and out of the hotel with luggage. Likewise we walked across the road to hail our own taxis every day. I get the impression the staff work for tips and if you aren't waving money at them they are not helpful. We booked the room through an online booking agent and were unable to stipulate we needed twin beds. However our reservation did not stipulate we had booked a King bed room. This arrangement has never been a problem when I have travelled to other hotels (especially 4/5 star places) who always accomodate by providing a twin bedded room when requested on arrival. Not so the Sofitel. The hotel was not busy but the receptionist advised that they had allocated us a Deluxe King Bed if we wanted a bed each we would have to pay an extra 30 dollars a night plus taxes. The room was not cheap to start with and this guy seemed to think it totally reasonable that we share a bed. I found the attitude of this member of staff dismissive and irritating. No effort was made to call a supervsior or to accomodate us. It was take it or leave it. In the end we paid the extra as we had already paid the website in full for the room and only had a short time in LA. The staff in general seem to pose areound the lobby in stylish black outfits. The service lets this hotel down but otherwise we went on to have an enjoyable 3 days in LA. The room was a little pokey but had nice decor, nice robes and Loccitane toiletries and it was very clean. In general the hotel is stylish and comfortable but staff service should have been better. One exception on the staff; the concierge was very helpful and didn't expect a tip, I gave her one anyway - grateful for some decent service. There are 2 big plus points to this hotel, the beds are fantastic and very comfortable and the hotel is in a great location directly opposite the Beverly Center with all its shops and restaurants. The hotel was cleaned every day but toiletries were only refreshed when my friend left a tip in the room for the cleaner. My friend used the laundry service which was fast and she seemed happy but it didn't come cheap as there was even a charge to bring the laundry to the room. There are 3 macs with free internet access in the lobby and the concierge will check you in on flights and print boarding passes. Be warned whilst they have Tmobile wifi there is a signifcant charge to have it in your room. Based on the cost of the hotel I would expect wifi to be free. Would I stay there again?

It's a convenient location to West 3rd Street, The Beverley Centre, Restaurant row, The Grove and Farmers Market are in walking distance (1km) but make sure you request a room on the hills side for a quieter stay. I suspect the plumbing needs a good rinse out to remove that 'stale waste water' smell (comes from the drain in the showers) and they would be fine.

Example: On my second trip, my colleague and I arrived very late (around 4 am) due to a delayed flight. We called ahead to make sure our reservations weren't lost, but when we arrived, they only had one room booked. I said that was an error and we'd like two rooms, but the check in attendant told us we were out of luck, that the hotel was fully booked, and maybe I could arrange to get a second room the following day. Well, the one available room had only one king bed, so I asked whether we could change that to two doubles. And the guy said, \"yes, I'll give you a different room.\" ! So obviously I replied, \"that means you have two rooms available and you're NOT fully booked.\" So we got the two rooms. Anyway, it was irritating because it was very late, we were dog-tired, and the whole process actually took like half an hour. It was so unnecessary and somewhat embarrassing because under the circumstances, it would have been really inappropriate for my colleague and I to share a room. I complained about the guy the following day, but the morning staff seemed surprisingly blase about it -- their attitude was like oh well, this kind of thing just happens from time to time.

The tv was nice and large and the bed was so so comfortable. I liked how each evening they would re-stock the complimentary evian water and re-make your bed if used since the cleaners came to the room during the day. The bathroom was also spacious. The shower had great water pressure and I LOVED the L'Occitane bath products!!! This is what won me over! Great choice Sofitel! I went to the restaurant twice during my 4 night stay and I thought it was fantastic. The food was amazing. I thought it was reasonably priced considering it was attached to a hotel. The cocktails ordered were also excellent. I thought long and hard about the location of this hotel when booking as I did not have a car. Although it's not in the most picturesque street like some other hotels, it was very conveniently located. I was there to shop and I walked to Robertson Blvd, Rodeo Drive, The Grove and Farmers Market and Melrose. It was a really safe area for a single female to walk around. The outdoor pool, whilst small and had intermittent bar service, was very nice. The only downside was that there was no free wifi.

The Beverly Center is directly across the dirty crumbling intersection of Beverly and La Cinega. Politicians must steal from Public Works in California to help pay for generous public pensions. The hotel is beautiful. And it's also across the street from Cedars Sinai hospital, where my wife was an out-patient for surgery. So we drove down the day before her 6:30 AM appointment and stayed an extra day just in case. We ate in their great restaurant and loved everything on the menu. Some complain that the prices are high, but it was about what you'd expect to pay for a good meal in any major city. Don't bother going into the bar for an early evening cocktail. The prices are higher and the service is non-existent. Their bar is what you'd call a \"bottle club\" with sofas and low furniture designed to seduce females who stop by your table to share your top-shelf $300-and-up bottle of vodka. Since we had a 6:30 AM appointment we retired to our contemporary furnish room and flat screen TV with a ton of cable channels. It was barely dark before we heard a microphone chatting DJ directly below on the patio or open doors of the bar through our solid glass windows on the 8th floor. My wife called the front desk and shortly after they must have jerked the jerk's microphone or closed the bar doors. I recommend a room on the west side of the hotel. The bathroom is luxurious with a water-wasting, water-fall shower that you can't avoid. They charge $9.95 a day for wireless access, so I walked my iPad across the street to the Apple Store in the mall where service was free in a generous public lobby. There was no wine opener in the room so we requested Valet parking to get one out of my glove box. Later that day house-keeping delivered two more an hour apart. The neighborhood streets are crumbling and appear to have never been swept. The Macy's sidewalk entrance windows are scratched with Graffitti. Yet Sofitel draws lots of foreign tourists. We heard Russian, Italian and Aussie spoken in and around the hotel. I'm sure at these prices you can find a better hotel in a better location. Try nearby Beverly Hills. For those using Cedars Sinai, I recommend it. If you are a tourist coming to LA for to the Beach, try staying further west in Santa Monica or Marina del Rey. Or futher south in Orange County.

The hotel also has a very well hidden outdoor pool, which although it only has a very limited number of sunbeds (about 12!) was very refreshing after a days sightseeing and also had free drinking water and a waiter drinks service. Restaurant and bar were very nice and very 'trendy' (bar full of young pretty things both Friday and Saturday night) but was also fairly expensive for the location - the covered outside seating area was lovely and heated by both patio heaters and firepit - but you couldn't get a seat at the weekend.

This was unexpected, and very very kind. If I can only pass one commnent, watch the drinks and \"extras\" prices.

The hotel is beautiful and I found all of the staff to be welcoming, courteous and friendly. So far... so good... then I got to the room. Hey, I'm from New York so I understand cramped spaces but ...really??? The room was teeny.. Now had the tiny room been CLEAN, I would not have complained...but the tiny room had what I like to refer to as a \"film\" or a \"coating\"... a certain \"ick\" factor that I could live without. Maybe they thought the flickering light by the door would make the stains on the carpet hard to see but I could still see them. Or maybe the electrical shock noise coming from the flickering light made was supposed to dry up the two WET SPOTS in the carpet...but it didn't... SIDEBAR: Those spots remained wet my entire 5 days stay. In fact I would not be surprised if the front desk called up each morning to confirm the re-wetting of these spots, because we kept the heat all the way turned up in an attempt to dry the spots and dry they did not.

I can't say the noise from the club downstairs bothered us like I read about in other reviews (I stayed on the 3rd floor) and I didn't have a problem bringing my cousin back to the room with us several times throughout the day (which was also a concern since a review said they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring people upstairs) The only other point I would make is, be prepared to spend money if you want to eat in this place. The food is yummy but it should be, it was the best $8.00 cup of tea I've ever had. ...

The room its self is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smallish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if you were to pace it out. However, with a cleaver use of mirrors coupled with the use of light pastoral colours in the d\u00c3\u00a9cor you never feel cramped. The bathroom is wonderful and the bed is a great place to fall into after a big day down town. As a first time visitor to LA the geography of the place takes a bit of getting use to. In other words, the concept of walking anywhere in LA is unknown to almost everybody (including hotel staff.) Every direction based question is meet with the finishing refrain of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 best to catch a cab..\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Public transport is never even mentioned. We were meet with quizzical looks of amazement by the staff when we said that we had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the Farmers Market that day.. We later found out the reason for the looks of wonder. Despite its body beautiful reputation, apparently, only hobos and the criminally insane walk in LA. Concierge was every bit as professional as the rest of the staff. The Stone Rose lounge is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hollywood moody\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with its mix of red and black and a great place to have a drink before dinner, and it is dinner, breakfast and lunch where this hotel excels! In other words their restaurant Simon LA is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153must eat at!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My wife and I ate there often in the evening and had breakfast there every morning. No matter the time, the staff is always happy to see you. In the morning we were asked if \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had a good night?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And in the evenings we were asked: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what we had done during the day?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They really made you feel as if you were welcome. In a lot of hotels it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the hotel that makes you feel as if they are doing you a favour by providing you with a bed and a meal for the night-not so the Sofitel LA nor Simon LAs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 A couple of things that struck us about Simon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where, when you sit down of evening, water arrives, and then a complementary bread basked is served. Now, this is a practice that has sadly died out in most Australian restaurants around the drawn of the last ice-age. For a complementary bread basket it was a substantial offering of crisp breads and rolls that would have drawn a main course price tag in most restaurants we have eaten at. This one small jester by our host demonstrates their commitment to hospitality and putting the guest at the centre of the evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities. There is a misnomer about America and American cuisine in particular, it being that America is: the land the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vegetable forgot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only contribution to the dining plates of the world is ground beef sandwiched between two sweetened buns. So much more is happening in the kitchen of Simon LA! Whether you pick the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153roasted young beats\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hamachi crudo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd each of the dishes is prepared with aplomb by a kitchen crew at the top of their game and delivered by a floor staff every bit in sync with the direction the restaurant wants to head. I can also highly recommend the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meatloaf\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brick roasted chicken\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or anyone of the wafer light pizzas (we had them all.) The cool sophisticated surroundings, matched by the great service of a wonderful meal was a great way to end a day in LA. As far as breakfast was concerned the stand out for me was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tortilla wrap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the light egg matched with the spicy chorizo sausage and the lovely hot dipping sauce was a real wake up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153LA style.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We also received a complimentary Danish pastries for breakfast. Here again a lovely touch. So after all that is the Sofitel LA perfect? No. One small example, the remote control for the clock radio in the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working ( flat battery or something.)I asked if someone could take a look? Yes of course right away. Five days later as we checked out, the remote control still wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. This is nothing more than the tiniest of fly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in what was on the hole a wonderful ointment of hospitability and service that the Sofitel LA tries to apply liberally to all its guests. Would we stay there again?

When we got there, we told them it is our 10 year anniversary and that we would love to get a suite and will pay the difference. We were told there are no suites available and were given the key to our deluxe room. We went upstairs to find our deluxe room to be TINY!!! No bath tub, just a shower and small!!! We called downstairs saying we would really like a larger toom and that we will pay the difference at which point they said they have a suite but for $300 extra a night (total $550/night). No problem, we take it. We get to our suite (very average and againon the smaller side) and we call for champagne glasses to open our specail bottle, they show up with a bucket of ice and glasses and they have a bill for $4.39!!!! Any other half decent hotel would send something up to the room of a couple who are spending their 10th anniversary there but no, not even a fruit bowl and we have a bill for glasses??? A few other things also happened, little, but showcased how the service is lacking. When leaving, I asked to speak to the manager and told her how disappointed we were at the service and she offered to take the charge off, wait for this.... for the glasses!!!! I was like \" it is not a matter of four bucks, we paid $550 a night, we are not fussing over four dollars but the poor service\". She did not even begin to get it. Poor poor service.

The cleaning service was great, we never saw them but the whole hotel was in great condition. (free bottles of water ever night aswell) The men working on valet and door service are great , if you need a taxi one will be there in less that 2 minutes, no joke!! The Location is great, right across the road from the Beverly Centre , CVS pharmacy , resturants ( P.F Changs is a MUST), Robertson Blvd is only a 10-15 minute walk away. Although as LA is very spread out you must drive to all major attractions like Hollywood blvd , etc . Which is like a 10 minute drive. The one downside to the hotel is that room service is over-priced for what you get, i would recommend running over to the beverly centre and get take out ! Over all this hotel is great , i would definitely recommend it to a friend and I will be returning in the very near future. Tourist Tip- do as many tours as you can it will be unforgettable , but the shopping in L.A isn't great unless your loaded .

We were made to feel very welcome there even though we had booked our room through Hotwire. Our request for a high room was also met. We got a room on the 9th floor that faced the Beverly Center. So we didn't experience any disturbances from party noises from the bar as some other reviewers mentioned. The room itself was very lovely and clean. I loved its modern classic decor! While the beds were a little too soft for our taste, we still found them comfortable and slept very well in them. The bathroom was spacious enough and also very clean. We loved the L'Occitane amenities and also the fact that the toilet flushed very quietly :-). Its location was also ideal to our planned activities so that was another plus. We went to the nearby King's Road Cafe, which was very good, for breakfast once and ate twice at the in-house restaurant, Simon LA, once for breakfast and once for lunch. We had wanted to order room service for the breakfast but found that it was much, much better value eating at the restaurant itself. The food and service was excellent both times.

After a short and polite complaint they offered us an upgraded room on a higher floor and on the north side, which id a great mark of their service, and the roon was excellent. Only slight disappointment was the bar, it was overly large and dark, the range of beer in particular was poor, and the service was relatively lacking.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Petoskey, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Nice Room, but some weird service issues......\u201d", "Author": "dre51", "ReviewID": "UR43126813", "Content": "We stayed here since it's just a few block from our daughter's new apartment in the Beverly/Fairfax area and we wanted to stay at a really nice place after five days of driving cross country. Plus side: #1. Location is great, right across from the Beverly Center and convenient to everything. #2. The room, though smallish, was beautiful, with plush bedding and swanky furnishings. The shower is large and the view was too cool - the Hollywood sign gleaming in the distance. The air conditioning is quiet and efficient, and the balcony doors really open! #3. The bar, though pricey, is worth it just to hang out on the over stuffed sofas and chairs. #4. Outstanding fitness center! Excellent equipment. Negative side: #1. Turn down service offered too early - on two nights the housekeeping staff showed up for turn down around 5PM when we were still getting ready to go out. On BOTH occasions, we said, \"Can you please come back later?\" They never did, so we didn't get fresh towels either night. #2. Previously worn bath robe? - after a shower my husband went to the closet and put on a large, fluffy robe and reached into the pocket where he found someone's swim goggles. We could only conclude that this robe had been used by a previous occupant. We called to report the problem and a staff member came to our room and presented us with two bars of soap and some shampoo and conditioner! Huh?? We called again and they came back to the room with two bath robes and asked us to produce the swim goggles as evidence. I hope some poor housekeeper didn't get flogged with them.... #3. Valet took our car out and left it sitting in the driveway - our daughter picked us up in her own car and as we were leaving I noticed our car sitting next to the Valet stand with all the windows rolled down. My husband asked them why our car was there and they said we had called for it. Obviously we had not. We asked them to put it back. To their credit, they didn't charge us for one night's parking.

We usually stay in budget (Holiday Inn Express or Best Western) level hotels, because we're not in the room much, but since it was a special occasion and we were staying for 5 nights, we spent the extra money and treated ourselves. The door, front desk, conceirge and valet service from the time we pulled up in a cab to the time we left in our rental car was great and very friendly. I have several complaints that might seem a little nit-picky, but they did effect our experience. First off, we reserved their \"superior\" room which I guess is the smallest room they have and the smallness was uncomfortable. The room was nicely decorated and the bathroom was cool and the bed super comfy, but because the bed is a platform bed and because the room is small and they put a chair at the end of the bed, I left there with a huge bump and bruise on my left shin and one on my right calf from banging into the corner of the bed. Nice look with a cocktail dress for a wedding.... I found it very annoying - and painful. Two weeks later I still have the bruises. The shower is a rain shower, which is incredibly relaxing and I loved it, but again it's the little things that make the difference. It was nearly impossible to shave one's legs in the shower because it's a stall shower and there is no foot rest, which might seem like a petty thing, but any woman over 35 knows what I mean. Finally, they have the duvet thing going on. I don't understand the obsession with duvets these days, because you have a choice of being hot or cold with nothing in between. So, in the Sofitel on the bed they have a bottom sheet and a duvet. No sheet in between your body and the duvet. I hope they clean them everytime someone checks out. So, because I'm always hot and my husband is always cold, we did not sleep well that first night. The second day we called housekeeping, but you can't talk to housekeeping, only the front desk and asked for a top sheet in addition to the bottom sheet and duvet. We got a scratchy blanket. It was too late to do anything that night, so another uncomfortable night. Third day we asked for a top sheet, no blanket and received another blanket. We called again and asked for a top sheet and have the 3 blankets taken away. The housekeeper showed up with 2 more blankets. At least this time we could explain what we wanted and the poor woman had to strip the bed and add the top sheet. After that we were comfortable and slept well. On the positive side, we requested by email and were given a room with a view of the hills and the hotel was really very quiet. For service (except for passing messages along to housekeeping), location and amenities, I give this hotel two thumbs up.

If management do read this, they should be extremely happy with the service their staff provide. As an A Club Gold holder; a bottle of bubbly and chocolate dipped strawberries was waiting in the room, which had also been upgraded. Room was superb, view of the Hollywood sign and hills, the perfect Sofitel Bed, Bose radio, HDTV, rain shower etc. Turndown service at night left bottles of Evian but this fell short of my experience at the Sofitel New York where classical music was playing, curtains drawn, chocolates on bed and water. Ate at Simon LA twice, great service and beautiful fillet mignon. Also had breakfast everyday, which was typical Sofitel.

The public areas of the hotel are beautiful. Very sleek and modern. The staff on reception were extremely professional and very helpful. There is no free wireless internet in the hotel but there are free computers to use at the business centre and in the gym. The room was great - clean, well appointed, spacious and with a very nice bathroom. Only odd thing was the very loud echo in the bathroom, it was like being in a tunnel. Let's just say you can hear everything nicely amplified in the bedroom... People have mentioned the restaurant/bar area and the \"night club\" noise. I was there for 3 nights (including weekend) and it was empty... so I don't know where the club was going on. The pool area is on the rooftop of the second floor and is small. The pool is a great temperature though, just perfect for me as I often find outdoor pools a little chilly. There were nice loungers and the poolside service was good. Only complaint is that as it's on the second floor, there is a lot of noise from the street below so it takes away from the relaxation. Not much the hotel can do about this I guess. The fitness centre in the hotel is remarkable, really one of the best gyms I've seen in a hotel ever. They also provide free bottles of evian and chilled towels. Really well done. My only real complaint about this hotel is the parking. There is no self-park option so you are forced to use the Valet service which is VERY expensive at almost $30 a day.

It is only good for standing on to see what the weather is like. The negatives I found were that it is walking distance from the Beverly Center but nothing else. And there are homeless beggars all around the hotel so if you want to walk anywhere be prepared to deal with them. And the Beverly Center is such a blas\u00c3\u00a9 shopping mall it does really adds nothing to the hotel. The real great shopping is in the Rodeo Dive area in Beverly Hills which is only 10 minutes away but you have to drive. So if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind calling your car up from valet parking, driving 10 minutes and then finding parking in the Rodeo Drive area, this world not present a problem for you.

I could not redeem them for bottled water, a Coke or Sprite. The waitress said I could get Champaign or some other alcoholic drink but nothing else. So since I do not drink alcohol I just tossed the tickets. I have no idea why the hotel puts this limitation on its free drinks but it really offended me. Do I ended up just tossing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free alcoholic drink\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tickets. Now would I stay there again? I cannot say I would. I like a hotel where I can walk out the front door and be in the center of everything.

At first I thought the \"hallway revelry\" was due to some particularly unruly guests, and then realized that poor soundproofing was at the heart of the problem as merely closing a door somewhere down the hall sounded like slamming. Another strange contradiction - the bedding is obviously very high-end, but relatively hard (i.e. it's a futon) so it's great for those who think firm beds are better and a tough go if you like soft beds. A major plus - the location could not be better. Within easy walking distance of outstanding shopping and dining, it is ideal for those who like to be able to enjoy city amenities on foot rather than always having to drive.

Coming from a Four Seasons hotel, it was a definite downgrade. Our expectations weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too high given the fact that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not spending that much on our stay in this hotel, however given this is still a four star hotel, and ranked #11 for L.A. on Trip Advisor we thought it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too bad. Bell Boys: As soon as I stepped out of the cab I overheard the bell boy complaining to his fellow worker \u00e2\u20ac\u0153man these bags are heavy!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Well, I dragged them all by myself through 3 different airports and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a size 6 woman! Lobby & Front Desk: I wandered around the lobby while my husband was checking us in. The tables had finger prints all over them and the black, supposedly cool, surfaces didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look that clean. The flowers weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fresh, and the carpets were too worn out. Before giving us the room keys the front desk lady asked someone to go do a final check on the room. Why would they do that in front of the guests? Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they supposed to have the room ready well before the guests are about to check in? This makes it seem like the housekeeping doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always do their jobs thoroughly and that someone has to check after their work. Room & hallways: When the elevator opened its doors to the floor our room is in, I smelled something was off. When I got into the room I thought this is definitely some really strong detergent trying to cover a very unpleasant smell, like an old carpet that has been puked on and cleaned way too many times. To my horror, when I took off my shoes I stepped on a wet spot of the carpet. I hate dark full carpets in hotel rooms in the first place, only God knows what sorts of germs guests leave in them, let alone one that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wet in patches. I thought there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no way I was gonna be able to stay in that room too much longer, so we went straight back to the front desk and requested another room telling them that the reason was because it smelled. The front desk was very apologetic, kind and helpful and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to give us another room right away. We took the key to try out the other room, which was in a lower floor but slightly larger. The smell wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at least something you might get used to if you stayed for long enough. Bathroom: The shower didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drain very well. I had to get off after 15 minutes or else the water would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve overflown. I reported this the next morning and it was fixed during the day while we were out. All toiletries I expected were available, including nail-filers which not many hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to provide. Bed: The bed didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look too welcoming. The sheets were yellowish, and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that feel of crisp new white sheets that I so look forward to in hotels. However, I did sleep throughout the night, so nothing about the bed bothered me during my sleep. Breakfast: The breakfast was included in our stay, which I think was well worth it. It was a menu breakfast instead of a buffet, but you could order anything you wanted for $50/person. Anything beyond that would be charged. However we ate there comfortably for 3 mornings and it never exceeded $50. The breakfast staff of the restaurant were friendly and the service was fast. I loved the food too, everything was fresh and good quality. Concierge: The concierge didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know to suggest things to do to our liking. I asked what was there to do in L.A. besides shopping (it was still too early for nightlife), he pointed out a few museums but that was it. When we asked where the best spot would be to take a good picture of the Hollywood sign he showed a corner on the map, we marked it on our navigation and drove there, but then decided to get closer to the sign and found out there are a dozen better places for a picture! Lost & Found: On the last day while I was packing my bags I realized that I was missing a jacket, I thought I must\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve left it in the first room that was too stinky to stay in. So I called the Lost & Found and asked if there was a jacket left in that room, they said yes and brought it right away. Then I though what if I completely forgot that jacket, would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve they called me to inform that I might have forgotten an item in a room that I checked into before? We stayed there for four nights, I forgot the jacket on the first night, and they neglected informing me about it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve forgotten a jacket in a dorm room after a semester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end in collage and they called me afterwards so that I could claim it. This is a four star hotel! The hotel was trying too hard to be cool with the style and furnishing but at the bottom of it it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just stinky and not very well maintained which only makes it look cheap. A wide flat screen TV is not the solution to a modern hotel. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in another Sofitel Hotel before, and that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that great either, so I guess this will put an end to our stays in Sofitel.", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, California", "Title": "\u201cGood location and excellent service.

The hotel staff were fairly helpful and changed our room, however the first room they switched us to had the same problem, since we were still facing the street.

First of all, the hotel staff was gracious enough to give us adjacent rooms and not just rooms on the same floor. The rooms were very spacious, spotless clean, and equipped with all the amenities you could ask for. The bathroom was equally spacious and the supplies replenished without the need to ask. The service from the reception desk and the concierge are exceptional. To give you a few examples: My husband had paid for a laptop at one of the stores but did not have the time to go pick it up; they did it for us and had it delivered to our room. I had seen a video camera that I liked at the same shop but did not remember the exact model. The concierge took the time to search the website of the store I was talking about, scanned all the models until I recognized the one I had liked, and sent out and got it for me. It was again delivered to the room on the same day. This came at a price, but with the short period of time we had at LA, every second counted. At one point, when we came down late one morning, and my elderly mother discovered that the coffee stand at the lobby was shut down, the front desk manager took the time to prepare her a cup in person and bring it over to her while we were waiting for a tour pick up. Everytime we entered the hotel, the staff greeted us with a smile, asking if we were having a good time and if there was anything they could do to make our stay more enjoyable. Also, we had stayed at the Renaissance for a couple of days before that, and while the location was exceptional and the view of the hills and the Hollywood sign an unexpected bonus, the staff there was snobbish and extremely unfriendly. The staff courteous, friendly and efficient attitude at the Sofitel was like a breeze of fresh air. The location was also superb with lots of restaurants, shopping areas, and sights within walking distance. I had such agood time there, that I was really sorry we had only booked a couple of nights and had to leave to San Diego. On a next visit to LA, this is where I will stay and this is the hotel I will be recommending to friends.

Only received one complimentary drink voucher (normally receive two) and when brought this to their attention a second was delivered. Our room was very small but with a great view over the Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood sign, but very very small. My husband went back down and complained and we were moved to a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the Beverly Centre shopping centre, not as good a view but certainly a much bigger room. The Sofitel never disappoints and the service is consistent with other Sofitel hotels we have stayed in around the world. The beds were extremely comfortable and all facilities in the bathroom including robes and slippers were of the normal Sofitel Standard. Again free internet and complimentary water were given. The Stone Bar (Cindy Crawfords husband designed it) was a happening place at night, a bit too noisy for us late in the night but a great place to have a drink before heading out at night, try and get one of the little booths outside and if not then a table outside. Check out the outside fire place with the dry ice - incredible at night >The breakfasts were reasonably priced for Hotel standard and of a good standard, we had exceptional service the first day but the second day we had to chase up our meal twice, not good, however, the Restaurant Manager apologised and this meal was given to us complimentary, so couldn't complain. >The concierge staff were very good,in particular arranging a Mustang Convertible car for us for one day with very short notice and the staff were always pleasant and very helpful. >This is a good central hotel for visitors as the public transport system (if you need it) is accessible out the front, the Farmers Markets and Grove Shopping Centre are about a $8.00 - $10.00 cab trip down the road, or a bus trip and you can also get a bus to Santa Monica from outside in the Street ( you need to change buses). The renovations have been completed to a modern contemporary standard and we would stay at this hotel again. > Lots of good restaurants around including the newly opened Gordon Ramsay \"The London\" In West Hollywood, again about $8.00 cab fare from the hotel.. We had dinner there (about two months after it opened) and the food was excellent, very small portion sizes so if you have the al carte you might want to order four or five courses. The Service could have been better and overall the restaurant was not up to the standard of his New York one, but it was a dining experience, a little more laid back style - but no Candy Trolley - which was exceptional in the New york Resturant Not far from the Hotel is \"The Ivy\" restaurant and the Concierge staff can normally get you a reservation, whilst we did not eat there on this trip (2006 was enough as the food was fine but the service not great and their attitude was poor and quite agressive if you felt the service didnt warrant a huge tip) if you want to see the Paparazzi in action this is the street to be in,.

There was no noise from other guests, just the road but that's enough to keep you up at night. If you're lucky, maybe you can be moved to another room.

There's free internet at the gym, so depending on your purpose for using the internet you can avoid the WiFi fee.

The only thing against the hotel ais: it's location - there's really nothing other than the Beverley Centre nearby. Even finding cheap evening food choices for a family was difficult. We did eventually find a wonderful Thai cafe with the BEST egg-rolls we've ever had (and in Sydney Thai restaurants are a time a dozen). The Beverley Centre was good for a bit of quick shopping which was all we had time for in a 48h stopover which included Universal Studios. Getting to Universal on public transport was EASY and took less than an hour! We took the 25c bus right outside the hotel to Hollywood/Highland then 1 stop on the redline. The shuttle up the hill came quickly. The 25c bus took us through West Hollywood, up the strip etc so was a good little sightsee! The only other hotels we considered were the Hilton Universal (a Club room) and the Beverley Garland.

Let me start by saying that I live in L.A. all my life (37 years) and have seen many hotel both in L.A. and around the country. The Sofitel is a very modern, upscale hotel since the remodel. Everything from the lobby accents to the rooms are polished to a high sheen. Check in was easy as was check out. We used several meeting rooms while there and the catering service was outstanding. Food was top notch and the service always came with a smile. Actually, that theme spread throughout the hotel. I have to say I was not expecting a hotel in this area to have such a friendly, outgoing staff. Everyone who worked there greeted me as I walked by. They really made you feel welcome. We had over 50 people in town for our meetings from around the country and those I spoke to gave grand reviews. I think the location is very good. You have the Beverly Center just South for shopping and a lot of food and entertainment within walking distance. You're close enough to the Sunset Strip to jump a short cab ride to get there but far enough to stay away from it if you don't want to be right in the thick of Hollywood. It's L.A. so things are a little pricey but you do get the best. Room service was delicious. The bar/lounge is very cool. Wed night is the big night at the Stone Rose lounge. It gets BEYOND packed. The only note I would make if I returned would be to get a room on the South side of the hotel. There is a school as other reviewers have mentioned. It's located on the North side of the hotel where my room was. I had to be up early for meetings anyway but the noise from the school on weekday mornings could be an issue for anyone who wished to sleep in.

The 4 of us had 2 SoFab suites (each suite is 850-sq.ft. big). The spacious room and upscale amenities made our stay so wonderful that we just didn't want to leave. I was most impressed by the newly renovated bathroom which was totally amazing with a big patterned glass window that looked out to the bedroom & you could watch TV while taking a shower, or you could turn on a switch and the glass would become frosted so it's not transparent any more. The shower stall had a hand-held shower or you could use the less powerful but nice big round ceiling shower. The 2 suites had different lay-outs & the spacious bathroom in Suite 921 had 4 shower heads so a couple can easily and comfortably take a shower at the same time. Valet parking was great and we never had to wait for more than 5 minutes for our car. Overnight parking was $29 per day (pretty expensive but OK in Beverly Hills) but there were always at least 2 people around you and at your service. They did make us feel like Royalties. Opposite the hotel near the gas station on N. La Cienega Blvd. there was a DASH bus to Hollywood Blvd (Kodak Theatre, Mann's (Grauman's) Theatre) and each journey was 25 cents (10 cents for senior). When we arrived at Kodak Theatre we found out that we could park the car there for 4 hours for only $2 as long as we bought something from the Theatre shops (even a coffee would do). I didn't recall reading about the cheap parking from other travellers, otherwise we would have taken our car there so my parents didn't need to wait for the bus that ran every 15-20 minutes. Sign up online to eat at Todai Japanese Buffet ($5 off) in Beverly Centre opposite the hotel. It's yummy! We ate in Todai in Planet Hollywood Hotel in Las Vegas and it was great! It's free to sign up online to become a Sofitel Privilege member, you'll get a free drink (champagne, wine, cocktail, etc.) each day during your stay from one of the bars. The business centre at the hotel near the check-in counter was the best as there were 3 computers for guests to use and they were all connected to a nearby printer. Internet access & printing service were all free of charge. We did our web check-in easily and printed out our boarding passes with no problems. We bought two 2-litre bottled soda for $2 at the gas station opposite the hotel. One bottle was $1.79 & $2 for 2. So we bought 2 bottles and left the unopened one at the hotel for staff to consume should they choose to. Buy a map with locations of famous Movie Stars' homes & it also provided you with driving directions to get close to the spectacular 50-ft. high \"Hollywood\" sign viewed from Deronda Dr. This is basically the only problem we found while staying in the hotel: Please be aware of the kids' noise early in the morning as the hotel was opposite a daycare or elementary school. Kids' activities took place in the school yard early in the morning and we got waken up as early as 8 a.m. as our rooms were facing the side street. The location of the hotel was great as it`s close to L.A. airport (20 minutes`drive even in morning rush hour) and it`s close to Hollywood, Santa Monica, Griffith Observatory (where you can see L.A. from the hilltop) and they were all within 30-minute drive from the hotel.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, VA", "Title": "\u201cFun, Stylish Hotel\u201d", "Author": "traveldudey", "ReviewID": "UR14529892", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel a few times while traveling on business to LA, most recently in Jan. 2008.

Sit at the sushi bar, toss the menu and let the chef feed you. Be prepared to pay $75 per person if you go all out but it's worth every penny.

Our room was a suite on the penthouse (10th floor) level. The living room featured a flat screen TV, Bose sound system and a spacious balcony overlooking the Beverly Center and a view of the downtown skyline. The bedroom featured floor to ceiling windows with electric shades, a very comfortable bed, chaise and another flat screen TV. The bathroom was enormous with separate roman tub, glass enclosed rainfall shower, closet and well lit vanity area. When returning to our room after dinner, the maid had prepared the bed, and left water, cookies, chocolates and a personal welcome note from the manager. These are the unexpected touches that we will remember for a long time. The next morning we ate a delicious breakfast in the hotel restaurant where we sat outside on the terrace under sunny blue skies. We were sad to leave as we felt so welcomed and were treated like royalty. The location is perfect, an easy drive from LAX in under 30 minutes (take La Cienega all the way from LAX to the hotel).

The bed was so comfortable we almost didn't want to leave it! Extra thick down/feather pad and four pillows of assorted firmnesses topped off with a wonderful down comforter. Perfect. The shower was another treat, a rainhead ( I think that's what they are named ) and a window that you could see through to the bedroom but also with the flip of a switch became opaque for privacy. Big jetted bathtub as well. If you go be sure to have a drink at the bar downstairs Stone Rose ~ later in the evening it is very busy and lots of fun. The outdoor patio has wonderful couches that give the feeling of privacy. There is also a nice fire pit to sit around. We had a wonderful meal the hotel's restaurant Simon LA, on the patio, but wish we would have paid more attention when ordering the seafood appetizer which was priced pp. making it kind of expensive. But there was plenty of lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams and oysters ~ delicious as were our various entrees, especially the seared tuna. The fitness area is well done with free weights, cardio and weight equipment. The hotel provides headphones, water bottles, fruit and cool damp towels scented w/mint. We also went to the spa, I had the Ideal facial ( with Vanessa) which was nearly the best facial I've ever had. My friend had a massage and said it was great. They start the spa experience off with tea and a foot soak, very relaxing. You can access the steam bath and shower as a guest of the hotel even if you don't have a spa treatment.

The room is laid out like a rectangle with a large and a small triangle both cut diagonally at the top corners. The large triangle is the bathroom, which was very large for a hotel bath, with a fully glass-enclosed rainfall shower, vanity and toilet. The small triangle is the step-in closet. There are two sets of French doors leading out onto a tiny balcony (about as deep as a shoe), but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a nice touch. The bed was one of those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kings; my 6\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feet reached all the way to the end. But the bed was very soft and comfy with plenty of pillows. It you like a very firm bed, it will likely be too soft for you. There was good lighting on either side of the bed for readers. Also in the room were two small dressers (one doubled as a nightstand), a chaise, and a desk on wheels. It was a little cramped to fit that much furniture in, but not overly so. The room is advertised as having a plasma TV, but it was actually a LCD. Still a very nice TV. The alarm clock does have an adaptor for your mp3 player, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very obvious. The bathroom had good lighting (which took a few minutes to figure out with multiple position rocker/dimmers). There is a phone next to the toilet, for those who need to be connected at all times. The TV sound can also be played into the bathroom, if you want to hear the TV as you get ready. The water pressure was good also \u00e2\u20ac\u201c too much for my hubby, who would have preferred a bit less in the shower. The sink has a small towel rack next to it, and a shaving/makeup mirror that can be used at the sink, or from in the shower (through the glass wall). The huge shower is stone/tile with a small built-in bench, a shelf for toiletries, and a photoelectric window that looks out over the bed into the room. Flip the switch and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opaque, flip it again and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear. We had much fun, flipping the switch back and forth, and it was nice to shower with a view of the Hollywood Hills. Amenities: The closet had 2 Frette robes, 2 pairs of slippers, padded lingerie hangers, a well made shoe horn, and safe that can fit a laptop. I thought the slippers were a nice touch, even if I was a little put off about the idea of wearing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153used\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd slippers. The closet also had a terrific sewing kit (the Queen of all amenities!) In the bath was a small canister of cotton puffs and Q-tips. There were plenty of fluffy towels, and the usual array of soap, shampoo, and body lotion, all Roget and Gallet brand. There is a hairdryer in a small cubby in the vanity, which was nice as it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take up excess counter space. Also in the bathroom was a loofah mitt in a sealed package. I thought it was a little silly until I wore an adhesive bra out for the evening and had to scrub off the excess adhesive the next morning! There is high speed internet, but you have to pay $10 a day for it. That seems a little steep when most low-end motels are now offering free wifi. My computer savvy husband was able to find an unsecured network easily, so if you have some computer skill, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to pay. The mini-bar was well stocked, although crazy expensive, as most mini-bars are. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try to get anything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve left behind at the hotel gift shop. They sell everything in the room, from the soap, to the robes, to the lamps, to the sheets, to the mattress, but not a toothbrush or bottle of aspirin. There is, however, a 24-hour drugstore/chemist's right around the corner for your every need. Staff: The staff were all very polite and helpful, but we still had a few small snags. Although I specifically asked for a Hollywood Hills view when I made my reservation, at first we were given a room that would have faced the Beverly Center. (Be sure to get a Hollywood Hills view, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much nicer.) We also asked at check-in for 4:00PM check-out on our last day, but when we got the new room the request didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to go with it, so on our last morning we had a chambermaid trying to get into our room while we were still in bed. A call to the front desk straightened it out quickly, but it was a bit of a hassle. The first night we stayed, I wanted to watch a pay movie, but their system was down. I called the front desk and someone was supposed to call back when it was fixed, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad they never did, as we went to sleep at midnight. We were skipped for turndown service one night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not a major issue as I know how to take the decorator pillow and throw off the bed. The valet stand always seemed like no one knew what was going on, but the car was always waiting for us as soon as we called down. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not made very clear that parking is $26/day, but given the location you really have no other choice. All-in-all, very small snags, and I certainly will be staying at the Sofitel again.", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cthe outstanding sofitel!!\u201d", "Author": "tre_12", "ReviewID": "UR8524525", "Content": "I have just got back to england from 3 wonderful nights at the sofitel LA.

Sofitel took a beautiful French-style comfortable and reasonable hotel and turned it into an exorbitantly overpriced, hideous post-modern house for their nightclub and spa, with all the charm of the Cultural Revolution. They've seen to every inconvenience common to the arrogance of aggressive post-modern designers. There is no lightswitch inside the door of the room; stagger around in the dark until you find one. An electric outlet (and the lamp plugged therein) didn't work; the alarm clock didn't work; none of the room's key cards worked, so I had to go all the way downstairs to get a new one from the front desk every time I went to the room. The lighting in the bathroom is harsh, extreme, poorly aimed and hard to locate and operate. My traveling partner's room was an unacceptably small, strange triangular wedge (for the same exorbitant rate as my more normal rectangular room). Her room featured a glass window over the bed, looking into the bathroom. Since when are the activities of a bathroom considered acceptable to display through a window into the bedroom? The beds are covered with huge duvet/quilts and no top sheet. One lays on what feels like a thick, floppy, supportless goosefeather pallet of some kind over a bedboard. Actually, there's a mattress under the pallet -- I ripped the pallet out of the undersheets and threw it (complete with human stains) on the floor, and extracted the quilt from the duvet cover to approximate the universal standard of a mattress with normal bedclothes. There is no sundries shop. Nothing happens if you try to get hotel services, like check-out, on the TV -- they've set the clock back twenty years by requiring a front-desk check-out. The pitch-black lobby with its hideous metal constructions is matched only by the already thread-bare carpeting in the elevators, and the aggressive and unattractive orange curley-ques of the corridor carpeting; room numbers are offset on diagonals so they can't be read until one has passed the door and inset room number.

Having seen the pictures of the outside online, I had expected the hotel to be somewhat ordinary, functional and fairly sterile. It turned out to be none of these. The hotel recently went through an 8O million dollar renovation which has turned it into a trendy, funky but stylish place - although the outside (other than the grand glass entrance) still looks plain and uninspiring. When you walk into the lobby you are warmly greeted and although it is a little gloomy you soon realise it has an interesting and unique style. There is, for example, a massive swirling steel sculpture in the centre and touches like a chair made of coins. The staff on reception are all chatty, tell you about the hotel and see you to the elevators. The hallways are bright and have a striking swirl designed carpet. The bedrooms are slightly quirky shape wise but this adds to the interest. The bathroom has no bathtub, only showers. The bathrooms are a good size and the basin is very modern, and the shower is fantastic. It has a large shower head above you so is kind of a \"wet room\" type of shower. As the bathroom has no window, there is a very clever solution as there is a large window in the shower that with a flick of a light switch makes it clear (so you can see into the bedroom and watch the TV while showering, the sound already plays in the bathroom which is something I always like). The bedrooms are not huge but have an enormous and very comfortable bed with amazingly soft pillows and high quality bed linen. There is a good sized desk to work at and internet access is about Ten Dollars. Another nice touch is the large flat screen High Definition TV. On the lobby level is an enormous bar which is trendy and attracts a hip crowd most evenings but is very busy on the weekend. The restaurant the other side is also great looking and the food pretty good. One stunning feature is the large fitness centre. This has loads of great equipment, is stylish and has nice touches like free bottles of water, fruit, internet access stations and even chocolate brownies as a treat for working out. The meeting facilities are good and team very helpful. I would love to stay here again. Not only for the hotel but a brilliant location with Beverly Mall opposite and seemingly zillions of very good places to eat around (every night we had some celebrity at a table next to us).

The rooms are really nice and the atmosphere perfect. You get a feeling of high quality but not too stuffy, plenty of good customer service, great concierge and fantastic waiter service.

Once, there was no one at the door and one of the valets saw me coming and RAN to open it for me. We had breakfast at Simon 5 or 6 times and it was excellent each time. They serve excellent french press coffee (i'm a terrible coffee snob). One morning I asked for a new cup as I had let my coffee turn lukewarm. Instead, I got an entire fresh new pot of french press. Once they forgot the avocado in my omelet and rushed out an entire plate of avocado. They also let us sit forever on the sunny mornings. We also had dinner and drinks at Simon/Stone Rose - the scene is a little too much but the food was excellent. Best thing to order is off the menu: it's the Iron Chef Burger. Tiny, perfect burger; fries with truffle oil, and a little milkshake. don't miss it. The fitness center was clean and open from 5am (helpful when you're on a shoot). They also provided bottles of evian, chilled towels, and brownies or muffins; internet access and computers; and headphones. a pretty complete place to hang out. the spa has very nice treatments - I did a facial and a massage - though it is very pricey. I'm from new york and this compares to the priciest spas here. however, you can't top having a massage in a relaxing setting just a couple minutes from your hotel bed. The sauna is not open yet, unfortunately, but the locker room is nice. what else? the location can't be beat. we walked to dinner many nights - not sure that's even possible in other parts of LA. also walked to shopping on the weekend. there were a couple very minor service issues along the way: the maid opened our door and came in one morning at 8:30am while we were still in bed (she apologized and quickly left) and the shampoo and conditioner were not replaced for days and I had to call housekeeping to get new ones sent up (but they came quickly). not big deals. Ok, now the bad. After we had been there 10 days with two cars parked, the front desk called up to confirm our credit card because of all the charges piling up. what charges? we asked. Oh, the $26 per day per car charge. That's $884 extra for parking the rental cars for our 17 days. I went to the front desk to speak with the manager. I don't have a problem with paying whatever needs to be paid, but I thought it was wrong we weren't told. There's no mention on the valet ticket they hand you, there's no mention in the literature in the room, there's no mention in the packet they give you at check-in, and there's no option to park in a separate lot. Instead of apologizing for not informing us of the charge and making some small gesture of good will (for example, a $25 credit to the restaurant or spa or something that wouldn't cost them much - or, god forbid, an apology) they just said \"This is LA and parking is at a premium.\" Yes, I said, I understand, I'm from New York. I don't have a problem with paying for parking, I have a problem with the hotel sneaking charges onto my credit card. It's something a less professional place would do and doesn't fit with the rest of our experience here. Anyway, it continued this way for a while, with the manager refusing to acknolwedge that we should have been told and getting increasingly more huffy. Did i mention we were there for 17 nights? In the end I paid the $884 and consoled myself with taking a few extra brownies and bottles of evian from the fitness center.

Bloomington, Minnesota, Chicago, Illinois and the one I am going to write this review about which is located in Los Angeles, California. My stay at the Sofitel in Bloomington was back in the mid-90's on a rather unremarkable business trip. The one thing that stands out in my memory is how odd I thought it was for the front desk staff (who were obviously dyed-in-the-wool Midwesterners) to be speaking with an affected French accent. The Sofitel Water Tower in Chicago is a spectacularly beautiful building that comes to a knife's edge point. And they actually made good use of this unusual architecture. I know because the suite I had there was *IN* that narrow portion of the building and it was gorgeous and eminently functional. I moved from Northern California to Orange County at the end of 2006 and have stayed at the Sofitel Los Angeles more than half a dozen times since then. The reason being that I often spend my weekends in LA proper and the drive back to Newport Beach sucks after a night of partying. But I digress. From my first stay there, I have been tremendously impressed with this property. From the well laid out carriage-way, to the polite valets, bellmen and front desk staff to the lightning quick elevators. This hotel recently underwent a $40M renovation and it really shows. The lobby is very understated and elegant. Black marble and subdued lighting. That same sort of low-key elegance is evident in the rooms as well. I have been lucky enough to stay in both of their uber-suites at either end of the top floor. Both boast gorgeous marble bathrooms with HUGE tubs and separate shower, outdoor patios with fireplaces and seating areas and voluminous sitting areas in addition to the spacious bedrooms. Both also have wide-screen high-def televisions in both the living area and bedroom and have gorgeous views of Sunset Blvd and the Hollywood hills. Those rooms are prohibitively expensive (even for someone like me who spends money like a drunken sailor) but even their standard room is a pleasure and a joy to behold. The room service is excellent, especially the hamburger and ham and cheese sandwich. Steer clear of the chicken soup which was surprisingly tasteless. I wasn't too impressed with Stone Rose despite the Rande Gerber connection. I am pretty spoiled when it comes to nightclubs and the one time I popped into Stone Rose it was WAY too crowded to be enjoyable. Simon:LA served an excellent breakfast the one time I managed to make it downstairs to eat in their dining room. I will have to try them for lunch or dinner sometime since a birthday dinner at Kerry Simon's other location in Las Vegas back in 2005 was outstanding. All in all, if you can afford it, the Sofitel LA is an exceptionally nice hotel. It is centrally located to Beverly Hills and just a short drive to the endless club and dining opportunities in Hollywood. No fake French accents here.

Our room on the 4th floor (with a view of the hills) was very well appointed and the feather bed on top of our king bed provided a great sleep. The room comes with shower only, no bath.

However, I had to make an exception this time! The Sofitel was a wonderful surprise and our standards are fairly high. We stayed at the Beverly Hilton a few weeks ago and it was nice... good food, good service, nice suite. But nothing extraordinary. We picked the Sofitel because of its close proximity to Cedar Sinai Medical Center - our destination this week (it is also right across the street from the Beverly Center, Hard Rock Cafe, and loads of other fantastic shopping locales) We did not expect much as the Sofitel is undergoing extensive remodeling (reflected in their prices I believe). The Sofitel surprised us with excellent service, immediate check-in (under 5 minutes, everything was ready, including the crib in the room with baby products inside! This is key for traveling families with nap times!), gorgeous design in the newly remodeled suites, impossibly quick room service, friendly European (usually an oxymoron in my experience!) :) hospitality all around, from the valet to the turn down service. We stayed in one of their newly remodeled suites - the design is modern, but not cold and linear. Huge framed mirrors, the most comfortable bed ever, an amazing bathroom with rain shower & soaking tub. (NOTE: as another reviewer indicated, there is a window between the shower & the bedroom - but there is also a switch that automatically frosts the glass for privacy!) And flat screen HDTV's everywhere - even the tub had a TV built into the wall. Our suite had a beautiful view of the Hollywood Hills - worth requesting. And main rooms in the suite had two sets of french doors - shallow balconies. But they are nice to look at & bring alot of light into the rooms. (Room darkening curtains are available to make your room nap-ready for the babies as in every good hotel!) Also of note: the staff seemed to be trained very well. Quick, courteous, professional. They don't even wait around for their tips - I had to chase down the room service guy to give him his tip! Best service I've ever had in California and one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at in recent memory. The overall feel of the place reminded me of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas - but with much better service. The Sofitel looked like an ordinary hotel from the outside, inside (in spite of the remodeling) it reminded me of some very upscale boutique hotels that cater mostly to couples or business travelers, but it turned out they Sofitel caters to whoever their guests happen to be - in our case a very young & demanding family! We requested extra blankets, pillows, duvets, wake up calls - you name it. And I give the Sofitel an A++ on every point tested! It's so refreshing to be pleasantly surprised with a hotel. My husband is never impressed (he travels the world in the best hotels), and even he agreed it was a first class experience. Oh, also, I found the best rates & the quickest service by calling them directly... and I usually book through expedia or the like.

Once in 1996, 2000 and 2005. Each time I have really enjoyed staying there. From the easy access to the Beverly Centre (across the road literally), to the amazing beds. Starting off with location - I did not hire a car in Los Angeles and didn't need to! The Beverly Centre across the road provided many hours of shopping. In 1996 and 2000, I even walked up to Sunset to Tower Records from the Hotel. As I was traveling by myself in 2005, I felt very safe staying at the Sofitel. The hotel room doors had double locks and there were always people around in the foyer late at night. All 3 times, I have stayed on the Bev Centre side of the hotel and have had no problems with the traffic noise. My room has always been massive with plenty of space to store luggage and clothes. The room is furnished adequately with a storage cupboard to hang up clothes/ items and a large chest of drawers for other clothes. The bathroom was very clean and had plenty of light. Room Service was also very good and punctual. (I had room service every time I have stayed there) and the vanilla cr\u00c3\u00a8me brule for dessert was AMAZING! I had a slight problem with check-in the last time I stayed there, but nothing that wasn't able to be sorted out. Note - if you book online through sofitel.com or other sites, be sure to bring a printed copy of your booking information (they tried to charge me hotel tax twice!). Thankfully, I had a printed copy of the reservation with me to show that I had paid the total rate online. A downside of the hotel is that it's a bit expensive to stay here and the rooms are looking their age slightly.

My room was a standard King room facing the hills. Great view. The room was very clean (what's with all these people finding dirt?) A good size desk (could have brighter lighting for it), comfortable armchair and table, good size closet with iron and ironing board, nice new in-room safe, and a very cosy bed (which a number of people have remarked about).

Got this hotel through a priceline bid. Was pleasantly surprised that its not just for business travelers! Great location far enough away from the French Quarter to avoid the crowds and noise at night, but close enough to walk down, enjoy it then go back to your nice hotel room.Over a two week trip this is the only hotel we stayed in where I used the gym and hot tub.Staff was helpful with directions and suggestions. Room was huge! There is no free breakfast, but you can buy theres for around $10. Skip it though, the day we went it was really crowded so the service suffered. NOT the fault of the staff, thats just the way it is. Besides, go out and eat with the locals and the Trolley Stop Cafe or the Coffee PotAlso after two weeks of hotels, this was the first one to have computers in the lobby with free internet access!Loved everything about this place!", "Date": "Dec 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR247082012", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "arizona_8"}, {"Content": "Very nice stay in the Big Easy Our stay was a pleasant one.

The hotel is only two short blocks from the convention center, near a trolley that will take you to the French Quarter (for $1.25 exact change), and if you don't mind a little walk, the hotel isn't far from Canal Street. Overall our stay was comfortable. We decided on this hotel because, of the options we were given by the conference organizers, the Courtyard had the best parking rates and offered free Internet access. A softball team had rooms not far from ours and liked to sit outside their rooms and chat in the hallway, but the parents and chaperones must have terrific because by bedtime, the kids were quiet. We thought perhaps the hotel was having trouble maintaining an adequate staffing level, because housekeeping made no effort to refresh our room during our stay, though they very kindly complied when we asked for specific services -- such as fresh towels. I also could not access guest services on the television to check my daily charges. When I called about my inability to access guest services, I was told that the system was down temporarily -- but it was down all week. It turns out the housekeeping staff probably didn't even know we were there, and guest services wasn't available for us because we weren't officially guests of the hotel, according to the hotel's computers. The conference organizers mistakenly made three reservations for me, and in trying to eliminate the extra reservations, the desk manager ended up clearing all of my reservations. The mistake wasn't caught until I checked out. The manager who straightened it all out was terrific and I really appreciated her attitude. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again -- but I'd make sure they knew I was there! ;}", "Date": "Aug 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR155230717", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "makalu"}, {"Content": "The Big Easy Was in New Orleans for a convention.

We arrived to find that the hotel had accepted people from the street into the parking garage and had no empty spaces for our vehicle. Not only this, but their was no parking for a mile. We ended up parking and then walking back. We checked in amidst a chaotic scene, tons of party goers (this was 4 pm) were packed in the lobby leaving no room for us to even walk.Once we got to the room, we found it very small. The bathroom was so tiny you had to just about stand on the toilet to close the door. The beds were nice, and the rooms were clean.Although you would think that for the price they were charging breakfast would be included or discounted, there was no such luck. We ended up hiking across the street to the nearest MacDonalds.The room was noisy, but did have a good view. There was a steamboat that started up every morning, and at night it was as loud as a parade. This was every night though!I have to say, New Orleans could use some general maintenance work done. The hotel had small things that annoyed us like the elevator situation. You push a button and then wait for an elevator assignment. Sometimes your elevator came, sometimes you ended up walking down 15 flights of stairs.

Off the beaten path, but close enough to the French Quarter and Harrah's for a reasonable price. The rooms were Courtyard standard with good sized bathrooms.

I used the fitness center, nothing spectacular but adequate. Parking was convenient in the hotel's garage. Not much of a view in an area surrounded by what appear to be converted warehouses.

The rooms themselves were okay - very modern, art deco and the bed was very comfortable but the meeting rooms and the service at this hotel left much to be desired.Even though we had breakfast planned to be brought out by 7:45am right as our guests were arriving, it didn't come out until I hunted down the sales and catering manager and by the time he got his act together the meeting started without anyone having more than coffee. This happened all 3 days we were there despite me bringing copies of the banquet event orders that he'd signed. They also forgot to bring our afternoon refreshments out on the last 2 days and we still got charged for it.At one point the sales and catering manager hid from me because I came to ask him about our missing refreshments. Also, we had billing issues with this hotel until August 2007 (the meeting was held in April 2007).This is not a place to go if you're expecting excellent service.

The rooms are exactly what you'd expect. What differentiates this hotel from other Courtyards I've stayed at is the clever look of the hotel's indoor public spaces and exterior. It looks like a converted warehouse, with weathered, exposed brick feel, and it works. Given that it's located in the Warehouse District, the hotel looks right at home. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and requested a room facing the pool (which, by the way, was also a nice little area), although there didn't seem to be any noise-related reasons not to request an outer-facing room. Other than a somewhat sleepy bar across the street, there isn't much to keep you awake at night.The area itself seems to be mostly for hotels and some good restaurants - and it's a nice departure from the hustle and bustle of the French Quarter roughly a mile away.

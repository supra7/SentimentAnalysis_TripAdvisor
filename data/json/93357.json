(Not that finding food/drink is ANY issue in NYC. Beds were not super comfy..but were ok. Our issue with this place was that we thought we were getting an excellent deal for 3 nights at 450 bucks...but since it was our first time in NY we didnt think to check for parking...and we had to go to a garage to park the car. We called around several places, and the average parking price was 45-50 bucks per day!! We could have afforded the cute condo apt we saw for 600$ with parking included since that is what we paid anyway :( It would have been better if we took a train in from NJ Princeton and then a cab to the hotel.

My room wasn't clean, I was told the housekeeper would come to clean, to give them some time. I called the desk back and asked to be placed in another room, they did. The room was cozy but the water was freezing! I transferred to another room the next morning as I decided to stay an extra night. The second room was a double bed room, which cost a bit more. 4am Sunday morning while sleeping my face & ear began to itch, I discovered a bedbug in the bed. I took pictures and brought the bug to the front desk, the night clerk had no idea what to or say about the incident. I asked for rubbing alcohol to clean the bites with, they didn't have any. I asked about the hotel policy on bedbugs, he didnt know about that either . I was told I had to wait to speak to a manager during \"manager hours\" which are M-F 10-6. I was moved to another room, checked the beds thoroughly one of which had an extreme amount of hair in it. I never went back to sleep and had to check out at 11 am. Overall the cleanliness of the rooms were good, the hot water needs to be tweaked a bit. The employees definitely need to be aware of hotel policy and should have some sort of answer besides \" I don't know\" during serious situations like this. Management should be available at all times. As a former worker in housekeeping there's always a manager accessible no matter the time.. The desk clerk is an essential to the hotel in my opinion and should be trained to handle situations in a more professional way.. I am by far easy going and i try not to complain much, but bedbugs are not something I would want to leave Park Savoy with.

Overall, I was really pleased. Our room was actually a decent size (though from the fire escape map, it appeared to be one of the largest rooms on our floor) and was clean. The bathroom was spacious and clean as well. Really, that's all I was looking for - since we checked in, went out, came back at 1-2am then left by 11am. The lampshade was a bit dingy, but the room had a small fridge which I wasn't expecting and found convenient. The AC was fine and kept the room nice and cool...had to turn it off when we woke cuz I was freezing! Construction does start early in the am (think it woke me up around 8:30) and the blinds do nothing to block out the morning sun...so a helpful tip might be to bring some earplugs and a sleep mask...both would have sufficiently solved both issues. I didn't really interact with reception aside from checking in, but I walked in with a smile on my face and they were friendly enough in return. Also, I never did get a voucher for a pastry or muffin or anything, but that didn't really bother me, as I was only expecting one based on what others have mentioned in their reviews. The elevator is really small, and takes a while...but if you are staying on one of the higher floors, I'd recommend waiting for it. :) We did get pizza next door...it was ok. I'd get it again if I was starving. Based on the value for the location (we walked to both Central Park and Times Square, and there are several nearby subway stations) and the cleanliness of the rooms, I would absolutely stay here again, and would recommend others on a budget to do so as well. There are no bells and whistles - it's really just a clean place to lay your head and get in a hot shower, but for the price, it really can't be beat. Another tip - If you are driving into the city, go to nyc.bestparking.com and map out different garages in the area and print coupons to guarantee your price unless you plan on trying to park on the street somewhere. There is a small garage just across the street, but it's a good idea to have back up just in case it gets filled up.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location but very sad front office employeessss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "GF F", "ReviewID": "UR116570298", "Content": "I would not mind going there again if they ever consider changing the Reception day employees..

When we went to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakfast room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the 6th floor, it was actually one of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single bedrooms which had a table with some croissants, bagels and muffins, coffee or tea. There was a hawk like staff member policing customers rudely telling them off if they dared to take more than one bagel, muffin or croissant. We looked around to see where we could eat our breakfast and it quickly transpired that we were actually expected to take our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 back to our bedroom on a paper plate, to enjoy the wonderful views of the scaffolding. After complaining to the hotel about their concept of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, we received rude emails and the hotel staff just could not comprehend what the problem was with their service. For $500 for 3 nights, the room and especially the breakfast were shockingly poor value. If you think the US is the land of customer service, think again.

This hotel is not as expensive as some, but there are a few things you should know. We stayed two nights. The room was clean. However, they are constructing an 80-story building right next door. And, they work all night. They have window air conditioning units at the hotel, and they don't block out the construction noise. I have never used the ear plugs I carry with me when I travel, but I used them during our stay. Even ear plugs don't block out all of the noise. I could be wrong, but I think they were running the jackhammer inches from my pillow. Due to the construction, they shut off the water on the street the two nights we were there. The water went off at 12AM and was supposed to be on at 6AM. It did not come on until 8:30AM. The next night, they shut it off at 10 PM. The other problem with the hotel is the electrical plugs. There is one in the entire room. It is located behind the bed, and it is not near a mirror. So, if you want to look in the mirror (or even the glass on a picture), you can't. If you want to charge your cell phone at the same time. Well... good luck. The last item is that if you have a hard time climbing stairs and need an elevator, don't stay here.

For the money (a little over 100$ a night) the stay was excellent. First of all, the location couldn't be much better. It's right in the heart of midtown where many places are within walking distance and the subway is right next door. The location is very near perfect - though of course people who have money to use for many cab rides it's not as much of an issue. The room was very clean and I saw nothing that troubled me. It wasn't luxurious by any means but the overall impression of the room was neat. Just know that the rooms aren't very big though they are not closet-sized either. They're small and efficient. The bathroom could be a problem for someone since it's quite tiny and slightly inconvenient for taller or larger people but it serves its purpose very well and shouldn't generally be a problem for people willing to stay in these kind of budget hotels. You had to wait for hot water for a while and in general don't expect to take long, warm showers. But again, it got the job done. The hotel is just basically a downstairs corridor with a front desk and then many floors of rooms. The staff was professional and the cleaning staff was both friendly and fast. No complaints whatsoever. There is some sort of construction work going on right next door so for people who demand absolute silence when sleeping it could be a problem after 7am. Also, if you don't want to walk the stairs the elevator is very slow. All in all the hotel is very cosy and functional. It is small but it has certain charm and it is clean. You don't get glamour or any special service and there might be a couple of annoying things for some people but I can recommend this hotel at least for young travelers and solo travelers and in general to people who can adjust and tolerate minor inconveniences.

Around midnight, a loud clanging in the wall started. It was a rhythm like a slow jack hammer.

As long as you know you're in a budget hotel, it is a wonderful place. In searching for a reasonably priced place in NYC, I looked at almost all of the hotels and B&B's listed in TripAdvisor. Coming from Canada, I was surprised to find that most of the budget hotels had shared bathrooms. Some of them had no elevator, and finding a room with two beds that was reasonably priced was rare. But those were our criteria (elevator, private bathroom, two beds) and to find that within a reasonable price range was very difficult. And to get all that, in a desirable location to boot, well, I consider myself lucky to have found the Park Savoy. The location, as everyone else has said, was perfect. As two women travelling, we felt safe walking at night, the subway was so close and to catch a bus was a half block as well. We could - and did - go anywhere in the city. The 7 day metro card is the best thing NYC could do for tourists. If you have time though, take the bus instead of the subway, as you see so much more. There were plenty of places around to eat, and the pizza place downstairs was good too. As for the hotel, our room was quite a bit larger than I expected. We were in a corner room, 903, and there was plenty of room to walk around. We could have fit a couple cots in there if we had been travelling with more people. We did walk past another double/double when the door was open, and their room was substantially smaller. The room also had a dresser and wardrobe, which is great for longer stays. I liked too that it had a little fridge. We could buy juice or water and keep it cold. The tv didn't work on a lot of channels, but who cares? If I wanted to watch tv, I could stay home. The elevator was slow, but I found it quaint. I've never seen one with a door like that. And slow as it may have been, it beat having to walk up 9 floors! The bathroom was fairly small, but it fit a tub, toilet and sink. What more do you need? Including shampoo & conditioner was great, since it's so hard to travel with it these days. We slept with the windows open, so it was noisy all night no matter what. NYC is a noisy city! We were gone by 9:00 a.m. every day anyways, so as not to waste a minute in this amazing city, and didn't get back to the hotel till 9:00 p.m. or after, so didn't notice construction noise. The maid service was great too. The room was vacuumed every day, and the beds made, and bathrooms cleaned, with fresh towels. One thing I noticed is that most hotels, no matter how much you pay, have kind of rough towels, but these, although not that thick, were very soft. We also had good service from the front desk, with wakeup calls every morning, and calling us when our shuttle arrived. When asked for directions or recommendations, they were always polite and helpful. Lest you think I'm just going to rave about this place, I will mention two small complaints. One was the water in the shower. It went from very cold to very hot, and I couldn't seem to regulate it. Needless to say, I had quick showers. The other is that I couldn't make a collect call from the hotel. They said I needed to buy a five dollar phone card to get an outside line. Of course, I found that you couldn't make collect calls from pay phones either, so I guess it's a NYC thing, and not just the hotel. We solved that by going to the Broadway Visitors Center (about 47th street) and using their free internet to email home. All in all, I would highly recommend the Park Savoy. With an average price of over $300 per night for hotels in NYC, this was a real bargain. Also, when you consider that any sales you get on hotels in NYC are usually only for one or two days of your stay, the fact that their price was consistently low is reason enough.

This location was awesome. 1 block from Central Park and close access to the subways, taxi's etc. The price was even better, though we did not hear about any breakfast deal before we went to New York. As with the other reviews here, the room is very small, the closet proportionately large for the room, but very clean. My boyfriend enjoyed looking down at the construction site every morning so different strokes for diff't folks as they say. I got a real feel for Manhattan staying here... tiny rooms are probably common, and with all of the \"grocery/convienience stores offering buffet/salad bars, it is reasonable to see how New Yorkers could live without a kitchen. I recommend the Italian/pizza restaurant just west of the hotel on the same side. (next door) I got an arugala salad out of this world and his chicken alfredo was awesome. Also something called garlic knots - these are very tasty. If visiting siteseeing, check out Strawberry Fields in Central Park. We walked down there and right next door to the Strawberry Fields entrance on the west side is a huge apartment building with gaslights and sea serpent railing. The building is called the Dakota. There is a doorman standing outside. Anyways, when leaving Strawberry Fields (a memorial to John Lennon) we noticed only 2 rooms with lights on in the Dakota. One room had the drapes partially open and we saw a HUGE portrait of John Lennon on the wall, about 3 floors up or so. We asked the doorman if Yoko Ono lived there, and he gave us a wry smile and told us he could not reveal the names of any resident. We did not have one bad meal in New York City. We didn't plan and restaurants, just kind of spontaneous choices but it was all good. For great burgers check out Jackson Hole. We saw Spring Awakening and Les Miserables - both I would highly recommend. Bono from U2 was at Spring Awakening that night also. Didn't spend much time in the room.

And you know what it was? It was just fine! The room is small. We laughed because they had a desk in the room with a chair and we wondered why they did that since the room is so tiny and you can't even sit at the desk because the chair won't fit between the bed and the desk. We had to put the chair up on the desk like we do at school.( Since we are teachers and do that at school) We couldn' t get our luggage in the closet because it did not fit around the bed. We had to pass our luggage over my bed to put in the closet-we laughed so loud but we understand Ny land is at a premuim. Even the ritzy places are tiny!Ok, this was weird- in all communications before we arrived, and there were many, we were told brkfst was included free inthe rate but it actually is not unless you book for a min of five days. ( note this if you are booking and ask about it so you are not surprised later)When I asked about it I got a very rude front desk person who said he didn't care less because my name was not on the list. I was shocked and taken aback by this since I used to work in the service industry and I could not imagine in a million years telling a guest I couldn't care less. When we went back downstairs the second time there were 2 other guys working the desk and both were sweethearts who fixed the problem right away.They called up to the bkfst room and put our name on the list thus redeeming themselves in our eyes. I still don't know how this happened since I had many emails confirming the rates included a daily bkfst with no min stay. That seemed like a big mistake to me since I even had it in writing. Some other things, Ok the closet is bigger then the room which we found amusing and the elevator is right out of a freak show, scary movie like Hostel or something.( take the stairs) The elevator ony fits 4 people. This hotel by far is a great deal!!!!! Clean, the bathroom is great! It did have some mold on the tub which should be a little cleaner. We were very pleased and thought it a super deal for a fantastic location! Enjoy. Ps- it is not fancy but we were expecting nada and got towels, soap, shampoo, etc so Pleasantly surprised! There is no clock in the room though so bring a travel alarm and yes the other person is right, we wanted to make phone calls too and couldn't. We could not figure out why they had a phone and we couldn't even make local calls to NYC restuarants right down the street??????????????This is a no frills, not fancy, but safe place to stay.

It was tastefully decorated and quite clean, and it had a decent amount of drawer space and closet space, especially for a small room (which it was). The air conditioner worked fine. The TV seemed to get only a few channels, but that's rock-bottom on my list of priorities. At about 4 p.m. on a Saturday, I called the front desk to complain that I had no hot water. A maintenance man was sent to my room instantly, and he politely demonstrated that it was the old \"you just have to let the hot water run for a loooong time\" syndrome. He added that it tends to be a problem only in the daytime, when few people are running the water. Does the hotel have an ice machine? No. A soda machine? No. A water fountain? No. Plan accordingly.

Unfortunately I relied on the good ratings it received. First, I would not consider the place clean In fact I could not bring myself to take my shoes off while in the room. It certainly was a \"barebones\" hotel, which I knew when I booked however the atmosphere left quite a bit to be desired. I typically book hotels offering only the basics as I don't need the frills, bells and whistles. This place didn't even come close to meeting my basic standard. I booked on a travel site which advertised that the Park Savoy offered free parking. Upon check out I learned this was not the case. Technically this was not the hotel's problem however, most hotels would have covered this cost with a customer request. I requested and presented them the documentation to show the offer that that I thought I had received and they refused to cover my $25 parking fee. Customer service isn't hight on their priority list. If you would like a good night sleep, don't expect it here, It sounded like I was l was at street level withthe windows open. This is not a problem with the service but something to be aware of when booking. If you can't afford anything else stay here. For $60 or $70 more you can find much better hotels. I'd save a little longer and stay elsewhere.

Located directly behind the Essex House and within one block of two subway lines, you couldn't ask for a better location. We had a Queen size room and it was small, but clean. There was plenty of room for our stuff-they even had a full size dresser, chair and mini-refrigerator. The bathroom was definitely small, but fully functional and everything was replenished daily. We stayed for a week, so were entitled to the \"breakfast\". It was ok, but I wasn't there for the food. There were many, many restaurants within literally a minute's walk and even a great pizza place directly next door. We got breakfast from the bakery or deli and walked across the street to Central Park for our morning picnic every day. The only downsides were that the elevator was really slow and since we were on the eighth floor, it was really too much to walk up. They are doing construction on some of the rooms, so there is a bit of construction noise at times too, but it didn't start too early. It is a rather European feeling hotel-small, older and the staff keeping to themselves, but friendly if you engage them in conversation.

It is a very modest hotel in a superb location. One block away from Central Park! Also one or two blocks from Coumbus Circle, or 57th street where the trains are. Very convenient! Location could not have been better. For this reason alone with the price $115 per night, this should seal the deal! The first three nights, we stayed in a room with dirty carpet, double bed (bed and bathroom were clean), decent shower, but loud neighbors. These people would sounds off early in the morning, and sometimes late at night. So there is sound transmission between rooms at times. I should have complained to the front desk, but did not. That was my fault. The lift was working well when we were there, no complaints about that. THe fourth night, we got a bed with a queen size bed and very quiet neighbors, but the room was facing 58th street, and there was outside noise. Much nicer room though! New paint, new carpet, and bigger bathroom. Form what I know they have rennovated a lot of the rooms. No real hotel amenities, beisde a luggage room, and continental breakfast if u stay 4+ days. All in all, I would go back again.

I stayed the first weekend of April, 2005. The hotel is small. I checked in, took the tiny elevator to the floor and room I was in. The room must have been 90 degrees with the heat(a radiator) pumping. I turned off the heat, but asked for a different room. I received a room on a higher floor and switched. The room was comfortable, but I opened the windows as I was warm. There is no A/C, only radiator heating for warmth and you can't adjust the temperature. The window had no screen in it. I had a corner room which had a view of the top floor of the parking garage. If the people looked up and to their right from the lot and the window was open, they could have possible seen me. What I hated the most was the slamming of doors all night. The fire door (the door between the suites of rooms and the elevator and stairways) kept slamming all night with people coming and going. Ear plugs don't work. The walls are very thin. If you want a quiet night sleep and are staying in the summer I would never recommend it. I guess it's ok during the spring and fall if you can handle the noise from the hallway.

Our flight to JFK arrived early in the morning and check-in time was not until 3pm. We arrived at the hotel at 7am and asked to leave our luggage there while we spend the day wandering around the city. We were given a card that allowed access to a small room on the fifth floor where guests may store luggage before checking-in and after checking-out. The room was empty when we dropped off our luggage in the morning. When we picked it up, there were at least ten other pieces of luggage in the room. It is not the safest place to leave personal belongings, as other guests have access to the same room, but we experienced no problems. I would not leave money or anything of great value in that room. We returned at 3pm to check-in. Everything went very smoothly. The room was very small, twice as big as the bed and had a small private bathroom with a toilet, sink, and shower. In the room was a small closet with a few drawers. Everything in the room (and in the building) was very basic and generic. The room was very clean. The toilet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chain broke in the morning. On the way out, we informed the front-desk clerk, and when we came back in the afternoon, it was fixed. The staff was nice and efficient but not effusive. There is no lobby, just a reception desk. The only thing that bothered us about the place was that the staff smoked in the reception area. The smoke smell at times made its way up the staircase, but it could not be sensed in our room, and we are two people who are very aware of cigarette smoke. On both nights, we had loud neighbors. They were two different parties. We were very tired and slept through it without a problem. It seems to me that this kind of thing can happen in most hotels. The hotel was very conveniently located for our needs: near Central Park, MOMA, Metropolitan Museum, Times Square, 1-2 blocks from the subway). It is around the corner from Carnegie Hall and Carnegie Deli.

The showers of the Savoy hotel were terrible. The water changed from extremely hot to extremely cold. It was impossible to decently wash my hair. The floor was dirty, as were the uncomfortable beds. The heater was leaking and there was no fire escape. Our view was a wall, and when we had the windows open we could smell the italian pizzaria downstairs. Not so nice in the early morning. We asked if they could fix the shower. They said they would do it, but they never did. We were not the only ones leaving early, we overheard other people leaving early too. I must say, they don't give you any trouble when you decide to leave early. That's the most positive thing about that place. That, and the location, which is quite good.

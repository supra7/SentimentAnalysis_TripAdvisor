Thomas Rd. and 7th. It is perfect for family members who are staying most of their day at the hospital. They have special rates for hospital stays. My husband's hospital stay was about 3 weeks. I was hesitant to stay there because of so many negative reviews. Either they have improved their service and accommodations, or the reviewers were given bad rooms, or expected a Hilton, Marriott, Sheraton experience at bargain rates... The room I stayed in was an efficiency apartment. You bring your own shampoo, food, and the rooms are only serviced once a week, which is fine. The staff were pleasant; weekday coffee, bagels, muffins, fruit are put out. The rooms are a bit shopworn, but the bed was comfortable, and the price is geared for practicality and long term, and not for vacations, luxury amenities. I would stay there again if another stay at the hospital was imminent.

The lobby was clean and the staff was courteous. Once we left the lobby, things went from good to bad! The hallway was dingy and the carpet was filthy-- we walked by several large stains that looked like dried blood or vomit. However, we wanted to check out the room before reaching any conclusions. Upon first blush the room looked okay. I could tell it's been recently remodeled-- fresh coat of paint, flat screen TV, refurbished cabinets. However, once I entered, I noticed: 1) The room was very worn: dirty carpet (cigarette burns and white stains), dented and chipped furniture; and stained sofa; 2) The bedsheets had hair and lipstick on it; 3) Someone's belonging were left in the closed (neatly bundled in a clear plastic bag); and 4) The room was infested with ROACHES! We grabbed our bags and left immediately. Extended Stay gave us a full refund with no apologies. We found a very clean and comfortable Holiday Inn Express for $30 more (breakfast included). SUMMARY The Good: Clean lobby; courteous staff. The Bad: Everything else, including: lobby that closes at 10pm; dirty hallways; dingy rooms; and ROACHES.

But this apaprently only applies to stays longer than three night - I stayed just three nights and was NOT assessed this charge. Now, I didn't get any maid service, but neither did I find it necessary for such a short stay. My room included the things you would expect of an extended-stay hotel: dishwasher, range, microwave, dishtowels and basic kitchen utensils. This was way, way less expensive than other hotel options, and was a convenient location to just about anything in downtown Phoenix thanks to the metro rail (which I also give high marks). However, just be advised that it's no frills all the way. Then again , who would expect a luxury stay for these rates? It's somewhat better than adequte in every respect.

She gave me a room next to housekeeping, and directly across the hall from the vending and laundry room. The air conditioner filters had never been cleaned, so I pulled them out and washed them in the bathtub. The mildew and mold in the air conditioner was so bad, though, that I changed to a different room the next day. The second room was better. Cars get broken into in the parking lot, as evidenced by broken car window glass on the ground, so don't leave anything of value in view when you park your car. They always clean up the glass before noon, so they know it happens all the time. I wouldn't say it's a bad neighborhood, but take precautions. The front desk staff doesn't seem to care much about anything. The hotel is quite attractive, and the rooms are nicely furnished. Even though this is an Extended Stay Deluxe, the rooms are smaller than the regular Extended Stay America hotels I've used in the past.

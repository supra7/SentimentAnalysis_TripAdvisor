The exercise room was small but well-maintained. However, there are no meals other than breakfast either at the hotel or within walking distance. The pool is tiny. The hotel is in a dull business park area by a freeway. Getting to downtown or, worse yet, the strip is awkward, especially during the ongoing freeway construction (the traffic was always bumper-to-bumper). You don't get an upgraded room for being HHonors Gold (and I had to remind them just to get the package of oreo cookies I was entitled to). I certainly would have trouble understanding why one would stay here unless one needed to be in the immediate area, at the prices they're asking (and certainly at HHonors Category 3 that they're now under).

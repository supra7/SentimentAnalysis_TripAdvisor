When we got to Memphis we were recommended to stay at the comfort inn, right downtown Memphis and it was $85 + tax. which we thought was a great deal for the location, and one of the cheapest places we stayed all trip. They have a comlimentary breakfast, rooms were better than expected , very clean and well appointed..

We were there on the marathon weekend, and stayed there with a team from Truman State. The beds were very firm but comfortable, the sheets were soft and not at all scratchy, plenty of pillows, there was a mini-fridge and microwave in the room, and the room was clean and quiet. The towels were on the plush side and very soft. The bathroom shower was best ever, good water pressure, lots of hot water, although an extra light in the shower area would have been nice. The free breakfast was way above average, with all the usuals plus waffles, biscuits and sausage gravy, 3 kinds of fresh fruit, regular and skim milk. Only one minus, the coffee was very weak. But there were a lot of kids there and they had planned for it, nothing ran out but the fruit at the very end. The service at the front desk was efficient and friendly. The rate was $70, which was so much less than most other hotels on that weekend. It was about 12 miles from downtown, all interstate driving, so it was quick to get back downtown, except at rush hour. There is a left, single lane exit when driving east which tends to slow traffic and get backed up - not the hotel's fault, just something to be aware of.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cAbove Average\u201d", "Author": "ShelbyboyTennessee", "ReviewID": "UR118412984", "Content": "I have stayed at 8 of the more than dozen motels located at this exit (Sycamore View). My stays have ranged from the pathetic (Red Roof Inn) to the superior (Drury Inn). The Comfort Inn was an above average experience for me on this multi-night stay. A significant discount on this chain prompted me to make a reservation on a \"newer\" room. The newer features included comfortable bedding/linens, carpet, most furnishings and a bathroom renovation. It was very clean (I check everything!) and odor free. The negatives included a broken window seal (fogged/etched insulated glass), a 20 year old 20\" Zenith TV with the inability to hold color, a bad back-up battery that allowed the smoke detector to continously beep when the power failed for 5 hours, a bad shower assembly mixer cartridge that leaked hot water to the rate of about a gallon per hour, peeling wall paper above the tub (I've never seen wallpaper in any bathroom that stays adhered above a tub) and finally I was surprised with a safe fee that I didn't realize was even in the room ($6 stealth fee!). The breakfast had a good selection, was well laid out and was tasty. The coffee, both in the lobby and in the room, was surprisingly very good. I encountered no safety incidents during my visit. Overall, this was a decent experience for me...I've had much worse and I've had better.

The outdoor pool is really too tiny to do anything but get wet up to the waist, and it was very full on our visit. Don't book this hotel over one without a pool - it really isn't worth it.

Also, when we flushed the toilet (in the teeny tiny bathroom with no vent), the noise was so loud/long running that it woke up my son twice. The breakfast was okay except the hard boiled eggs...they tasted like they had been last weeks leftovers and they made my dad gag.

I'm glad they were able to get us in, because the Liberty Bowl was happening and the hotel filled up really quickly. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and leaving out a tray of cookies & fresh coffee in the afternoon was a nice touch. And we were happy that we had some protein options with the continental breakfast (yogurt, hardboiled eggs) as well as the habit-forming buttermilk biscuits :) There was secured parking in the garage for $5 a day, and going in-and-out was not an issue (which was good because while the Comfort Inn is downtown, it's further than one would think from some major attractions). There was a safe in our room which we did not use, and a daily safe charge appeared on our bill - it was removed once I explained to the desk clerk that we never used the safe. As another reviewer noted, the bathroom sink area was granite and marble - nicer than what I'd expect for a mid-level chain. The room was spotless and kept so during our stay. And the fact that the hotel was full of Mississippi State fans and still quiet must mean that the walls are adequately thick :) I really liked Memphis, much more so than Nashville - it's got a friendlier, more welcoming vibe and this was reflected in the staff from those at the front desk to housekeeping.

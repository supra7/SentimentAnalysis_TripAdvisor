Some of the concerns other people have had were there, mainly some of the furniture cloth and carpets had staining (which looked like it had been steamed but not fully removed) and the one lift in service has to be one of the slowest in the civilized world, but they got the second lift back on line the day before we left. Check in/desk staff we're all very helpful & friendly and although no free wifi in the rooms, there were two pc's in the lobby for guest use, so that's what I used. This is a conference hotel so there were normally a number of delegates milling about, but nothing to worry us with noise etc. As advised by helpful travelers on here, I asked for a room at the back of the hotel facing the mountain on check in and we were given a room on the 11th floor. As mentioned, the rooms have seen a lot of service and are past there best in some areas, but our room was perfectly serviceable for our needs with a nice 42\" flat screen and clean crisp bed linen. Got free parking on the deal, but noticed that the entry/exit barriers seem to be kept open at nights, so maybe they no longer charge anyone? You need to have a car here as although the hotel is just across the road from a large mall (well a five lane freeway and a couple of dual carriageway's), you can't really walk to any attractions. Guys on the desk offered to run us over to the mall if we didn't want to walk, which was nice, but we took the 15 min walk. The tramline does pick up at the mall though, so you can run round town or down to Tijuana on a $5 daily travel card. Oh yeah, Wendy's, Denny's & another cafe right next to the hotel, so cheap eat options on hand within walking distance, as well as the food court in the mall. Although there are many better locations to stay in San Diego to be in the centre of the action, it offered good value for what it is, an older Sheraton in a non tourist location.

The pool area was nice and relaxing, however over by the wall side of the pool there was a steady stream of sugar ants running along the length of the pool. Not really a huge issue to me as I know they are common in warmer climates, but it did kind of freak out a 5 year old girl.

I usually stay anywhere from 4 to 10 nights per stay and am almost always upgraded to the 12th (Club Floor) or 14th floor (2 room suites). A hillside view room is always quieter (even numbered rooms). The hotel is comfortable and the rooms have the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper Beds. Having stayed here on multiple occasions, I have noticed a rather high turnover in staff in the last two years. It seems every time I check-in, there are all new front desk clerks. Everyone is very pleasant, yet overall training could be slightly improved (especially around Sheraton standards). * Addressing recent comments about security: The hotel has NO security cameras and what security at night there exists is very MINIMAL.The 12th & 14th floor USED to be controlled access in the elevator, however two years ago this was stopped and anyone can access these floors - strangely, the doors from the stairwells that access the floors still require a key. I do believe that the hotel does have a security problem (inside and outside), which is why I never leave a laptop, iPad, or similar device in my room when I am not there. Also, make sure the room door clicks shut, some doors don't close on their own. Rooms in general are comfortable, however I believe there needs to be a renovation of soft furnishings, wallpaper, carpeting & drapes. Renovation of the banquet rooms were being done on my most recent visit - nice - but do the guest rooms too ! Club Lounge: As with most domestic Sheratons, this hotel has a lounge the size of two standard guest rooms. The lounge offers a very limited evening service of 1 or 2 appetizers, and a small selection of sodas & water. There is a $3 charge for beer & wine. There is a nice small continental breakfast served from 6:30-9am every day (unfortunately not longer on weekends as with most Sheratons!). The ladies that staff the lounge in the am's & pm's are very sweet and always remember me by name. The lounge itself has never been renovated and is in need of sprucing up. The furniture is too big for a small lounge and provides little area for seated breakfast - especially on weekends. The complimentary parking for Platinum guests is a nice perk not found at other Starwood properties. Of course, Platinum level guests get comp internet access here and at all Starwood Hotels worldwide. I will continue to stay at this property as it is most convenient for me and is a nice Starwood choice if I don't want to be in thedowntown area. One comment for the management is that I don't like being told that things are the way they are because of Remington.

The staff is very good and quick to please. I also love the easy freeway access. And the daily room rate seems always near $100, which is well below any other Starwood properties in the downtown area. I also have never failed to receive great Platinum SPG benefits. That said, the carpets in this rather dated hotel, need to be torn up and replaced. They are old and stained. I cannot imagine any carpet company being able to get the stains out. I'm not talking about just the hallways, but also in the rooms. The last three rooms I have had all have terribly stained carpets. The maids can vacuum all they want, but the stains remain. I never go barefoot in my room at this property. On the 12th floor which is the club level the elevator lobby carpets also need to be restretched and laid flat before someone trips and breaks something. Given how responsive management and staff are, my only assumption is that Sheraton corporate is so cheap they are refusing to pay the cost to change out the carpets. Of course at the same time they do that, they should also get rid of the furniture which looks as it is from the 80's. Just two elevators and they are incredibly slow. And yes, the staff hears about it all the time. Remember, they have the joy of riding them almost every day. In the mornings when people are leaving for the day, they can really be tied up. Ze-Net wireless internet never works for me when I am in the hotel. I always have to call the help line and have them get it working. Other people have complained in the club room and at the front desk they can't get it to work, so I know it's not just me. The hotel is old enough that it does not have hard wired internet access in the rooms. For business travelers this is a major inconvenience. The pool is a pool. For families with kids, it works. It is nowhere near what you'll find in resort properties, but it provides a place for the kids to play. For those of you who do not get access to the club room without paying for the upgrade, I would possibly think twice about the value. In the morning they provide a decent enough cold continental breakfast, but in the evenings it is slim pickings. This last night they offered a whopping two food items. Potstickers and deviled eggs. NOTHING ELSE. No cheese tray, crackers, chips, veggie tray, fruit, nuts. NOTHING ELSE. For beverages there are sodas and water in the refridgerator and during evening club hours they usually have a wine available. No hard liquor. If I paid the extra money, I would be let down. Thankfully, it's free for me and I'm always entertained going in if I am around in the evening just to see how little there is. As I said earlier, the rooms all have dated furniture and low ceilings because it's an older hotel. 14th floor has higher ceilings, but that's an all suite floor and you'll either pay extra or have to be Platinum SPG to get up there. I enjoy sleeping on the beds and the bedding at Sheraton. It is always a restful sleep and I know exactly what to expect. No complaints here. The toiletries are fine, as are the towels and robes. Bathrooms are quite small, even in suites. This is an older hotel and until they refurbish properly and remodel a little, you're only going to see single sinks with very small vanity areas. There is a Link internet station in the lobby and one terminal in the club room. These are complimentary for guests. Sometimes when I'm trying to get on ZeNet in the room, I'll just give up and go to one of the free Link terminals rather than call the help desk to get on. For those of you who need peace and quiet to sleep, definitely request a room on the back of the hotel looking at the hillside. The front of the hotel literally faces the freeway and yes it is quite noisy. You gain great freeway access, but for light sleepers, you'll want to request a room in back. The restaurant on site is ok. Nothing great. There are plenty of nice restaurants just across the freeway in Mission Valley, so rather than eat from an uninspired menu and over-pay, drive across the freeway (three or four blocks) and you'll have plenty of options. Hillcrest is also the first exit off the 163 going south, and it too has a lot of diverse restaurants, just 5 minutes away. To sum it up. You stay here for a great rate of around $100, easy freeway access and a nice staff. In the meantime, pray they get some money to refurbish the place, especially so they can replace the carpets.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cMy Favorite San Diego Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Terry G", "ReviewID": "UR117500455", "Content": "I visit San Diego about 15 times a year.

I could have parked free over night and got to my car well before 10 Am. The hotel is located in a light industrial are and parking is really not at a premium.

So, I looked online at rates on Friday, April 15. I was interested in the breakfast package, but I noticed that my child wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be included for breakfast. Doubletree had a similar package which cost only $10 more, but it included the children. Also, they have an indoor pool which would be preferable due to the spring season temperatures. I decided to call Sheraton, Mission Valley, since we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed there before, to see if they could include my child. Not only would they include my child, they would knock $8 off the nightly rate. This was actually making Sheraton about $20 less than Doubletree per night. Since our focus was Sea World and the beach, I decided that Sheraton would work out the best. We had a long 7 hour drive to San Diego due to all the traffic leaving our home city and driving into San Diego. We have an infant so it was a relief to finally pull into the Sheraton property and get out of the car. We checked in at 8 pm. There was no mention of breakfast vouchers and I forgot to ask about them since I was simply relieved that we arrived. This is odd though, since our increased rate actually helps pay for the vouchers so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure why the check-in clerk would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forget\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd what we paid. We went out to dinner after settling into our room and returned to the hotel around 10 pm. I stopped at the front desk and spoke to the same gentleman who assigned our room. He looked up the info and said that our package only included 1 breakfast per day. I was confused since the original booking was for 2 breakfasts and I called to see if we could add our child to the package. Now we are receiving less than what I had originally called about? The person on the phone had switched us to a government discount, but that was what he selected when doing the offer over the phone when I explained that I needed our son added into the breakfast package. We argued quite a bit and the gentleman would not change anything. Now, we actually have less than what I originally called about and we already were in our room at 10 at night, when we could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been staying at Doubletree. Finally, he said I could use the free Internet service included in my room package and look up my email confirmation. If I could show him confirmation of this arrangement, then he would give us the breakfast vouchers. I printed a copy of my email confirmation and showed him the following typed info in my email, which I have copied and pasted below from the email: FULL BREAKFAST FOR 1 Per Person/per Stay He said that the above message did not mean each person received a breakfast. I explained that in English, the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153per\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153each\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so the above statement actually reads: Full breakfast for 1 each person each stay. It really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter what I said because he said that we did not get breakfast, other than for 1 person. I was getting angrier and angrier at this point because this was not the arrangement I made when agreeing to book a room on Friday and the printed email confirmation in my hand meant absolutely nothing. We could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been at the Doubletree for $10 more ($18 more after this supposed discount) and been swimming in an indoor pool that evening. I told him that he needed to get a manger that could see to this arrangement that I paid for on Friday. He stated that he was the manager. I started raising my voice pretty loudly and other customers were in the lobby off and on during this long, heated exchange. I assumed because I got so loud, he finally gave me the vouchers for all 3 nights for the 3 people in my family. I was seething by the time I headed upstairs to our room. This would be our last stay at any Sheraton Hotel. Never again. We thought there was a hot breakfast buffet like the Sheraton in Anaheim, but the next morning, we discovered there were only some discount store pastries and cereal boxes available. I had asked during the reservation if this breakfast arrangement was the hot buffet we were accustomed to in Anaheim. We apparently weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only confused customers because as we sat there, a few other families entered, looking for the buffet. The vouchers stated that we could order off the menu, so we did. The service was poor & there were hardly any customers in the restaurant. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised. This entire breakfast experience actually made us laugh about the fact we were so angry about leaving out our breakfasts entirely when we checked-in to the hotel. McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a better experience. I took a shower after breakfast and our smoke alarm went off and would not shut off. Apparently the steam (no ventilation system in the bathroom) sets off the smoke alarm outside the bathroom door. My husband looked outside in the hallway because we actually thought the hotel was on fire. There were a couple of housekeepers & another employee on a cell phone. My husband thought they were calling someone because apparently, it was only our room with the problem. I stopped my shower and the smoke alarm shut off. No one ever came to our room to question this problem. Very odd. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think an employee might want to investigate. This happened again later and a maintenance worker showed up and removed our smoke alarm. That can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly be legal. I gave him permission to do it though because the smoke alarm was a huge nuisance. Who wants to listen to a piercing smoke alarm every time they take a shower? The first night we noticed a Going Green flyer in our room. If we declined housekeeping services, we would receive a $5 voucher from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153participating vendors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for each day we declined services. We thought this might be a nice way to get some lunch money for the day we left. We had to hope that a good restaurant would be on the list. On Monday, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive a voucher, but we received one on Tuesday. It turns out that the participating vendors were actually the restaurants INSIDE Sheraton. Well, that was silly. A bagel cost $5 so our decision to decline housekeeping services was a very poor one. The flyer didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t indicate it was restaurants on the property. My husband decided to ask a gentleman at the front desk if the snack room allowed the use of these vouchers. He said that yes, we could use the vouchers there. That was fine then because we could get some snacks on our day of check-out. On Wednesday, we expected to get our Tuesday voucher since we declined services Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, the only thing we received was our bill, no second voucher. Great. Now I have to call and complain about yet another issue on our final day. I called and that issue was handled surprisingly well. The woman on the phone said she would send the missing voucher up to our room immediately. She did. Wednesday morning we went to check out. We let our son pick out $10 in snacks from the snack room, which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long since a 30 cent candy bar was priced at $2 and a $2 bag of chips was actually $4. We went to the counter to hand in our key card and use our vouchers. The woman said that we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the vouchers in the snack room. We explained that just yesterday, someone had told us we could use them there. She apologized for the misinformation and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow us to use the vouchers. At this point, I was FINISHED with Sheraton Hotel. We were on our way out of town and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had it with the horrendous service at this hotel. With customers standing nearby, I told her that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d no longer be staying at any Sheraton and there was no misinformation. It was all blatant lies. We were lied to about our reservation and lied to about the vouchers declining housekeeping services. We needed to redeem these vouchers and leave the property. She told us to take the items and leave. We did. I wrote a complaint to Sheraton. I received an email response from management at this property, offering us 7,000 points. I had no idea what that meant & that's tacky to offer something that most customers would be unfamiliar with. I emailed & learned that 7,000 points were equal to 1 free night. I'm not sure why this wasn't the offer given. Plus, 3 horrendous nights that we paid for cannot be made up with one free night.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guadalajara, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cLike my home\u201d", "Author": "LAG59", "ReviewID": "UR112961504", "Content": "Great hotel!

You can get an fridge for $10 extra a night but really it should be included.

The elevators are frequently out of order, but even when they were working, they were slow(10+ min wait) and frankly a bit scary! You also have the choice to ride the maintenance elevator with the trash, towels, room service...... The plumbing needs some major repairs as well, the rooms have drippy faucets, clogged drains, and just generally poorly maintained bathrooms. The gym is tiny, with only 1 elliptical and 2 treadmills; when I was staying there the TVs on the machines were broken too. The windows are insanely thin, if you're on the freeway side, you will hear traffic all night long. I stayed here frequently due to the fantastic location and proximity to where I need to be. I loved having all the shops and restaurants right there. The hotel itself leaves a lot to be desired, but works as a crash pad after a long day of work.

The last part is the fact that housekeeping woke me up not once but twice to clean my room after I answered like 3 tiimes they still persisted to come in and ask after I said \"No\" I could not fall back to sleep so that kind of ruined my first day of rest and my second as they did it both days.

I followed the link on the Rodeo site which went to Starwoodmeetings and booked through there. My confirmation email included a link to upgrade to a club room for only $40 a night, I followed the link and it listed the benefits of the Club upgrade being \"Don't miss this exclusive opportunity to upgrade your room to experience our Club Level Rooms for $40 per night. Our Club Level Rooms gives you access to our Club Lounge and fitness center. Our Club rooms also include a free bottle o water and upgraded amenities. For those who like a little extra room for families or for buisness upgrade your room to an amazing Suite for $100 per night. Suites are over 500 square feet and include an outdoor balcony, upgraded amenities and a free bottle of water. Our Suites also gives you access to our Club Lounge and fitness center. Club Lounge includes: complimentary breakfast, afternoon hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres, a variety of beverage options and copier/fax/printer.\" Well the catch is that the club lounge is only open for breakfast Monday - Friday, and hors d'oeuvres Sunday to Thursday. which is not listed in any of the communications or links I was sent from Starwood and the hotel. It is mentioned on the Features & Activities page of the hotel website. But I was not told of this when I booked or when I checked in. I contacted the front desk and was told the Club lounge was not open on weekends, but that I was still entitled to the other benefits of free internet, car parking and the bottle (single) of water in my room. I contacted SPG chat and after a lengthy online chat with Amy was told pretty much the same thing, sorry but there is nothing we are going to do or offer you, its listed on the website. The hotel is fine room wise, good bed, a little dated decor, room compendium stained and damaged pages, good Air Conditioning, happy looking staff, but I think for the money I could have got a better deal at the other hotels down the road which were including a full breakfast with the room rate. I was not satisfied with the response I received from the initial contact with hotel staff or from SPG online Chat, I believe their upgrade information is misleading and they kept trying to pass the blame. While writing this review I received a call from Lucy at the front desk apologising and sending me up vouchers for Continental Breakfast which is all I really wanted in the first place, but I had to jump through hoops to get to this point and spend an hour and a half of my time dealing with it. There are promotions everywhere saying \"Rediscover Sheraton\" well Sheraton needs to rediscover its guests and its communications to ensure that all information is clear and concise and clearly stated. In the old days (10 yrs ago) every effort would be made to resolve an issue and associates were empowered to take the initiative and ask the guest what they wanted for the problem to be solved. On my experience this time no one asked me what it would take to make me a happy and satisfied guest, they pointed me to the web page and said its there to read that lounge is closed. They did not put themselves into my shoes to see how I was feeling and I don't think realised that a tiny little thing like a continental breakfast would impact on view and opinion of the Sheraton and Starwood brands. I now have a breakfast voucher, but I had to fight for it and spend time that will never be recovered.

The first two trips were very nice and I enjoyed the hotel, room, food selection and the staff. This trip was different. The room I was assigned to had a very small bathroom - the vanity was upgraded but the toilet and tub were old. The toilet lever broke twice during my three day stay. Once, I called maintenance, and the second time, I fixed it myself. The roomed seemed clean, the linens were new and the bed was comfortable. I liked the larger TV and the desk area. I did have to pay $9.95 for daily internet. The air conditioning system turned on and off frequently, which would not have been bad, other than the loud band and crackle that accompanied the action, enough so that I needed earplugs to sleep. The nice concierge/doorman was gone and the front desk staff seemed new and overwhelmed, with no clear answers for the simplest of questions. For example, one evening, the hotel elevators were not working for at least 45 minutes. They could not direct us to service elevators, or stairs. They ran low on small bills and would not give change, so I was not able to leave a tip for housekeeping on my last day (even the restaurant could not give change). I called the front desk to request a taxi and a Towncar showed up instead, with a flat fee fully ten dollars over what a taxi cost to arrive from the airport. This is called rogue-cabbing and is against city and convention bureau policies, but I'm sure the front desk is getting kick-backs from this car service. The restaurant was understaffed and they directed me to table with no menu,silverware or beverage for ten minutes. On the plus side, the food was good when it arrived. Leaving the worst impression is my experience after I departed. I found a $4 charge on my CC. I have contacted the hotel over ten times by phone, fax and email for the last two weeks and they have not resolved the matter, nor I have I even received a reply back. On three occasions, I actually have been disconnected by the front desk instead of being transferred to the accounting department or general manager. Twice, I have talked to someone who promised a receipt within the hour, to no avail and I have never actually received a callback, fax or email in response. I left a voicemail detailing my dilemma for Susan Stevens, the general manager, and have not received a response. All this over a $4 charge, but it is blocking my entire expense report, so it is important. In this economy, what hotel can possily survive with this lack of customer service?

After calling engineering to tell them there was a problem, he told us thats just how they work. The room was dark and looked over the motel syle pool. The TV remote did not work. The comforter was stained. It was just one thing after another... We got ready and called the front desk for a cab to get to the event. Knowing that it was only a 3 minute cab ride across the freeway, we called down about 10 minutes before we needed to leave. Our frustration only grew when we were told it would be 20 minutes for a cab. After waiting 25 minutes, now missing the opening speeches of the event, a town car arrives and asks us if we called for a cab. We had waiting all that time because the girl at the front desk called a town car? He claimed to be a taxi but it was certainly a towncar service and I am positive the agent make some sort of commission. $15 dollars later for a 1.5 mile ride across the freeway I had had it. I paid a very cheap rate but even if the room were less than $100, I would not stay there. It is dirty, secluded, and has poor service.

There were lots of marks on the walls, stains, etc. The desk chair was broken. Later the manager told me the room has been refurbished, but I didn't see it that way.

There's a small gift/convenient shop, but no clerk - you pickup what you want and pay at the reception/check-in desk. There's a restaurant on site (didn't try it) and a reasonable pool. There's also a \"club level\" for the nightclub crowd. On the weekend it was pretty busy between club rats and what appeared to be a wedding party/family reunion.

The room was clean and modern. Bathroom was very small, but had new tiles and was spotless. No fridge in the room but that wasn't a problem for us. There is a restaurant / bar at this hotel that was surprisingly good. The waitress was super friendly. We had the fritatta and huevos rancheros, and both were really, really good. Later in our stay we stopped by this same lounge for a drink and had a very entertaining bartender. FYI - Parking is an extra charge, not included in the Orbitz rate. We were charged just over $11 per day.

They said they would send the maintenance man, but when I returned all I found was a small floor heater. I was there 3 nights, and to my knowledge the thermastat was never fixed. At least they could have left me a message explaining why they left me a portable heater. The worst part about the hotel is how noisy it is. The freeway is right outside your window.

There is also an initial fee plus time-related charge to use the computers downstairs in the business center.

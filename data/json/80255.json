The location is great as you can simply walk to the Old Town with its restaurants without the need for a car. The connection to the city Ctr is good and frequent too - but we had a car and did not use the train. The room we were in had two queen size dbl beds, was spacious and clean. The rooms get some noise, mainly through neighbors, not so much from street. Sometimes the train is blowing its horn and that can be heard but is no different to Downtown San Diego where that happens with higher frequency. The whole location looks actually quite neat but is set in an industrial environment. If you can ignore the surroundings, this is a nice place to be. The Inn has a small pool which looks clean (we never used it though) Free wireless at reasonable speed. The breakfast was basic with toast, muffins, eggs, jam, some cheese spread, orange juice, some (canned?) fruits, coffee and tea. But the self-baked waffles were great! They could have used maple syrup instead of browned sugar though. There are always fresh fruits available (also outside breakfast hours): apples and oranges. The staff was always very friendly and helpful. On checkout we were offered a 10% discount if we returned.

The shower head had good flow but was placed very low even for people of average height. I had to turn the knob to the maximum for hot to get barely sufficient hot water for the shower.

I would have asked for a refund soley on this, but my friend asked that I give it a chance. I ran the a/c unit constantly along with the bathroom vent and soon the smell was not noticable, until the maid turned it off one afternoon. Next, the television. Most don't go to a motel to watch TV, but I like it in the morning and before bed. The TV was way too small for the size of the room. How long have tube-style TVs been obsolete? I paid for the upgraded room, maybe they should have an upgraded TV. Noise is a problem. Not in the room with the windows closed and the a/c running, but still a problem. The highways, the sirens, the planes and the helicopters, maide sitting out by the pool headache producing. And the pool. There was one lonely child who wanted to swim. His mother let him swim if other people were by the pool. Excuse me! It is not my duty to watch your kid. Complain, complain, complain. I don't mean to. The location is good. The housekeeping is excelent, even if they don't speak the language. The parking is free. The bed was as good as any I ever laid in. The WiFi worked. The breakfast was OK. I felt safe.

No its not a luxury hotel nor is it situated in the heart of San Diego but based on pure value for money it has to be amongst the best in the whole area. Location - yes its abit out on a limb but not as bad as some make out. There is an ample car park and the site looks and feals secure. There is a five minute walk to the Tram/Bus/Coaster station and yes you have to cross a busy road but there are traffic lights! San Diego Old Town is a few minutes past the station and has many shops/ eateries. A 24 hour pass on the tram is $5 so you are easily able to get almost anywhere in San Diego at a minimal cost. As for the hotel and its staff - you cannot fault it. Spotlessly clean and everything you would expect from a hotel of this size. The Breakfast was great too. Many people have raised an issue over noise - yes there is a freeway nearby as well as the train but it was not noticable in the room. The airport is also close by and whilst we didn't notice it on the first day it was noticable on the second - probably something to do with wind direction. However it was not as serious an issue as others would make out.

The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable, so comfortable that I found myself looking for the brand in case I wanted to buy the same for at home. We walked to Old Town and it was quite close and seemed safe enough. Breakfast was complimentary and was pretty good. The pool was a bit small but sufficient and I hardly ever saw anyone else there. There was free wi-fi service and it worked well and although not lightning fast it was more than sufficient for just web searching. The bathroom was also seperate from the the sink area which was a nice setup and provided a bit extra space. The major negative to the hotel is that the walls seemed thin and we could hear our neighbors talking and hear their tv as if there was a party next door. It wasn't terrible but I would imagine this wouldn't sit well with some people. Our tv also had \"issues\" and didn't always work correctly and was also set up to be watched from the couch in the room and was difficult to see from the bed.

I really wanted to rate it higher, as the staff and management seem to try hard to make it right, but some of the minus keep bugging me. Here are the pluses. - First, the hotel has some of the best rates for its location. Few properties that I researched would sell rooms for its rate (about $130 for a 2 Queen deluxe suites, less if you are AAA member) that is so close to most of San Diego's major attractions. The rate includes parking, internet (well, limited) and breakfast - a continental breakfast with packed pastries/bagels, waffle machine, and boiled eggs. Breakfast is pretty decent. Items were constantly refilled, and we found no issues finding a place to sit (hotel was fairly full during our stay, judging from the occupance of the parking lot). With respect to rates, if you are an AAA member, make sure you mention that during your reservation. It is likely that the whoever is handling your reservation will ask if you are an AAA member (a plus, a hotel that offers a discounted rate on the phone). Also, the AAA rate is not mentioned in the hotel website, and the published rates do not reflect the 10% AAA discount. According the the front desk agent, what you should do is to make a note that you are a AAA member in the comments field of your online reservation. Or call in person, they are quite friendly. - The rooms are quite clean and comfortable. Well appointed and functional. I would say they tend to be on the smaller side (the deluxe 2 Queen, I mean) but it worked for our family of four. The vanity area is separated from the bathroom which is a plus. AC is an under-window unit, a bit noisy, but it works pretty well. The room had also a tv and a dvd unit, where you can check movies at the front desk. - The hotel is nicely landscaped, and the pool area, although small, is pretty nice. Another plus is the lobby, where you can help yourself with coffee and water the whole day. It also has a computer and a printer station. It is actually a nice area to hang around, and there were even some board games that you can check and play (chess, scrabble), which is what actually excited my 8-year boy quite a bit. - I believe that the best feature of this property is the location. It is actually close to everything that matters in San Diego. It is walking distance to Old Town San Diego. It is less than 10 minute drive from SeaWorld - and you don't need to hope into the freeway to get to SeaWorld, which is a plus to save some rush hour traffic. The same holds for downtown, Gaslamp quarter, marina, and Balboa park. It was a 10 minutes drive to the beaches and 20 minutes drive to La Jolla. Actually, location is one of the major reason we chose to stay at the Old Town Inn, since its proximity to SeaWorld allowed us to leave the park late afternoon so our kids could have a brief nap and we could enjoy some dinner outside the park, before heading back to watch the night shows, which we found was well worth it. Also within the location topic, there are plenty of dining options right near the property (we had thai in a mall nearby), although I think it would a bit too far to simply walk. - I should also note that the staff works pretty hard to make it right. They are quite friendly. I wasn't aware of the AAA discount until the second day of our stay. When I mentioned that, the front desk agent automatically gave us discount for the remaining nights - I didn't even need to ask (bring your AAA card, though). The morning helper was also very friendly in giving us information and directions. Now some minuses - The first, I would like to say that the Old Town Inn is basically an old motel that has received a nice face lift, furnishings, and landscapting to look it nice. It is successfully most of time. However, there are times that you are reminded that this is an old motel under the facade, for example, when you hear the sound of the pumbling in action early in the morning, and you know nobody is using the bathroom. We were on the first floor, so perhaps this factor is magnified. Nevertheless, it does highlight that this is an older property. - The property is quite small (which is good and bad), and so is their parking lot. To be fair, we haven't had any parking issue, even arriving late, and the hotel was fairly full. But it does give that feeling of being crowded, not to mention the need to do some maneuvering to fit into some spaces. - The location is great, but the immediate surrounding area is kinda iffy. I did not feel unsafe in the area (it is just desert, with an industrial feeling, and only runs for a block or two) but I would not stroll around outside the motel after dinner. Still, it is perfectly safe to walk during the day, as a lot of people do. - In room internet is free, but ... Well, it seems that the hotel does not have a large bandwidth, and if you do try to download something, the server will block your mac address permanently. I don't if that is what happened to us, but I was not able to access the internet after my wife used the computer, and she said the only thing she was looking was CNN. Maybe we were blocked for some accidental news streaming, I don't know. It was a bit of an annoyance, although I was able to remedy by using the lobby computer. At the end, the free perk was not actually free. - Finally, my biggest quibble is with the noise. From our room, we had an unobstructed view of an elevated portion of a freeway and, hence, the noise had an unobstructed path to our room. The noise actually arrived in the form of \"white noise\", but very audible. Again, it may be that our room magnified the conditions (rooms facing other directions may not be in the direct path of the noise). I also believe that the gaps between the door and the door frame (which were relatively wide) may have to do with it (sounds seem to flowing through these gaps), meaning that it may be possible to ameliorate the situation by narrowing those gaps. There were also other noises adding to the symphony, including airplanes and the aforementioned toilet flush from the upstairs neighbors. In all fairness, I should mention that I only noticed these sounds early in the morning - evenings were quite ok. Also, wife had less issues with noise - and she is the light sleeper. Also, to be clear, these issues were not deal breakers, otherwise I would not have given a 4 star rating. However, they were reminders that this actually an old motel underneath the nice facade. I thought that overall the hotel provides an excellent (probably the best) value for your money, considering its ammenities and location. It has a friendly, accommodating staff that works really hard to make it right. However, it does have issues, like noise and crowding, that keep reminding me of its old motel facet. As I said, my sentiments for its rating swings from 3.0 to 4.5, averaging 3.75, so that's why I finally decided to rate it at 4.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cI never knew it was there!

The rooms were very clean and fresh. The staff work extremely hard to maintain the hotel and it has a lovely welcoming atmosphere. The pool area is just perfect with beautiful landscaping and we really enjoyed relaxing there. The complimentary breakfast is ideal with cereal, fruit, pastries, eggs and cheeses - really not sure what anyone could find fault with - its fresh, well-stocked and the dining room is very airy. The hotel lounge is extremely comfortable with free access to the internet. As other reviewers have commented there is also a wide range of DVDs to hire.

This was the only hotel we were disappointed with during the entire trip. Checked in late (11:30 p.m.), unpacked all of our stuff into the hotel. Got ready for bed, took off our shoes and HUGE wet spot on the carpet at the foot of the bed. Decided since it was late and we had unpacked, to just wear shoes and tolerate the nastiness. Placed towels over the wet area which immediately turned brown. Reported the issue in the morning and the first comment from the employee was, \"We were going to have our carpets cleaned this week but because there is a large convention in town...\" When you are in the service industry, please don't make excuses, just make it right. And this excuse doesn't justify the situation anyway. Then I was told that a coffee spill had been reported in that room and housekeeping had attempted to clean it up. And it was still soaking wet at 11:30 p.m.? The solution...reduce the rate from $89 to $67. They forgot to mention the $67 still didn't include taxes/fees.

The budget-friendly price is an obvious draw for those sadly lacking trust funds (like me).

I'm impressed. Baffled, but impressed. Bottom line, if you're looking for an above-average hotel right off major highways (and close to Sea World) that tries hard to exceed your expectations, this is your Inn.

The Old Town is a first class establishment in every respect. The location is good. The rooms are very clean and have been updated throughout.

Now for the specifics of why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five stars. We arrived on an 8:00 AM flight and thought we would at least drive by and ask when we might be able to check in. The typical experience when no advance early check in has been established is a curt statement of the check in time. Not here. She politely said, let me check and see if your room is ready and then smiled and said yes it is and within 5 minutes of walking in , we were in our room. One day in a passing conversation with one of the staff I mentioned that one of the electrical outlets was a little worn out and loose. The outlet was replaced later the same day I mentioned it. We had some bad luck with a day trip to Balboa Park, the power was out and most of the park was closed. We had purchased the tickets at front desk and we were able to get a hassle free refund of the tickets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really good example: My daughter was changing from a Gas Lamp Hotel to one on the beach. We had planned for her to take a cab and drop her 5 pieces of luggage in our room for the day.

We stayed in the economy room with the queen size bed. It's a very tiny room with enough space for a small table and couple chairs, two night stands and a tv stand. Large closet though with ironing board and iron and a small coffee maker on the vanity. The bathroom was so tiny that there was only room for a standing shower. We did go into the pool, it was small and heated, better than most motel pools I've seen. The breakfast was great, I love waffles and I got to make my own. There was also juice and milk, cereal, donuts, coffee, bagels and cream cheese and danishes and fruit salad. For being a free breakfast I was pleasantly surprised at how much was offered. I also liked that we didn't have to pay for parking. This, the price of the hotel and the free breakfast and being near Old Town is what sold me. Granted the area isn't the best since it seems to be right in the middle of an industrial area but I didn't have any problems with seeing homeless people or street walkers loitering around the area like some of the other reviewers said. But what really made this stay even better was the kind and friendly service people. My fiance forgot her engagement ring on the bed and realized it AFTER we checked out and AFTER we'd already started our Old Town walking adventure. The woman at the front desk didn't give us a hassle when we asked to go back into the room because we forgot \"something\" and as my fiance was running full speed back to the room we just past the housekeeping lady that had actually found the ring and was giving it to the woman at the front.

When I checked the prices, I was skeptical about the lower prices that went along with the great reviews. I also couldn't get a good feeling for what the area was like.

She treated me like I was the most important person she was taking care of. She was informative, knowledgeable, gracious and personable. I had to call the night before and ask if the room would hold one more adult, who decided to come with us at the last minute. The person I spoke to then said there was a fold out couch that could be slept on, but also stated it might not be as comfortable as a bed. There would be a minimal added charge for the third person. I had a comfortable feeling about this place after speaking to these people on the phone. Upon arrival, (easy to find), the desk person was happy to see us and once again very personable. She explained everything thoroughly, informed us of times for breakfast and sincerely seemed to care about our stay. Once we got to our room, it was just more reinforcement that we had made the correct choice in staying there. We had a large room with a two burner stove, sink, fridge and microwave and lots of kitchen type cupboards. The couch was comfortable for sleeping.They also delivered a plastic tub of kitchen utensils, pots, pans and dishes for us to use. The bathroom vanity/sink was separate from the shower and toilet. Nice nightstands, chest of drawers and desk No problems receiving internet. Beautiful landscapes, everything well kept up and no bad smells anywhere.

We did not have a rental car, so were reliant on public transport, but if you have a car, there is free parking. When we checked in (at 10 AM!) the front desk people gave us lots of information on the area, including a guide to getting around by public transport, with tips on how to get to local attractions, grocery store, beaches and more. Very helpful! The closest grocery store is just a couple of bus stops away. There are also tons of other stores (Target and such) as well as a lot of fast food in that area. Super close if you have a car and very accessible by bus as well. We spent our first two nights in the one bedroom suite. There was so much space in this suite- we loved it!

We also enjoyed the ability to check out DVDs- a great end to our busy days in San Diego. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious- heavy on the carbs, but still good. Coffee, tea, and water are available all day in the lobby as well. If you need to do laundry, there are a couple of coin-operated machines near the lobby. We especially appreciated this, when traveling with little kids. The hotel was quiet and we slept well all of the nights that we were there.

We arrived an hour prior to the 3pm checkin and with the nice day our girls took a swim in the nice pool. We saw the BBQ grill in the corner and thought it was nice to have available, but unfortunately we ate out all the time since the hotel was conveniently close to the historical part of old town. Anna helped us out at checkin and pointed out on the map how there was a pedestrian tunnel underneath the railway station that would get us quickly to that part of old town. Taking note of the time on my watch it took no more than 5 minutes to get there. Our main reason for being in San Diego was to also go to Seaworld which was about a 10 minute surface street drive from the hotel. Back at the hotel we enjoyed the extras they provided such as a bookcase selection of DVDs guests can borrow along with a variety of board games and books which guests can enjoy in the lobby where there were couches to relax in or take back to their rooms. It was also convenient that they had a guest computer in the lobby, but we used the free wi-fi from the room and had no problems. Also it was nice that in the lobby they always had coffee and ice cold lemon water available. Then of course in the morning there was the continental breakfast in the dining room next to the lobby. Nice to have your own freshly cooked waffles in the morning with their good coffee. The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was very neat and with the granite counters for the two sinks added a nice touch. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in as I slept all night without the tossing and turning I usually experience at other hotels. The room was well maintained, but the only negative for any of this review was the fact that there was the smell of cigarette smoke every time we entered the room (although the sign on the door as with all their rooms show 'non-smoking'). As much as I prefer to conserve electricity I found that having the AC on helped keep the smoke smell away. I was told that all the rooms are undergoing some improvements and changing them to all be non-smoking so perhaps they hadn't completely gotten to the room we stayed in on the 3rd floor across from the lobby.

With a AAA discount we stayed a Sat nite for $ 100 in a room that was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. The beds were very tidy and comfortable, and although the room wasn't large it didn't feel cramped, and was laid out very efficiently. Particularly useful was that there sinks in different areas so that both of us could get ready at the same time without interfering with each other. Noise levels were quite good too. Staff at the front desk and in the breakfast room were very friendly and helpful. They gave us good guidance on attractions, and sold us Zoo tickets for a slight discount ($ 4 off regular price). That saved standing in line to get tickets at the Zoo. Of course, considering the price there are some compromises to make when staying at Old Town Inn. One is that there is no restaurant or bar on site. Another is that there are no tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, groceries/drugstores in walking distance. You can't get into Old Town itself (despite the name) because you have to cross a 4 lane highway.. However, the location is very central for reaching San Diego's main attractions by car (Zoo, Midway, Botanical Gardens, Old Town, Coronado, Petco Park, Gaslight area, LaJolla etc). All within 15-20 minutes drive. The only other downside is the lack of an exercise facility although they do have a nice swimming pool. They don't have a separate \"Business Center\" room but they do have a computer and printer in an area near the front desk so that you can run off boarding passes and/or maps. Given all that, Old Town Inn would not be an ideal place for an extended stay because of its lack of certain amenities and the inability to easily walk out and get them nearby (like a restaurant or bar).. On the other hand, for a quick 1-2 night stay where you don't plan to spend much time at the hotel and only want clean, efficient, pleasantly decorated rooms , helpful service, and a convenient location for driving to points in San Diego at a very reasonable price, this place can't be beat....", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cYou won't find a better value\u201d", "Author": "belwah1", "ReviewID": "UR99946748", "Content": "This is our third year of staying here.

I stayed at less than half the rate of a hotel within walking distance to the SDCC and even with the SDCC parking ($10). The OTI is slightly less than 10 minute drive on surface streets to the CC and about 2 blocks to Old Town San Diego. The neighborhood looks iffy mostly because it appears to be largely industrial rather than commercial or residential \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 also the trash, the liquor stores, and the wandering homeless. Personally, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here without a vehicle because there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything besides Old Town I would want to walk to. The property however stand out all the more because of the environs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is well kept and well lit. Plenty of parking right in front of the rooms. Access to San Diego is good since it is located right on Pacific Highway which leads straight to the harbor and downtown. The other way is the Sports Arena area where there are quite a few restaurants, shops, lumber store, etc and of course the Sports Arena. It is a little awkward getting to the motel from Pacific Highway since it is a south bound one way so if you are coming north up Pacific you probably want to turn left at Kurtz then right on Rosecrans and right again on Pacific. The airport is really close but not so close so as you are bothered by the sounds of aircraft. The motel is at the junction of the 5 and the 8 Freeways. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested take a look at the management response of September 20, 2010 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c gives a little bit of history and context if its authentic. My experience was overall favorable. No problems with my reservations or with check-in. You get a nice hospitality pack with your check-in materials and the staff was friendly and efficient. My room (a non-smoking queen) was tidy and did not smell of cigarettes. The TV had fewer cable channels than some other hotels with similar price range but they have a library of DVDs in the lobby you can watch for free on the DVD player in your room. My room had a small refrigerator and microwave. Also a coffee maker with coffee packets, hair dryer, iron, and ironing board. I noticed that each day one towel, the first tissue paper, and toilet paper ends were folded in some kind of origami decoration \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice touch especially considering it must have taken somebody some extra time to fold and plait the stuff. My bed was kinda soft but not a problem. Both nights the locale had no other noises than the occasional train in the distance and a little bit of freeway rumble. The breakfast area was clean and bright. The complimentary breakfast includes waffles you make yourself, a variety of pastries, bagels, toast, boiled eggs, oatmeal, cereal, fruit, coffee and tea. Not exactly hearty fare but, you know, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthier that way. I noted that on the morning I checked out that the bagels were hard enough to knock out fillings (i.e. stale) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just a warning. Observing my fellow travelers at breakfast, I would guess they were mostly families on trips of some kind rather than business travel but you never know. This is my kind of place meaning functional and value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not the place anybody would run away to in order to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pop the question,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd spice their marriage, or maybe ruin their marriage. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not exactly certain I would stay here again except if I were attending another work event at the Convention Center and needed to save money and I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to stay here without a vehicle.

I stayed in one of the deluxe rooms, and I think if you're planning to spend a lot of time in your room while you're on vacation, it's probably worth it to pay the extra to stay in the deluxe rooms over the economy rooms. I saw one of the economy rooms, and while it was perfectly nice, it just wasn't as spacious as the room I stayed in. The sink/vanity area outside the bathroom in the deluxe rooms is huge! I also had a sofa/seating area, which was the perfect spot to have our dinner of pizza and popcorn while we watched a movie. The tv also swivels, so when we decided to hop into bed, we swiveled it from facing the sofa to face the bed instead. The location is a little different, but compared to the prices of the hotels that are actually in the Old Town state park, their prices were a pretty significant savings. The road the hotel is on is kind of busy during the day, but the rooms don't face toward the street, and the landscaping and pool are so pleasant that you don't really notice the street after you've been there a little while, and the traffic really dies down at night, and you don't really hear the traffic if you're in your room, and I had no problem sleeping at all. The staff is very accomodating, and the place has quite a few nice little touches that you don't see at other hotels in their price range.

I simply could not pass this place up after reading all the reviews. First trip with family to San Diego and wanted to find a gem that met our needs (close to the beach, close to town, safe and clean). The Old Town Inn was where I landed. The motel is really out of place in an industrial area a good 5-7 minute walk to Old Town and sandwiched between the rail line stop and large warehouses. The price was (with tax $150 per night for the larger two queen room. Parking is free (a definite saving compared to most motels in area). Bedding, rugs, linens and overall cleanliness was adequate. The pool was tucked away and provided a good dip between activities. Towles and plenty of chairs at least late afternoons when I used the facilities. Breakfast included in the price was comparable to Hampton Inn, Comfort Inn, etc. Enough fuel to start the day. Nothing fancy, but good. So compared to the prices I sought in Sand Diego, this was a good bargain. Now some istems to consider when thinking of booking: 1) We stayed on the weekend and the surrounding location was very empty. So anyone walking around at night appeared a bit out of place. The area is not seedy, but suspect and my work takes me daily to NYC so I have a good barometer. 2) Daytime use of the transit system is fine. Once dark, weirdos, homless, strange folks, like any other city, come out to play. Did not feel comfortable after 9:00 PM going home including the walk back to the hotel. 3) Old Town is a neat place to spend time, good food, authentic and charming. Felt comfortable there and the food was excellent. 4) The rides to the beaches (Pacific and Mission and Coronado) were all easy. THis is a great place to stop if going to Sea World, it is close by. OVERALL It is what is described but nothing more than an average place in a weird area with some nice touches.

I would like to add several of my own however. First, in reading the reviews I noticed several that were negative. Those reviews were quite old and all of the problems mentioned seem to have been addressed. Second, what makes the Old Town Inn so special is all of the \"little things\".......coffee and tea available in the lobby all the time......an extra-large sink area in the bathroom.....computer availability.....and so much more. Third, at the time of booking I asked for a \"quiet room\" and we were given a room on the 3rd floor. No car doors slamming. No noise from above. And last, the \"tunnel\" to get to Old Town that was mentioned in quite a few of the reviews was a bit off-putting to me until I saw it. It is large, bright, artistically decorated, and under 24/7 security monitoring. I worried for nothing!

This hotel isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much to look at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is situated in what appears to be an industrial area that, at first glance, seems to be in the middle of nowhere.

We stayed here last year (March 2009) and booked to stay again this year (March 2010) and the quality and service has not changed. If anything, the hotel has improved. We had an unusual traveling situation (we were flying standby from overseas) and so were not able to pinpoint a definite time for arrival/departure. Not only did Beatriz and other hotel staff members help us with rental car and taxi information, they also held our room and did not blink an eye to many last minute changes we had to make due to our standby status at the airport changing frequently. We never got an endless ring or a busy tone, a re-routing of our call to a main office somewhere out of state while making/changing reservations, and we were never put into \"hold heaven\" each phone call we made. Our calls were answered within a few rings, the staff (especially Beatriz) was courteous and understanding with our changes, and professional. They EVEN called us back to let us know our room was ready EARLY, along with suggestions of a quieter room they had off the highway side!! Wow. It is a bit older facility, but certainly not in its pride in ownership and management. The grounds are impeccable, the pool surrounded with pretty bushes and flowers, and the rooms clean, comfortable and spacious. Though not in \"hot spot\" locations other popular, familiar-named hotels tout, Old Town Inn is MORE conveniently located, in our opinion. It is an oasis in an otherwise not so \"bling bling,\" stuffy city location. When freeways and highways in downtown, airport, and Gaslamp Quarter areas get congested with traffic (often) you will wish you never parked a car (and paid a daily fee for doing so!) at a hotel other than one positioned like where the Old Town Inn is. Its Pacific Highway location is this hotel's best kept secret, especially when pressed for time to get to and from the airport and car rental pick up/drop off locations in a hurry. It also is a short walk from the lobby of the hotel to the bus/shuttle/trolley station in Old Town. The rates are remarkably affordable for such a great location. Though along the road, past the bus station, and then down under a highway tunnel, we felt safe (even at night) in walking, as a family, from our room to Old Town (great restaurants, stores, and nice town to enjoy and walk through!)

The pluses- yes, a very good value for San Diego and the rooms were very clean and nice. The lobby and breakfast area are clean and nice and staff is friendly and helpful. The pool area is nicely landscaped but it is a small pool and no hot tub. There is a barbecue by the pool and my husband cooked on it and said it needs to be replaced. The location is a plus and a minus. It is a plus as only a couple miles from airport, a walk to old town, short drive to downtown and embarcadero, and short drive to Balboa Park and Sea World. The minuses- the location is a bit industrial. I picked this place because of good trip advisor reviews and I do think it is o.k. for adults but not especially for kids. There was a \"hobo\" as my son calls homeless - sitting one morning outside our room. I did tell the office and they did something about it but it was a little unsettling as he was talking to himself. We also decided by the same token we didn't want to walk to Old Town at night. The TV stations are slim and only kid programs were Cartoon Network which most moms know is trashy cartoons and nothing kids can watch after 8 p.m. There was HBO family which had PG13 movies - nothing my son could watch. He got hooked on TLC however, as it had the only programs that were PG rated. I know - we were in San Diego not to watch TV - but tell me that after you walk all over the SD zoo, SeaWorld and Wild Animal Park - you want to veg at night.

I'm from Vancouver, Canada, and haven't been to many places down in the States... Luckily TripAdvisor made things a lot easier. I had to choose between this Inn and Comfort Inn which is also situated in the Old Town area. Thank goodness we chose this one. Why? We took the trolley, while our other colleagues that chose Comfort Inn had to take the bus and ended up being late for the Convention every time! We stayed here for the ACN National Convention from February 27 to March 2nd. Every staff working at the Inn was friendly. When I was calling in to check for availability three separate times, each staff member I had talked with was very polite and respectful. We arrived in San Diego early and the staff were able to keep our luggage in the Manager's office until we came back for a proper check-in. The room was basic but very clean. The two queen beds were very comfortable and the shower was great! Every day coming back from the Convention we would find our beds beautifully re-made. The concierge is open 24 hours. One night, two of my colleagues were thirsty and wanted some milk to drink at midnight... The staff in charge allowed us to get some milk from the kitchen. Breakfast was plentiful with bagels, waffle ovens, 3 or 4 types of cereal, orange juice, milk, muffins and danish buns. Commuting to the Convention Center was made relatively easy by the Trolley Line. Warning: It can get confusing at the Old Town stop! If you want to go to the Convention Center, take the Blue line (although it comes to you at the wrong direction... It's just that it's the end of the blue line, and so the trolley actually goes in reverse.), stop at America Plaza, walk across the trolley line and then Take the Orange line to Convention Center. You'll get the hang of it :)! Total commute time from Old Town to Convention (approx 15-20 minutes). I'd recommend everyone to try the Casa Guadalajara Restaurant situated in Old Town, and the Thai Ly restaurant in the heart of Gaslamp Quarters.

We chose Old Town Inn based on TripAdvisor reviews, and we were pleased. We wanted to be close to downtown and the cruise terminal, but didn't want to pay $200 to $300 a night downtown for each couple, so we came here. Great choice. We got the family room that has a bedroom with a full kitchen and 2 queens (very good friends can share this bedroom easily.) Can't beat the price - it was less than half of the cost of staying downtown, and we were less than a 5 minute walk from the train station and trolley line. We enjoyed using the trolley for all our travels. A quick walk to Old Town, too, which we did a couple times. Ultra clean. Very friendly, accommodating staff. We called and said we were arriving early, and they made our room ready at noon. Pool was sparkling, although it was still a little chilly to use. My only complaint about location was the long walk to the closest grocery store. We actually used our kitchen, and cooked breakfasts in our room. Our husbands complained about the long walk to and from the store through a not so desirable section of town. It would be nice if the hotel provided a shopping service once a day, or something like that - or maybe just a drive to and from the store once or twice a day. That would really help. Room was quiet, well maintained. We'd stay there again, and our friends were thrilled with the choice. Cab ride from the airport was $16-18, and to the cruise terminal the same. Multi-day trolley passes were cheap - I think $3 a day or something like that and we used the dickens out of our passes, good on the trolley and buses, too.

Change the name to Old Inn?\u201d", "Author": "jasonblu", "ReviewID": "UR25612239", "Content": "Being a fairly seasoned, and previously pleased \"Old Town Inn\" veteran, I booked a two night stay at my \"Old Faithful\" San Diego hotel, somewhat excited to show my wife and new baby that there are still great hotels that don't cost a lot. Long story short, we checked out early and stayed at the Dolphin Motel (see my review of them elsewhere). Something seems to have happened to this once wonderful gem of a hotel, or maybe I was looking at it now from a different angle, having my wife and baby there with me. I am not sure which. Notables on SHUTTLE SERVICE Easy. There is none. Take a cab - its about 15 bucks from the airport. Notables on CHECK IN We called to have a room reserved that day, and, I guess due to the bad economy, there was no problem finding vacancy. I talked to a very nice gentleman who took down my name and said there would be room waiting for us. When we got there (at midnight, mind you), there was a new clerk, and she had no idea we were coming. Now, to her credit - she said their system was doing backups, so she could not access the database. I guess they don't have a backup means to pass down from shift to shift on who is expected to arrive during their system down times. Something they should consider doing. We were told we had to wait till the system came back up. 10 - 15 minutes went by, then my wife and baby came in wondering what was the hold up. The baby started crying. Next thing I know, the clerk is flipping through the paper register finding us a vacant room. Why it took a crying baby to think up this backup method, I am not sure. Maybe for 75 bucks a night, they don't want to go TO Crazy on providing good service. I say this tongue in cheek, as the girl behind the desk clearly didn't want to be there, and was a obviously annoyed at her job. She was certainly not the cheerful lad who answered the phone 2 hours earlier. I'd have to say employee wise, they are hit and miss now. Before, I could never find an employee there that wasn't eager to help and cheerful. Notables on THE ROOM Immediately when I walked in the room, I sensed something was different. Where once there were immaculate, clean, neutral smelling rooms, I was hit with a wall of sour, musty, almost urinal smell. I sniff tested the carpet and the bedding. Though they didnt smell all that fresh, that wasn't it. It was the A/C unit. Apparently they have this policy to save electricity where they shut off the units when the residents aren't in the room. I am guessing this is what is causing mold to grow in the units? It was so bad, we had to just shut off the unit. Thankfully, it was 67 degrees outside, so, it wasnt like we were sweating in the room. The residual stink was enough to ruin the rest of the night though and we both awoke with headaches. Compounding the odor, the carpet had also been recently heavily doused with carpet powder - so the smell of the perfumes in the cleaner combined with the wet sour mold smell, made it nearly intolerable, odor wise. Note to management: stop crop dusting the old worn ditry carpets with carpet powder and just replace the dang things. They are old, dingy and creepy feeling on bare feet... DEFINITELY due for replacement. The bedding is the typical, cheapo, plastic, rough, cheezy floral print bedcovers that are not fit to use as blankets. Those always annoy me. Two words to hotel-bedding-success guys: Cot, ton. Everything else is your typical budget hotel room fare. BTW - No refer. No Microwave. No iron. Actually - its a bed, a shower, a sink, a toilet, a moldy A/C unit and not much more. Zero Frills. Wife wants me to mention though that they had \"nice new granite-ish counter tops.\" Cool Beans. Needless to say, I was no longer talking up the place to the wife. She was not impressed. Notables on their WIFI INTERNET. Summary: It's a cruel Joke. Fellah's, dont be fooled by their listing of offering high speed internet in the rooms. Its a sham. They limit the ENTIRE hotel area to 2 Mb/s (for comparison, a typical single home internet cable service provides 11Mb/s.) !! They even have this retarded system that will document your MAC address and ban you from the router for downloading \"large files\" , but don't define what that constitutes a \"large file\". \"Pretty much only enough to check your email, is it. \" said the clerk. I had an important \"large file\" (132 Mb) I needed to DL for business the next day and I was locked out in minutes, or so I thought. Upon further inspection, I realized that my wife's laptop and both our iphones had signal but couldnt log on. A router issue. Nothing to do with my \"large file\". I called the number for tech support listed by the room phone, and the silly lady on the other end didn't know her routers from ravioli. Seriously. Like a robot, she started walking me through this check-list of stuff completely unrelated to the issue at hand, laboring over what operating system I was using, blah blah, when, since 3 systems all using different OS's had no signal - The antenna's clearly just needed to be reset. I tried to cut to the chase with her, but she mentally short circuited when I suggested we just have the routers reset. Wasting time there, I had to just hung up. I called the front desk, told them the situation. They said they could reset the antenna's. Only, they never did. Or if they did, the internet never did come back up. That was a big one for me. In this day and age, one HAS to have connectivity. Managers, get with the times! Get fast wifi, make it part of the room fee, and let it fly. Its cheap and easy. Notables on the CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST It's no La Quinta, let me tell you. They DO have the waffle maker (which, now, you have to mix your own mix. They now give you the cups, the water and the powdered mix and a plastic fork to mix it with. Before, they had them all ready made out, you just sprayed the iron, poured the pre-made mix, and voila - delicious waffles) other than the waffles, they have bagles, dry cereal, instant oatmeal, milk, coffee, and watery orange juice. That's about it. I seem to remember much more selection, and even scrambled eggs and bacon and sausage when I was there last. Maybe not. In a word - thin. Miscellany For those who are patriotic - I noted a strange anomaly. They have a California Flag, a Marine Corps Flag and the Mexican Flag hanging in a row from the roof...but NO AMERICAN FLAG. (at least not there - if there is one somewhere, I didn't see it) Odd. If your going to fly flags, and your IN America, fly an American Flag. Bizarre. Are they trying to make some political statement or something by omitting the Ole Stars and Stripes? HIGH POINTS. The grounds were clean. There was enough parking. The bathroom and shower area were clean. Its conveniently located: 5 minutes drive from the Airport. 5 minute walk to Old Town. Its Cheap. They had a nice military Rate of $68 plus tax. Came to like 74 a night. Would I stay there again? Replace all the carpeting, nuke the A/C units of the sour mold, keep em on, switch to all cotton bedding, offer decent WiFi without those retarded restrictions (11Mb/s is about $60 a month FOR THE ENTIRE HOTEL guys, come on) and of course, show your loyalty to the country that lets you run a business on its soil and RAISE THE GRAND OLD FLAG - keep the $68 military rate and I would come back in a heartbeat.", "Date": "March 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat place\u201d", "Author": "batchelle", "ReviewID": "UR25155317", "Content": "My wife and I got married at Sunset Cliffs, and chose the Old Town Inn for it's price and location between the ceremony site and the restaurant we went to after.

Included breakfast, a nice pool, and the over all look of the outside(plant life and hotel) was very attractive and relaxing for me.

We upgraded for an extra $10 a night and stayed in the newer section which seemed much nicer. The pool was lovely as well as the beautiful landscaping. We took the Trolley downtown (blue line) most days which is an easy walk (easy walk to old town as well) and easy to navigate. (FYI-the pamphlets recommend Old Town Mexican Cafe-not really that good and pretty expensive-seems like a tourist trap) *Breakfast was supplied everyday, got a little repetitive but was a nice money saver and kick-off to the day *Staff-Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. We bought our zoo tickets at the front desk to get a discount. Hotel room- We got a room with a big bathroom and two queens which was definitely worth the extra money when the laundry and souvenirs started piling up. Everything about the room was fine with the exception of a squeaky floor (which gave us something to laugh about) I think overall that people our age (mid twenties) might be better suited at a hotel downtown as more of our activities were focused closer to the city and not as much on other areas of San Diego (mission valley, la jolla) which the old town inn IS very central too ( it seemed as though we were the youngest guests too). Also, younger people might not find the closest neighborhood, old town, as interesting especially since there is not much going on at night(that we could see), with the exception of Harney's, a hipster sushi restaurant. Overall the stay was good, the close proximity of the trolley (and some rides from friends) meant we avoided having to get a rental car which was appreciated.", "Date": "December 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Caledon", "Title": "\u201cA Jewel of a Motel!\u201d", "Author": "JayDeefromBramalea", "ReviewID": "UR22734055", "Content": "We stayed here when we went to San Diego and Old Town for the weekend recently.

The corner unit room on the 3rd floor was clean and large. No refrigerator. All room doors face an outside corridor. The Inn is on Pacific Highway but I didn't hear much noise. It is also situated in a commercial/industrial area. The area is quiet at night but did not feel uncomfortable walking in the area at night. I started looking for rooms in May but didn't book room until September. Because I didn't book early enough I originally couldn't get 5 consecutive nights in the same room. My initial booking ended up with us having to move 3 times. The staff was courteous enough to phone me the next day (without me requesting) to inform me they had a room available for 5 straight nights. Paid approximately $100 per night with AAA discount. Standard continental breakfast with 2 waffle makers, bread, bagels, fruit cocktail, cereals, orange juice, coffee, tea, etc. The front counter staff was friendly and helpful. The front counter had discount tickets on sale for some of the attractions. For example, an adult zoo ticket for $30.00. They also provided complimentary toiletries such as toothpaste should you run out. The only complaints I have are the following: 1)internet access on the free computer was slow (minor detail) 2)you can't book through the internet even though they have a website. However, there is a toll free number. Once you told the staff what your requirements were, they would email you back to confirm your reservation. The response time was quick. Old Town Inn's location was central for our needs given that the transportation hub that was approximately 300 yards away (across the street and commuter parking lot). The bus and trolley system takes you to all the tourist sites - Gaslamp district, downtown, beaches, La Jolla, zoo, SeaWorld, Fashion Valley and Mission shopping malls, etc. including the border next to Tiajuana. The outlet mall Las Americas is also next to the border less than 1/2 mile from the last trolley bus stop at the border. The Old Town tourist site is on the other side of the transportation hub approximately 200 yards away. Waiting time for regular buses was usually less than 10 minutes (daytime). Trolley bus waiting time was less. HINT: Buy a day pass good for the trolley and bus. One day adult pass is $5.00, 2 day is $9.00, 3 day is $12.00 and 4 day is $15.00. You can buy the pass at any kiosk /terminal or at the convenience store at the transportation hub. Restaurants We ate at the Coyote Cafe and Old Town Mexican Cafe in Old Town. Restaurants are next to each other. Food was good. Little Italy Restaurant - Filippi's. Restaurant entrance is through the deli. (3 trolley stops from Old Town). Good food at a fair price. Always crowded. Go early or late to avoid lineups. Gaslamp District - Sloppy Joey's - pizza and pasta. Food was okay. Phil's BBQ on Sports Arena Boulevard - good food - chicken, beef and pork ribs, etc. Less than 1.5 miles from Old Town Inn Other Info: Taxi cab from cruise terminal to Old Town Inn - approx. $14.00 before tip.

I have previously called the hotel directly to book a room for two adults, and was given a price quote and a reservation number. Due to some miscommunication, I was booked for a room for Jun 23 and 24 instead of Jul. I was quoted around 150 bucks for 2 nights over the phone, and did not receive any other confirmation after that. When I arrived at the hotel on Jul 23, the person at the counter told me that I booked for Jun, and since I have missed my booking they had charged me 170 bucks for not showing up. Apparently, that was the price for \"one night\". They didn't have any vacancy either, and would not let me use the hotel phone to see if there are any other vacancies in the area. Instead they directed me to the pay phone outside the hotel, which ate up our 75 cents, the last of our change. I was really frustrated, since I have planned the trip that does not account for any delays such as this. We had no more change to call hotels, I was out 170 bucks, and I had no place to stay. Finally they told us that they had one room that they can let us stay in. It was 170 bucks a night, since the Comic-Con was in town. So from an average of 90/night to 170/night. Desperate for a place to stay, we took their offer. But let's just say that we were not happy campers. But to be fair, aside from that, the stay was more than pleasant. The room was nice and clean, the bed was so big that it felt impractical (you could fit 3 adults on it) and it was comfy. The breakfast was ok, with bagels, waffles, toast, stuff like that. Someone helps you make the waffles too if you don't want to do it yourself. When we checked out, I talked to the GM, Beatriz, about my 170 penalty for \"not showing up when I was supposed to\". I had booked for Jul, not Jun, but I got charged 170 bucks! I was quoted 150 then, even if they were going to charge me, why did I get charged for more? Beatriz immediately fixed that for me by putting the money back on my credit card and apologized for the mistake. And with that, I left the hotel quite satisfied with the overall service and quality of the hotel. Although I think the younger staff they hired (like the teenage front desk girl that first helped me when I checked in on Jul 23) needs some improvement, overall it was a pleasant stay. I'd recommend it.

The continental breakfast was quite good and the waffle makers that others have mentioned were fun to use.

Our first night, we ordered pizza from Broadway Pizza, thanks to the recommendations included on a laminated sheet in the room. The pizza was really delicious, a good price and delivered right to our door (no address needed; I just needed to tell them \"Old Town Inn\" and they said, \"OK!). The next night, we drove the few blocks to Old Town. I did some research on Google and found lots of good reviews for the Cafe Coyote and Cantina, located at 2461 San Diego Avenue. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes, but by the time I parked the car and walked a few blocks to the restaurant, my wife already had a table. The service was great, the chips & salsa wer e quite tasty, the hand-made tortillas were great, the portions were generous and the fried ice-cream was delicios.

Yes, it's across the street from the train station and the freeway is audible from most front-facing rooms. But for the price, I can totally live with that. If you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs, just in case. It's about a $14 cab ride from the airport (a bit pricey, but oh well). There's someone that staffs the front desk 24/7. They provided me with free toiletries like toothbrushes and toothpaste when I realized at past midnight that I forgot to pack the essentials. Also had extra pillows and blankets upon request. They have breakfast 8am to 10am (I think) and it's YUMMY, totally worth waking up for even after a long night. Fresh, hot, self-serve made-to-order Belgian waffles, a variety of danishes, muffins, toast, and bagels. Also there's fresh fruit, canned fruit, OJ, hot coffee and tea. Honestly, for a motel, this is an awesome brekkie. The standard room itself was not bad, fairly small but clean. It fit a dresser, a 27\" CRT tv, queen sized bed, and a two-person dining table. There's a vanity, a small walk-in closet, and a bathroom with a standup shower. There's AC & heater in the room just in case the weather isn't perfect. Walls are paper thin so we heard others coughing, talking, and watching tv. This was not nearly as bad as the very occasional train rolling by tooting it ridiculously loud horn. Earplugs are a good thing if you happen to get a room near the street :) We rented a car so I can't really comment on walking distance to everything, but I can say that everything was easy to reach by car. Parking wasn't at all a problem and we came during spring break/St Patricks day weekend. A few oddities: The carpet felt damp the entire time we were there, like they were just shampooed but didn't dry completely. The ventilation of the bathroom wasn't great, drops of water condensed on the ceiling and dropped on our heads (and some of the water was brown). A few lightbulbs were out or close to dead so they would flicker endlessly. I think the previous resident in our room had set the alarm to ring at 7:30 am and didn't turn it off.

We found the location suitable for our four-night stay, as we were doing the tourist thing in San Diego using public transport. The transit centre is a little over five minutes walk away (walk through the carpark, out the car entry/exit point, cross the highway at the pedestrian crossing with lights and walk a minute or so down the highway). We caught a number of buses during our visit and I must say every single bus driver was extremely friendly and helpful - it certainly left me with a very good impression of the people of San Diego! The location is in a bit of an industrial-type area, but another five minutes walk past the transit centre is Old Town with all its restaurants. I imagine though that most people would probably feel more comfortable walking at night if they weren't walking alone.

However, we rather disappointed with the hotel. The room itself, while clean, was no more than adequate. We had difficulty finding a carpark space near the room with some large vehicles in particular making it very awkward to park in certain places. The air conditioning was rather noisy. The main reason for choosing this hotel was its location near old town. I had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel in the first place but when I did I was surprised to find it in a somewhat industrial area and the nearby neighbourhood didn't look the best in the world. In fact whoever decided to call the hotel the Old town inn deserves royalties because I'm sure the name gets people interested in the hotel as an old town accommodation spot. On a map the hotel looks very near old town which technically it is. But to get there, even if it only takes 5 minutes, you have to walk past a warehouse, cross a busy highway, walk under a freeway and then an underpass under some railway tracks and a trolley station (the trolley goes all the way to Mexico border from here). Not really a walk for those with a nervous disposition although once in old town everything seemed safe enough. In a nutshell I'd prefer a few more touristy things adjacent to the hotel to make the walk more pleasant. Being on the highway has one advantage. Its an easy 5 minute drive to SeaWorld if that's what you're in San Diego for. As someone who has visited most other parks in Southern California I thought that park was a little too commercialised for my liking with not enough rides or indeed shade to keep the little ones happy.

Our room, which was in the one-story section of the hotel, was clean and comfortable, but a tad stuffy without the A/C (a card in the room stated that it helped save energy to leave it off, and we could turn it on if we wanted to). I didn't notice the chemical smells that other guests have complained about. The pool was nice but needed cleaning. I noticed them doing so the day we left. WiFi internet worked great the first day, then inexplicably petered out the second day, but I'm spoiled and internet access on the road is just a bonus. We never heard any noise from the 5, but the very comforting sound of train whistles reached our room frequently. The proximity to Old Town State Park and the trolley into downtown were major bonuses for us. How nice to be able to park at the hotel and explore by public transportation and on foot!

Horrible cleaning fluid smell that we just couldn't get rid of for 5 days. We were only in the room at night- but its bad enough for headaches. 3. Bad location- near to everything, but close to nothing. Can walk to factories/highways/train. Its surrounded by several freeways/highways/major routes. 4. Multiple signs posted that the inn uses chemicals that are dangerous for pregnant women/cause birth defects.

It was actually pretty good! The pool seemed kind of small and was suppose to be heated. However, everyone was complaining about how cold the water was. They did have towels set out for you so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have to ask for them. They also have a computer for guests to use, with a 15 minute limit. That was definitely nice to be able to check our e-mails and/or do some research about the area. The breakfast was fine but the OJ was watered down since they put ice in it. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always keep up with re-filling the bagels & muffins either. The waffles were great though. Another issue is that they only have 8 tables in the breakfast room which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always sufficient seating for everyone. The location was great because we were able to walk to Old Town for shopping and dinner, Sports Arena for In & Out Burgers and Starbucks, to the MCRD to watch the Marine graduation, and to the transit center to take the bus and/or trolley \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which we took to SeaWorld and Coronado Island without any problems. The day we left, we checked out of our room, stored our luggage with them for the day and then they called a cab for us once we were ready to go to the airport. They even called a place that the fare was only $10 something without tip!

When we first approached the hotel, I was concerned because it seemed to be in an area almost under the highway, but it's really not, and the location was actually very convenient. We could walk to Old Town for dinner, and the central location was great for driving to the zoo, Coranado, and a wedding we attended on Vacation Island.

The staff members were helpful and very sweet. They recommended a good pedicure place and a fun (though not superb) Mexican restaurant. They also sold us discounted tickets to the zoo (which was great, by the way.) The complimentary breakfast --waffles, choices of cereal, danish, some fruit, etc.-- was filling and pretty decent though not excellent (the fruit wasn't great, just some apples and oranges, but I'm kind of a food snob so don't weigh my view on this too heavily) . The little dining room was light and cheery, and the pool is nice too. While not super-fancy, the rooms were clean and tasteful. The linens were good, though not luxurious. The toiletries (soap, shampoo, etc.) were probably the only disappointment, but, like lots of people, I'd brought my own anyway. The towels were more than ample.

The rooms were pleasant however they were lacking many items. There was no fridge, safe and the rollaway bed they brought us was probably thirty years old. The staff was pleasant when we booked in, gave us great maps for getting around and arranged for us to have extra pillows and blankets. Our room was near the road and we heard everything. Unless we had the air conditioning on high we had a hard time sleeping. I slept well in Anaheim but after the second night at the Old Town Inn both my husband and I had sore backs. I was tired after sleeping at the Inn. The rooms were clean and nicely appointed, however our rollaway bed was never made the three nights we spent there. The breakfast was just okay, the first morning we had to go find staff to restock as there was nothing left and it was still quite early with a lot of people standing around waiting for food. The breakfast room is small and they ask you not to eat outside of the breakfast room. I'm not sure where you should eat if you can't get a table. ( standing up, I guess). The pool is fine and clean. There is no hot tub. Parking became difficult if you were one of the last in the parking lot. It is small and difficult to manage. We would have rated our stay okay until we went to check out. We had checked in using our CAA Visa Travellers Cheque Card. They accepted this and yet when we went to check out they told us they could not accept this ( even though we had no problems with our other hotel, restaurants and shops for the last 10 days). We had to go and get cash from the bank. When we returned home, we notice on the statement, they had put the money through on our Visa when we checked in and then taken our cash at check out. This has been resolved but only after calling them . Apparently the girl who checked us in should not have accepted our card. We spoke with our CAA and Visa and they said they have never had anyone reject this card. It is the same as a travellers cheque but in the form of a card which makes it much easier to use. Old Town Inn is the only hotel which we know of that does not accept it. I think perhaps the Inn should get up to date on new payment methods. Would I return? No. And obviously I would not recommend this to anyone else. The inn was okay but the check out definetly turned me off.

A car is still a good idea in SD. However, nearby are bus and trolley routes. On arrival about 4 PM, I noticed a very strong \"room freshener\" which was definitely overdone. My advice to the hotel is to insure that non-smoking rooms are absoulutely maintained non-smoking and that room fresheners be far more subtle and sparingly used. The bathroom was 1950s design with a small shower stall, toilet and small updated vanity. The two double beds would be adequate up to a 6 foot tall person but not beyond. If you are tall get aroom with a queen bed. The decor had a cheerful bedspread and paint scheme. TV was very basic cable. The lobby was warm and welcoming as was the staff.

The breaksfast was adequate and convenient self serve. Bagels, dry cereal, instant oatmeal, pastries and make your own waffles. The waffle batter was bland to paper mache' in flavor and texture - might be improved with a longer cook time and perhaps a different batter. One piece of advice to the staff - get a sneeze guard and keep the food out of children's reach. We observed one hacking, sneezing child spreading her germs over the pastries and bagels.

The bad news... In general, there was a bunch of little things that were kind of annoying for us, We are two men in our 40s that rented 2 rooms (a small one and a larger one (the larger one had a kitchen and sofabed as well as a queen)-- both non-smoking) 1. The first \"larger room\" they gave me had a strong cigarette smoke smell. The carpet actually had cigarette burns in it in spite of the fact that this was supposed to be a non-smoking room. 2. I was transferred to another room (no smoke smell) but it (and my friend's room) both had a perfumy/disinfectant kind of smell that we both found unpleasant. (Perhaps, it's that Fabreze stuff and you might not mind it but both of us left the windows open to get rid of it).. The second room also had cigarette burns in it (these were on the blanket). In addition, the back of the door to the room had some heavy scratches and dents on it as if something heavy had been thrown against it. 3. When I returned later to my room, and turned on the tap to brush my teeth, there was an overpoweringly strong sulphur smell (rotten eggs smell) coming out of the tap. 4. I went to buy bottled water and the vending machine I tried was out of water; the second one stole my money and failed to dispense my water. 5. When we arrived, The pool had a sign on it saying that the water heater was broken although I saw people swimming in it later in the day who said it was warm. 6. The \"make your own\" waffles for breakfast were pretty tastelss and the cereal had a stale taste. The cereal was dispensed from large glass jars via scoops. I thought it strange that the scoops were stored by hanging them by the scoop-part (not by the handle) on the wooden knobs that were screwed into the center of the jar lids. In this way, every \"dirty\" hand that came in contact with a jar lid -- and left its germs on the lid's knob --resulted in those germs being transferred to the scoop which in turn was repeatedly inserted into the jar. (Yeech!). I believe that the reason the cereal tasted stale was that the jars were never emptied and washed -- just re-filled from time to time. 7. The remarks of the prior posters notwithstanding, there was some traffic noise from the street. My room was about 1/2 way back from the driveway entrance and you could still hear some noise in the distance (with the windows closed). It didn't disturb me -- I feel asleep easily but it might affect light sleepers, especially if your room was closer to the street. FYI, the smaller rooms (what they call \"the bungalows) are farther away from the street than the larger rooms. in general. Ok, the good news... 1. The lobby was very nice -- there was the fireplace and attractive furnishings. 2. Check-in was a snap. Mary at reception (who later changed my room) was a delight as was everyone who worked there. 3. The rooms were very nicely' decorated: even the smaller room was nice -- the only slight drawback was the smaller room's bath which had the \"original tile\" which while clean looked a little old.. 4. Everyone who worked there was very helpful and kind. When I lost my money in the soda machine, the deskclerk led me to the third machine (in the laundry room) and gave me the money I had lost. 5. The Orange Juice and tea at breakfast was tasty. I did not try the bagels but they were large and lots of people appeared to be enjoying them. I've sinced talked to a plumber who told me that the \"sulpur smell\" that I experienced (which was not in the shower, btw) could have resulted from a recent plumbing repair and probably would go away in a week or less.

Convenient to everything, especially Sea World (great for us, since we bought the 5 day pass!). We only used a half-tank of gas for the whole week and probably could have gotten by on much less if not for a foray to the Wild Animal Park. An easy walk into Old Town made this great for late-night dining, too. Breakfast, while not gourmet, managed to fill us up just fine with plenty of good choices-- waffles, bagels, hard-boiled eggs, and oatmeal. That in itself probably saved us an arm and a leg in food costs, doubling the value of this wonderful budget lodging. By the way, we stayed in one of the older economy rooms with a microwave and fridge (they call them \"bungalows\"), and enjoyed it very much. We were in 141, the end unit, which afforded us plenty of privacy and was away from the noise of the pool.

In any event, most reviews on TA are accurate. This is a motel facility on a busy 6 lane highway facing a munitions plant. That said, it was not noisy at all in our room which was not far from the street. We had a king-sized bed, a small desk, a sofa facing an armoire holding a television with basic cable channels. The room was well maintained and the bathroom and dressing area were very tidy. One gripe about most motels, the industrial carpet was not clean - so it's a good idea to bring slippers. The motel makes a great effort to create a pleasant atmosphere in an industrial area. Travel time to the airport is only 5 minutes but we heard no air traffic! The staff are all very friendly. The desk had ample help to facilitate check in for the large crowd as all rooms were sold out the entire weekend.

A bowl of fruit cup and 2 self-serve waffle grills seemed to fascinate many visitors.

So, I went with an open mind. The room we got was not located on the main grounds of the property, it was there older rooms, which I guess are the cheapest, they were located next door to the Inn. I first thought they were an apartment complex, but unfortunetely I was wrong. The room is very small with an even smaller shower stall. i mean I am 5'7, and had to bend over to get my head under the water. So if you envision taking a romantic shower with you significant other, than forget about it. We had a problem with one of the employees (Hanz) checking us in, he was just not the friendliest person in the world and the manager (Batrice) did say he was being trained for the day shift. We were given an upgrade to a room with a refrigerator and microwave which was great to keep some water. But, we found the freezer did not work when we bought some ice cream on night and the next moring we had a milk shake instead. So, if you get a fridge, I would not trust the freezer. The breakfast was very good, much more than you could ask for. Waffles were my favorite. Public Transportation was so close, this was my favorite part of the place, literally a 5 minute walk to the trolley, bus, and cab station. Which was great for us, since we took amtrak and used the trolley to go everywhere. All in all, The Old Town Inn was a decent place to stay, and I might stay here again for a cheap room.

If you read all of the reviews you will get a pretty good idea of the hotel. It was clean but not brand new, had a more than adequate breakfast with enough variety to please just about anyone. We did hear some noise from people above us and when the shower was started for about 5 seconds but no road noise at all. As soon as the people above us moved out it was quiet. We were in a 2 queen- bed room with the gas hot plate (and hood vent) as well as fridge and microwave. We are a small family of Mom, Dad and a 6 year old and we were mostly visiting for all the theme parks. We were only really at the hotel for breakfast and after dinner usually went to bed. It's located very close to Seaworld, the zoo and the airport and only 30 minutes or less from The Wild Life Park and Legoland. We attended all the parks and getting to them was very good with the hotel directions. I think that this hotel is awesome for a family visiting the city for the sights, the pool was clean and our son was the only one in it the few times we went but the weather was mostly overcast. If you have a huge budget, go to a 5 star but if you want to spend your dollars on the sights and park meals etc. then this hotel really helps. A rental car is best but it is very close to public transit if you are only needing to be in town. There is a crosswalk and lights to cross the 4 lane road between the hotel and the trolley/transit system and Old town. As for it being far from restaurants.....again, with a vehicle it is minutes from all the fast food and pizza you can imagine as well as Black Angus, several family restaurants etc. The famed hotel circle is also really close and we drove by it on our way to the Wild animal park and it looked like a zoo. It is just countless hotels on either side of a major freeway so I don't know how any of those places would be either quieter or nicer and the price on most I saw was considerably more than the Old Town Inn. Also there was no parking fee at this hotel to add up the bill. We stayed for an entire week and the front desk was helpful though usually fairly busy. For families with young kids I would really recommend this hotel unless you are made of money and like room service etc! The breakfast had a choice of 3 cold cereals, 3 types of oatmeal, a great fruit salad, hard boiled eggs, 3 types of bagels and cream cheese, white and brown toast, 2 types of fruit pastries, 2 types of muffins, OJ, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and of course the self- made waffles and syrup. Pretty impressive for no extra cost. We were there for the last 4 days of spring break and never had to wait for a table and it was even quieter for our last 3 days.

We exchanged one of our weeks for Desert Springs II and another for Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Newport Coast Villas (Newport CA). and spent two nights at Palm Springs Marquis Villas Resort, with another couple .(I have written reviews on these.) We were on our first California visit. We were on holidays, in California, from January 26 to our return to Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada on Valentines Day February 14th. We arrived home to -40 degree temperature. (It is the same temperature in C. or F.) . We often travel with another couple but this time we were just the two of us.

We followed Trip Advisor for the hotels mentioned and Hermosa Hotel. We found the reports to be very accurate when one considered the consistent comments. (Also checked the reviews on the timeshares, but we were confident we knew what to expect at them.) This was a situation where we were in Newport Beach and had a night and the better part of two days to fill in before our return to Palm Springs. We had thought about going to Mexico but decided that was too much and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we made that decision. While we were at the Newport library, being guest computer users, my wife was looking after emails and I checked out the motels in San Diego on Trip Advisor. Old Town Inn seemed very inexpensive and had gotten good reviews. We felt we had been lucky with Hotel Hermosa in Avalon would we try our luck again? I phoned and was offered a room for $65.00 I booked it! We arrived about 3:00 P.M. my wife wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feeling very well, just a little off. I asked if an upgraded room might be available. I was offered a room with a queen bed, a microwave, and bar fridge. It was a little bigger and $10.00 more. (A Special Price!) My wife rested and I looked around. The pool area was very well looked after, as was the lobby. It appeared all the staff I talked to are proud of the inn! Again, all the positive things that have been said, we agree with. We did not experience any problem with noise or any other negative situations. My wife felt better after a rest. I got direction to Old Town and asked if it was safe for us to walk there. They said they had not had any trouble and we left about 5:30 P.M. for a walk around Old Town. It was great! There were shops and a band, very enjoyable! We got into a Pizza Restaurant,(My wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favorite!) around 9:00 P.M. We enjoyed the meal and walked back to the Hotel. We felt very safe all the time! The next morning, we went for a great breakfast as has been described in other reviews. We bought tickets for the Trolley Tour at the Inn for $28.00 each. (They said leaving our vehicle at the Inn would not be a problem.) We walked to the Trolley in old Town around 10:00 A.M. and had a quick tour of San Diego. We returned about 2:00 P.M. We had a quick lunch and left for Palm Springs about 2:30. This is a very nice hotel, well maintained and would be great for a family. It was great for us.

The bed was very comfortable. The linens and bedspead were in excellent shape. It also had a small refrigerater and microwave. There was a large closet with plenty of space to put luggage. The outside of the hotel was well kept with plenty of free parking. I asked the staff for directions several times and they were always very helpful and knowledgeable. Susannah suggested several Mexican restaurants in Old Town that ended up having very excellent food. She also recommended that I try the trolley to go downtown to a ballgame. It was easy to use and dropped me off right next to Petco Field. The electric trolley train and also the city bus lines, both operate from the Transit Center, conveniently located about 200 yards away. Old Town, a must visit local attraction, is within walking distance right next to the Transit Center. You could just park your car at the hotel and access most places in the San Diego area from here. The trolley will take you to all the way to Mexico. It is also quicker if you consider the time to find a parking place downtown and also cheaper considering the price of parking downtown. I ate breakfast both mornings at their free breakfast bar. It was well stocked with a variety of cereals, breads, fruits, rolls, muffins, bagels, and several different juices, milk, and coffee. I was told they will soon add waffles. Espiranda was stocking the bar and worked as hard as any waitress I have ever seen. She never let anything get depleted. Be sure to tip her if you agree with my assessment. Because of her efforts, your breakfast will be an enjoyable way to start your day. They had a very nice pool area, although I did not have time to use it. After my two night stay here I moved to the Humphrey By the Bay because I wanted a bay view. Old Town Inn outdid the Humphrey in all ways except two, the bay view at Humphreys and the on site restaurant for dinner. In every other way it was better, cleaner, bigger room, and friendlier. That is not a knock on Humphrey's, which is higher ranked, just a complement to Old Town Inn. Old Town Inn was much lower priced. I actually wished I had stayed at Old Town Inn for all four nights. I had never tried a hotel before solely because of reviews like this one. I was very glad I had. If you are used to the Hyatt or similar you may not like this hotel, however you will save at least half on the room, not have to tip everyone who says hello, and save the $15-20 for parking. The rooms will be just as comfortable and the customer ranking of the hotel is probably higher than most of the Hyatts, Hiltons, and Sheratons in town. Compare for yourself.

The economy room is great for the budget, no frills basic but still nice. continental breakfast was exceptional, fruit salad, danish, cereal, muffins, bagels and even hard boiled eggs.

One in our group went to the conference center and it is about 15-25min ride depending on how fast the second trolley arrives at the station (You have to switch from the blue line to the orange line to get to the conference center and anywhere downtown...about 7 total stops) The Old Town Inn has a great continental breakfast and we had no problems as other people mentioned about needing to get up early to get the best out of the breakfast. Even at 8:45 there was plenty of food for us. The hotel was almost completely booked when we made these reservations and I am not sure that our room has always been a non-smoking room but it was very very clean and hard to tell so we didn't ask. We felt safe and comfortable in this location - especially being a group of only females. It is a pretty place and Old Town is really close as are some great Mexican restaurants (and Italian). Other areas are just a trolley stop away. I would recommend this place to others. We paid $85/night but it would have been cheaper had we been able to book sooner and gotten a smaller room.

The front desk girl did not even ask us if smoking room was ok. The curtains were the color of a dirty cigarette filter, and would not close using the string, you had to force them closed by hand. The screen in the window was ripped. There was blood splatter on the bathroom wall. The bathroom window overlooked the lovley smelling garbadge pails. Our bedsheet was greasy and looked like it a used noxema pad. I wonder if they even ever washed them. The sheets felt cheap and itchy. The blanket had burn holes in it. The furniture had burn marks on it from people who left cigarretts there. The room was 9x10, maybe, and there were 5 ashtrays in it. Who the hell needs 5 ashtrays in a room that small. And why would you give a couple a two bed room? We will be sleeping in the same bed. The pool was freezing. Why couldn't they atleast turn ON the heat? The one saving grace is the continental breakfast. I have never seen such a nice spread for a free breakfast. So we were roped in by a bargain discount, and if we had stayed in a regular room, not the bungalows, I think our stay would have been ok.

When we arrived at Old Town about 12:30 pm, Lela advised us that our room was ready for early check-in. What a great way to start our holiday! The Inn is very convenient to most San Diego attractions and they give you typed driving and walking instructions to these attractions. The continental breakfast is very good but the breakfast room does get crowded. The pool is heated and is nicely landscaped. We made good use of it to sun and read a book. The staff are most helpful with suggestions about what to see and where to eat. Erika recommended Casa De Pico at Bazaar Del Mundo in Old Town for Mexican food and very large margaritas. We were not disappointed. Old Town Inn is a mini oasis located in an industrial part of San Diego.

His helpfulness and pleasant voice on the phone is what made me decide to book this Inn....not to mention the reasonable price. Not knowing what to see and do in our down time in San Diego, Lela, at the reception desk at The Old Town Inn offered suggestions and even provided us with walking directions, trolley and vehicle directions!

It is five minutes from Bazaar Del Mundo and The Old Town Historical Park. I felt VERY safe in this Inn and was not uncomfortable returning from the Park on foot at night, unlike being out after dark in Northern CA. The continental breakfast was a nice start to our busy day, but they do get busy. I had made reservations for two nights via telephone a few weeks in advance but got into town a night early. We were able to get a room a night early but we did have to switch rooms the following day because the Inn was booked solid. The night person seemed friendly on the phone when I called to see if they had a room and explained that we had reservations for the following two nights, but when we got there, he seemed like we were putting him out. (This was the ONLY glitch in our stay.) The following day when we came back from Sea World and registered for our reserved room, \"something had happened\" to our reservations and the staff upgraded our room at no additional charge. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the flower gardens and fountain were beautiful, the lobby was very cozy and inviting, the Inn has LOTS of information on attractions on in the area, the breakfast was nicely stocked and very welcome in the busy moring.

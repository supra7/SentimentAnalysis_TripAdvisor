I had stayed at other Hilton group Phoenix airport (PHX) properties before, but not the Hilton Phoenix Airport. Very pleasant surprise! I phoned the hotel from the arrivals level. They told me exactly where to go, gave me an estimated shuttle arrival time, and actually appeared at the pickup point at the time they said they would. The shuttle driver was very friendly. He helped all passengers with their bags. A pleasant shuttle driver goes a long way toward setting the tone for a pleasant hotel stay. Check-in was pleasant and efficient. The Hilton Phoenix Airport has a Hilton Honors level floor with a twenty-four hour lounge with breakfast and evening snack service for Hilton Honors members. The evening service hostess was very pleasant and the snack service was enough for a meal. And since the lounge is open 24 hours, it is possible to stop back in and pick up a beverage. The pool area was very clean. Towels were available. Room was comfortable and well appointed. Many guests were present in the morning to shuttle to the airport. Staff saw the number, quickly found a second driver, and got us all under way in two vans! This was a very welcome stress free and perfect hotel stay from start to finish.

Having stayed at many airport properties, my expectations were quite low, especially since we only paid $65 on a pre-pay rate. After getting our rental car, we arrived at the hotel after midnight and were warmly greeted by the front desk agent. After giving us the room card for our upgraded oversized room on the 4th floor, he went ahead and got us a few bottles of water from the back (nice touch!). Our room was on the 4th floor and turned out to be very spacious, featuring bright colors and modern design. To our surprise the executive lounge was open 24-7 and we were able to get soft drinks even at 1 a.m. in the morning! The hotel itself was very quiet and there was no noise from the airport at all. Next morning we had breakfast in the lounge, which was quite good and I was able to use the computer in the lounge to check in for our next hotel. They also gave us 2 $2 coupons for a discount, in case we wanted a full breakfast in the restaurant, which I thought was a really good idea. The lounge breakfast was good enough for us and after a quick check out we were on our way to the National Parks. Overall the hotel exceeded our expectations. Service was great and the room was great.

I got the hotel by naming my own price on Priceline for $55 a night + tax. If you've ever done the priceline thing, you know what to expect. It's the worst hotel in the category I searched, which was the airport region 3+ stars. That's not to say it was a bad hotel. Its obviously an older property. The room was smallish, the bathroom was truly small, and there were signs of age (water warped bathroom door, tiny amounts of mildew in corners you cant get to, etc.) But my worst complaint was the AC. I like it cold, and granted it was spring, but it wouldn't get much colder than 75 degrees, and imagine in the hot summer desert sun it would be much worse. We had a king room with a sofa bed, on the first floor, facing the courtyard. The room had a sliding glass door, and a small patio where we could see the pool. That was by far the best perk. The hotel is quite near the airport, and fairly central (10 min to Tempe, downtown, Scottsdale and many spring training ballparks). Overall, I'd say it was worth aprrox. 85 dollars a night. There must be better alternatives in a similar class to a Hilton if you're going to spend more than that.

They looked nice and fluffy but once I put my head down, all of the air squished out and my head was pretty much on the bed and the sides of the pillow bubbled up to mimic ear muffs. I had to use three pillows to try to get my head off of the bed. The king sized bed didn't seem very big and the white comforter had a blood stain on it, which was obviously disgusting!

There was a dual-cup coffee maker. A new wi-fi access was being installed while I was there. Before it was completely upgraded, the peak-time speeds were a bit slow. (The hotel should drop the $9.95/day charge for the service.) The bathroom had the usual amenities, but the service was a bit stingy with facial tissue. The staff was invariably polite and helpful. I can't say enough great things about them. I didn't eat in the restaurant, so I can't comment on that. Some reviews point out the infelicitous location. It's near the airport, which has its convenience; I wasn't bothered by airplane noise. There really isn't anything to walk to in the area; you probably want to stay in Scottsdale if being close to nightlife is important to you. Other reviewers point to the sleazy strip clubs, but those facilities are down the main road (University) from the hotel. They are by no means in visual proximity to the hotel. You might want to ask where your room is located with respect to the lobby. My room was about as far from the lobby as it could be--and in this poorly designed building, that was a long ways.

Again, no 'welcome Ms. X' Nothing. Both rooms were acceptable; however the bathrooms need a serious toothbrush scrub. The tile grout was disgusting. The shower head is immovable and the shower curtain is ill-fitting so the floor gets wet and is VERY slippery. Beware, I had a softball size bruise on my knee for about a week after slipping.

Both my sons and I have VERY sensitive skin, and the shower was literally painful for us. The intensity of the stream could not be turned down - just the temperature. Not to mention, five minutes into the shower, you were standing in six inches of water because the tub didn't drain. it was the most miserable shower experience we have ever had. My son was also disappointed with the wireless internet - he could not connect in the room, and the only \"hot spot\" in the hotel was a small area close to the bar downstairs. If you wanted to use the hotel business center, the internet access was not free. However, you can print your boarding passes for free, which was great. Upon checkout, I mentioned all this to the clerk, who was VERY kind. She apologized and said she was not familiar with the showerheads, but she would send Engineering to the room to check it out and to fix the drain. She also said when we stayed there on our return from Denver, she would comp us our breakfasts or give us a suite if one was available. I appreciated her empathetic attitude and the time she took to place several notes on our stay, and she placed notes on our future reservation as well. Upon our return, we were comp'd our breakfasts the next day. We went to the room and before unpacking, I immediately turned on the water to see if the tub and sink drained. They did - however the shower was the same. This time, I literally stood on the side of the tub and examined the showerhead. There was no way to turn down or adjust anything. I called the front desk, briefly repeated our issue from a week ago, and the clerk said he would send Engineering to show how to work the shower. We waited for a little over ten minutes, and the phone rang. It was the manager, who apologized and explained there was no way to adjust the shower stream. I told him I was sorry, but we could not stay here. What made this even more unsettling was the fact it was now close to 11:00 at night and we were exhausted from our trip.

Also, I very frequently stay at Hilton Brand Hotels, and I've been a Hilton Gold member for over five years. That said, my most recent experience at this Hilton has made me never want to stay at another Hilton hotel again. My wife and I stayed her in Mid-March 2011, and it would have been an OK stay, except for the fact that I woke up with 50-60 bed bug bites all over my hands, feet, arms and legs. After a day of intense itching and swelling, I visited a doctor who identified the bites as bed bug bites. I also found out that I was allergic to the bites, and the doctor had to be put on prednisone and topical steroids to treat the swelling. After my wife and I got back from the Doctor, we called the hotel to report that I had been bitten by bed bugs. I wasn't calling to get any type of compensation; I was just trying to make them aware of the problem so they could address it. My hopes were that they could prevent other customers from being bitten and help prevent the further spread of these pests. When I finally was able to reach the manager, he was belligerent, rude, and inferred that I was making the entire thing up. There was no, I'm sorry to hear you were bitten, or is there anything we can do for you. Instead, he said, that the person that stayed the day after I did didn't complain about bites, and if I wanted to file a claim that I needed to contact their insurance company. I explained that I didn't want to file a claim, and that I just wanted to make sure that the issue was being taken seriously. From there the manager just became more belligerent and haughty, so I finally just gave up talking to him. Bed Bugs are becoming more and more common, and it the attitudes, apathy, and ineffectiveness of manager's like this that allows continued rapid spread. If this Hilton continues to treat all cases of bed bugs like they did my case, it will be overrun in a matter of weeks. I would strongly recommend avoiding this hotel at all costs.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cStep Inside - You'll Never Believe this is an Airport Hotel\u201d", "Author": "I_Notice_Everything", "ReviewID": "UR98589922", "Content": "This airport Hilton is beautiful.

I got a seriously low rate on a King suite directly though the Hilton.com website. NOTE: This hotel, while close, is still about a 15-20 minute drive to the airport in the heavy Phoenix morning traffic so please plan accordingly. My first impressions weren't very good for this hotel. It's a large, but older Hilton property and there was construction underway on the parking lot. This (along with the lack of clearly marked signs) made it difficult to even find the entrance to the lobby. Then, since the main lot was closed for construction, I had to park on the back of the building and walk (in the 100 degree Arizona heat). BUT...once inside I was stunned and pleased to find a very nice, two-story atrium lobby complete with shops and a restaurant. The King suite was clean and big---almost the size of a one bedroom apartment. The bathroom was huge with double sinks on a sprawling u-shaped marble vanity and a separate tub and shower. Room service was fast and tasty. I was delighted to find that the pool and hot tub are open 24-hours a day and require a guest key to get in for added security. The pool area was large, nice, and very clean with a nice music selection playing and the hot tub made for a relaxing late night experience (although the water needed to be hotter). Overall, this hotel is a great value for the money. The main drawback is that it's big and old, so everything from the building entrances to the decor in the rooms and throughout the hotel needs to be renovated and updated to give it that modern, classy feel I've come to expect from Hilton.

To keep the review fairly short i'll just list the issues in bullets: - The room (366) absolutely stinks of stale smoke - it must have once been a smoking room - Most of the buttons on the phone do not appear to work: busy for room service (tried 5 times), no answer to wake up call, does not even dial for operator - Condition of room is very shabby, carpet is old and coming off the grounds, general cleaniness is very bad (not a cleaning issue, more an age issue) - Television system somewhat faulty (there is a channel that scrolls though the porn offerings (does not actually show the movies) which be an issue for some people with kids - Wirless internet signal is to weak to use (at least in my room) On the positive side, room service was on time and fairly decent, and they gave you 2 bottles of cold water on arrival. Overall this is the worse Hilton (or Garden Inn) i have stayed in (I have stayed in many)... some other people seem to have had positive experiences but I just thought it prudent to add a word of caution.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, NE", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "Husker4theSpurs", "ReviewID": "UR25118471", "Content": "I thought this place was perfect for what we were looking for ... clean, convenient location, and great price on Priceline ... front desk lady was really helpful as well!!

By looking at the other reviews, we booked with Hotwire (If you pick the Airport area, they have an unnamed 3-star hotel in the area, that's likely the Airport Hilton) and paid less than $55 (with taxes and fees). PROS: Quality restaurant (Rennick's) on-site. Very good food. Extraordinarily comfortable beds. Down comforter ... very nice. Staff is trained to be extra nice ... but not too smarmy. There's a grill + sports bar on site. We didn't go in, but having one there is a plus, considering one of the \"cons\" Price: Again ... this is a 3-star hotel that we booked for cheap. Their normal going rate is over $100. HUGE, puffy towels ... very nice. MP3 player plugin on clock radio ... CONS: Location. This area is rife with strip clubs and auto-body shops. There's ZERO to do/see within a couple miles. Downtown Tempe is several miles east, so that's the best bet. It's also kind of out of the way, on the SE side of the airport. High-Speed Internet: They charge $9.95 for access ... with 1- and 2-star hotels offering it for free, it's time this place does the same. Decor: Yes, it's supposed to be a Southwestern motif, but it's a little old and worn. Time for a remodel. TV: The remote looked like it went through a dryer ... And some of the \"buttons\" didn't work. The TV itself was an old, fuzzy Zenith. That needs updating too. CONCLUSION: Excellent hotel for the price, but ONLY for the price.

We booked a king room on the executive floor (which is the fourth and top floor of the hotel). The room was large and also contained a settee, coffee table, desk and chair. There was an in-room safe, coffee maker (teabags also provided), hairdryer, iron and ironing board. Our balcony faced on to the pool area. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed lovely and comfortable. The bathroom was small, but nicely furnished and had a large selection of Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries.

Our package included breakfast and on the second evening we ate in the hotel restaurant (there is also a bar which also serves meals). The food was delicious and the service very good. There are other hotels in the vicinity, which may also serve food, but we were quite happy to eat in the hotel. We had pre-booked a Gray Line tour for the second day - \"Valley of the Sun\" - and thoroughly enjoyed this. Special thanks here go to our tour guide Charlie, who also picked us up at the hotel and dropped us off again at the end of the tour. The hotel also has a fitness centre, business centre and small gift shop. At the end of our stay we travelled by courtesy transport back to the airport to pick up a rental car and for a nominal $5 charge we were driven directly to the car rental centre.

The bathroom was tiny, but compared to the rest of the hotel, it was beautiful. Everything in the room looked clean, but I didn't dare sit on the couch or the desk chair. The lamp switches were all slightly sticky, and I did my best to ignore that. As with all Hilton hotels nowadays, there were cards with instructions about how to get the sheets and towels changed. Since I was only there for two nights, I ended up putting the do-not-disturb sign out the entire time (no need for housekeeping to come in if they're not going to change my sheets or towels.) Two things made the entire stay a 3 star instead of a 2 star. First, the sheets were completely clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Second, the bathroom was clean, and the water pressure was great. In terms of location, this Hilton is apparently in a weird place. Two different long-time Phoenix residents had trouble finding the place because it is (a) not near most other airport hotels, (b) off a little-known \"highway\" that's only two miles long, and (c) near some bad parts of town.

I got my key and started walking to my room. The hotel is a big square and I think I was on the exact opposite corner of the hotel. The room was spacious and clean with very comfortable bedding. The decor was a little over the top Southwest, but I guess it comes with the territory. The workout room was ok, but the A/C was broken when I was there in that room and so it was quite warm (even at 5:30am) - they had the window cracked, but it was still pretty toasty. Overall, a pretty decent stay.", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cGood Business Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jbasil", "ReviewID": "UR8029881", "Content": "Very nice hotel for business travelers - very few kids.

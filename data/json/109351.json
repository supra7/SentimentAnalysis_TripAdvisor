Internet functioned well. Did not use hotel dining options, but the coffee smelled great! If the hotel is full, finding a parking space may be difficult, but we managed okay for three days. Location is easy to navigate. Too cold for the pool. Hot tub looked in good condition, but we did not use. Room furniture is very functional with a small sofa and a desk. The desk has an additional pull-out table that makes for versatility in working or eating. Nice. Our room had a coffeemaker but no frig or microwave, which was no problem for this stay. Coffeemaker is the single cup style with pods (not K-cups.) I often bring my own coffee, but in this case I could not use it.

Whether those don't exist anymore, or whether Marriott is foolishly trying to extend their cachet to more profitable hotels, I don't know. Long story short - there is no courtyard at this Courtyard.

Modern and friendly.\u201d", "Author": "littlejet", "ReviewID": "UR94193756", "Content": "We just came back from staying 2 nights at this hotel and found it extremely comfortable. It's quite modern and updated. The lobby is done in an unusual color mix of gray, orange, and slate blue but it works. In the lobby there's also a large touch screen that you can manipulate to get various news and weather info, as well as info about special events. There was one seating area next to some bookshelves that actually had a couple of decent books like, \"1000 Places to See Before You Die\". The art throughout the hotel was mainly art photos with a modern feel. There is a Starbucks that is merged with a little bistro in the lobby. They've got various breakfast items including made-to-order eggs, healthy options, muffins, etc. If you get a room deal that includes breakfast, it actually comes from this little bistro, not from a typical hotel breakfast buffet. The little bistro also has sandwiches and other things for lunch and dinner as well as beer. The room was clean and neat. LOTS of hot water - you can fill the tub with scalding hot water if you want. The soaps/shampoos provided are pretty basic, not anything to write home about. The beds were incredibly comfortable. There was free Internet but not Wi-fi, i.e. you had to sit at the desk to connect your computer to the Internet cable they provide. One cool thing about the desk though is that there is an oblong table on legs that is completely detached from the desk and sits under it. We could pull the table out for our 5 year old son to do his homework on while my husband sat at the desk. But you could also arrange this table so that you've got a side table at right angles to the desk, effectively giving you twice the desk space if you needed it. We were in room 230, extremely quiet. The staff at the front desk and the bistro/Starbucks were great, very friendly, not intrusive or pushy. ***...BEST THING WE FOUND ABOUT STAYING HERE...*** Adjacent to the hotel is a small nondescript strip mall with a questionable looking massage parlor in it. In this strip mall is a Thai food restaurant called Bangkok Thai Cuisine. My husband and I love Thai food and have eaten at many Thai restaurants across the country. This was some of the best Thai food we've had in years!! Even our 5 year old son who'd never had Thai food before said it was the best food he's ever had in his whole life, especially the mango sticky rice dessert.

This hotel was $129 per night, they charged for breakfast where most other hotels have a better, FREE breakfast, and when I tried looking at the newspaper on the front desk counter Saturday morning just to see if my girlfriend, who was interviewed, was actually in it, I was \"reprimanded\" by the front desk agent. I told her I was just checking something quick, and she quickly made me feel like a 5 year old by pulling the paper away and telling me it was $1.00. I am not cheap by any means, but guess what, raise the rate $5.00 and have free breakfast and a Saturday newspaper.... As far as the hotel itsself, the rest of the staff was \"dallas friendly\". The rooms were definitely outdated... I felt like I was trapped in the 80's. Tell you what... Do yourself a favor and stay 2 miles up the street at the Embassy Suites...

First, the pros; Manager was nice, pool was great,*heated* comphy bed, good food, I like those mini coffee pots, nice location...of the hotel. Now the cons, the maids. ALWAYS the maids. =S Heres my story, I drove SEVERAL hours and was beat. I was on the 3 or 4th floor faceing the lobby, where they set up breakfast. How do I know? Well, the Noise, noise NOISE. At the crack of dawn as employees would make themselves know that they were setting up breakfast b/c I can hear it LOUD and clear. I didnt complain b/c they were just doing their job....in a LOUD way. So I lost several hours of sleep after I was dead beat tired from the long drive. The next con was, on the day of checkout, being at noon*forgot* trying to get as many minutes left on sleep, at 7something am the MAID unlocked my door, Didnt announce herself, ENTER MY ROOM, TURN THE LIGHTS ON and say 'oops.\" when she realize I was still there. I said to her, I found out later she didnt speak english, I have sevarl hours in this room left. I always put everything together before the checkout day so I can rest, washup and leave w/o worrying about anything else. But back to my story, She leaves and I look at the clock, the time being close to 8am, checkout at noon/or 11, one of the two. I try to sleep through the workers making noise with the dishes downstairs and 30 minutes later, the maid walks in, turns the lights on, yanks my sheets off and says 'oops' and walks out. I put the do not disturb sign up and try to fall asleep. 40 minutes later, she opens the door AGAIN!! Turns the lights on and realizes Im there and says 'you no go?\" \"No, you go.\" She did and guess what, she does it again. It was rediculous so I call downstairs and complain about the lady. I cant sleep now since people are laughing and talking excessively loud and I go to wash up. I come out of the bathroom and shes back in my room pulling the sheets off my bed. I complained downstairs and they were nice to give me a free stay, though I would of liked my money back. Still, they were nice about it.

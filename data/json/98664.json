The sole reason I booked this room was to take advantage of a points promo the Carlson Club is running. Check-in was nice and quick. The lady behind the counter was very nice. The rooms themselves were much better than expected. They are large, had a decent bathroom, a mini fride, a microwave and a medium sized HD TV. The bedding was very comfortable. The reason I give it a 3 instead of a 4 is because of the location. It's in a seedy area of Dallas where there's really not much to do. The hotel makes you use your room key to enter into their halls. I suspect this is to keep out the riff raff. Parking is free and I think I saw free wireless. You could certainly do worse.

After a complicated and confusing trip to the hotel - nobody in the area knew were the hotel was and route planners couldn't find it either - we found the surroundings to be dingy and run down. Inside, we were positively surprised by the seemingly new interior. Rooms themselves were large and beds were comfortable. However, service couldn't keep up with that impression - the rooms were cleaned only superficially (hairs from other guests on pillows etc.) and crumbs on the carpet. The worst moment of the stay was a Texas-sized cockroach walking up the wallpaper from behind the bed. We asked for quick assistance from the front desk, insisted multiple times while the roach strolled up and down the room, but housekeeping was not in a hurry at all and didn't seem motivated to do anything about it. About an hour later, we gave up and switched our room. The pool was alright, could have been a been cleaner though (used plasters etc. in the pool). Surroundings contrast the hotel's interiors completely: rundown apartment buildings, sex shops and the like next door make the Radisson seem out of place. Parking spaces can be accessed by anyone, people hang around the area at night, doesn't give you a safe feeling and makes you worry about your car. Amenities are not in the immediate neighborhood, a mile or two away, but their seems to be a shuttle service from the hotel. Downtown is about 20 miles away. All in all, I would recommend this hotel to the budget conscious traveller who has a car to get around in the area.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA bit skeezy\u201d", "Author": "Guzilla", "ReviewID": "UR68607398", "Content": "For an alleged 3 star hotel, I expected much more. The lobby and ballrooms all looked nice and polished. But go further into the hotel and it's not near so nice as your first impression might lead you to think. The rooms were ok...the sleep number beds are always comfy. The bathroom was cramped. The hallways weren't as nice as they may have once been. The pool was downright awful...it was dirty, the area around the pool was dirty, and they had no towels available at the pool. The location is right up against a bunch of downmarket apartments.

I experienced a housekeeper cleaned my room and left all my personal items on the first drawer wet!!!! I had a natural spring water tank on top of the drawer and I saw that the housekeep cleaned my room a bit and left for lunch so I stayed during lunch and left for her to finish cleaning my room. I came back and my room was cleaned but things on the first drawer have been pulled out and soaked wet. No one informed me this not even the front desk and I went to see the manager and he said the lid just came off naturally!!! But it's a jet water tank with closed valve and the tank was not broken nor leaked. He said it just happened like that and even I said if accusing the drinking water's company, it's not logic enough since the drinking water's company wouldn't be able to launch its product in the market if its lids come off naturally. They did not take any responsibility so the service is awful and the management team is one of a kind that I have never seen anything this bad. Extremely bad impression and all I can say it's just exactly like all the other reviews about this hotel. If you want to come here think hard.....it's one of a kind that would give you a nightmare. If I haven't paid for the course which includes the hotel, I would definitely moved out. Not worth your money and why wasting it on poor standard as such. Awful manager and unprofessional service. Nothing good in my eyes for this hotel.

There appears to be a new wing being added with more rooms. The hotel does have an exercise room and a pool. The restaurant is currently closed, but should open up soon. Attending a conference here, we were served a buffet by the hotel from the restaurant kitchen. I found the food served by the hotel for the conference was very good and satisfied. The remodeled rooms all have Sleep Number beds and my room had a microwave and refrigerator. The front desk told me that when all is done all rooms will have the Sleep Number beds, microwaves and refrigerators in each room. The facilities would be acceptable for someone passing through for a night. If you are here for a conference plan on renting a car to take you to places other than the local neighborhood. If you are without transportation, be aware: Walking about the neighborhood at night is not recommended. In fact, you might be wary even in the day time. Homeless people congregate, live and sleep 24 hrs a day under the dark freeway overpass less than 75 yards away. The closest place to eat outside the hotel is at a Waffle House about a half mile away and you must walk through the gauntlet of homeless people to get there. Otherwise, plan on driving 3+ miles for food. Two convenience stores are within a short walking distance, but visit them before dark (one requires a walk through the gauntlet of homeless people). The hotel does have a van and will take you to within a five mile radius for dining and shopping, which would be your best bet. Downtown Dallas is 10+ miles away and there is really nothing close other than a few stores about four or five miles down the road. There is no access to the DART system and even taxi cabs didn't know where this place was located.

One thing you should know however is that the free bottled water that comes with the Executive Level rooms means one small bottle. The hotel does need to pay more attention to cleanliness and their impression. For the entire stay, there were two trash cans and a \"Wet Floor\" sign left in the hallway on the Executive Level.

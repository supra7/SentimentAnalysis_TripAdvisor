A true value for your dollar for those looking for above average lodging at budget prices. I enjoyed my time by the pool and also ate dinner at the attached coffee shop restaurant which featured \"home style\" comfort food. As a retired flight attendant, I have stayed at hundreds of hotels and understand what a traveler is looking for in their lodging requirements.

Just before we left, I had checked out some other travel reviews and was very nervous once reading many of them. However, I kept an open mind and we arrived on the 17th. Prior to leaving, I had called our travel agent and she had called the resort. They promised her that they would give us one of their \"softly renovated rooms.\" When we arrived, we were told that we were poolside, so we headed to our room to check it out. When we opened the door and took a look around, we were SO disappointed! Softly renovated meant that the furniture had dints and gouges out of it, the walls had been painted over gouges and pieces of it missing, the electrical sockets weren't even attached to the wall, the bathroom was old, and the tub dingy. The bath mats were gray each day and twice we had \"fresh\" towels put in our bathroom that had hair on them---not ours! The bathroom tiles had pieces missing out of them, and had been painted over to cover all of the chip marks----not even in matching paint. The air conditioner worked, but didn't keep the room at an even temperature. The one-pane sliding windows had no screen-----everything but the toilet was old! You could hear our neighbours through the walls at all times of the evening/night. The door had no weather stripping on it at all, didn't close properly and as a result you could hear everything that was going on outside. The chair looked like something that most people would have thrown out! We were disappointed enough to be willing to lose our money that had been paid early in the spring and move to another hotel, but unfortunately, didn't find one available for the time we needed----most were booked. We will NEVER stay here again!! It was a great location for getting to all the tourist sights, however, there are many other hotels on that same street that would be much better and more comfortable.

I had read the reviews and as there were mixed reviews I thought it probably was just because people were too choosy....I was wrong. This place is a dump. I had booked originally for 2 nights but cancelled the second night as soon as we got there. We were supposed to have a 'superior' room. We were given room 805, which was substandard at best. The room was smelly, it was dirty and the bathroom was disgusting. I picked up the phone to call reception and the inside of the handset was black with dirt. I could not hold the phone so I hung up while the guy said he would check if there were other rooms available. I got to the reception before he did anything. We were given a 'newly decorated room' according to the reception.....not. The second room was a bit bigger but the same old and tired d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The beds were uncomfortable and creaked every time you moved, so none of us got much sleep. My sons went for a swim and said the pool was ok but while they were in the jacuzzi some people came alone with drink (which is I think the third pool they refer to on their website). If you don't mind you children being subjected to that this is the place for you! Myself and my wife decided the only way to stay in this dump would be slightly numbed with a few drinks. In the list of facilities it indicates there is a sports bar, so we went to have a few drinks and a game of pool. The bar was full of local people having a pool tournament, so I ask you can the hotel honestly say that this is a guest facility if guests are not able to get access. I complained to a manager about the supposed-to-be-hotel, I needed to get it off my chest. The lady said she would follow it up and call me in the next day........that did not happen.

The wallpaper was peeling off the walls in both the bathroom and the bedroom. The rooms are in need of a major refurb!! There's a restaurant onsite, although I'd compare it more to a diner. It too is in need of a major refurb. Some of the booth seats had tape on them covering holes in them. The food was just okay.

Third-party prices fill rooms, and provide the business with opportunities to sell services and win future customers. My advice to Priceline customers: pay attention to reviews, articulate your needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet and you bought from Priceline, tell Priceline in writing; use snail mail to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found them responsive. Talk to local management directly and pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational.] Very economical for me for one week on Priceline, this hotel is on an exceptionally beautiful large footprint in Mission Valley, located on the service road just S of the I-8, improbably named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hotel Circle North.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rooms are basic and dark, my room much too small for the enormous heavy furniture that populated it. My \u00e2\u20ac\u0153king\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room barely contained a king bed, a huge TV cabinet-dresser-closet, a huge easy chair, crumbling plaster around the old temperature control unit, and a spare desk/chair. Movement from one part of the room to another required moving furniture. Email asking for a refrigerator at check in was answered by telling me I should not have booked thru Priceline, and my request was forwarded to a front-desk supervisor who never answered it. (I gave u email and just asked for the refrig at check in.) There was no TV remote; it was later replaced. The ancient heating-cooling system didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond, and was eventually replaced with a new one. The personnel involved with me were terrific, of particular note the housekeeper (who I tipped generously, twice) and a night maintenance person who cheerfully replaced the AC unit. BIG PLUSSES: Ample free parking, flawless WI-FI, a beautifully-landscaped premises and pools, a self-service laundry on the property, free local and 800-calls, computer with printer near front desk. NEED HELP: outdated decor, bedding just OK, space much too small for oversized furniture, very thin walls and night noise from other guests, and severe attitude from a front-desk person who declined (in a pretty absolute manner) to find me another room (hotel was overbooked) when the AC system started heating the room at 11 PM one night. (The hotel does, however, have cooperative relationships with other area properties to care for guests who find themselves bumped or in awkward situations, when an environmental problem (like a non-working AC) means a guest need can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be properly met.) A local pizza company stuffs fliers noisily into the room each afternoon, in violation of hotel policy; and apparently calls to it from hotel rooms are blocked!) The on-premise restaurant serves basic but fresh American food staples, generously portioned, lots of specials, pleasant servers. Hotels in this area are close to everything, downtown/Balboa Park/Hillcrest is 3 miles. Local drivers, who will cross three freeway lanes at 60 mph to an exit ramp, are frightening.

Unless a room has been checked out of there is no reason for maid service to just open my door. It would have been nice if the front desk staff would have said something or that there was some kind of notification in the room that a maid would be by that early. I exchanged our towels and asked for more coffee for the next day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she happily took care of my needs. But she did want to come in to clean \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We were a 3 day stay, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like people in my room while my things are there. The room is fairly large, nicely appointed. The coffee pot is an actual pot with ceramic mugs not paper cups. That was nice. It made 4 cups. The hairdryer actually worked. They do have a safe and a nice size closet. However, that's about it. The room shown on their webpage was not the room we were given, an unnecessary bait-and-switch. Attempts had been made to upgrade the room. Granite tops for the nightstand, desk and coffee area. Newly upholstered and appointed bed, beds were far from large. A full size is not large. The TV remote worked about half the time. Private balcony overlooking the 1940-1950\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style courtyard was nice, table and chairs were plastic with cigarette burn holes and definite rot on the boards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although they did try to paint over it. We had a spider crawl across us the first night in our bed. Lovely. As to cleanliness: The items that touch a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skin were clean. However, the carpet edges had never seen a crevice tool, the edges in the bathroom the same. The walls in the bathroom had several hand prints and foot prints on the wall paper and the door trim was grimy. I am a previous rental unit manger so I wet down a washcloth just to see how easily it came off. Plain water did the trick so I attribute the issue to poor management of the cleaning staff. Obviously the rooms are not inspected after they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cleaned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The upkeep of the entire hotel inside and out shows decay and rot. The wallpaper has been patched instead of replaced, the vaulted ceiling has been painted white over dark wood, and is now cracked and coming off in large pieces. At night you can see where all the other patchwork has taken place. They have a laundry, but the area is foul, both in upkeep and atmosphere. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel safe down there. 3 washers and 3 dryers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cost is 2.00 per load there is not a bill changer so make sure you have quarters!! You will need to go to the convenience store/booze store (with that type of crowd) onsite and deal with their rudeness to purchase laundry soap. The bathroom is dismally small and in bad repair. It is all inclusive. The sink is in with the tub and toilet, very little counter space. The sink cabinet is melamine and is peeling. They do have Sauve shampoo and conditioner for your use. The tub does not hold water, the massaging shower head had one setting (if you tried to change it fell apart in your hand) , the coupling to attach the shower to the wall is coming off. But the pressure and temp were good. There is a sweet tattered note taped to the wall that states that if you should wish to take their thread bare scratchy towels they will happily charge you ( on that note, there is a LARGE sign at check-in that states that they will hold funds on your card for up to 72 days, so beware) This hotel is on Hotel Circle. There are SEVERAL other places to stay. I would recommend that you do. But as stated, make sure that you have a car. It's a pain. The one saving grace to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is the on-site restaurant. (the other plus would have been the gas station, but it is closed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you will have to go up I-8 to find one close) Very Friendly staff in the restaurant, attentive servers. They have a great Breakfast special at 6.99 with several choices and the Blue Plate Special at 7.99 that starts at 11 am and goes until they close \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are other restaurants in the same area, all are in the other hotels. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rate the Bar or the Gym. We went to neither. But the Gym is up the hill and behind the hotel. It looks nice from below. They do have vending and Ice Machines. The pool is okay but much smaller than the one shown in the picture from the web. They do have a hot tub, my family told me that it was nice and warm, but after looking at the mediocre attempt at cleanliness in the room I opted out of the hot tub experience. Oh yes, the noice level. From everywhere but our next door neighbors who kept slamming the balcony door - very quiet.

In April, I was at a conference in San Diego, the weather was beautiful and I had time to visit with family. Knowing it had a pool and a resort feeling, and I had also, stayed at another property owned by the same company (I am very happy with the quality of that hotel). I went on line and got (what I thought at the time, was a good deal), the weekend rate of $105 per night for a double room. Your first sign should be the lobby and its tired decor. Although the staff was helpful and did try to accommodate my comfort. The old Hollywood feel of this \"resort,\" is deceiving. I had requested a double room, quiet on the top floor. I was given a double room, below a two level freestanding building, with a bank of rooms on two levels. No elevators in this facility. As I drove up to the door (parking is outside your entry door) a young man, directly on the floor above, was sitting outside his room on the balcony walkway, drinking a can of beer. Not an encouraging sign for a Grandmother, hoping to spend time entertaining her family. The room was marginal at best, dinghy and dirty, the window was right next to the bed and the bathrooms were small and not very up to date. The 805 freeway borders this property, as convenient as that makes it for access, there is no escaping the noise, and there is freeway noise, but it was the idea of the young man upstairs with the beer, who encouraged me to ask for another room. I went back to the desk and was given (without question) another option, a handicap room with one bed, also facing the freeway on the first floor. This room was a single handicap, with a walk-in shower; it was not any cleaner and still very noisy, again with parking outside the door. Back to the lobby, for the third room. This room was a little away from the freeway and closer to the pool, a little larger, but the beds were still right next to the window, no parking in front, so that helped, but the noise was very apparent. At this point, I should have cut bait and run, but I was tired and with my Grandson, who wanted to swim, so we decided to try for at least one night. This room had a toilet that ran all night, and was necessary to jiggle the handle several times to stop it. The TV reception was fuzzy and not all the stations worked. Noise from the freeway went on all night, so I slept with earplugs.

I should have listened to the negative reviews on this site & stayed somewhere else. Let me also say that I have stayed at 5 star hotels and also Motel 6. This resort makes Motel 6 look like a 5 star hotel! My wife & I were in town for a charity event so I booked a room for 2 nights via the hotel website & checked in on 4/11/08. Upon entering the stuffy lobby, the absence of air conditioning is very apparent & was replaced by the sound of an electric fan. I started to wonder what type of establishment we were in when I was given directions to our room and told to turn right at the mini mart. Upon opening the door to the room we were immediately met with a strong musty smell. The feeling you get upon entering the room is that this is a place where you need to think twice about removing you shoes and walking around in your socks or bare feet. The carpet was wrinkled and old. The TV remote was sitting in a pile of crude on one of the night stands. The paint on the celing had seen its better days and was mostly peeling. The wallpaper had holes in it & was also peeling. The bathroom had hair on the ceiling above the shower. The bathroom vanity had also seen it's better days & was in sad shape. The bathroom light fixture was rusty & had 4 light bulbs - 2 of which worked. the bathroom was so small that if one person is using the toilet, no one else can enter the room. When I placed the phone book on the writing/ sitting desk, the phone book stuck to the top of the desk. We were forced to stay at this \"resort\" for one night as all of the other local hotels were sold out. First thing the next morning we checked out & found another hotel to stay at for the remainder of our trip. No one asked why we were checking out early & no one seemed to care. Had the room rate been $50.00 per night then this would have been a situation of \"you get what you pay for\". When you are paying $144.00 per night, I at least expect a clean room in decent shape.

After complaining to the front desk, we were moved into a deluxe suite (free of charge) which somewhat resembled the picture on the website. It was roomier, brighter, warmer and surprisingly quiet considering the pool (clean, warm and full of fresh towels) was directly outside our door. Nevertheless, it had a small bathroom. To put it plainly, expect to have bruised knees if the door opens while you're sitting on the toilet. Also, the only towel rod for a room which sleeps 4 was broken so that the towels were sliding off one end.

However, that said, the food at the restaurant is still very good and the service prompt. The store on property is incredibly convenient. The rooms are adequate but note that the sink is in the bathroom so its harder for two people to get ready, although there is a vanity/desk with coffee maker outside the bathroom. There is room service here, convenient but of course slightly higher priced. The pool is nice and the bartender in the tavern will make you drinks in styrofoam cups to take to the pool.

I would recommend this hotel, because we did get a good deal on it and hotels in San Diego are soooo expensive. But I didn't expect such dank, dark rooms.", "Date": "July 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cRUN to the nearest Motel 6!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3687731", "Content": "Due to the price paid, and the word \"resort\" in it's name, I certainly expected much more. My daughter and I stayed, on vacation, for 3 nights. Where do I start? The carpet and bedding was damp when we walked in. Contributed it to the humidity, which I thought they would have done something, anything, to keep the rooms from feeling \"sticky\". The room itself is as pictured, however, is about half the size it appears to be. The remote to the tv didn't work, and when asked about it and told it would be changed, well, lets say we had to get up and down to change channels/volume the entire time. Maid service. Despite the \"Privacy Please\" sign, we were woken up at 7:30am by loud knocking from housekeeping. MAJOR no-no for me! The bathroom. When we arrived, there was hair in the sink, the lotion, shampoo and soap had all been USED and not replaced! GROSS GROSS GROSS. We ended up going to the store and buying our own. The major kicker - I paid for the room up front in cash, as well as a $150 security deposit, in cash. They turned around and charged my debit card the $150 deposit! When I realized I needed to get money from my ATM and discovered the \"missing money\", I asked the front desk if they charged my debit card. I got a very firm \"No, we did not because you gave us cash\". This was on Sunday. I couldn't call my bank until the next morning, which I did. Sure enough, they DID charge it AND take my cash. I had to fight with management in order to get them to release the hold at my bank so my daughter and I could return home! The staff - Most were very courteous, however, very lacking in their knowledge of giving correct directions or even knowing where the nearest Starbucks was (it's in Fashion Valley Mall, across the freeway!). When asking about transportation, they were a bit clueless to everything but the Old Town Trolley and making a call to a scuzzy cab company. The Restaurant and Liquor store - Saved the day! The store had soap, shampoo, every kind of first aid needed and tons of snacks. A bit pricey, but that's normal for a convenience store. The restaurant staff was wonderful, the food good but a little high priced for what you get. We found up the street a bit a place called Ricky's which we ate at the remainder of our time there. FABULOUS food, great service and prices you can't beat! Overall..........find a Motel 6! Much cheaper and the rooms are just as clean and accomodating, if not more, than Mission Valley Resort.

But this place...oh, where to begin. We booked the place despite some negative reviews on this site. Heck, there are negative reviews about our favourite hotel on this site, so we take it all with a shaker of salt. A mistake on my part. First of all, the positives. The family restaurant, though most portions of the food served was inviting Coronary Artery Disease (however I find this a US phenomenon not limited to this restaurant), was open late, had good service, and reasonably priced. The Liquor store next door was fabulous, perfect for late-night munchies and of course, the liquor, which we needed substantial amounts to get us through our reservation period at this hotel. The pool - nice, clean, beautiful surroundings with giant rose bushes and floral gardens. The fun stuff ends there folks. The room was dank, dark, the lights worked at varying intervals that could only be attributed to the lunar cycle, the carpet was dirty. It started out as an \"OK\" on the cleanliness factor, and deteriorated to \"Disgusting\" on the day we checked out. The bathtub did not drain - AT ALL. We left a comment about this on the \"housekeeping comment card\" which then proceeded to sit in the exact same table location we had left it on the first day. Of course, travelling with my mom and step-father - who is a hairy guy, if I may be so blunt - the tub and bathroom was filled with disgusting hair by the end of our trip. I hated taking a shower and didn't touch ANYTHING while I was in there. Oh yes, the supersonic toilet. I suppose this is a California water-saving thing, but the toilet had a button on top that you had to push to flush, and you had to pound on it to elicit any effect at all. When you pounded hard enough, the toilet flushed with such ferocity that I started hanging on to loose jewellry/hair/clothing lest I be sucked into the vortex never to be heard from again. Service was adequate, but I felt sorry for the folks who worked there - it has to be damaging to the self-esteem to be forced to wear a neon hawaiian shirt to work every single day. They also advertise the Trolley stops outside the front door. If the front door is Old Town State Park, which is a two mile drive away, they are correct. Trust me, I am not a whiner. I have stayed in some grotty hotels. This is the second grottiest. The only reason the other hotel in my grotty category wins first prize is that it had bullet holes in the door and no towels.

I have stayed here twice, in 2004. The first time they had apparently just changed from a Quality Inn, so perhaps the rough edges were due to the transition. Both times I booked via an internet service, just trying to find somewhere cheap. This is a very basic two-story walkup type place. Rooms are standard motel room, but are generally in very good repair, perhaps recently renovated. Location is convenient for freeway access to attractions downtown. The 24-hour restaurant is adequate for the very hungry having just arrived in town. The 24-hour convenience store is a big bonus, you can stock up on snacks. No view, you're on Hotel Circle, i.e. the freeway. The staff, however, have always been universally rude and unhelpful. Checking in takes forever, and the staff are not interested in room preferences, or indeed your very presence.

The staff could not handle the full house, check-in took over an hour with only 4 guests in front of me. They lost one reservation, forcing the gentleman to find another hotel, and they had another reservation under a completely different name. The non-smoking room I was in clearly had been smoked in and reeked of that hotel deodorizer. The hotel is right next to I-8 and the freeway noise is constant. The buildings were clearly built decades ago and have poor insulation and noise reduction. On the second day, the electronic lock broke on my door, forcing the staff to break in. After two hours working on the door I was told that it couldnt be fixed until the morning, and since there were no other rooms avalible, I would have to live with a door that doesen't lock. It took alot of arguing, but they \"found\" another room, which smelled just as bad. That day I came back to find that the cleaning staff had left my door ajar all day. On the plus side, the numerous pools are nice and the place is pretty kid friendly. The 24hr on-site resturant has awful food, but works in a pinch.

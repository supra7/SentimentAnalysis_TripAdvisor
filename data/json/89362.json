When we pulled up we started to think that this hotel looks nothing like the pictures on the internet, so we went to the front desk and everything went very smoothly. We were given 2 rooms, 1 room 2 beds and another with a double bed. As we went on to our own rooms I received a text about 15 minutes later from my buddy stating that there were blood stains in his bathtub, on the wall, on the sheets, and if you were to look at there door it looked as someone had shot the door twice with a gun. Every door we had after that they were pryed back as if someone were trying to break in, also the security volts in our room were broke which goes along with someone else\u2019s opinion when they stated that there laptop was stolen. So as I was on my way over to their room I spoke with one of the room attendants and I politely asked her to get them new sheets. When I returned back to my room our A/C had been on for about 45 minutes and our room was still not cold and the A/C unit was blowing out hot air. We went down to the front desk and were given a new room right next door, so we packed up our belongings and moved for the second time and turned on that A/C unit. We decided to stock our fridge with soda to keep it cold, and there was no refrigerator. I went to use the shower before myself and friends went out to dinner and I look down and find used dirty soap that the hotel provides. So after another 45 minutes we visited the front desk for a second time. The gentlemen was very annoyed with our problems, we informed him that we would be going to the inner harbor and that we would be back in about 5 hours, and if the A/C was still not properly working that we would be back down to request a new room. After a few minutes speaking with the gentlemen he ended up giving us a new room. Room 334. With all of this said and done, we walked into our new room and the A/C worked very well and we had a fridge to keep our drinks cold. We are now finally content with where we are spending our weekend, but in my opinion I would not suggest this hotel.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nanuet, New York", "Title": "\u201cUnsafe!\u201d", "Author": "IamTripping", "ReviewID": "UR69980109", "Content": "This was a last minute booking so I did not have the luxury of reading reviews.

I have no idea how they ever got the rest of the picture to look as good as it does but do note the very small size of the room. It is even smaller in person. I was afraid to touch anything in the room and slept in my clothes. We could not wait to leave the next morning.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cAvoid at all costs!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3679410", "Content": "This was one of the worst hotel stays I have ever had. Our non-smoking room reeked of smoke, and we did not have a queen size bed as we reserved. Also, the plastic on the cups had been ripped open, and the beverage tray looked like it had not been restocked for some time. The air-conditioning in the fitness center was broken, and since it was 90\u00b0 and muggy, this meant the fitness center was unusable. The elevator was also broken, so we had to lug our bags up the stairs. The two worst problems were that our data port did not work and the room was not serviced. First, I complained at the front desk that phone didn\u2019t work. The clerk tried calling the room and said that it should. I asked to try another phone jack to see if perhaps my computer was problem. The clerk said no and suggested that I try an Internet caf\u00e9 downtown. Second, after the first day, we found a note in the room saying the bed could not be made because something had been left on it. However, the room had not been serviced at all: no towels, cleaning, or trash removal. I complained at the desk, but they said because the cleaning staff had left for the day, all they could offer me were towels. I was told that it was the hotel's policy not to make the bed if any personal items at all had been left on it. It would've been nice to have known this beforehand. This also made me wonder if, since the housekeeping staff was so easily persuaded not to clean, anything in the room had been cleaned before we arrived. Because the hotel has a 100% satisfaction guarantee, I told the manager we should not have to pay for our room. She, however, felt that the staff had addressed our problems by giving us towels and sending us downtown to use the Internet and therefore refused to honor the guarantee. Save the $116/night this hotel charges and stay anywhere else!", "Date": "July 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cNot Great for a Holiday INN\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3184598", "Content": "My husband had to go down to Baltimore for work so we decided to go with him. The hotel was easy to find and check in was easy, but the room was not great. The carpet was terrible, I wouldn't even let my kids take their shoes off. The bathroom was in bad shape. Everytime I took a shower dirt would wash out off the corners of the shower. Just a warning for anyone parking downtown. I took the kids to the Port Discovery and parked in the Frederick St. garage. Someone broke the window and stole all of my daughters DVD's and her DVD player. She is only 4 and was very upset that someone would steal from a 4 year old. DO NOT PARK IN THIS GARAGE!!!!

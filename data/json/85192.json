We found the staff friendly and helpful but the actual condition of the hotel left alot to be desired. It definitely wasn't as well kept as the one in F.L. We ended up taking a taxi from the airport after waiting for the shuttle for nearly 45 minutes. Check in was fine and we enjoyed a nice meal at Grill 305 and when we went up to the room all I wanted to do was take a bath and crash. I walked into the bathroom and as I went to draw my bath, to my horror the bath was full of hair. Upon further inspection it became quite apparent the bathroom hadn't been cleaned at all, although the towels were clean. I phoned down to reception and they were very apologetic and someone was knocking on our door within 15 minutes to do a thorough cleaning of the washroom. This has never happened to us before at any hotel and it was a bit un-nerving but being so tired it didn't prevent me having a good night sleep !!! The buffet style breakfast was good and our transfere to the ship went without a hitch. The trip to the dock was $10/pp which I figured was quite reasonable, although the small mini van was very crowded and extremely difficult for some of the older passengers to get into.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice choice for pre-cruise\u201d", "Author": "BrWo", "ReviewID": "UR126388313", "Content": "Stayed here for the first time pre MArch Break cruise.

We arrived on Friday morning checked in then went to bayside to pick up our daughter. At first the lobby looks a bit cheesy but the rooms were very nice and spacious. Although the scenery from our balcony wasn't very nice it would turn out to be nicer then we thought seeing as how when we rang in the New Year we could count over 20 different fireworks displays around the city, the kids enjoyed that just as much as we did. There is a nice atrium in the middle of the hotel as well as a great restaurant a bit pricey but very tasty. On a side note about the restaurant the first night my daughter and I went down to grab a bite to go but decided to dine in at first the hostess was rude and off putting but the server more than made up for it, after the meal they gave a comment card which I filled out and told the truth about the hostess. After I got back to my room I started to tell my husband what had happened and the phone rang it was the manager from the restaurant wanting to apologize and said he takes those cards very serious I was shocked because I was in the industry for 10 years and I know that most of the time the cards get tossed in the trash so I was amazed at the quick response. This is a good sign that the staff takes their jobs seriously and aimed to please. The morning breakfast buffet was nuts but was by far the best breakfast we had had in a long time. The pool was very nice if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the occasional airplane you would think you were at a pool in Vegas. The gym was very nice not too big but it isn't like it was super crowded.

Most hotel shuttles passed up twice and when I called after waiting 30 minutes I was told it was on its way. It finally arrived nearly 45 minutes later and as you can imagine, was now packed. By the third stop, it was standing room only. Then the driver decided to drive like a madman to the hotel, swerving and speeding. 2. By the time we reached the hotel, the front desk had one person working. Some kids needed a band-aid so he left for 5mins to find one. Some 15 mins later, another person comes out to help with check-in. 3. The air con does not work well. At 80 in Miami, the bedroom was hot, the living room mild. 4. The WiFi is not free and when I pay [$12.95] I expect it to be fast, it wasn't. It was so slow that it was unuseable at points. 5. The lobby had a wet spot that was clearly left out all night. I almost broke my head open on this. 6. The bathroom was not 100% clean. There was a dirty plastic bag left under the sink. 7. I contacted management to raise my concerns and never heard back.

And parts of it were - but I was quite disappointed in other areas. First, the good: The room and bathroom were very clean. Lots of channels on the two flatscreen tvs. Fridge/microwave/wet bar and dining room table were much appreciated. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept on. The noise level in the room was totally fine, even though A) it's an airport hotel, and B) I'm pretty sure the hotel was booked near capacity. The business center had 4 computers and we were able to find a free computer whenever we needed one. Printer worked just fine while we were there. The pool area looked very nice, though I didn't spend any time out there. The lobby area was quite comfortable - I know because we arrived quite early at the hotel (9:00 AM) and had to wait three hours until noon for a room to be ready for us. I can't fault the hotel for this - their stated check-in time is 3:00 PM! I just wanted to warn fellow travelers not to expect a room at that time of day (we were checking in on a Thursday morning). Finally, the breakfast was much more than I expected - they had nearly anything you could want to eat, whether you had time for a sit-down hot meal or just wanted to grab something to go. Pancakes, bacon, eggs, potatoes, pastries/donuts, fresh fruit, cereal, etc etc. This was by far the best \"free breakfast\" I've ever experienced at a hotel. Now, the not-so-good: Other reviews tout the shuttle service that will take you to nearby restaurants/bars. Heck, even the hotel information book in the room mentions this service. However, when we asked for a ride to lunch, we were denied. \"Too busy\", they said. After browsing the dismal food delivery options in the area, we ended up walking to a nearby Bennigan's - only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. However, this is the ONLY restaurant within walking distance -- so be warned. If the shuttle is \"too busy\", they won't take you anywhere. This may not seem like a big deal, but to two exhausted, starving travelers - it put a really negative spin on the rest of our stay. Note - later that night, around dinner time, the shuttle DID take us to a nearby shopping plaza - and picked us up, too. However, they again warned us that they may be \"too busy\" to pick us up and that we might have to take a cab. So - be warned! The shuttle service to nearby attractions is NOT a given. (However, the airport shuttle service was great! Every 30 minutes on the dot, very punctual.)

After reading other negative reviews, and feeling that Embassy Suites are usually very good hotels, I ended up booking this one anyway. I was mistaken to not heed the warnings of other reviewers. We arrived before check-in time, probably around 1pm. There were many other guests waiting in the lobby for available rooms, probably from flights or other post-cruisers. As stated, check-in time is 3pm, and you are lucky if you can check in before then. We had our infant with us, and were able to check in about a half hour early thanks to the lady at the guest relations/services desk. The front desk staff were just not interested in helping us or anyone else who wasn't already a guest. If we didn't have our baby, we would definitely be waiting longer. The room was OK, with standard amenities common to all Embassy Suites. We did ask for a crib, or Pack-N-Play for our baby, but it required 3 calls to the front desk before finally arriving after 7pm. The pool was OK, with lots of trees which limits the sun exposure, and as a result, regulates the temperature of the non-heated pool. As we stayed in December, the temperature was cool. (I would guess about 76-78 degrees.) The hot tub beside the pool felt about 100 degrees, and was much needed to warm up after a swim. There is a restaurant onsite, but we decided to walk over to Bennigan's for a less expensive meal. (around the block) The biggest problem was with the A/C and heating system not working properly. The system would not shut off, and continued to pump out cold air all night. The daytime temperature in Miami was well into the 70s, which was fine for the A/C. At night, the temperature dropped to the high 50s, and so did the room. At 11:30pm, we're not going to pack up and move with our infant to a different room. We ended up all sleeping in the same bed, with our baby between us just to keep her warm. At least she got a good night sleep... Breakfast was the regular bacon and eggs cooked to order deal, which was as expected. At checkout, we did complain about the room. We were not expecting a free night, but maybe an adjustment to the bill for a freezing room. All we were told was that we should have asked for a heated room! As a regular business traveller, I guess I'm naive to think that all US and Canadian Hilton hotels would have standard heating and cooling. Try asking for a non-heated room in Canada when it's minus 40 outside... If you would like to stay in a chain hotel in Miami, I would strongly suggest somewhere else than this Embassy Suites. I stayed at the Hampton-Miami Airport Blue Lagoon pre-cruise and also at the Best Western Premier Miami Airport for a pre-cruise in January 2011.

I was told by the representative that they only had one room reservation, even though I had a prepaid voucher in my hand inciating two rooms. The agent was very short and indicated there was nothing she could do and that they were sold out for that night. I called American Airlines Vacations and they later left a message while we were in flight indicating that the matter had been taken care of and that they would have the rooms for us.

I called again and was appologized to and told that the shuttle would be there at any time.

The hotel they walked us to did not provide nearly as much room as and Embassy Suites room. The shuttle did not arrive for another 10 minutes. We paid for two rooms at the Embassy Suties, they did get us three rooms at the other hotel because there were only Kings rooms available. However, they complained about that and tried to only do two rooms, we waited 50 minutes, between 1:00am and 2:00am for a shuttle that is suppose to run every thirty minutes, and spent another $106 on breakfast. They did offer to send the shuttle to pick us up and bring us for breakfast but wasn't too sure about asking my family to get up even earlier to wait for another shuttle after such a short night already.

The free shuttle from the aiport was a deciding factor, BUT they also had a shuttle into the area to take us to restaurants, which was a great deal. We did not use their shuttle to get to the port, but I believe it was a $10 charge per passenger. We ate in the hotel restaurant for lunch as we were all arriving at different times. The service was very nice but it took forever for the orders to be up. I don' t know if this was because we were eating at an off time or if this was normal for them. We were a party of 10 people and basically had simple sandwich orders so it seemed to be an excessive wait time for our order. As I was looking around the dining area I noticed huge cobwebs hanging from the palm trees, so their plant service really should address this. Also the area to the left of the rear elevators on the first floor of rooms needed a bit of care, it looked like the plaster had fallen off and had never been replaced nor repainted. It wasn't the most attractive view. The rooms were nice (room 418), because we were preparing for a wedding the dining table in the front of the suite was great for laying out our goodie bag stuff. It was also nice that the sofa had 2 hockers for additional seating. The sleeping area was nice, great blackout curtains and it wasn't noisy even though we were overlooking a street. The shower was nice, good pressure and the water was hot. I had no trouble sleeping there. Just a side note concerning noise in the room. The atrium seems to magnify noise, and if people are boisterous during the complementary cocktail hour it will echo up to the room. It isn't bad since the living room area is oriented off the atrium. I think our group might have been a bit rowdy and I did notice the noise level. Breakfast was included and very nice. An omlette station as well as eggs your way. The usual assortment of dry cereals, juices, fresh fruit and sweet rolls. The seating area is beautiful (the plants needed some dusting) and peaceful. There is a koi pond and waterfall that make for a lovely background. There are also some caged birds that are entertaining. The hotel reccommended \"La Rosa\" for dinner, a cuban restaurant not far. We used the complimentary shuttle to get there. It was a great place! The waiters were fun, lively and the food was delicious. By that time we were a group of 14 and it was late, but the restaurant accommodated us with no problems. There was a woman singing cuban songs and playing the piano, the crowd was involved and singing along or doing solos. We ordered things ranging from black bean soup to baked chicken and skirt steak. Everything was delicous and we all shared so we had a taste of everything. I rate this restaurant highly. All in all the Embassy Suites Miami Airport was a great place to stay for an overnight.

Comfortable bed and spacious bathroom.

The hotel does provide a complimentary shuttle from MIA airport to the hotel...a huge plus considering cab fare in Miami is ridiculous. A quick call to the front desk directed me to location of the shuttle at the airport. I arrived 3 hours before check-in, so I wasn't expecting my room to be ready (and it wasn't). The front desk attendent politely offered to store my bags and gave me access to the complimentary breakfast buffet (the omelette station was GREAT), access the business center, and pool. The lobby is extremely busy...buzzing with all kinds of people waiting on shuttles, cabs, checking in & out, and waiting on rooms. Definitely no place to relax. The problems didn't start until after I got in my room. The decor and cleanliness of my suite was pretty good. Very spacious and well appointed. However, I guess in the mad rush to prepare rooms, housekeeping forgot to restock toiletries- no tissue, no soap, and no bath towels. There were no extra rolls of toilet paper anywhere in site, and it took forever for housekeeping to bring some. I had to use resort to using the lobby bathroom. No good. Since I was already downstairs, I decided to have a drink poolside at the hotel's restaurant. Since this hotel is so close to the airport, incoming planes looked like they were going to literally land on the roof of the hotel. Noisy is an understatement. Good thing my drink was strong. Napping in my suite was impossible. If it wasn't the loud planes, it was the guests walking by the rooms. All of which I could clearly hear. The walls are extremly thin! You'll need earplugs to get some rest. The Manager's reception with complimentary cocktails was very nice! However the bartenders were clearly irritated and tired. They didn't care if you tipped them or not. So it was a little uncomfortable going back for more drinks. Housekeeping needs to step it up a notch- there were room service trays left in the hallway ALL DAY! I had to call to have them removed due to the funky stinch. If you can avoid the checkout process, do it. The front desk is CHAOTIC during checkout time. I would advise you pay cash upon arrival also. This hotel held almost 30% more than the cost of the room on my debit card and it did not clear until over a week later. THE GOOD: This hotel is located near the MIA airport and fairly close to shopping. It's clean and the decor is pretty. The rooms are spacious and the front desk staff is very accomodating. Complimentary breakfast was great as well as the free drinks at the Manager's reception. THE BAD: Housekeeping needs to do better. For the rate I paid (and it wasn't cheap), I expect toilet paper, soap, and towels in my suite. It's also unacceptable to have nasty, smelly food trays in the hallway all day. THE UGLY: This is a very busy hotel and it's extremely noisy. Sleep was almost impossible without earplugs. Some of the staff visibly appeared to be very unhappy with their jobs. Also they need to do better by clearing their account books faster. A hold on my debit card for over a week is not cool. I will recommend this hotel for a quick layover or overnight stay.

I was offered a room on the opposite side of the hotel and on entering this room a plane was taking of and this was noisier than the train, so as I had been informed that the trains stopped at 9pm I thought it would be best to keep the first room. We had a terrible night as the trains do not stop at night and I think we heard them every hour of the night and after a nine hour flight and no sleep we felt dreadful the next day, not a good start to our holiday, Also we had paid for an upgrade to a high floor although as a hilton honors member this is usually free subject to availibility.

I had been comparing MANY hotels in the Miami downtown and airport areas, and I finally chose Embassy Suites because it boasted two room suites and most importantly - free shuttle service to and from the airport, all at a very affordable rate. It was the first time I stayed alone in a hotel and I felt very safe because of the atrium, glass elevators, and two-lock front door. I was very pleased with the excess: 2 rooms, 2 flat-screen TVs, 3 sinks, and even a Nintendo system (although I think you have to pay for it). It is the perfect place to stay if you are looking to be close to the airport. It is also perfect if you are coming back from a cruise and staying in Miami for a few days before you take off. I had disembarked a cruise and took the $10 shuttle from there to the airport, where I knew I would be picked up by the complimentary shuttle to the hotel. It was all very convenient and I love that I didn't even notice/hear the planes shooting by overhead considering the airport is less than a mile away. Also, if you like shopping, the Dolphin Mall shuttle comes by 3 times a day and for $10, you get round trip service. The room(s) were very comfortable and spacious. Although I must admit the decor, specifically the bedding and curtains are a bit outdated and on the tacky side, it all appeared clean and welcoming. I must stress that you not make interstate/long distance calls because you will be charged a fortune. I had made 2 outbound calls both totally about 5 minutes and received a bill for $52! I then proceeded to discuss this with the front desk, who gave me 50% off that bill. That is the only bad thing I can say about this hotel - that it rips you off for making long distance calls. I'm from Canada and I've called my friend who lives in Daytona Beach before. And let me tell you, 5 minutes did not cost me anywhere as much as I was charged, 50% off included. This is a great hotel. I would love to stay here again if and when I have the chance. The restaurant wasn't bad. The steak was good. The salad needed work as it wasn't washed properly.

Everything is spotlessly clean, staff are friendly and very helpful. Glass elevators enable you to look down to the main floor restaurants. But the crowning glory was the fact that every evening, from 5:30 to 7:30, they offer free drinks to all their guests. Beer, wine, and well drinks. And every morning, there is a free, cooked to order breakfast buffet, for all guests. On top of what tasted like fresh squeezed orange juice, there are hot and cold cereals, toast, muffins, doughnuts, fruits, etc. plus sausage links, bacon, and eggs cooked to order. They have a long list of filling ingredients, from which you can choose, to go into your cooked to order omelette. It is truly unbelievable value for the money you pay.

And when we arrived housekeeping had forgotten to change the bedding on the sofa bed after the previous guest. And when we came back to the hotel on the second day of our stay our room had not been cleaned. The condiments tray in the room were not refilled during our stay. When I visited the business center two of the computers were out of order. At the restrooms next to the restaurant all soap dispensers were out of soap. In front of the reception there are dispensers with cold water - a really nice thing - but when empty nobody took notice of them or refilled them. And then there was breakfast. It was really a zoo. For some strange reason, this Embassy Suites has decided that ALL people must stand in line for hot items. With the result that you had to wait in the very looong omelette queue even if you just wanted a waffle or a strip of bacon. Other Embassy Suites does a Hot Buffet, so you only have to stand in line if you want cooked to order items.

My family and I stayed at this hotel as a layover after I was in Miami for a business trip then it was off to vacation, on a cruise. I have stayed in Embassy Suites in Tampa and Las Vegas and very soon ( last week of August ) in Williamsburg Va. The positive: very close to airport and friendly staff and close to local fast food locations. The negative: Once we entered our room it SMELLED AS IF SOMEONE LEFT A DIRTY MOP IN OUR ROOM WITHOUT OPENING THE WINDOWS IN THE DEAD HEAT OF SUMMER FOR OVER A MONTH, OR OF EXTREME MOLD. It was so bad that we could not stay in the room for more than 5minutes. It felt like a ball of mold was stuck in our throats. We immediately informed the front desk and as mentioned before, friendly service, they instantly offered us another room. BUT, I dont know if we had the scent installed in our noses, but this other new room had the same scent. The assistant manager said she did not notice the stench and I looked at her as if she was nuts. They offered to move us to another room and honestly I asked was it the same floor, 7, she said yes and I gave up. So we planted our bags and left our room, hit the pool, shower and out to eat. I know this review is some what old and I am sorry for being late, but now that we are off to Busch Gardens Va, I had to write it. Based on reviews that I see here it seems as if they fixed the problem. And that's awesome. But I know our stay on that particular night, it was horrible, not even the breakfast saved it and we always loved ES buffet breakfast. It just seemed that at that time the hotel needed a major overhaul and again if it has taken place I cant wait to go back. But if my company sends me to Miami again or in general, to a ES hotel, and they will in the last week of August in Williamsburg Va, because that's our choice hotel, I will request to see the room before I sign in.

The driver had to leave 10 people behind because there was no room in the shuttle. He called in for back-up after letting them know that another shuttle was being requested. Chek-in was fast and very friendly. The gentleman at the desk answered all our questions. Check-out was even faster; just a simple call to the front desk.

The King size bed was very comfortable and my wife appreciated the five pillows on the bed. We ordered in room service from the in-house steakhouse restaurant. I tried calling three times before someone picked up and politely took my order. The delivery was timely and the food cooked to perfection. The breakfast service we had Sunday morning was the largest and most diverse of any hotel that I have stayed at in recent memory; including our previous week stay at the Hyatt Summerfield Suites near the airport. It was better than what some restaurants offer. The made to order omelets were a treat and I loved the hash-browns and juice selection. Upon leaving, we missed the scheduled airport shuttle by 10 minutes. Another driver agreed to take us right away instead of waiting 20 minutes for the next one.

I was nervous from the road even viewing the building, as the upkeep has obviously been neglected. Miami is a tough city due to the heat and humidity, so businesses must take added efforts to avoid mold stains and blackish streaks on stucco structures. This Embassy has been poorly maintained. The lobby failed to strengthen my misgivings, as it seemed dank and in need of a good bleach-scrub in general.

The toilet had disgusting black mold just growing under the rim. The seat appeared to be WET when I lifted the lid! Black mold also was prevalent on the tile grout and near caulking areas of the sink and counter. I literally did not want to TOUCH ANYTHING!

Beds are comfortable (except for fold out sofa) but biggest concern was that the lone bathroom opens off the bedroom with no access from living room area (we've stayed at other Embassy Suites where the bathroom can be accessed without going into the bedroom) or is accessed from both sides. Seems like a small concern but with 5 of us (2 teenage girls and 3 adults) staying in the room, traffic into the bathroom was constant. The breakfast buffet can be rather chaotic during the peak hours. The hotel offers a manager's happy hour and although they offer a limited selection of mixed drinks, it is rather bland (i.e. popcorn). The biggest draw back to this hotel is that it is very far away from anything and nothing else within walking distance except for a Bennigan's restaurant. We decided to try and catch a bus down to the Bayside Marketplace/Biscayne Bay. This was a challenge as we had to walk approx 3 blocks on a busy street (no sidewalks) then once we caught the bus we had to change buses again in an area that might be somewhat risky especially at night. We used taxis quite a bit and one way to Bayside/Downtown area was $25.00 and about $30.00 to Miami Beach. Great if you have a car but do expect to pay a bit should you want to go sightseeing.

There is an iron & board for last minute preps for your trip, a sink in the bedroom, bar sink in the living room and a sink in the bathroom - all with mirrors. The extra sinks and mirrors made it so much easier for 3 people to get ready for an early morning flight. We would definitely stay here again if we need a jumping off point in Miami. It's such a hassle stopping on the way to somewhere else and these rooms make the experience as luxurious and easy as possible. Flat screen TV's in both rooms for catching last minute news before leaving the country. The buffet breakfast was also just what you would expect, plenty of variety and they will also make your eggs any way you want. You can't go hungry with the variety! The shuttle to and from the airport was on time and the ride takes only 5 minutes from the airport. It runs every 30 minutes. When we returned to Miami we got our luggage just as we figured the hotel shuttle was possibly making it's way back to the hotel and we didn't want to wait 30 minutes. My husband had the number of the front desk and the clerk called the driver before he got back to the hotel so he came right around to get us. Once we were seated on the shuttle, the driver gave us each a bottle of cold water from a cooler next to his seat. On the airport side the planes can be very loud as others have stated. But embrace it and watch from your balcony - it's exciting watching them come and go so close by. After reading reviews I was prepared and brought ear plugs so I had no problem sleeping at all. My husband didn't use earplugs and said he was fine. My son slept in the living room and never heard the planes. Just bring some earplugs and enjoy the otherwise quiet luxury!

As an airport hint, there are two levels of parking/bus travel at the airport. Embassy Suites vans use the upstairs level. This will save you about $12 if you use one of the cabs in the lower level. Everything was up to Embassy's standard of excellence; helpful staff, the plush gardens on the ground floor, and generally excellent food service. The van service back and forth to the airport is very helpful. Our room had a couch, internet service, and TV's in the living area and a double bedroom. We experienced no noise problems and we were right in front of the elevators one night. The view of the Miami skyline at night was gorgeous. There were only two quirks that kept me from giving this a 5 star rating. The beds seemed somewhat small. I had to be careful rolling over while sleeping with my wife. I almost rolled out of bed a couple of times. The couch rolls out to make another bed, so the three of us had our own bed. Thus, this wasn't too bad of a problem. The other thing that seemed strange involved the night-time restaurant. We were dining about 8 at night. The food was decent and served without any problems. We were seated more outdoors with a wall separating the restaurant and the lake. What was unusual was when the busboy came by, glanced around, and placed the dirty dishes behind the wall! At first, we thought he had placed the dishes in the pond itself, but evidently there is a ledge between this wall and the pool. It appears when there are enough dishes; they bring the cart around to be cleaned. Time saver? Perhaps. It just seemed strange to see when it happened right in front of us.

Some women were screaming and laughing and having a great time while we were trying to get our toddler to sleep. We tried running the fan on the thermostat, but it kept shutting off, so we didn't have a lot of white noise to drown it out. Fortunately, they all went to bed around 10 pm.

The sound of the rushing water is a very calming sound to hear and drowns out a lot of other noises. It would be great if all hotels were layed out like this!

The room was just like the pictures on the Embassy Suites website. Kind of dark colors, but very nice and granite counters. The bedroom does have some brighter colors, and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was clean and nice. Not sure if I missed the sign, but it took me a little while to find the ice machine (even floors). Odd floors have laudry facilities. Did not use pool/hot tub facilities this visit. When we woke-up breakfast had started and the US Today was at the front door. Breakfast is very good at most Embassy Suites and this Embassy Suites does not disappoint! Check-out had a small line so I used a kiosk downstairs. Two taxis were parked out front and we were on our way the the cruise terminal! To summarize, this is a great Embassy Suites. It did not blow my socks off and my few interactions with staff were not as friendly as last time, but it is a very consistent place to rest your head!

We were dropped at the hotel with the free shuttle bus provided by the hotel, the guy who drived the bus said he would give us a card for 15% off the restaurant at the hotel, but once we arrived he never did, strange. Anyway we get checked in and head to our room, we had 4 cases, 2 backpacks, a trunki and our 2 year old! Yeah we travel light, we get to the room and the key does not let us in, we tried a few times until a handyman came to the room and asked why we wanted in there, I said thats the room we have been allocated, but they gave us the wrong room instead, so more waiting about and we were given the right room! Its not a major deal just wanted to mention that. The room was great, very spacious, had a seperate living room with tv and bedroom with tv. We head straight downstairs for the reception cocktails from 5.30pm - 7.30pm. The lady behind the bar was amazing, very polite and friendly. We would leave a tip in the glass at the bar for her as she worked really hard for the 2 hours. I had vodka and orange, my husband had beer. Other people were having cocktails, wine, you name it it was there, ok the vodka was Gordon's vodka which I havn't heard of in Scotland but it tasted great. There was free popcorn and pretzels where you could help yourself. We headed back to our room for an early night to prepare for our flight home after a great time in Miami South Beach, cruising on Liberty and then the Florida Keys, so this hotel was a happy ending to our vacation. In the morning we headed down for our cooked breakfast, the lady took ages to make my eggs sunny side up, when she gave me them she said sorry and said if I wanted to wait for another one, I had already waited 10 minutes so could not wait as our toddler was playing up!

The first half was at Homewood Suites, Blue Lagoon, Miami. (See Homewood review) We arrived for an early check-in on Sunday morning to be told no rooms available and an offer to hold our bags. Then suddenly, there was a room available. We could check in early even though they normally charge for early check-in, but this was waved for us. Since I assumed being a Hilton Honors would get me an early check-in I was somewhat taken aback by this statement. Maybe it's my Starwood or my Marriott membership that does this. We checked in about the same time two days prior at Homewood with nothing said about early check-in other than they did have a room available for us. None-the-less, I was glad to be checked in our room so we could head out to Aventura Mall to go shoe shopping! My initial impression of the hotel driving in was a positive one. We signed up for $15 per night parking. There is lots of greenery and palm trees in the landscaping providing for a soothing and calming effect. The hotel is an older Embassy Suites. I have not stayed at one in a few years and could tell the age. However, it is the typical Embassy Suites with large window suites surrounding an atrium planted with an abundance of palms and other greenery, ponds with Koi fish, waterfalls, walk-ways, and plenty of tables for mingling. Our one bedroom suite was typical of the hotel chain, but after Homewood Suites with a kitchenette, I felt somewhat short changed since I was now paying for parking and a higher rate for the room. However, I was looking forward to breakfast in the morning. We unloaded, checked out the pool which was landscaped and gave a nice impression of a garden, and headed out to Aventura Mall to window shop and look at shoes. We were back in time for the free cocktails. The two teenagers went to the computer room to do whatever they do and we headed down to the free cocktail reception in the atrium. There was a long line for two bartenders. After a 20 minute wait we each ordered two margarita's and found a table to drink and buddy talk. We went to the computer room where we were notified by hotel staff that the two teenagers (age 13 each) could not be in the computer room alone without an adult. I told him I would be on another computer and he promptly insisted that I had to be on one computer with the minor. Which meant that I couldn't do what I wanted to do. Then he said no one was waiting now and it was okay. Ummm, I wonder why he came in the first place if no one was waiting or reported the girls who had been calmly utiizing two of the four computers. Since one of the girls was doing homework on a special project due when she returned to school later in the week, I felt this was just as important. I asked the front desk if the teen could do homework and they told me yes. Though disappointed with the girls not being able to use the computer like they did at Homewood, I was pleased with that response. However, I made sure they did not go back down to play on the computer--only do homework for no more than an hour. Imagine a 13 year doing homework on their own while they are on vacation in Miami. Later that night, we learned that we could not control the temperature. We turned it up as high as it could go (80 degrees) and it NEVER got warm. Not really warmer either. We froze all night and we are from the mid-west and used to the cold. The two double beds in the bedroom were nice and comfortable, but we were cold with the thin blankets. The girls on the sofa sleeper were apparently cold also because they called housekeepping the next evening and asked for an extra blanket which was brought to them after a slight delay and a 2nd call. Breakfast was good--not as good as I remembered for Embassy Suites, but still good--better than Homewood Suites which also served a hot breakfast via buffet. Embassy had pancakes, french toast, sausage, bacon, cooked to order omlets, potatoes, toast, bagels, biscuits and gravy, muffins, pastries, fresh fruit, cold --cereal, soda, juices, coffee, milks, hot cereal--I think I've got most everything listed. Long line for the omlets, but it went fairly smooth considering they were cooking them to order. Actually this was the best part of the stay. Plus, I am a breakfast person. The teens preferred the breakfast here better than at Homewood Suites. We spent the 2nd day at Bayside Marketplace and came back mid-afternoon due to an afternoon shower. The hotel was freezing even though it was afternoon in Miami! This is when the girls called for the extra blanket. We did the cocktails again--the line was shorter--we were earlier, and it was Monday, so a lot of folks must have checked out earlier. Tuesday morning and our last day, a great breakfast again.... And time to check out. We took pictures in the atrium with Koi fish and parrots and headed out to Dolphin Mall to kill time prior to a six o'clock flight back to Kansas City via Atlanta. Express checkout was very smooth. We had prepaid for both days on line, so the only charges was $30 for 2 days parking which I left on the card. We dropped the hotel room keys in the dropbox at the front desk and departed the hotel. Overall a good stay. Only issues were being kicked out of the computer room, no trash can in the bathroom, lines for services in the atrium, inconvenient bathroom set-up, and the hotel temperature. If breakfast is important to you, and you don't mind paying for parking, this hotel will do fine. It is clean, functional, and secure. The breakfast and cocktail reception are the highlights of the stay. These are the freebies that come with the price of the room.

The front desk associate informed us that the Manager's Reception had started and that we had an hour and a half to enjoy the reception. We went to our room after check-in.

The room was also equipped with a microwave, which was good for my sister because she needed to heat something up. After unloading our bags in the room, we went down to the Manager's Reception. The bar staff was very friendly. The drink list was more than I would have expected from a free cocktail party. It was a nice break after a long day of travel. The design of the hotel has an atrium-style, open-concept dining/social area that's the height of the hotel, with water elements and tropical plants. It's very inviting. The highlight of the stay was the breakfast. I was expecting a warm continental breakfast. However, what I got was a big buffet style breakfast with warm pancakes, fresh fruit, cereal, breakfast sides (sausage/bacon/homestyle potatoes), biscuits and gravy, juices, milk, coffee...etc., etc., etc. all served in the open atrium area.

Of the five elevators (there appeared to be no service elevators, so maids and porters had to use the only ones accessible to guests), four were working. So to get to the seventh floor (where our room was) it often took 10 to 15 minutes. Multiply this at least five times a day and you can sense the annoyance. This was further aggravated when issued key cards mysteriously and frequently did not work which required another extended wait to get them re-issued. The lure of a 'cooked to order breakfast' had its booking attraction, but the reality is quite different. Every day we had to line-up behind 20 to 30 people and then scrable to try and find a clean unoccupied table. It did not seem to make a difference whether it was 7am or 9am. The noise generated from literally scores of seemingly un-supervised children in the breakfast room and lobby drowned out any jumbo jet taking off over the hotel.

Two other nights room service worked well but be prepared to pay $2.50 delivery charge plus 20% service and then a tip on top.

I called the hotel and they said they'd reimburse us for a cab since it had been close to an hour by then. It was only about 6 minutes to get to the hotel and cost a flat fee of $10, plus I tipped $3. I got the total $13 back when we checked in. The hotel is an open atrium type with all the rooms facing the center. Check-in was quick and she gave us complimentary bottles of water. Our room was 809 and really big with a separate living room with a big flat screen tv, separate table, couch and chair and ktichen area with sink, microwave and fridge. It was really nice and the king size bed was comfy. The shower backed up but for one night it wasn't a big deal. I worked out after we arrived - the gym is open 24 hours and was really nice - new machines and weights. The cardio machines all have their own tv's that you can hook your headphones up to. I also saw an outdoor swimming pool that looked inviting. We ordered room service from the steak restaurant in the hotel.

Breakfast, forget the cold coffee and stale Danish, they have a HUGE breakfast buffet every morning with made to order omelet's and about every thing you could want.

Then the next day we spoke to the manager on duty and the same nothing was done.....it was horrible... If I was the owner of the embassy suites I would not permit this hotel to have that name because it killed the perspective that we had of the em bassy suites.... and there was alot of unhappy people in that front desk..something is going on bad in there and I hope that is not to late, that someone does not get hurt because of their negligence with those doors.", "Date": "May 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cAwful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mactoki", "ReviewID": "UR7700751", "Content": "I stayed here on business several times because it is cheaper than the other Hilton brand hotels in the area. The hotel itself is dreadful. The room decor is extremely tacky as is the lobby, atrium and all other hotel areas. They claim to be doing a renovation but pictures I saw of the planned changes did not seem that great. The rooms have a microwave and a fridge but no cutlery, plates or glasses to actually eat from. I had to go all the way down to the restaurant to pick these supplies up. They would not give a plate so I had to steal one from breakfast! There are 2 sinks in the bedrooms and bathroom, neither of which worked. The plugs were broken on both meaning I could not shave. The girl at reception seemed totally uninterested when I told her this. The shower did not work correctly - half the water came out from the bath taps. The bedding was basic and the pillows very old and uncomfortable. The room smelt funny. The TV was ancient. Often the elevators did not work correctly. Another problem I had was one morning I needed to pick up a package from them that had been delivered to me. Reception said that I had to go to the security office to pick it up. However the security office is always closed! It took days to get my package. However the worst is yet to come! One night I arrived very late (about 1:00am in the morning). The guy at reception told me that they could not accommodate me and had given up my room. The excuse he gave me was that they had had some storm damage two nights previously. He said he had arranged accommodation for me at the Sheraton which was about 30 minutes drive away. So I drove to the Sheraton, tried to check in and was told that they also had run out of rooms! I was outraged. I then got sent to the Airport hotel which was another 30 minutes away and very inconvenient. I didn't get to sleep until about 3:00am in the morning after a long flight. I think this is unacceptable especially as I am a Hilton Diamond member. I also happen to know that there were no storms two nights before in Miami! The one redeeming feature about this hotel is the breakfast which is pretty good. Also the hotel is cheap if you pay in full up front, but this is not enough reason to stay here.", "Date": "May 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bahamas", "Title": "\u201cThe hotel from [--] a complete dump. think twice before you stay here\u201d", "Author": "Tennie007", "ReviewID": "UR7665958", "Content": "First I must express my disappointment with my Travel Agent for recommending me to this place...I stayed at The Embassey Suites from May 18th to May 20th 2007 and from the moment I check in me first impression of the place was that it was worn and in need of a face lift. Upon checkin I was greeted by a very unfriendly agent who appeared to be very tired and just wanted for this to be her last duty for the day. She asked to see my credit card which was on file, I told her that I wished not for my credit card to be charged and opted to pay cash in full with an additional security deposit she told me that it was not neccessary given that me credit card would not be charge and I can settle at the end of the two day stay. Little and behold on the second night I was complete humilated and embrassed given that Security had locked me out of my room. I went to the Front Desk spoke with a so call Manager named \"Karyn\" who appeared to be clueless as to what had occurred and expressed to interest in my concern. I again asked her what was the problem given that I was locked out she indicated that they were charging me credit card two hundred dollars a day security..I immediate informed her told her of what her agent said to me upon checkin and paid my bill in full. I told her that I would like to have her General Manager \"Juan Carlos Palacious returned a call to me to express my total disatifaction and she said that he cannot be reach she had no contact information at her property for him. I became furious I demanded that he return a call and went to my room escorted by security to open my room door. Karyn left work at 11:36pm on May 19th 2007 and never returned a follow up call. No word from Mr. Palicious as well. Upon entering my room I freaked to find out that not only was the door locked but the room was not clean at 12 midnight. I went back to the Front desk and spoke with Marcos who confirmed that Karyn left and he was the only person on property that I can speak with and we was only an agent..You can imagine what was going through my mind during this time, I ask Marcos to contact his Manager or some senior person and he told me that no one was reachable. I asked Marcos if this was indeed an emergency with a Guest at his hotel what is the process he told be that he would call the revelant athorities and write a report and update his GM when he sees him. I could not believe what I was hearing and became fearful knowing that his hotel did not have a senior person availble to assist guest conerns. I noted the many definciencies with room 7-314 room very moldly, room leaking near the sliding door I jumped out of bed into a pool of water, faucet is leaking in the bathroom, shower is broken, no day service, TV had a black screen unable to view. tile cracked in the bathroom, the furnitures are worn and old, and the staff need a completed training course in customer service and how to handle complains they were completely unresonsive and refuse to take responsiblity for their own ineptidue. This place is a complete waste of money particually when you are paying almost $200.00 a night not worth it at all...The first room that I was assigned was 7-432 which was completely unbearable from the moment you entered the room mold everywhere..I opted to eat breakfast outside of the hotel given that I was concern about the cleaniness of this Hotel. Please note that I tried calling your 800 number to get some help and spoke with Erin in resevation who said that there was nothing she can do and question me as to why Marcos told be to call the 800 number. I asked her for her last name and she said no. I was so furious at this hotel and in total disbelief that there was no Customer Service of any kind anywhere at the Embassy Suites (MIA). I told Marcos that iI wanted a Manager to call me at first light in the morning to speak with them prior to departure and again up to 11am on May 20th 2007 no response from no one...unbeliveable. I then motion to the Front desk and spoke with the Security Manager who said that he was the Manager on duty and I told him my concerns...and asked to speak with the GM he told me that he was not available. I reinterate my conerns and asked him what the [--] is going on in this place with only one Security Officer on duty at the front gate and no other management presence anywhere..he said that he was the way they do things there..I pulled out my business card and told him that I was a Hotel Manager at a world class hotel and told him that if my guest needed assistance with a concern that warrants my attention my staff can reach me without a doubt. When he saw my card he started to act nice.. I also told him that if I needed to reach my chaiman I can reach him without a doubt. i told him that my number one Core value is to \"Blow away the Customer\" and my staff is impowered to make it happen. My Guest is of utmost importance to me and to have any of my Guest leave unhappy is a major problem. I told him, my staff are impowered to resolve issuses. I suggested that they train these people in customer handling to appreaciate the value of a guest particually when there are other options..I requested the GM information and was given one night credit which was totally unaccepatable and not the response I was looking for. So all of you who are looking for a Hotel close to the Airport think twice about this place and also the security of yourselves. Today I tried calling the GM and again no response....I can also suggest that you hire JDPowers and associates to check your standards if any.

I am not one to complain, but if I can help someone avoid this place I will. I am writing this in my hotel room so the experience will be fresh in my mind. My party checked in on Sunday May 6, four of us with seperate rooms. As we checked in, we told the front desk staff that our luggage had been delayed and would be delivered later. We also stressed to them that we wanted our luggage as soon as it arrived, even if it was in the middle of the night. I called at midnight, 3AM, and 5AM and each time I was told that the luggage had not arrived yet. In the meantime, I was on the phone with the airline and was told that the luggage had been delivered and was at the hotel. I went down to the front desk and was put off until the security guard came on duty at 8AM. At this time, the meeting I was in town for is about to start and I am standing in the lobby with wet hair and the same clothes I had on the day before. Anyway, he went down to the security office and said \"Oh, look here it is\". I grab my bag and as I pass the front desk she said \"well I guess it was here the whole time\". No appology, no nothing!! At least I was more fortunate than one man in my group, they couldn't locate his bag until noon. Also, the room itself is fine. Nothing fancy. When I initially checked in I was given a room that had not been cleaned since the last guest. I thought this might have been just a mistake but when I went down to the front desk to get a new room, the rest of my group was down because their rooms were dirty too. Again, no appology was given. As a paying customer I expect some courtesy and service and since I was given none I will warn others about my terrible experience.

This hotel has a nice pool and the staff seemed friendly, but it needs lots of help. The public areas inside the hotel are very dirty, the rooms have a terrible moldy/humid smell that is almost unbearable, and the place needs some serious repair and refurbishment. The sink in the bedroom sprang a leak in the middle of our last night and flooded the carpeting, and we got stuck in one of the elevators once.

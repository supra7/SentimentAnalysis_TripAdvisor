I quickly jumped out of bed and ran to the hospital. The next morning I called customer care. They said more than likely the management would understand and be able to either refund my stay or give me a significant discount being that I only occupied my room for an hour or so. I had not heard back from management until Monday around 3:30 p.m. Surprisingly the manager said there was nothing she could do as the maids report indicated a full cleaning. HUH??? changing the sheets and cleaning a toilet is considered a full cleaning. Anyway, she offered no sympathy and ended up charging me a full night's stay.

I travel quite extensively due to my job and I am a Gold Prioirity Rewards member. One of the perks of being a Gold Member is upgrading. I requested an upgrade which was not even acknowledged with no explanation as to why it was not available. My husband, who was with me at the time, is disabled and needs a bath tub to bathe in. When we checked into the room and I started to prepare to give him a bath, I discovered that the tub was damaged at the bottom and it would be rather uncomfortable for my husband to sit in. I went to the front fesk and advised of the damaged tub and the gentleman at the front desk advised that he had no rooms available. The hotel was not even crowded what so ever. I knew that there was no way that it full. Finally, the man advised that he would call his supervisor and see if he could move me to one of the rooms that were empty but taken off the available list. I then asked him where the laundry facilities were and he stated that the hotel did not have one on premises so I asked where a nearby laundromat was. He stated that he would find out and when he called to advise me of what his supervisor said he would give me the location of a laundromat. I went back upstairs and waited for over an hour with no phone call. I called the front desk and was advised that that associate had left for the night and had not said a word about the issue with the tub. The associate said that he would send keys up so that we could move, which he did. After repacking, moving to the new roome cart ,and unpacking, we went downstairs to return the luggage cart and the keys from the priginal room. We asked the associate then where the nearest laundromat was and to our amazement, he stated tyat there was one on the 4th floor!!! I was livid and advised that the other associate had told us that there was not one. I asked for quarters and laundry soap and just as the guy reaches under t he counter to hand me a boix of soap he tries to make excuses that the prior associate had only been employed for 30 days and probably did not know that there was a laundry room on premises. If there was laundry soap under the counter, what would that associate think the laundry soap was for??? By this time, we are looking at three and a half hours of messing with these people. By t he time I got my husband bathed and got my laundry done and got to bed, it was after 1:30 a.m. I had to be up by 6:00 a.m. To make matter worse, I got the general managers name and number and when I contacted her and told her my experience, she said she would look into it and call me back. I never heard back from her. I ca lled her again and she acted as if she did not know what I was talking about and was extremely rude. I advised her that I wanted my points back or something for my compensation. She refused me and acted as if I had nothing to complain about. I asked for her supervisor's information and she told me that she was the head honcho. To make sure that I understood her correctly, I said, \"so your the head of Holiday Inn huh?\" to which she said yes she was. I did end up calling Holiday Inn's Consumer Complaint dept and eventually got one half of my points back. It's b etter than nothing.

I like it much more than the Best Western on Sepulveda, that's for sure. The HIE has a refrigerator in the room, which I consider a huge plus. I bought juice at the nearby Wal-Mart, for instance, and did not have to float it in the ice bucket to get it cold. As others have noted, the bathrooms are absurdly small, with long toilets that make getting at the hair dryer a feat for an orangutan. A shorter, rounder, toilet would have been a better idea! Another minus is the very loud HVAC unit. I found the beds too soft, and the fluffy mattress top was suffocating. Pillows are marked Soft and Firm, and there are fat ones and normal ones - great to have a variety. The free wireless was reliable and excellent, which is my main criterion when I am in Van Nuys, since I rely on it to do the things I've come to do while there. I used the hotel fax as my printer! A desk chair would be nice, though - I had to pile pillows on the upholstered chair to sit at the desk. I didn't remember that from two years ago, so maybe some rooms do have desk chairs. The hotel is just plain ordinary accommodations. The breakfast is just plain ordinary cold food -cold cereal, fruit, juice, hard boiled eggs, and bread for toasting as well as danish and croissants - think packaged baked goods, not scrumptious. They have instant oatmeal, but without a microwave and less-than-boiling hot water, it doesn't quite work. But the offerings will get you to lunch, and I took an orange up to the room to eat at night. Hard to peel with just a plastic knife, but a welcome snack. There's an In-N-Out Burger a few miles east on Roscoe, if the next-door options - Denny's, Burger King, and Taco Bell - don't entice you.

We were delighted to find that Trip Advisor was absolutely right: our large, king-bedded room was immaculately clean, well serviced, and quiet; even though we learned that the hotel is undergoing massive renovations, we never heard a sound. The complimentary buffet breakfast was better than most I've had and the staff couldn't have been more efficient or accommodating, and if you get bored with the sameness of the food, you can walk next door and eat at Denny's. We have already booked another stay for our next trip to CA.", "Date": "September 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg Manitoba Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe room was clean, comfortable, and quiet, what more can you ask for?\u201d", "Author": "macmaroon", "ReviewID": "UR3743047", "Content": "My family and I stayed at nine different hotels in sixteen days and surprisingly all of them were great (thanks in part to reading reviews from fellow travelers at TripAdvisor). The Holiday Inn Express rated about the middle of the pack out of the hotels we stayed at. We selected this location because it was very convenient for us, as we were visiting relatives who only lived a few blocks away. For three adults, the AAA Rate was $101.47, including taxes. The non-smoking room on the seventh (top) floor was large, and included two beds, a clock radio, two comfy chairs, a table, a large television (could only watch fourteen channels) with remote, a medium-sized refrigerator, a coffeemaker, and an iron and ironing board. The bathroom included a hairdryer, shampoo, lotion, a shower cap, and soap in a dish. The sink was in the bathroom and the shower/bathtub had a handrail and a bathmat. While the toilet was hard to flush, it did have good suction, but seemed to be in the way when using the sink (since the bathroom was small). There were two elevators for this seven-storey hotel, and we never had to wait long no matter if we were in the lobby or on the seventh floor. If you forgot your laptop, they had two Internet access terminals in the lobby for a reasonable fee ($1.00 = ten minutes). Unfortunately, they were quite busy during the whole four nights my family was visiting, but I did managed to use them just the same. The hotel is located off the freeway and is within walking distance to Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Burger King, and Taco Bell. You will also find that parking is at a bit of a premium, but if you are a Priority Club member, there are a number of spaces right by the door, which I took full advantage of! Overall, we were very pleased with our stay, as the room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. You might find fault with the small bathroom and lack of television channels, but these are minor inconveniences. My family and I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "August 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cTry this spot for convenience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2478163", "Content": "The Holiday Inn Express was so clean, efficient and enjoyable that we booked three addtional nights at other Holiday Inn Express locations.

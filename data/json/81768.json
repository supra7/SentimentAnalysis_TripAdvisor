My wife and I, from San Diego, stayed in one; my cousin and his wife from Denver stayed in the other. We wanted to stay overnight in San Pedro so, if something went wrong with anybody's transportation, we had time to recover. The rooms were clean, comfortable and well-appointed. The property seems to be well kept. The lobby area was getting a fresh coat of paint while we were there. The location is almost perfect, being about four blocks off the end of Interstate 110, the Harbor Freeway. There are a dozen fast-food restaurants nearby on Gaffey but the only nearby sit-down place, in a hotel one block to the north, was \"closed for remodeling.\" A five-minute drive to \"Ports o' Call Village\" will get you several nice restaurants. We didn't take the hotel up on their cruise parking offer because they quoted different total prices at different times and that made me a bit uneasy. We opted to park at the cruise terminal. (It isn't cheap at 12 dollars a day, but it's a tiny fraction of the cruise cost and was very convenient.)", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NEWBRUNSWICK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Place for before cruise stay\u201d", "Author": "WEREALLYLOVETOTRAVEL", "ReviewID": "UR125319438", "Content": "Yes- as some people have said this is an older hotel so a bit outdated.

A Payless shoes is also handy. It is walking distance to the pier so good for a walk. Coffee is available all day and donuts for breakfast at the hotel but there is a McDonalds McCafe next door .

There was only one van taking about 10 at a time and we estimated at least an hour and a half wait by the time we got in line. Cab was pretty quick.

I flew from NY, had a layover, in CHI, to San Diego.... had to meet with my lawyer in Irvine the following morning after having arrived the night prior at midnight. I was exhausted! After that ordeal, I had the big depo in LA the following day and had no where to stay; my lawyer dropped me off at LAX with all my bags only for me to be rejected by several hotels because I had no credit card to reserve my room with. I then recalled the Vagabond in which my dad brought me and my family to when his military career brought us from NJ to CALI when I was but 17 years old until our military housing was ready. They took me in late at night! I was so grateful! I was so relieved! I was even more excited when I wealked into the room and smelled how clean and felt how comfy the bed was the pillows on the bed. Moving along... I checked out the following morning and was refreshed and ready to fly back home to NY, thanks to the Vagabond. Here I am back again as my husband and my children relocated back to good ole' California by car and needed a room for a week so we can situate ourselves and but of course where else and WHO ELSE could I think of.....

In simple terms, it is just a great place, it is clean, the staff is friendly, owner is usually on premises, the price is right and you get what you pay for and the beds aren't bad. We stay there when we take one of the cruises out of the port which is so close you can see the ships when they are in. They have a shuttle that takes you to the pier free but don't forget to tip the driver, he is super helpful. The always have free coffee and rolls in the morning. They also have a park and cruise program so if you are driving and want to leave your car it is really a great deal as it is only about a $5 cab ride back to the motel from the pier. Only down side and I mean ONLY, actually not a down side, just a tip, is that it is right on Gaffey St, so it can be a little noisy, so if this bothers you just request a room on the back side, not a great view but it will be a lot quieter, you still get a nice room. There are a couple of restaurants close enough to walk to, the staff will point them out to you, plus there is a Japanese Susi House right on the same corner that might scare you from its looks but it is top notch susi and the owner is usually behind the counter but if your not into susi they have some great traditional Japanese dishes. Plus a CVS and a couple of other drug centers close by for any last minute needs. If you are going to use a rental car with one way and a drop off, I would suggest Enterprise, they have a drop off only a few blocks away from the motel and they will give you a ride to the motel, other rental drop offs are in Long Beach so it winds up being an expensive shuttle ride to the Vagabond.

The next morning, I could not locate my pass-port and without it we were dead in the water for accessing the cruise. Kazi was so good at assisting us in advising on what to do under the circumstances and made his facilities available to help. Above all, he said he needed me to relax and think out my situation. After about 60 mins of termoil, it occured to me that I had hid my pass-port in my money belt and my crisis was over. In the mean time, he outlined the unthinkable if the pass-port could not be located, i.e. how we would spent the time in San Pedro while our friends went of the trip without us. It included a room special. Next, we were immediately transported to the ship using the Inn's van, and on our return seven days later, we were welcomed by Kazi while we picked up the car.

We came to a Hawaiian bbq place and stopped there. It was a fast food place but the food was good.

We started to get worried when someone rode the elevator with us and cautioned us that the hotel wasn't safe, especially in the back. The people in the room next to us were, shall we say, party animals. Not only did they scream, yell and play music through the night, but their friends drove by and honked their horns loudly several times in the wee hours. This is not the hotel's fault, but I noticed that at the front desk there is much video footage flashing on, showing goings-on around the hotel. I didn't want to call the front desk because I had a kid trying to sleep in my room, but it is a small hotel and I'm sure they heard the late-night revelry as well as we did. So I am perturbed that they did nothing -- absolutely nothing -- about it. And the room doors slam LOUDLY unless you purposely close them quietly -- which, I assure you, our neighbors did not.

This was my first trip to Dallas and like the legend of things being bigger in Texas, I found that they're often better, too. I thought that this hotel was in a great spot with good access to the main roads. It was in an area with lots of activity but it was still quiet enough to not be intrusive. The front desk gentleman was super nice and the room, although on the small side, was crisp and clean and had everything I like to have when I travel: small refrigerator, hair dryer, ironing board/iron, etc. It's an older hotel that was most likely converted to a La Quinta Inn at some point, but they seemed to do a good job with it. La Quinta is growing and expanding so quickly that there are a lot of locations that are converted from other, sometimes older, hotel chains. Sometimes they're not as successful as others, but I found this one to be great. Whenever you see rooms with an outside-opening door, you know it's an older hotel. That's rarely if ever done anymore. The breakfast was good with some protein (egg) choices which was a nice change. It was all neat and tidy and well-stocked. I think there was a pool here too, but since I was there in December, when even I (someone from Minnesota) was cold, I'm not sure if it was still open or not. Everything in the room worked perfectly and things went as smoothly as I can ever wish for in a hotel stay. There are a ton of food choices in the area as well as Starbucks and other coffee houses if you prefer a stonger brew like I do. There's also a big Target store nearby which was nice. I was here for two or three nights and got to know the area a bit and it seemed nice and safe. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and would highly recommend it to others based on my experience here. As for Dallas itself, I really had a great time and loved the city and the folks I ran across there. Everyone seemed really, genuinely nice and I think that Texas may be the land of big hearts too.

Although only there one day, we were pleased to enjoy speaking with each employee -- the security guard that patrolled the lot at night, the maintenance man sweeping up early in the morning, 2 desk clerks (check-in and during the stay) and the manager, Kristie. Each encounter left us smiling...it's refreshing to be able to say that about ALL employees at ANY business these days! From the reassuring wave from the security guard twice during the night (we were visiting a greyhound adoption event, and had two-in-tow that had to go!) to the maintenance man early the next morning who greeted us with a perky \"Good Morning!\" made us feel we had made the right choice with this LQ property. We originally arrived a little early and the desk clerk joyfully took our cell phone number, directed us to a nearby park (dogs..remember?) and gave us a call as soon as the room was ready. Making waffles in the morning, I bypassed the instructions, and the on-duty desk clerk came out and helped solve the problem of the beeping waffle iron, as I'm sure she has been doing for years, but she still made conversation and showed me exactly how it all worked! The room was very clean (it's an older LQ property...I think I even stayed at the same location over 20 years ago), and the remodeled room was perfect. We stayed in a 2 room, 3-double bed corner room...which would be great for a family, or several business associates traveling together...as each room had its own TV, dresser, alarm clock, etc. Like with all La Quinta properties, this one had a great work desk, free internet and wonderful waffles & muffins in the morning! Being located right on the Central Expressway, traffic noises were heard 24-hours a day...but we found leaving the A/C or fan running blocked all, but the loudest noises. While mentioning the A/C...you should be warned...it gets COLD fast (no complaints here...we were visiting Dallas in July and loved every chilled minute we stayed in the room!) There are many, many, many restaurants a short walk or drive from the motel -- even some great little pubs right around the corner. Since we were traveling with dogs, we appreciated the nice, clean dog-walking lawn...it was park-like! With the complimentary \"waste disposal\" bags right there...it was nice and clean...and \"land-mine\" free! We have stayed with the dogs at other LQ properties, where the grass was not watered, and it was nasty...definitely NOT the case here. Like I mentioned, it was park-like (and well maintained.)

Distance to downtown and the AA Center is 10 minutes and to Northpark Mall about eight minutes the other direction. Stay in a room facing the rear if traffic noise bothers you (it doesn't me so I always stay in a pool room on the second floor). This property is super close to SMU and the Gerald Ford Stadium. Try a Last Minute Deal on the La Quinta website and this property can be booked at a weekend rate of $59!!!", "Date": "October 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay at La Quinta!!!\u201d", "Author": "JenPerna", "ReviewID": "UR6561809", "Content": "Stayed at the La Quinta Dallas CityPlace for 1 night in January. The lobby was inviting, spacious, and clean. Check in was quick and easy, no hassles. I got to stay free with my Returns points, which is always an added bonus. The woman on duty gave me a nice room on the main floor facing the front of the hotel per my request. My room was very large and super clean. The bathroom was also very big and very clean. There's tons of free parking. Breakfast was good and served in a large area with plenty of seating. It wasn't busy and I could sit, relax, and watch the TV. There are several restaurants within walking distance, including Dennys next door. It was only a few blocks to McKinney street and a short drive to downtown, including Reunion Tower. All staff were so friendly and helpful, going out of their way to give me directions or help. The woman who checked me in gave me plenty of maps and brochures and even stepped outside to show me different landmarks and specific directions. The woman who checked me out also went out of her way being friendly and helpful with directions. I only had a few complaints. The hotel is a bit difficult to find off of the freeway (I found all of Texas a bit difficult at first because it is all freeways and one way streets). But once you know your exit, it's not too bad. Second, the window opened but had no screen and didn't lock when open. So you really couldn't ever leave your window open because anyone walking by could open the window all the way and climb in the room. Strange!! There's no Internet station which is difficult for me because I don't bring a laptop. I'm not entirely sure how safe this neighborhood is because there were tons of signs suggesting you lock your vehicle, and I saw police all over sitting in their car, driving around, walking around, basically on watch. I'm not sure what this meant. But I always felt safe. Lastly, if your room faces the front of the hotel you are basically ON the highway and it's noisy. I don't mind this, but if you want it quiet just ask for a room facing the back. Please email me if you have any questions, JenPerna@aol.com.

I took the advice of staying upstairs and a room in back section (away from traffic).

Fast check-in and check-out. Kind staff, good with driving directions. Room was very clean. Breakfast was fine - continental, good variety, remember this isn't a bed and breakfast.

Also, the continetal breakfast was sub-par in our opinion with packaged danish, bagels, and muffins like you would get out of a vending machine. On the positive side; this LaQuinta is an older property but it appears to have been taken pretty good care of.

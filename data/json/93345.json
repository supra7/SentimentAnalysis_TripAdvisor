My room was on the 5th floor facing 10th street, and the noise was constant and loud. I figured I'd try to drown out the noise with the fan/AC. Well.....I suppose since it was December they figured everybody would prefer heat, and a lot of it because that is the only setting that would work on my AC/ room control fan. It was blowing so hot I has to open the windows to let it cool off. After an hour the room finally got down to an acceptable temperature, roughly 75 degrees F. Then I closed the window and still heard the traffic as though I was walking on the street, there were no noise softening windows installed here. The shower was not only dirty, but had problems with keeping a constant temp. I tried to watch a little TV to fall asleep but the channel selection was poor, unless you pay for additional channels or movies. In addition, they charge for wifi!

This was my second trip there. First time staying right in the heart of Times Square. This hotel was one-star better, in my opinion. We had an early morning flight, arriving at the hotel around 9am. There were no rooms ready. We were able to freshen up and store our luggage in a locked room, before we hit the streets running! We left and were told the rooms should be ready mid-afternoon. When we returned around 4pm, we were able to check-in. The rooms were VERY large. Accommodated 4 ladies, all their luggage and all their shopping bags nicely. It was very clean as well. We had 2 double beds, mini fridge, iron, safe, everything we could need. The bathroom was roomy and clean as well. Beds were super comfy! We called several times for extra towels and they were brought immediately. We never waited long for anything we needed. The concierge was very helpful. We booked the shopping tour to the Woodbury premium outlets right through the front desk. If you are a shopper, this is a MUST. For $40 we got round-trip transportation and a coupon booklet upon arrival. We opted for the 8:30am departure and arrived just in time for the store openings. This is also advised as by noon, it was SUPER packed. We went on a Saturday, but I would advise to go during the week if possible. We picked the 3pm return to avoid traffic, but we could have shopped longer as there were stores we didn't get to. We opted for a shuttle van to take us to/from JFK. We paid $20 pp each way, including a tip. As far as hotel itself I would definitely return. It was only 3 blocks from Times Square. I was worried about noise factor, but we had a room not facing the street and it was super quiet. I didn't try the on-site dining but some of the other ladies did and they said the nachos were the best! We also didn't have time to try the pool as we were so busy!

We were around a 30 minute walk from Time Square - the walk was nice but we'd have liked to be closer to have made better use of our time. In the surrounding area there are shops and a McDonald's but not a great deal else! But it was fairly quiet for New York so we got some sleep. The rooms and hotel in general are very dated - everything works, but we had a tile missing in the bathroom and a shower that would flood the bathroom floor that kinda thing. We had a quad room which was fantastic - mainly because there aren't many quad rooms in New York hotels as we found when looking for hotels. The beds were really comfortable and after a long day of being on your feet all day we all got plenty of sleep without any noise or interruptions. The hotel is really clean and the cleaners always did a great job - we got clean towels everyday which was good aswell. One perk of the hotel, is that we managed to see Ground Zero - Ground Zero is fully booked until December (this was when we went in October) so the only way to see Ground Zero while we were there was to book a boat tour and combine the two... which we did - this was fantastic that we were able to see this and I'd recommend booking through the hotel as we had no problems. Being in New York, we didn't spend much time in the room or at the hotel - the one thing that we really wanted from the hotel was our boarding passes printed off. This was impossible. Reception told us to use the computer that we had to pay for - well we were having so many problems printing off the passes. We were extremely stressed out trying to get this done when we were running out of change and time. The receptionists' did now want to help at all and told us that the computer belonged through a different company and they wouldn't even walk over to see if they could try to help us. They told us to get the boarding passes faxed over to the hotel and it turned out they gave us the completely wrong number - we were absolutely furious about this as there reluctance to help made the situation worse. I can't write this review without some tips for sight-seeing: we saw the Empire State building at night then the following morning we went up the Rockefeller centre so we saw 2 different types of view but the fact that we saw them back-to-back was lovely. We went to the Chrysler building, went down 5th Avenue and THE shops of New York: Bloomingdale, Sach's, Macy's, Tiffany's and Barneys, Ground Zero (the official museum is being built and will be completed in 2012), Times Square (if you can see at night for your first time you will feel the full effect of it!), wall street, Ellis Island, Statue of Liberty, we saw a Broadway show - Wicked is one of the shows to see, we didn't book tickets out there purposely so we could buy them in New York at a discounted price....only to find out that they NEVER discount tickets and the show was fully booked for weeks ahead. There were 4 girls in totals on the trip and we did the Sex and the City Tour which we absolutely loved we luckily managed to get tickets but were surprised to see how fully booked the tour was (even 7 years after the show has ended!). We all did the Helicopter tour which was lovely and gave us incredible bird eye views but I'm not sure I would recommend it as I did a tour in Vegas (Grand Canyon) which was longer and more impressive - the tour only lasted 25 mins and cost $160. One of our highlights was doing a dinner cruise with Bateaux, we had a jazz singer, 4 course meal and window view for $230pp (\u00c2\u00a3130) which is alot but well worth it - the views of New York at night are fantastic and this enabled us great views of the buildings and statue of liberty at night. Overall based on our unhelpful boarding pass experience I would not stay here again and I would not recommend this to friends. I hate giving bad reviews, but I really feel that if we had had better customer service then I would have left feeling more positive about the hotel.

For those of you who know NYC hotels, that's a really really good rate. The hotel had positive reviews and was well located (10th Ave and 50th St). It also boasted a $10/night rate for parking - unheard of in any major city. Total including room, taxes, and parking was $260. When we (I went with 4 friends) arrived to the hotel, we had some misgivings... The exterior looked like a dull 1950's motor lodge hotel that was under renovation. We went into the lobby area to check in and were pleasantly surprised by the difference between the hotel's exterior and interior. The front desk area was a bit cramped and the overall decor in the lobby area was a bit \"overdone traditional\", but it was clean and well kept. We stowed our bags with the bell desk as our room was not yet ready. After wandering around town for a bit, we went back to the hotel to check in. There was a slight snafu regarding the rate (I had to pull up my confirmation email to show them the rate I made the reservation at) but it was quickly resolved and we got the keys to the room. The hotel has a bit of a sprawling ramshackle pieced together feel that isn't at all unpleasant. And then we got to the room... We were all very surprised by our room. First of all, it was obviously recently renovated. Everything looked new and modern - different from the exterior of the hotel and it's common spaces. Secondly, it was HUGE. 410 square feet is pretty good sized for most standard hotel rooms, but in NYC it's simply massive. There was plenty of space for the 2 queen beds, the armoire which had a nice new flatscreen TV (with plenty of cable channels) perched on top of it and an empty mini fridge stowed inside of it (inside of which we stowed beer, wine, water, etc), the bench and luggage rack, and the desk. The beds and bedding were nice and comfortable. There was a vanity built into the room next to the smallish closet. The bathroom was also recently renovated and wasn't at all cramped. We then opened the curtains and admired our fantastic view of the New York City skyline. We weren't in the room for more than 5 minutes before the bellman promptly arrived with our luggage. Later in the day we went up to the penthouse pool. The star of the pool area was again the views of the skyline. The pool area could definitely stand to be renovated, but the space was large and open and there aren't many pools in the city. The whole stay was great.

The room was spacious; an excellent fine for NYC. The most important requirement for an NYC hotel in the summer: A/C and it worked great. The pool was a good too, it allowed for the kids to relax before bedtime. Although they did not have complimentary breakfast in the hotel, there is a great deli place across the street from the hotel. You could get an bagel egg sandwich for less than $3.00.

Statue of Liberty was inspirational. Central park was great--We found the Alice in Wonderland statue. We also did a night tour on the bus and when we were in Brooklyn there were fireworks--it was beautiful to see New York at night.

Since we had run the 1/2 marathon that day, when we came back to the room later that afternoon to rest and clean up, the room had not been cleaned yet. The maid showed up, but since one of our party was sleeping, decided to forgo the cleaning and just got a bunch of clean towels. Amenities in the bathroom were limited to soap, but as this is a mid-range hotel, we didn't really expect any more than that. The AC was iffy and not consistent.

There is also a pool, which we did not utilize, but if you have children, would be a nice amenity. The hotels' restaurant consisted of a conference room that had been turned into a dining area. They are remodeling the restaurant and I believe that it should be open by now. Not to worry as there are plenty of excellent restaurants nearby.

I have recommended it to 2 others already. Were travelling with an extended family group, with kids around 12-15 years old. The positives far outweighed the negatives, but FYI in the interest of a balanced review, the NEGATIVES were: - incoming parking process was slightly confusing - older hotel so showing its age in some ways - depending on your perspective, the hotel was \"too far\" from the busy excitement of Times Square - though I though the 12-15 min walk to Times Square was no problem at all, and I liked being slightly away from all the lights/craziness/action - not enough plugs in room (pet peeve of mine) - while internet rate was reasonable, had to buy separately for each device ($10/day tho I bought a package for $35 for 5 days)- this is an expensive inconvenience if you want internet on your computer as well as your smart phone, etc. - small lobby so if many people are checking in/out at same time it is crowded - this did NOT bother any of us but it could bother others - the streets you take to walk to/from stuff aren't very nice - they aren't terrible, but they aren't overly pretty either - no coffee maker or microwave in room - pool itself was no big deal and the hours were limited POSITIVES - clean beds / clean rooms, bathrooms, and carpets - our room (Deluxe Queen) was quite large - large by most hotel standards and enormous by NYC standards - View from the rooftop pool, especially at night, was excellent - fridge in room - $10/day parking - Outgoing parking was smooth as silk (vs. Incoming confusion). - Price is very reasonable (for a centrally located, decent hotel, family-friendly, in the middle of Manhattan) - - big windows in room with dusted window sills - working A/C - needed it, it was so hot during our July visit - quiet (though we were really only there for enough time to sleep a bit) - I thought the location was excellent. Easy to find from the Lincoln Tunnel. One block east to 9th Avenue took you to the central Hell's Kitchen area where there are loads of restaurants open at all hours day and night. 12-15 mins walk to Times Square.

You can always \"save\" a ton of money by not staying on Manhattan, but then you will miss one of the main attractions of this city: its non-stop energy level. Spending an hour going to and from your lodging inevitably forces you to miss this facet of NYC. Skyline is not right at Manhattan's hot spots, but it's fairly close. Tenth Avenue (on the west side) at 49th Street (mid-town) is only \"near\" the Javits Convention Center, but not terribly far from Times Square and the Theater District. A subway is two \"long\" blocks away, a bus line goes right by the hotel, and one could even walk to Times Square. The general area is not bustling with people all day, but there are a number of delis, bars, and place to hang out. Thus, unless you need to be right AT a certain place, a substantial price savings may well make this place a bargain for its location. In addition, the room we stayed at (#422) was quite roomy for NYC lodging. At the price we paid ($427 for two nights) we got a lot more space than we expect for lodging in this city. As the photo below shows, there was clear water damage on the ceiling of our bathroom. The staff seems to be aware of it, as they tried to paint over it. I have no idea if they did anything more than that. There was no musty smell or mildew in the bath, but it doesn't appear there were any major repairs done to handle this water problem. The room featured air conditioning, TV with 40 channels, iron, mini-fridge (useful for cold drinks), phone (charges even for toll-free calls) and shower. It was clean, comfortable, and well-maintained. The hotel has a 24 hour exercise room, as well as pool -- but check the hours on the latter. Staff was professional and courteous. Note that all smoking is completely forbidden in all places inside the hotel. No breakfast is provided for guests, and I did not notice a restaurant in the hotel itself. However, several delis, bars, and fast-food restaurants are within a block of the hotel, so you will have several choices of where to eat. I recommend the Ramses Deli across the street for fresh sandwiches. The hotel charges for parking (no surprise in NYC), for wi-fi on a 24-hour basis, for use of the PC in the lobby, and for storing luggage after you check out. The latter is no more than what you would tip the bell hop at any other place, so consider it a mandatory tip.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot the highlight of our honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "rob21blue", "ReviewID": "UR109285953", "Content": "We went to New York for our honeymoon & I can safely say that the Skyline hotel was certainly not the highlight.

It's just an all round superb location. The hotel itself is a little dated in decor etc but very clean, housekeeping did a great job every day, clean towels, clean bedding. We didn't eat in the restaurant or use the pool so can't comment on those - mainly because we wanted to explore and go out to eat and just didn't get the time to use the pool as we had such a jam-packed 5days with tons of sightseeing and shopping to do. We've stayed at the skyline before (about 5 years ago) so knew how good the location was already and knew the hotel was decent the last time we stayed and we weren't disappointed. If you're expecting luxury you will be disappointed but it's basic, clean and has super friendly staff (except one misery guts we encountered!).

However, after looking at prices I found that the Skyline Hotel was comparable to those in New Jersey and was conveniently located in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks from the Lincoln Tunnel and even fewer blocks from Times Square. The location made for an easy entry into the city without having to fight thru the congestion just a few blocks away. The hotel itself is a throwback to the past from the lobby to the hallways. I don't mean this in a bad way, it seems like one of the \"fancy\" hotels from old-time movies, very retro-high-class. The rooms themselves are spacious, as was verified by our 18-month old who had plenty of room to run around and play. While the hotel itself reminds you of something from a time gone by, the rooms have all the modern conveniences like LCD TV's, fridges, and comfortable beds to make the stay enjoyable. The only negative thing I would say about the rooms is that the drywall could use a little patching in places (like the areas around the heating/AC units) as they are crumbling away. However, I could not hear a sound from other rooms so I just tended to ignore surface appearances. The wait staff in the restaurant area were among the most friendly I have ever encountered and went out of their way to make our breakfasts (the only meal we ate in the hotel) fantastic. The price is great and the location couldn't be much better without going into sky-high costs. A ten minute walk thru a very safe-feeling residential area gets you into the heart of Times Square.

Having read so many reviews on trip advisor, i found that, it really is an individual opinion. Some of us have expectations far higher than reality. So i felt obliged to write one about this trip to New York City, albeit this being my first review. Just recently, i and a few friends stayed at the Bellagio Hotel in Vegas, so my first thought was the comparison that i was going to make when i got to the Skyline. Yes, there is a difference. Having said that though, the Skyline was better in their room size (2 x double bed 4th floor) Clean room/clean towels/comfortable living area. Maid came everyday to make beds and change towels/hoover etc..... Checking in at the hotel was efficient and ALL the staff was exceptional. Hot drinks was available in the lobby area throughout the day. When we was exploring the hotel, at no stage did we say \"this is not good\". Skyline had a gym room also a swimming pool, and comments were made on trip advisor that the hours of the pool was not enough......? what are these people thinking....... \"right when i get to Skyline im going to swim solid for 6 hours and do another 3 hours before i go to bed\"! Get a grip. Let's move on, it's around a 10min walk to Times Sq and at no time did we feel unsafe walking back to the hotel late at night. Plenty of places to eat on 10/9th Avenue whatever your choice of food maybe. Two blocks down on the corner of 10th Av & 52st was City Lights Diner, fantastic there. Here's some free advice: If you need to make phone calls back home, then get yourself to the \"Radioshack Store\" 8th Av Port Authority, i got a Virgin pay as u go for $20 top it up with credit and they will activate your phone there & then, within 20mins i was phoning back UK for 40cents per minute! Also if you want to go Statue of Liberty \"Crown Access\" book online asap with Statuecruises.com like i did. When we got there all crown tickets we're sold out! Beware it's a very stiff climb but worth it. Go Empire State Building and buy the 86th & 102 Floor tickets then you do not need to go \"Top of the Rock\". Lastly, make sure you have an itinerary, as we stayed there for 9 nights we divided our days with North/South/East & West sight seeing. One more thing, if shopping is your thing, do what we did. Go with old clothes and trash them out there and get yourself to the \"Woodbury Outlet Centre\" it's easier to book it with your Concierge around $42 per person but you do get a discount booklet coupon. Kuwait Airlines are cheap and you get to have 2 x suitcases @ 23kgs and hand luggage @ 8kgs, Bargain!

So adjust your expectations. I have been there 3 times, and this hotel was far mor spacious than the first two, and that for less money. We had the superior room - so all my comments are only valid for this room category (people hardly ever mention which room type they had, so kind of hard to compare). Our superior room had 2 queen beds plus an entrance with wardrobe and even two desks with a chair each. There was also a cupboard with a flatscreen TV on top. You can see, size of the room was spacious compared to the usually tiny rooms in Manhattan. Bath with tub was also comfortable size and in good overall shape. The much criticised hotel staff had an okay attitude - no rudeness or other misbehaviour. So if this has kept you from this hotel from other reviews, ask yourself if you really need them to be your friend, or are you just looking for accomodation with minimal service? If you need friendly stuff, then you're simply looking in the wrong price category. Overall: Definitely recommend the hotel, but check the price you are paying. We were quoted prices from 145 up to 287 per night for the superior double. The lower price represents excellent value for your money, whilst for anything over 200 you'll probably find better value. Negatives: The heating system really isn't working well. It didn't work when we arrived, so I called (twice) to get it fixed within one hour. Afterwards, it could just not be turned down. Once we turned it off, it didn't work when turning it on again. Also, when working, expect some crackling noises for some time. So the choice is either it is rather warm, or rather cold (both are in reasonable range). If you are not planning to spend much time in the room, that shouldn't be a problem. It's not like you would be freezing when it is off, and you can always have the window open to reduce heat (can be noisy though). Parts of the room are in very good shape, others not so much. In our room, the bathroom door wouldn't close perfectly, same goes for the main door. But both closed sufficiently to feel safe. Walking distance to times square is 12minutes (check with google maps if you don't believe). Nearest subway station is about 8 minutes (50.Street; which allows you to take subway line E directly towards JFK with interchange to the airtrain, total cost 7$ per person, taking around 1 hour - very competitive when traffic is slow (and it often is in Manhattan)). Overall we would definitely stay there again for a good price. If you are particularly picky on minor issues, pay more and go smoewhere else.

Continental breakfast was nearly twice the price and it's much cheaper to get a takeaway from the 24 hour deli opposite. Staff were very helpful but there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms. There is parking at this hotel (which we didn't use) which is quite a bonus for the location", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belleville, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGREAT PLACE AND GREAT LOCATION!!!\u201d", "Author": "lilchrissy2", "ReviewID": "UR69089427", "Content": "We travelled with 6 women.

We were disappointed with the room as it was very old fashioned and not like the pictures we had seen when booking! It was a large room with 4 beds which wasn't too overcrowded, the decor was not great and looked like a bedroom from the 1970's. It was spotlessly clean, with large flat screen tv and the bathroom had been renovated so it wasn't a problem for us as we were only using it to sleep in. The distance from attractions was okay - after all New York is so big you can't be close to everything!! We were expecting to do a lot of walking and we did!! We did not eat at the hotel as we wanted to be out and about very early, breakfast was mainly a bagel, fruit or bacon roll from the deli opposite which was very reasonable. We did not use the swimming pool as we were too busy so I cannot comment on this. The concierge (Anne) was very helpful and advised us on medical help when one of us was unwell. Overall we had a great time in a fantastic city and just used the hotel as somewhere to sleep. TIP: We bought the New York City Pass before we went and saved an absolute fortune on entry to the major attractions. Cost was $460 for 3 adults and a child. For this we visitied the following: Empire State Building, New York Skyride (within Empire State Building), Maddison Square Gardens (Tour), Madame Taussauds, Cental Park Zoo, Statue of Liberty (Ellis Island Optional), Rockafella Tower, Sea Air Space Museum, The Beast (speedboat ride), Bodies Exhibition. I would thoroughly recommend the pass - we purchased ours online and picked it up in Planet Hollywood shop in Times Square p.s. you also get $10 discount off a meal in Planet Hollywood per adult and children eat free.

I found the Skyline and after reading the reviews here booked the rooms and crossed my fingers. As soon as we stepped in the lobby, I knew it was going to be OK. Check in was quick and efficient and we received rooms well in advance of the check in time. The Lobby and the trip to the elevator had an art deco feel going back to when hotels really were a treat. A couple of days after our arrival we returned to see Holiday decorations out all though the lobby making it just sparkle. It was very nice. The rooms were large with king bed, a pullout sofa, a desk, an armoire with drawers and which hid a small refrigerator, a vanity counter with hair dyer and still room for my 4 yr old granddaughter to have room to play. The bathroom was nothing speical but completely adequate with nice towels. Both rooms were spotless the day we checked in, the carpet was still a little damp from the steam cleaning and for the most part housekeeping duiring the week was acceptable. Our plastic wrapped glasses were never replenished the whole time in either room and if a cup was left with something in it, it was not disposed of. These were minor, but still enough to make it just less than \"very good\" We are pretty low maintenance after we check in somewhere so we didn't need the Concierge or any help except for a small maintenance issue on the AC unit in one of the rooms and it was fixed. The staff was friendly and pleasant each time we came into contact with them. The older lady who worked in the gift shop was a jewel. The restaurant did not seem to be one of their stand-outs, we only ate once and that was for breakfast the day we left, we were just going to order off the menu but were encouraged to do the buffet which was out of just about everything and by the time they got it refilled we had to go. Everyone appeared to blame someone else and the fact that they go ahead and stick on the gratuity kind of rubbed me the wrong way. It was mostly empty and with so much good food around I cant see much of a reason to choose it. There was a bar we had drinks a couple of nights, it was pretty dead but we were not looking for big party just someplace quiet to end up the evening and that is what we got.

I didn't have time to complain, so I just accepted it - at least it was bigger than the closets I've stayed in elsewhere. It was about 5 blocks from Times Square. We walked to a show, then got a cab back. There were a lot of shops and restaurants just one block away on 9th avenue, not so many on 10th where the hotel is. The neighborhood is Hells Kitchen. The place is old, but the decor is acceptable, the carpets seem almost new, and the place was very clean. The mattress was lumpy, but good enough for me to get a good night's sleep. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but checked out the menu which looked adequate, and the prices were not too bad. Check in went smoothly and the staff was friendly. My key cards failed the first time around and then again later so I had to walk back down to the desk to get my cards re-keyed. One thing this hotel was missing that I think should be available is a door man to help with luggage and cabs, and there was none. I had to bring my luggage all the way indoors before they offered help. And I had to hail my own cabs. Not a real inconvenience, but I emjoy the luxury of having someone else do that for me. I noticed that a concierge was on duty every time I was in the lobby, including midnight. I didn't bring my computer, but noticed they did have wi-fi. It wasn't free however. I just feel that at $300 a night they can afford to give you the internet for free. Will I stay there again? Probably not.

Head down the street for family owned diner for breakfast or pick up sandwiches at Subway which was one block down. Excellent value for the price and no one can beat the $10/day parking. Most other hotels charge $40-60. Take valuables out of car...they took our Disney Easter Bunny antennae topper - not a big loss, unless you are 5 years old.

We arrived at around 3pm, staff on the front desk where friendly and polite even cracking a few jokes with us. It made us feel welcome and put us at ease from the start. The location was excellent, a straight 4\\5 Block walk east (cross the road and keep walking)along 49th or 50th takes you to Times square in about 10 minutes, 5 minutes more and your at the Rockefeller Centre and 5th avenue. Room was large, clean and comfortable, TV Fine, Bathroom Spotless, towels clean... no problems. We spent a few late afternoons early evenings at the bar downstairs. Seems a good mix of hotel guests and locals. very relaxed and inviting atmosphere. Very warm and friendly lady behind the bar kept our drinks full and sorted us out with a cheese burger each, which really hit the spot after a hard days sight seeing and shopping. Hells Kitchen\\Clinton area of Manhattan has a real neighbourhood feel with a quiteer ambience and a slightly slower pace compared to much of the city. Within 5 minutes of the hotel there are several good grocery stores, deli's and Dinners. 10th Ave Dinner (left out of the hotel and one block on the other side of the road) was very good for breakfast. Warm, quick service and full menu. Very reasonably priced, we found that the closer you got to midtown the more expensive the breakfasts got. by the time you get to Times square you paid double the price for half the portions with little or no difference in the quality. !0th Ave dinner is a great, cheap way to get you off to a good start in morning. Fats Sals Pizza Shop over the road from the Hotel is also to be recommended, try the Full Pie, with meatballs and Brocolli (tastes better than it sounds!!) Loads of good restaurants on 9th Ave we tried a few but I really couldn't tell you what they were called.... sorry. Good quality and service at both meals, neither appeared too expensive. Enjoy the Hotel, Enjoy your trip to New York and enjoy your stay at the Skyline, We really couldn't fault it for the money we paid. And enjoy the neighbourhood, it can add another dimension to your trip. TIPS: Woodbury Common Factory Outlet is worth a trip, try and go on a weekday when it's not as busy. Tickets can be bought from the Grey Line Ticket offices around the city (Large on on 9th) or Port authority bus terminal which is also where the bus leave from (10 minutes south east of the Skyline) Top of the Rock is a great way to spend an evening, book online before you go.

They put us near each other which made it even better. We were impressed by the size of the rooms, the furnishings, such as refrigerator, large flat-screen TV, view of the Empire State building, etc. It is located in the up-and-coming new Hell's Kitchen, and the restaurants on 9th Ave. nearby were rich in ethnic foods. The location and the restaurants kept coming up in our Gray Line bus tour and even the Circle Line boat tour as a \"must-do\" place to eat! The kids enjoyed swimming in the pool, and the adults loved the night-time view from the all-glass enclosure. The porters and desk staff were excellent! We stored an amazing amount of luggage our last day while we attended a Broadway play, and everything was kept safe and sound for us. Parking is a real steal at $10 per day (no in-or-out, but that suited us fine). We didn't try the in-house restaurant, but we enjoyed the Westside Famous Deli across the street for excellent breakfast and lunch sandwiches, snacks, drinks, etc. We got back to Virginia and found we had lost a camera. Lo and behold, some honest soul found it in the lobby and turned it in. We found it in the Housekeeping Dept., and the manager of housekeeping was so helpful in returning it to us. What a blessing!

If you are a British, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to do some sightseeing and a copious amount of shopping. If you are so inclined, you may get to party as well. This said, I appreciate that a hotel room can \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmake\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a stay. I was slightly apprehensive about staying at the Skyline having read the reviews on TripAdvisor. However, as I had left my hotel booking to the last minute, the choice was rather limited. I was warned off the Hotel Pennsylvania by my travel agent in London who does not allow clients to stay there. Incidentally, the Pennsylvania is referred to the 'Transylvania' by locals. Here are the pro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and con\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of the Skyline from my perspective for my stay in late April 2008. Pro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the room is clean, with fresh towels every day. There was a fridge in the room which is good as you can store milk for a morning and mid-day tea. As with most New York hotels, no kettle was provided but I always carry a travel kettle to avoid disappointment. The television is flat screen and has approximately 30 channels, so a daily dose of Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune. If I recall correctly, all televisions in the US have to be digital by 2008/9, so this may have precipitated the upgrade. The room also had a safe to store valuables. The hotel had security staff to prevent undesirables entering the property. Incidentally, the local area is very safe and was not concerned about my personal safety. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try the swimming pool, but who goes to NYC for pool side action? Some of the reviews for this hotel comment that the hotel restaurant was below par and there are no alternatives in the vicinity. Reviewers seem to forget they are in New York and there are bars and diners on every block. Across the street is an Indian Deli as well as a Chinese take-away. Also, there is a great bar, Perdition, where you will receive a warm welcome from Jeff and Shaun and meet some friendly, native New Yorkers. The hotel is not too close to Times Square and the retail areas but it is near the Subway station on 50th Street from where you can get the train to 34th Street for Macys and alike. Con\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Initially, the shower mixture didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work properly; stone cold water. This is a common hotel problem which I have experienced elsewhere. I reported the problem and presumably it was fixed as it was functional afterwards. The plug socket in the bathroom was hanging off the wall and the lock on the bathroom door required fixing but these were not significant issues. As for the d\u00c3\u00a9cor, well, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t modern. The beds, as I had a twin Queen, the bed opposite the television was comfortable but the other near the window was rock hard. Moreover, the internet TV wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working either. However, the main grumble was the air-conditioning. I was disturbed every night by the adjacent room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air-conditioning it made a horrendous noise when it was in use. As the temperature was between 70-80 degrees during my stay, invariably the first thing which goes on at 1am when guests return from a night out is the air-con, thereby interrupting an otherwise peaceful sleep! I thought the Concierge was unhelpful. I required a cab to JFK to leave at 6.30pm on a Sunday evening but was offered the airport shuttle at 5.30pm, take it or leave it! No other alternatives were offered. Moreover, the hotel Gift Shop is expensive and it was difficult dealing with the aged assistant. Conclusion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ok but not great. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the Ritz but reasonable based on Manhattan prices. ($1,200 for 5 nights). Would I stay again?

We booked this due to its location (my mistake) and because we got a good price. (again last time ill do this). For 2 first timers in New york the location wasnt suitable at all being 9 blocks from Times Square. On arrival our first evening we went for a walk and promptly got lost (a word to first timers in New York- trying to find Times Square by the lights in the sky is a silly idea get a map). Not much in the immeadiate area- a pizza place and 2 supermarkets. An irish pub is across the road which we avoided-being Irish we figured we could go to an Irish pub back home any time and not waste any time in New York by doing so. Hotel is about 20/25 minutes from Times square and the Port Authority bus station. It was really too far for us to be travellling back to drop off the bags of shopping we had and travelling back to Times Square then again. (we ended up getting a lot of taxis to cut down on travelling time and maximise shopping sight-seeing time) After getting back to the hotel we filled the mini-fridge with cold drinks as the temperature was pretty high. However when the fridge was on it made a very loud humming noise which was disturbing so we had to turn it off to get to sleep. Beds were comfortable and the room size was adequete for 2 people though because floor space was limited we left the suitcases on top of the second bed. I heard there was an upgraded part of the hotel but it all looked fine to us. Corridor was a bit dated looking but not a issue. The tv reception was very fuzzy though(we were watching fox news for the week). Breakfast was buffet style and the food was good. However on the 3rd day we got charged more than we did the day before for the exact same breakfast which we disputed angrily with the supervisor. We didnt bother tipping them after that as we felt the service was lousy. The concierge was great-really helpful answering all our questions of how to get about and where to go for transportation etc. She was also great helping us get tickets for Phantom of the Opera (for $40 dollars less than the theatre price!) Didnt use the restaurant in the evenings as we didnt stay in the hotel during the day and we didnt use the bar for the same reason. And now to the most negative part- on the second last night we were there around 3 am in the morning I was woken by a persistent squeaking noise, so turning on the light to see a small mouse scurrying behind the desk!!! I was disgusted and alarmed at this as we were on the 5th floor. I was torn between going mad and requesting to be moved and letting my girlfriend sleep(reason behind this is because we already had a awful experiance in Tenerife 2 months earlier and didnt want our dream trip to New York to be remembered for the wrong reasons) So I decided to say nothing................(to my GF and the management) not perhaps the best option I know. We left the hotel the day after anyway. Next time I go we will definatley be staying a lot nearer to Times Square, the hotel was ok bar the problems but nothing special. The porters were very helpful-as we were leaving one basically stood in the middle of the road to hail a cab. He then refused my tip (it wasnt a meagre amount I was offering) out of politeness which was nice but I insisted.

With private apartments now changing hands for $1.5 million in Chelsea and the Village, the Skyline Hotel is a little gem in an otherwise expensive location for hotel accommodation. Stayed there for 3 nights in February 08 - booked direct with hotel over the internet and negotiated a very reasonable rate (just be careful of additional taxes - unlike the UK, they are NOT included in quoted prices for food and accommodation throughout the city) Don't be put off by the functional outside facade or the rather plain lobby of this hotel on arrival ... its rooms are large, comfortable and spotlessly clean. Beds (2 doubles) to die for, with immaculate bathrooms and loads of classic white towels and boiling hot water. Plenty of (US) channels to choose from on TV and easy access to the internet just off the main lobby. Front office staff are OK, you can leave your bags with the Porter if need be after checking out. Norman, the concierge, will organise theatre tickets and will even deliver them to your room. His prices are discounted from the full rate, but can be purchased even more cheaply from the Ticket booths downtown - but dont forget you will have to queue - so you get what you pay for! Situated in the \"Hells Kitchen\" area on the West side of Manhattan (10th Avenue), the Skyline is the perfect location for all the sights of Midtown: on the two occasions I went to see a Broadway show, the hotel was a convenient 10-15 minutes walk from the main theatre area. Dont be put off by the name of the area: it, like so many other neighbourhoods in NYC, is fast becoming a desirable place to live - right up to Harlem! I walked (safely) everywhere in Midtown (most New Yorkers do!) - if you want to use the subway the nearest stop is a few blocks away. Take the Uptown and Downtown (and Night) bus tours for a general overview of the City on arrival - these leave from 8th Avenue/49 Street - just 10 minutes walk from the Skyline front door. Again a 3 day \"hop on/hop off\" option is available and can be incorporated with the 3 day pass for even greater savings The area is coming down with places to eat/buy food, so although the hotel is a brilliant base from which to see the sights, dont worry about eating there - there's so much value, choice and quality in the streets without having to join the lines at Planet Hollywood (if you must!). Look out for the \"Fixed Price\" menus - exceptional value 3 course meals from $13.95 upwards! If you're interetsed in seeing as much as possible in a short space of time, purchase the New York Pass - 3 or 7 days of unlimited free access to the main visitor attractions - and save yourself a fortune on admission prices - buy it on the internet before you go and collect at Times Square - then skip the queues at the Empire State and elsewhere! A direct airport bus service from/to Newark arrives/departs the Port Authority Bus Terminal (42nd Street/8th Avenue) EVERY 15 minutes ($25 return trip) - only 15 mins walk from hotel - why pay $35 for a taxi + tip (one way?) Yes, you can get hotels that will be more \"central\" to \"the sights\" but I wouldn't have sacrificed the comfort, price and convenience of the Skyline for an overpriced and noisy \"image\" location anywhere else in the city! Like most people visiting New York, I only spent a few hours in my hotel bedroom - if this sounds like you, then book the Skyline - you wont be disappointed!

As a frequent traveler to NYC, I have always stayed in New Jersey and taken the PATH subway into the city, hearing horror stories about the hotel prices, driving into NYC, and the cost of parking (if you can find any). My trip was during the off season, to see a performance at the nearby Ars Nova theater, and it knocked out all those preconceived notions. The winter rate was cheaper than I would have paid at any of the usual Jersey City chain hotels. The room was bigger than I expected (knowing to expect very tiny, this room was decent for city standards). The room was clean, and had been renovated at least semi-recently. Most of the staff was great, with the exception of a very slow check in process. The hotel is located close to the Lincoln Tunnel entrance to the city. Parking is on site for $10 a day, which can be added to your room charge. The hotel is on the West side, just a little south of Central Park and very close to the theater district. A cab ride to/from the south end of Manhattan should be no more than $20, or you can take the subway, which is very easy to navigate. The area itself (formerly known as Hell's Kitchen) is not the exact BEST in terms of cleanliness and feeling safe, but I was a young woman traveling alone, and walking around alone late at night and I had no problems. I didn't present myself as a tourist though (no map, no camera, no acting lost) and that might have helped. I brought pepper spray just in case, but did not have to use it.

The room was lovely - 2 double beds, plenty of storage space, a safety deposit box provided & clean bathroom and towels/beding which was changed on a daily basis.

Macy's & Bloomingdales are very distracting!!

I am always one for reading reviews on as many sites as possible and there were a few people moaning about the decor, carpets etc but how often do you sleep on those?! We arrived late afternoon and checked in no problem. We made our way to the room and it was a great surprise. It had 2 king size double beds, a nice new bathroom and loads of storage space. Also much to our delight there was a view of the Empire State Building. The room was very clean and spacious. The hotel boasts a dining room (We didn't eat there as it was more expensive than the cafes down the road, one in particular called the Galaxy on 9th Avenue. Excellent breaky and great price). Also there is a bar but again we didn't use that at all as we were out from 9am-10pm most days so the hotel was only used to crash out. At one point we made our way to the top floor and found the swimming pool. I do not think it is used that often but would be great if you are with children or want some exercise (although the walking was enough for us!!) The concierge in the hotel was very friendly. We booked Empire State tickets with them and they said that if the weather was poor and we didn't use them then they would give us a re-fund. Luckily is was sunny one day so we went up to the top. Also they have discounts on shows and other theatre tickets so is always worth asking them. So our view is that we would definately stay in the Skyline next time we head to NYC. Ok, it's a 15 minute walk to Macy's and the Empire State but when you have so many sites and sounds it does not feel far at all. The tube runs from uptown to downtown and is efficient and fairly cheap. You can buy a 7 day tube pass for $24 i think but worth checking. A few tips: 1. Go to the visitors centre at Macy's with your passport and you receive 11% off your shopping 2. Remember that they add tax to almost everything so the price you see will need to have 11% added 3.

The Sunday morning we collected our hire car and drove into Manhattan for a few hours before travelling on our way to do a 3 week tour of the New England States. My husband remembered the parking facilities at the Skyline and we headed there and parked up so we could then take the short walk into Town. Unfortunately my husband collapsed in the Street and had a seizure and spent the next 4 days in hospital. That evening making my way back to where the car was parked I called by the desk to see if they had any rooms. Luckily they did but each morning I had to ring reservations to see what was available. On the Tuesday morning I was told they were fully booked but the bell boy pointed to a young woman and told me to speak to her. This turned out to be Director of Operations - Daisy Ramerez - from that moment she became my star and helped me with so much. She went way above and beyond the call of duty and we will both be eternally grateful. She told me to stay where I was and told me the room was ours as long as we needed it. We had to cancel our trip as my husband was advised not to drive and I do not so Daisy helped me with cancelling all our bookings, she let me use her telephone in her office and then carried on making the calls after i went to visit my husband. I know this is meant to be a comment on the Hotel but I wanted to just let people know about our situation. She was the first warm human contact I'd had for two days apart from my Husband she truly was brilliant. Not everyone would have offered me support like that! The Skyline itself is in a splendid location, the rooms have recently been refurbished and ongoing work is happening in the dining areas. After my husband came out of hospital we had two days just walking about and taking in the beauty of the City. We hope one day to go back to New York and I'm sure we will visit The Skyline again.

The bedroom was adequate, but the lack of coffee making facilities was a major disappointment (I thought every hotel had a kettle and coffee sachets in the room nowadays!) I'm afraid I do like a coffee when I wake up and whilst it may seem trivial to some,had I known this in advance, I would have booked elsewhere! After reading a review on Trip Advisor that mentions a fridge, we felt let down when this item had been removed. The bath plug was missing or didn't work so we had to make do with the shower. The view from the room was awful - a garbage area and spare parking lot underneath. Made a huge mistake on the first morning in using the hotel for Breakfast - burnt bacon, curled up sausages that had been revived from the previous day and very hostile staff. The bill was incorrect (one American and two Continental suddenly became three American (funny how they went for the more expensive one!) Needless to say, they didn't get a tip! (We didn't realise 10th Street Diner so thoughtfully recommended by the guys from Shotts was so close or so good!) From then on, we used 10th Street Diner and humbly suggest you do likewise!

Pros : *Price - a very reasonable GBP480 for four nights, including taxes. *Room size - yowza! Big for NY, and the relatively small cost. We were in Room 409 - have a squint at the video I uploaded if you want to see size/layout etc (although I make no apologies for the quality of the film - there's a prize for anyone who makes it to the end without falling asleep...) *Facilities - there aren't too many hotels in NY with good sized pools, and the on-site parking is another definate plus. *Location - some folks might consider the Skyline's location too far out, but for us it was just perfect; a five minute stroll along to 8th Ave and safe day and night. *Maid service - efficient and unobtrusive, exactly what you want from a maid service. Cons : *No coffee-making facilities in the room (although some fab wee deli's across the road to fill that void, if required.) *No hanging-space in the room - tonnes of room and not one little rail to hang our clothes! We didn't really unpack for the five days we were there, just dug deeper into the suitcases! *Banging doors - this was the one thing about this hotel that I found hard to live with. We happened to be sharing a corridor with some kind of school/club gathering, hence every other room in our corridor seemed to have at least three teenagers resident. As you might imagine, there was a lot of room-hopping at odd hours of the day and night (...ahem...), and a remarkable lack of stealth and subtlety involved in said hopping. Basically, the room doors will bang unless you close them over softly. The teenagers in our corridor clearly hadn't mastered the art of soft door closing (a truly complicated task, after all...) and whoever was supposed to be supervising them had clearly drank themselves into oblivion in the bar, or some other such coping mechanism, so they went unchecked. Yes folks, there was a lot of banging going on in the Skyline that weekend... *Pool opening hours - not great. I would have much prefered early morning swimming, but the pool hours are late afternoon to evening. There has been quite a bit said on T/A about surly staff at the Skyline, but in general, I found the reception staff and porters to be okay - nothing to write home about, but certainly not rude.

The room had a standard sort of motel look--furniture a few years out of date, a bit worn but serviceable. The room was clean but small.

This was also a combination problem with the on-line agency as they didn't send the hotel the list of names of those staying in the rooms. The front desk clerk would not accept my printed e-mail voucher from the travel site which contained the billing information and names on the reservation. I either had to wait 2 hours for when my friends arrived or call the travel agency to get them to fax a note to say that I was indeed supposed to be staying there. The clerk was rude, unhelpful and treated me as if I was trying to pull a scam on him. I was totally embarassed as there were others waiting in the line-up and frustrated as the bill was already charged to my credit card from the travel agency.

This happened once a day for the next four days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had to keep going to the front desk to get new door keys. We had adjacent deluxe king rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which for some reason the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unlock the doors that would join our two rooms together. The two rooms were very large and newly renovated (however, the pipes in the bathrooms looked like they were rammed through the wall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the wall paper and the actual wall were broken to pieces around the pipe in both bathrooms). There was a pool on the penthouse level of the hotel which was a nice amenity even though the hours were limited. We ate at the adjacent restaurant for breakfast our first morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that was a mistake as it was mediocre at best. Skip this and find a local diner. The hotel is about 10-15 minute walk to Times Square (and the closest subway). We also walked home from a harbor tour at Pier 83 in 10-15 minutes. The television in one room wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work properly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the maintenance crew came no less than four times to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it with no success. They did end up giving us free parking for our troubles. Checking out of the hotel was another nightmare. I had reserved the rooms online \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on their own website \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and had the printed reservation with me. My parents, who stayed an extra night, wanted to move into my room because of their t.v. problems, so I tried to check out of their room. The lady wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let me do this (not that she even knew who was staying in which room because all the reservations were in my name). First she had to argue that I reserved both rooms only through Monday. When I showed her the reservation printout she got very snotty and asked if I reserved the rooms through their website (YES!!). She finally made me check out of my room and said my parents could put their things in the closet while the room was made up. I then told her that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t check them out of their room. Boy, that caused attitude problems. She spent a good ten minutes looking for the slip for that room. She then gave up and said they would just mark it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153signature on file\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd instead of having me sign the form. I wanted to pay for both rooms and this was really throwing her for a loop. When I get the second invoice from my parents I will be surprised if she charged me the right rates. They acted as if the hotel was so full they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accommodate us, when in fact there were tons of empty rooms. The woman with the attitude first said the manager was not there when we first requested to see him/her. Then, five minutes later when she got so flustered she disappeared saying she had to check with the manager. Hmmmm. My parents had additional problems checking out the next morning as well. So much so that the manager came out and gave them $40 off their room and said if we came back again he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153might give us a discount\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. My father told him they were never coming back here and the manager kept badgering him as to why not. All in all, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms were roomy for us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two adults and a small child in the king bed and a 13 year old on the sofa bed. The distance to local attractions was not too bad. But goodness, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they get some competent staff at the hotel? The best employees were the bellboy who was very friendly and the pool attendant who gave us great directions to Yankee Stadium.

The fact that I had never heard of it during all of my other many visits to NY, along with some of the reviews here, concerned me. However, my family did not experience the rudeness others did. The Asian receptionist (does she know this site is making her notorious?) did not smile, but she gave adequate service; then again, no one else was there when we checked in. I did not like having to pay to check my bags either for the day we checked out, but apparently free checking is only when you arrived early, not staying late. (Doesn't make sense to me, but like paying the toll only one way in the LIncoln Tunnel, it must make sense to them...) I, too, found the concierge captain, Norm, and his female assistant pleasant and helpful, but unfortunately they gave incorrect info regarding Sunday service stops on a particular subway line, as well as incorrect Saturday bus information. No biggie, but it was annyoying; I would have simply walked back from my appointment and saved myself from wasting time waiting! The room surpised me. It was larger than NY standards, clean, totally redone, and fully stocked with everything we needed. We had the deluxe for $179, which was worth it if one needed a refrigerator. (This room is on special during the week for $149, by the way.) We used the pool both days; it was wonderful to be able to take a dip in the heated water after a day of walking, before getting ready for dinner. It actually is much nicer than the pool at the Sheraton, and outside of that and a hotel near the UN, I know of no other NYC hotel pools. It is a little out of the way, but if one does not mind walking or plans on taking cabs everywhere, it's still close to the major areas of midtown. There were actually 2 things that bothered us...one, when we were cancelling earlier reservations, that receptionist kept transferring back to \"Reservations\" even when I tried to tell her no one was answering, on a workday. Nor did the manager or assistant manager answer, for almost 2 hours. Since you need to cancel by 3 pm or be charged, I started to worry. Finally someone answered in Reservations and said that she had called my number and had gotten a \"no-service recording\", which sounded made-up to me, since other people were able to reach me! So, if you need to cancel, start trying as soon as you know, just in case...Secondly, the water pressure in the shower is terrible! If one has thick or long hair, it will take about 3 times as long as usual to rinse shampoo out. I finally turned on the bath spigot and just knelt down, that's how bad it was!

It's on 10th Ave. right in the heart of Hell's Kitchen and has fairly large rooms as opposed to the NYC standard. The subway is a few blocks away, but i never had trouble getting a cab out in front. With that said, if you value customer service AT ALL then stay far, far away from the Skyline. This is the second time i've stayed here and the second bad experience i've had at the Front Desk. This particular visit i had booked my reservation online thru the hotel's own website the evening prior to arrival. The Asian woman at the counter told me she could not find the res and i should go sit down while she spoke to the Guest Services Mgr. She continues to check-in other guests, some she sends to sit down on the couches as well and wait. After 40 minutes of no eye contact or explanation i approach the desk again only to be put off again. 10 minutes later i'm asked to go in the GSM's office (Latina woman) and i'm grilled as to why i did not have a printed confirmation as opposed to the handwritten one i had with me. The GSM actually tells me to sit at her desk to find my reservation myself because she can't find it and now they want to charge me $269 as opposed to the $149 rate i booked. It takes me literally 2 seconds and i pull up my reservation - booked at $149 and would you BELIEVE not one apology? She laughs and says how silly computers can be and how they always have problems. Again no apology, just a lecture about how if i had a printed confirmation (as oppposed to the same numbers handwritten) it would have been somehow more helpful. After this you would think she would've gotten our keys and took care of us, but instead we were made to go back in line again. When we asked for a $20 upgrade to a different room they again snickered and said they couldn't possibly do it for free. By this time we just wanted to get to our room (#839). It was very spacious, however we did find hair in the tub and cigarette holes in the sheets of the pullout sofa - not a huge deal but my friend did call housekeeping for extra towels and mentioned the hair and instead of an apology she was told it was impossible because the woman that had cleaned the room never had any complaints. Incidentally we never got the towels... Also the soda machine on the 8th floor only spit out regular coke, no matter which button you pressed (we tried twice). When we called the Front Desk she told us to go to the gift shop in morning for a free replacement. The gift shop's attendant was wandering the halls and we were in a rush. We waited for her to come back inside and explained the incident. She was an elderly lady who yelled at us for taking 2 bottles and said we could only have one. We took the 2 anyway and walked out with her cursing us the whole time. Another interesting fact - this may be the only hotel in NYC that CHARGES the GUEST to leave your luggage for the day. I only stood there for 10 minutes and in that time i witnessed 5 people tell the bellman in no way were they paying for that service. Everyone kind of ganged up on him and put their luggage on his cart, including us without paying the $2 fee.

The front desk asked for a further $40 US a night for a room with a refrigerator but we would have to wait until a room was available.

On our last evening there we got stuck in a lift (elevator) for 25 minutes. As soon as it happened we used the phone inside the lift, and a voice said 'we're working on it now.' After not hearing anything for 15 minutes, we rang again and the receptionist was totally shocked that we were stuck in the lift, and claimed nobody had told him. I have no idea what happened to the first person we told, but it seems that the staff obviously don't communicate. Five minutes after that somebody came and knocked on the lift door. He seemed genuinely concerned about our plight. He told us that the lift had broken down twice already that evening but they'd managed to get it working both times. (Why on earth they didn't put a sign up if it had already happened twice is beyond me.) He said they were trying to contact an engineer to come, but as this was a Sunday night had no idea how long it would take. When we managed to establish that we were actually on the floor we wanted and it was simply the door that was stuck, we gently suggested that perhaps whilst waiting for the engineer the hotel staff could maybe attempt to open the door and get us out. Completely astounded and no doubt impressed by this revolutionary suggestion, he went off somewhere to get tools and/or colleagues. Whilst he was gone my husband managed after about 5 minutes to slide the door open enough for us to get out, and we made our escape. We phoned reception from our room to inform them, so that the guy searching for the tools and/or colleagues could stop; they didn't seem to know anything about the escape plan. The reception staff didn't even apologise for the inconvinience. After another few minutes we heard from our room the guy return with the tools and/or colleagues, and ask the lift door in a panicky voice 'are you still in there? Hello? Can anybody hear me?' We were tempted to leave him guessing for a couple more minutes, but since he was the only person who seemed to care about our plight, we put him out of his miseary and revealed our survivial. The point of the story is this; lifts break down, it happens sometimes, but the customer service attached to it was non existent. The hotel didn't even apologise. Regarding the rest of our stay I'd say the following; Location - Good, the two block walk to the subway station seemed to get longer each time, but I think that was more to do with the worsening weather. In reality it was only 10 minutes. Noise - I was only disturbed by noise on the last night, though my husband says noise from inside and outside kept him awake every night. Room - Spacious and clean. I found the beds and bedding comfortable, my husband didn't. Our TV was broken. We could watch different channels, but it always flicked back to the menu page after 5 minutes.

It was also very handy to have a small fridge to store drinks and food items. The housekeeping staff did a fine job of cleaning the room daily. The hotel's location is pretty good too. It's a 2-3 long blocks away from the subway and the Times Square attractions, but the walk is not insurmountable. Also, I felt safe in the neighbourhood at all times, even around midnight. On the downside, the hotel is in need of some repair work. The elevator paneling was beat up and pieces broken off. In the room, the black bathroom countertop was patched with electrical tape. A leaking water supply to the toilet was patched with duct tape, but left rust stains on the tile floor. The flange on the shower head had come off the wall. The light socket in one of the bedside lamps had come loose. The table lamp on the desk and the pendant light by the door were askew. The doors on the armoire that held the TV and fridge didn't fully close. I should say these defects were mostly cosmetic, and none represented a threat to our health or safety. The front desk staff and porter were efficient, but gruff - I found that to be common amongst many workers in New York. The lady at the concierge was quite pleasant, though. I can't say too much more since our dealings with the staff were minimal. We were looking for a place to store our luggage while we were out during the day and a clean, comfortable place to sleep at night. The Skyline delivered exactly that. Compared to other hotels in Manhatten, it was a bargain.

Close to \"restaurant row\" and the subway though. We stayed in the older side, so you did have to do about a dozen steps with no elevator (that I know of) to get to the other side before taking the hotel up the back tower. Not a big deal for us, but request new side if you can't do steps. The reception gave us a friendly Italian welcome and let us check in although it was only noon (check in is 3pm). The concierge gave us maps of the city and gave us tips on the theatre since we wanted to go one night. He also offers a service for discount tickets if you don't want to wait in the TKTS line for half-off tickets (his are about 30% off on average). The room was spacious (for NYC) and very clean. We thought it was odd that the front desk wanted to know if we wanted the phone turned on (didn't know this was an add-on???) and we never used the TV so I can't comment on that.

To say that the staff is unfriendly would be putting it mildly. I was ill-prepared for the rude, actually mean-spirited, behavior I had the misfortune of dealing with. Upon arrival at noon, my king size deluxe non-smoking room that I'd reserved was not ready. I came back three hours later, a little concerned that the clerk was so unfriendly, never smiled or said anything more than what was necessary, I was given the key to my room only to find that it was a double, not the king I'd reserved. I called down to the receptionist. She said the only other room was a king smoking room (never apologized for the inconvenience). I kindly asked what happened to my reservation? She said in very broken English i had to choose between the rooms, that they \"don't guarantee rooms\" whatever that means. I opted for the non-smoking double and asked her to adjust my rate. she told me to talk to the manager. I didn't think it would be a problem. So, when I went to check out, this same clerk told me that she wasn't going to change my rate b/c I had signed in and approved that rate with my initials on the form. I was shocked. I explained the obvious -- that I signed for a room that was supposed to be a king but wouldn't have known it wasn't until actually entering the room which I couldn't do without checking in first. She accused me of lying about the room I'd reserved, telling me that my initials meant i was going to pay that rate no matter what the room was (??!). I asked to speak to the manager. The manager was even worse than she was. She adjusted my rate, but kept lecturing me that I had signed for a room and chosen that room and that my initials upon check-in proved their point. I thought I was in the Twilight Zone. They wanted to charge me for a king size room that THEY had not even placed me in, that I never saw nor stayed in. Their mistake wasn't what upset me, it was the way they spoke to me. Both the clerk and the manager acted angry with me and never once admitted they made a mistake. Even as I signed my bill with the adjusted rate, the clerk kept mumbling \"you signed for this room and this was the room you wanted.\" I actually told her to be quiet, that i was finished with the conversation. She kept on mumbling and scowling at me -- and the manager just casually walked away. I actually raised my voice, telling her all she had to was to thank me for my business and tell me to have a nice day -- that still didn't stop her absurd rant. We actually ended up in a screaming match that they seemed to want to provoke. She didn't care that other patrons were standing around waiting to check in. She just wanted to argue with me even after the matter had been settled. It was the most unnerving and odd thing I've ever had happen to me in any service establishment anywhere. The rooms are old and smelly, but spacious and cheap. The location was perfect so all was not lost. But, the people who run this hotel do not care about your experience there. Only stay at this hotel if you can't afford anything else.

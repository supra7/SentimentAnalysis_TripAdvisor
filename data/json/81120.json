Everything near the convention center was sold out or very expensive. I have a car and this hotel is conviently located next to the 110 freeway entrance and exit. The drive over the bridge to Long Beach was scenic and easy. My room faced the freeway; surprisingly the noise did not bother me and I'm usually noise sensitive. The staff was friendly. The rooms were clean the bedding and furniture looked fairly new. I used the iron, refridgerator, hairdryer, coffee maker,tv-what more do you need? They also have a small pool and serve breakfast. The price was unbeatable with my triple A discount. If I had to complain about anything I would remember to bring my own pillow next time. The hotel pillows were hard foam and I looked forward to getting home to my more comfortable bed.

It also had 3 washers and 3 dryer so you could do laundry if you wanted to. The Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant is the only place to eat within walking distance but we had a great meal.

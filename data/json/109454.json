Each to their own, but we still loved it. I like to travel to Dallas via Amtrak, and the hotel is straight across from Union Station, just one perk of its great location. It is old. Now, if old isn't an attraction for you, stay somewhere new. Old has problems sometimes, but old also has charm. Maintenance on a building constructed in 1925 is a full-time job. The elevator is slow. Big deal. It's OLD. It's not all that small, either. It adequately transported the three of us up and down in plenty of time. Our room on the 7th floor was impeccably clean. It was small on an American scale, but large on a European one. The two beds had nice linens, and good mattresses and pillows. The bathroom door had a few problems -- the knob mechanism was broken, but the door still shut. The bathroom was well designed and amply stocked with fresh towels, and products. There was a closet for sweaters and coats, which we brought but didn't need. There were plenty of other storage possibilities in the room as well. One of the nicest facets of the hotel being old is that is has windows that actually open. We enjoyed the sights and sounds and cool breezes it brought us with the lovely early spring weather. The room also has individually controlled heat and air, but we didn't have to use more than the \"fan\" setting. Several bottles of water were included, as well as a nice ice bucket and tongs. One of my few complaints was the one-cup coffee brewer. The coffee was only stocked for two, and we are big coffee drinkers. I will say in their favor that we have never had a hotel respond to a reservation for three correctly anywhere. This isn't just a problem of the Lawrence, but of hotels in general. An expanded continental breakfast is included. The breakfast room on the second floor was clean and had plenty of tables and chairs. A variety of juices, coffees, teas, and milk were available, as well as cereal, pastries, bagels and cream cheese, and waffles you could make yourself. Basic, but money saving, we enjoyed this the first day, but opted for Cindi's Deli just around the corner from the hotel for a hot breakfast the next day. Its food and service were both excellent, and it's gigantic menu could surely please just about anyone. The Founders Grill, also downstairs, had a bar and dining as well. They offer all kinds of things, but I give high praise to their burgers and Philly Cheese Steak. One of the best things about the Lawrence is that they offer shuttle service to within 3 miles of the hotel. Our Ethiopian drivers knew the city well, were good drivers, and spoke excellent English in addition to being accommodating of my being on a cane. I can't praise these gentlemen enough. I'd much rather tip them than take a cab or the hit-and-miss DART. Everyone associated with the hotel was just great. They seemed to have pride in their little antique gem, and are working hard to keep it up and running AND charming. The milk and cookies at 8 p.m. is a great perk, too. So, unless you have some kind of unrealistic ideals about what an antique, European-style downtown hotel should be, stay at Hotel Lawrence. If you are expecting shiny, new, fast, and impersonal, stay elsewhere. If you've traveled in Europe and liked it, want to be downtown, and appreciate personalized service, stay at Hotel Lawrence.

Also, if you're from a water conscious area the entire Dallas area will give you pause (pressure washing the streets, non-aerated shower and sink, etc.) I adored the service, despite checking in kinda late the gentleman at the front desk offered to send a crib up to the room without us having to ask and all of the staff was incredibly sweet to our 7.5 month old. Everyone was able and willing to help out from pointing us to grocery markets for snacks to finding a band aid. The hotel is in a great location, we were able to walk to most of downtown and only drove when visiting family. Not to mention the picture perfect view of the book depository from our room.

I found this hotel on the trip advisor forums. I was looking for a room within walking distance of The House of Blues. I read the reviews here and did see some negative comments but thought I would give it a chance. I called the hotel directly I thought, as it was listed as a Dallas number however I was connected to a \"Reservation Desk\". I inquired first if the hotel was within walking distance \"Yes, only three blocks from The House of Blues.\" Wow, that is great I thought. This was very important as I would be walking back to the hotel after the concert with a 13 year old child, alone. I then asked if their valet service was secure as I read a in one of the reviews that someone had all their car windows busted when parked at the meters. I was again told \"Yes, ma'am, 100 percent secure.\" Perfect I thought. I told the agent that I appreciated the information and would confer with my husband. We had planned to stay at the W and needed two rooms on Friday night and just one on Saturday night as my husband would be leaving early before the show. My husband was elated at the fact that I had found a bargain and said to book it if it was what I wanted. So I called back and spoke with Chasity. I again asked her the above two questions and was given the same responses with slightly different wording of course. I booked two rooms for Friday and one for Saturday evening. We arrived at Hotel Lawrence around 5:30 p.m. to check in Friday evening. We circled the building twice looking for valet service or a bellman but had no luck, so we parked at the meters and deposited money. The first thing we noticed was the right entry door of the hotel was broken and the left door was rotting. WE greeted Mark (yes, we greeted him not the other way around as he ignored our arrival at the desk) and informed him that we were checking in for the evening. I informed him that we were unable to locate valet and he replied \"Are you ready to park?\" \"Yes\" I said. \"So you have unloaded your luggage?\" \"No, not yet.\" I responded thinking that there would be a bellman to help me with that. His response \"Well then you are not ready to valet then. I'll take the keys when you are.\" My 13 year old daughter just laughed out loud in shock at his ruddiness. He asked the name on the reservation and pulled our paperwork. I then said \"Are you three blocks from House of Blues as I thought it was located on the other side of 35?\" He responded that it was indeed on the other side of the highway and that it was 10-12 blocks. OK I am going to make the best of this situation. I ask if they have a courtesy van or transpiration and he says yes but it will be closed after the concert. At this point his rudeness had gotten to the point that my husband who had just walked in was looking at me like what the heck is going on. I tell Mark all of the above about speaking with two of their reps and being told the same information and that I called because I had read some negative reviews on trip advisor. When I repeated the valet question to him and told him the reps response he laughed and said \"no one can guarantee that.\" Really? seems both W and Hyatt have security on staff as well as cameras watching your vehicles! I inform my husband of my dilemma and the misinformation I was given and he suggest that we just call Hyatt Regency which is just a little over a block away and cancel this reservation due to the misinformation. Of course Mark informs me that he is the manager on duty and will be charging my card as I am no longer within the 24 hour cancelation period. I tell him to cancel tomorrows reservation and he says he can't do that either as it needed to be done by \"3 p.m. central standard time\". We left, called Hyatt booked two rooms for $10 bucks more and were amazed at how much help was around when we pulled up. Valet, bellman, awesome check in staff, even friendlier bellman Juan brought our luggage to our room and encouraged us to call him with any questions or request. I told the front desk about our issue at the other hotel (did not name it) because I was still in shock and he apologized as if it were his fault and said I know which hotel you are speaking of as we have been informed not to ever send anyone there if we are full. Seems Hotel Lawrence has a reputation all around town and not a good one. I HIGHLY SUGGEST SPENDING THE $10 EXTRA DOLLARS and staying at the Hyatt as the customer service alone is what would be found in a 5 star hotel.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Hotel and worse service\u201d", "Author": "Phillis_Travel", "ReviewID": "UR124296091", "Content": "A group of 30 of us stayed here January 26-30 2012.

Therefore, I selected the Hotel Lawrence because it seemed passable in terms of quality, and the location was the best one to start a day of looking at JFK assassination-related sites as it was virtually in Dealey Plaza. I got a room that faced Dealey Plaza, so I woke to Dealey Plaza covered in light snowfall. I think given my reasons for going to Dallas, the view made the hotel worth the money, as I could see the former Texas School Book Depository, Elm St, and the Grassy Knoll from my window. The room itself was not so modern - the bathroom looked newly-renovated, but the furniture & television looked a little archaic. However, I spent little time in the room, despite the cold, so for me it was fine. The breakfast was a buffet, and a little limited. I usually turn to cereal when I can't get scrambled egg & toast, so it was cereal day for me, but that was fine as I was eager to get to Dealey Plaza anyway. The night I got there, the restaurant was closed, and it was about 10pm, but luckily someone in a room ordered a pizza, so the driver took me back to the pizzeria so I could order a pizza there. I flew out after spending one full day in Dallas, and the trip from the HL to Dallas Love Field took around 30 minutes in the morning peak hour period.

Not every experience was pleasant, some just horrendous,to downright terrifying, and some were better than home, and left you with a real yearning for a return stay. I was only up for 1 night, booked on the fly after 2300 CST, through my favorite trusted online reservation service, got a killer rate, less than $60.00 before local tax rates, and was up less than 5 minutes after arrival. The lobby was spotless, every common area was clean, and the room was turned well and cozy. I was actually impressed with this hotel, didn't think I would be because of the rate, but I probably got a late price trigger (if that exists). There was a pot smoker on my floor, a non smoking floor, but hey, cigarette smokers are out and local code for non-smoking buildings doesn't include smoking pot in a public building, there are other statutes for that. . This hotel again is old, almost a century old, has been renovated, but has very distinct art deco decor. Yes, the rooms are smaller than some newer hotels, but the studio I was in had more than enough room, was really clean, and was just right. The bathroom was a little euro, but the shower was spot on (partial Swiss Shower with really hot water, and great water pressure, easy 1 hour steam if you need it.) I am really impressed this hotel gets alot of reviews, good and bad, but that is expected, it's a hotel, run by humans, not robots.

Good points: easy to get to by car from airport. Very pleasant and helpful receptionist ( an older guy called Lenny) who arranged valet parking for us as we were really tired, at no higher cost than it would have been to park up ourselves.Environment was kind of \" shabby-chic\", quite an old fashioned reception area,but clean.It was cheap for Dallas, but perhaps only so as we had booked well in advance.The hotel is an easy and safe walk to the West End district, with variety of restaurants, bars and shops. Breakfast was a hlp yourself buffet with a selection of cereals, fruit, boiled eggs, toast and waffles, entirely adequate. The hotel offers a free bus drop off/pick up service to anywhere within a 3 mile radius. Just down the street is the Texas Book Depository and the infamous Grassy Knoll, with excellent nuseum charting the JFKennedy rise and ultimate assassination.Plus the tourist info place is right there too.We also made use of the hotel secure boxes, which was good to have at the start of our vacation. Negatives: Though our room was adequate in terms of size and facilities, and the bed was reasonably comfortable, the room did smell badly of stale cigarette smoke. On arrival, Lenny noted that the room initially allocated to us had been allocated to someone else, so perhaps this was the only alternative available? Anyway, I guess we could have complained and asked for a room change, but to be honest, we knew we would not be in the room much, and we were too tired to bother asking the first night. Probably a mistake. Overall, it was an OK stopover, perfectly adequate, but, in spite of Lenny's welcome and helpfulness, we would probably choose somewhere else to stay if we return to Dallas.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWORST hotel experience, ever.\u201d", "Author": "Dootdoot", "ReviewID": "UR118582727", "Content": "The only employee I encountered was harshly judgemental and unwelcoming.

As we walked down the narrow halls, we peeked into some of the ones that housekeeping was cleaning, and I noticed a few different sizes. We had a corner room, with windows facing the Plaza/Courthouse, and I would say it was slightly larger than others. We had 2 double beds. Did not experience any bedbugs, and the room was clean. True also the Hotel is OLD. It is a Historic hotel, There is no pool, and I didn't see a gym. The internet connection sucks. The bathrooms are tiny and have been decorated in what I think was supposed to be art deco style. You can barely turn around in them, and there is nowhere to put your toiletries, not cool for 2 females sharing a bathroom. There are no microwaves or fridges in the room. So don't bother saving your leftover 40 dollar dinner to eat later, lol. The lobby served cookies and milk, we did not eat in the adjoining resturant. We did eat the free breakfast, and it was fine, clean and sunny eating area on the 2nd floor. Yes elevators are small, so if you have lots of luggage, it may require 2 trips. There is only 1 computer in the lobby and the printer was out but the front desk printed our boarding passes for us. The location is great, across the street from union station, and the metro rail, which can take you all over dallas for 4 bucks, and you can walk to Market square, where there are all types of eateries. We also walked to House of blues and dicks last resort. Dealey plaza is right across the street from the hotel. The front desk people were nice, especially the young man who checked us in, can't remember his name but he was great, the woman on the night shift was a little chilly, but was not unprofessional. The best staff are the shuttle drivers! They took us to our Palladium ballroom destination, and to deep ellum, and because it was a relatively slow afternoon, at checkout they took us to Dallas Love field! How is that for going ABOVE the call of duty? Tip the shuttle drivers well folks! They raise the level of this hotel by at least 1 star!

Upon arrival, there was no place to pull up to the hotel and unload, so my husband pulled around the corner and put a couple quarters in the meter. We checked into our room and unloaded. We ended up parking in the Union Station lot since it was only $5. We were given a room with a great view of the Old Red Museum and Dealey Plaza. The room was small, but adequate. There was no refrigerator, so we filled the sink and our small cooler with ice. The Hotel Lawrence offered fresh baked cookies in the evening and we went down to the lobby to get a few. They were good, but tasted like they were cut from a roll of pre-made dough. Still a nice gesture. We slept well in the room. Since it was New Years Eve, you could hear some partying late into the evening, but we had been partying as well and had no problem falling asleep. We safely walked to the AA Center for the New Years Eve concerts, festivities and fireworks that evening. On New Years Day we walked to the Sixth Floor Museum in the morning and also to the New Years Day parade downtown. We walked to the Spaghetti Factory for lunch. The hotel was a great home base because we never had to move our car out of the Union Station lot.

I was told that the nearest parking lot with available spots at that hour was Union Station. The staff (nor the owners) cannot control the parking situation in downtown, but I feel it is only ethical to warn potential clients of the situation I found myself in. I was ready to walk away and lose my money rather than venture out alone a third time in search of parking.

I have stayed in an old chicken coop, do to rain, while camping one night and it was cleaner than this place. We walked in to what looked like pigeon poop on the floor. The white coverlet on the bed and floor were covered in black soot from the furnace. When we took the waffle coverlet off the bed there were stains on the waffle blanket. I was so tired that I just wanted to brush my teeth, wash my face and lay my head down...Thank God for my own pillow. When I turned on the water in the bathroom, it was either hot or demonic. The bathtub should have been condemned. After crying, my husband and I just started laughing hysterically and started hanging up our clothes in something that resembled a closet. When opening the \"closet\" door, you could see through a hole in the wall to the hallway. Our company was there for the Super Bowl and we had 7 rooms. Each in their own special ways had issues. After complaining to management they assured us that they had just been screwed by their contractors. She didn't see anything wrong with our rooms, after taking a \"tour\" through all 7 rooms. I'm not a complainer and I am definitely not a liar. Well...after reviewing some other reviews on the hotel, it dates back to 2008 with the same exact problems. During our stay, the one elevator that worked, broke down and the fire alarm went off for no apparent reason. I gave a 2 for service because, Ruthie, was great. She knew exactly how we felt and tried to make our stay as nice as possible. Convenience to downtown was great. Cindi's cafe, walking distance from the hotel, is phenomenal. There is a bar/restaurant connected to the hotel. I did not eat there but the first night we went, they \"closed\" the bar at 9:40, when they have a closing time at 10. I was in the bar industry for a long time and if someone wants a drink, you give them a drink. The last night we were there the bartender happened to be part owner...he was great and apologized for his lazy bartender. I hope that they can pull it together someday because of the location and history.

We had to pay $20 more per night to have a room with two beds, and paid $15 per day for valet parking. We didn't mind that our room was small, but it was not as clean as it could havebeen. The free breakfast was horrible. Although we paid for valet parking, I looked out our window one morning at 6:15 a.m. and saw our car parked on the street in front of the hotel. I looked out again at 7:00 a.m. and it was gone! We returned to our room one afternoon at 2:45 p.m. and the room had not been cleaned! And when they cleaned it they did not give us clean water glasses or remove obvious trash, like a soda can. Yes, we left them on the table,because there was no room in the one tiny trashcan in the bathroom! Waited two hours for a blanket and received it only after calling back to the desk.

The hotel itself is wonderfully located, right by the Reunion Tower, Dealy Plaza and West End are within walking distance, Union Station right across the street to catch the DART trains (to the Fair!), and if that isn't enough, the hotel offers a shuttle to take you anywhere you want within a three mile radius (Farmers Market!). The hotel is older, but seemed to be well maintained with wonderful staff. Everyone was pleasant and the rooms were smallish but clean with a modern bathroom. However, one afternoon the fire alarm just kept sounding, on and off for several hours. We were told at the first sounding that \"someone had opened an alarm door\", then the next time \"someone is smoking on the tenth floor\", then the third time 'a bad wire and a technician is on the way\". After those explainations, we stopped leaving the room and asking questions for the rest of the alarms. I thought the situation could have been handled better. Probably not smart on our behalf to stop leaving the room, in case there was an actual fire, but walking up and down 4 flights of stairs for no real solution gets to be bothersome. Had this happened from 1am to 4am, I could see myself getting upset because no-one knew the reason, thus no immediate soultion to the problem. Also, we did not receive the wake up call on Sunday morning, but I consider that my fault for not setting the clock alarm as a backup. Despite the alarms and extra sleep, I would definitely recommend this hotel, based on location alone. If you plan to sightsee Dallas, this is the place.

I mean...milk and cookies! So yeah its different. The hotel breakfast was top notch, the views from the room excellent too. The only fault i could find with the hotel was that i used the atm in the hotel and this for some reason gave me a crummy exchange rate. Not the fault of the hotel, if i were to stay again ild make sure i withdraw from a bank. If you dont have a laptop they offer a computer in the lobby with free internet. They ask you only use it for 20 minutes. I used it far longer than that sometimes (only when there wasnt anyone around waiting) and it was a great touch. To offer the service for free is a fantastic thing especially when some hotels make you pay \u00c2\u00a34 for 15 minutes. however remember theres only one computer, so if youre desperate to get onto the net you may have to wait your turn :) so yeah, smaller independent hotels that arent a mecure or hilton do need support. but only if they provide a service that is of decent quality.

Unlike most of the big chain hotel options available downtown, there are no cookie-cutter rooms at the Hotel Lawrence. Each guestroom's decor is different; no two are exactly alike, and the rooms include little \"extra comforts\" (like the bathroom fully stocked with everything from organic shampoos and lotions to cotton pads to Q-tips in a cute little glass jar, and a full-body spray adjustable shower with dual heads). The rooms are small, which is a drawback, but this is common in historic hotels where the original rooms have been preserved intact (which, historically speaking, is a good thing.) My room was clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated. Built in 1925, the Lawrence has been restored with care. The owners have shown a lot of love for this old place; they have researched the hotel's history and understand it's importance and proximity to the heart of Dallas. Several great photographs of the Hotel Lawrence's past adorn the walls, telling visitors the story of it's evolution from railroad hotel to tourist destination. My room was 1001, located in a corner niche' of the 10th floor. Although it was right by the ice machine and the elevator, that noise never roused me (although a few late night noises from the ghosts which are rumored to haunt the 10th floor did!). The room also afforded a great view of the Old Red courthouse and Dealey Plaza - and of course, everything is within easy walking distance. Only drawback is parking - street parking is often available nearby, or if you don't want to feed the parking meters, there's always easy self-parking at the train station next door for five bucks, or a valet parking option the hotel offers for $15. Another plus is that this is not a noisy hotel (not much outside street or traffic noise can be heard), not a party palace like the Hyatt Reunion. It's quiet, low-key, laid-back, and easygoing. The staff is so helpful - if you need *anything* at 3am, they are there for you! They also offer a free shuttle van to help you get around downtown and are always going the extra mile to make sure your every need is taken care of.

May I first start by pointing out that the Hotel Lawrence is a three star hotel and it should be viewed as just that. The online reservation system was easy to use and took very little time to complete. The hotel has an address for Houston Street but the entrance and the valet parking is located on the north side of the building, on Jackson Street. Check in went very smooth and we selected the valet parking for $15.00 per day. Parking is across the street at Union Station where you can park your car yourself for $5.00 per day. The parking spots that are reserved for the valet seemed to have more room than the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153open\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd parking spots. If you have a larger vehicle I would opt for the valet parking. The friendly and helpful staff greeted us upon our arrival and informed us our requested room would not be available for the night. They gave us room 1003, which had a great view of the Old Red Courthouse Museum and Dealey Plaza. Our room while being small with one queen bed was very clean. The 10th floor is all smoking but that did not pose any problems. The walls are thin and we could hear people in the adjacent room while we were getting ready for the evening. This hotel was built in 1925 and does have some rough edges and in need of some updating but this would not keep me from returning. There are two elevators in the lobby. The one on the left is in need of repair and was being used as a service elevator by the staff. We did not have any problems with the elevator on the right at any time. The Fitness room was small and had a few machines. More than two people would probably be too many in this room to workout. Our evening started at the West End, which is about two blocks north of the hotel. We met a friend at Landry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Seafood where we enjoyed a delicious meal and libations. We then purchased day passes ($3.00ea) for the DART light rail to go to Poor David\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pub on South Lamar to listen to music. The train is clean and has been a good way to get around, but it can be a little scary later in the evening. The concert was over at 1:30AM but we had to leave at 11:30PM as the last train departs Cedars station at ~11:45PM. Our room did not have any coffee in it but we did not bother to ask for any as they serve Starbucks coffee in the Breakfast Chamber with the breakfast. Breakfast was good and we found a nice selection of items. The Texas shaped waffles were very good. Our bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed a good night sleep except for the phone ringing at 2:30AM. There was not anyone on the other end. We figured someone just dialed our room by mistake or just maybe it was one of the ghosts that are supposed to be on the 10th floor? The shower had good pressure and plenty of hot water in the morning. The next day we decided to visit the 6th floor museum at Dealey Plaza. This is just two blocks north of the hotel. The cost was $13.50 per person and includes a headset for the audio tour. We were impressed with the museum and the way the material is presented. You have a strange eerie feeling while viewing the exhibits and looking out the 6th floor windows onto Dealey Plaza below. I would suggest arriving early to beat the tour busses. Recording or photography is not allowed inside the museum. The museum opens at 10:00AM Tuesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sunday and opens a 12:00PM on Monday. There and several other attractions and restaurants to visit within walking distance of the Hotel Lawrence while the Dart light rail opens up many more options to explore. One thing we noticed while we were walking around is the many panhandlers in the area. 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3 people approached us on each block asking for money or trying to sell us something. We would stay here again due to the convenient location and the helpful staff. You can take a chance on cheaper \u00e2\u20ac\u0153last minute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rates that are offered at other hotels in the downtown area if you are able to be flexible. If you like to explore and get out, this hotel will prove to be a great starting point. If you are looking for a room to retreat into and spend your time, you may want to look at other properties unless you are OK with the small rooms. We did not see any of the other types of rooms that are available, so we can not make a comment about their size.

The restaurant had changed owners immediately prior to our arrival, so full-service breakfasts were temporarily unavailable, but the hotel's breakfast room served an enhanced continental breakfast that included the usual pastries, cereals, and fruits, plus biscuits and gravy, hard-boiled eggs, and Texas-shaped waffles, Cookies and milk are served in the lobby every night at bedtime. The bellmen are helpful and try to anticipate their guests' needs. While the rooms are not furnished in glossy modern styles and tend to be smaller than the typical world-wide chain, Hotel Lawrence makes the frequent traveler feel -- well, maybe not at home, but as though he was stopping over at a friend's house for a day or so.

I dealt with 3 or 4 different receptionists and they all were fantastic. Another nice touch is the $1 bottle of water. You get 2 free in your room, and if you need more they sell them for only $1. You can't beat that, and if you are nice they give them to you for free anyway. I never paid the extra $1 for additional bottles, and I probably had 5 or 6 extra.

The staff was friendly enough and the cookies and milk in the evenings was a nice touch, but I don't think it will be at the top of my list when we go back next time.", "Date": "August 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texarkana", "Title": "\u201cLawrence-Convienient & Classy\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3797528", "Content": "The Hotel Lawrence was really nice. We took our 2 year old to Dallas on a train ride because she loves trains, and chose the Lawrence because it is directly across from the Amrak station and other west end activities. We chose right. The staff was great. They took us on the hotel shuttle to the aquarium and zoo at no charge. They even came to pick us up and were super friendly about it. If youve ever pushed a tired toddler in a stroller up hill, you know how nice a shuttle service is - however most west end activities would be in walking distance. Theyre just a few blocks over. The hotel was classy, but small. It seemed like everything was a mini version. It was well maintained though. We were skeptical of only having a queen size bed over a king, but it worked out for the best. It gave much needed snuggle time. :) All in all, you cant beat the price and service. It would have been nice to have more space in the lobby, rooms and breakfast areas, but I guess nothing is ever perfect. It was a nice trip, and we will stay here again for sure.", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Lawrence", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d109454-Reviews-Hotel_Lawrence-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$88 - $141*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">302 South Houston Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dallas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TX</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">75202</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "109454", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/6d/73/6d739d66cef7fbe42dd0c12eba51fdef5large.jpg"}}

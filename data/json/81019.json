The room had a stale, musty smell, almost as if there had been water damage at some point. There was a mini bar with nothing in it - I'm guessing the type of guests who stay here either can't afford the cost of a drink or two, or that the hotel can't control 'shrinkage'. Pretty sad. The worst part was the shower (no bath), which was so tiny that I could barely turnaround in it, with a flimsy curtain that did little to contain the water. The morning after our first night (we had booked for a week), I called the Westin St. Francis next door and got a reservation: goodbye Handlery! Our room at the Westin was only $60 - $70 per night more, for a much bigger room, larger bath room, sitting area, etc. The most interesting part was that no one asked us why we were leaving after only one night.

You thought hey it might be nice to stay right on Union Square and in the front of the Cable Car line, So you check the St Francis rates...ouch. Here's an alternative: The Handlery Hotel on Geary St right across from the St Francis. Although it's a small hotel, the rates aren't always fabulous because of it's location, when they are, grab a room. The hotel has 2 buildings. One is a newer building that backs onto Ofarrell St and the older section is the front where the lobby is located and is on Geary St. I stayed there several years ago when I attended a conference. I stayed in the older building which they call \"the historic rooms\". At that time, they up graded me to a room that had a sweet sitting room attached to it with sofas. This time they were having a promotion and I booked a \"historic room\". I requested a view if possible and I was given a room on Geary St. Do not make that mistake, I was wokened up at 3am by what I surmised as the clanging of garbage trucks. The room was small but had a quaint bay window in it. I usually don't mention bathroom size, but, this was the smallest bathroom for hotel room with the exception of Parisien hotels I've stayed in. They have done a nice job with decor. When you step into the hallway you can tell that this was an old hotel. The floors creaked when walking down the hall and plumbing pipes are mounted where you can see them as is some of the electrical ware. The stairway is narrow. Again, it is well decorated and reminds you that the heart of SF was bustling before indoor plumbing and electricity. But, here's the real plus-the location. You are 1/2 block from Macys, close to all the Union Square shopping, down the street from the Broadway type theaters, 3-4 blocks from shopping on Market St and the Hyde-Powel Cable Car turnaround. The staff will help you if you would like to catch a bus to ...? They also have a concierge. I did not use the pool, but it is encircled by both buildings so is protected from the wind. It is a fairly large size with a few tables and lounge chairs. It would be especially nice if traveling with children and having something for them to do at the end of a day of museums and shopping.

I had considered booking the previous day (Friday) but sadly it was more expensive and already booked, besides which I had a previous engagement. When I arrived at the hotel to check in, the staff were unable to locate my reservation. After some back room consultations, the front desk rep produced records showing that I hadn't checked in the previous night, and so my reservation had been canceled and I'd been charged for a \"no show\". Of course, I hadn't checked in the previous night because I'd been several hundred miles away in my own bed, exactly as planned. After another fifteen minute wait, the rep informed me that the suite was free tonight (obviously a surprise, given I'd booked it) and he'd be happy to rent it to me for an additional two hundred dollars. (This actually ended up coming out to about $260 because of something about pre-discount taxes and surcharges), so I ended up out of pocket about $625 for one night in this admittedly rather nice room. But not $625 nice. Not even close.

Nice enough that you can buy what you need, but in this day and age wifi is pretty important for figuring out where to go and how to get there in a big place like Union Square San Francisco.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Canaan, CT USA", "Title": "\u201cSecond Visit, One Year Later\u201d", "Author": "whmurray", "ReviewID": "UR125553881", "Content": "All right, Let's get this out of the way up front. Like most moderately priced hotels in San Francisco, the Handlery is an old property. In one or two places, the carpet looks a little bit shabby. However, in all the ways that count, this is a nice comfortable, full-service hotel that may be one of the best values in this very expensive city. Accommodations On my latest trip, I had room 847, spacious and nicely furnished. It was larger than the room I had last year, perhaps because I mentioned that I had reviewed them for Tripadvisor. On the other hand, the bath was not quite as spacious. There was a desk with lamps, desk-top plugs, and a great chair, In addition to the desk, there was a large dining table. Under the large flat-screen TV there was a small refrigerator. I liked the interface on the TV. On the power on screen, there is a scroll that shows the available channels and their numbers. This saved me from having to scroll to find the channel that I wanted. Since I now watch movies on my iPad, I did not notice the movie selection or the prices but I would expect them to be good.. I almost forgot that there was a safe in my room. There was a coffee bar in the room, but since the weather was good, I just went across the street to one of the three Starbucks in the block. (Lest you think that is a lot of Starbucks, there is a spot on Market street from which one can count five Starbucks. There are another two closer than the furthest of the five but which one cannot see.) One of the advantages of an older property was the large walk-in closet. [I hate those tiny presses that pass for closets in \"modern\" hotels. ] The clock radio had a line-in connector for mobile computers. As an iPhone user, I might have liked an iPhone adapter but this arrangement accommodates my iPad, laptop, and your Android or Windows device. The king-size bed had a very comfortable mattress, plenty of big fluffy pillows and a bolster. There was a room service breakfast menu and order form on the bed. Okay, there was no scale in the bathroom. That is by way of saying that is the only thing I missed. All of the permanent and consumable amenities were there, including my favorite, the curved shower curtain bar that makes the shower seem more roomy. There was a generous supply of generous sized towels and was clothes. The modern plumbing delivered plenty of hot water. Amenities The Handlery offers all the amenities one would hope for, from a knowledgeable, polite, and helpful concierge to shampoo in the bath. There is a very nice pool in a large atrium, a barber-shop, a business center, and an exercise facility. While I did not avail myself of any of these things, they were all pleasant, well-equipped, and popular. While this is not a convention hotel, there is a small number of meeting rooms. Wireless Internet is $9.95 per day or $40- per week (per device). While free would be nice, this is cheaper than most commercial hotels. These think nothing of charging $20 per day on top of much higher room rates. (In the US, economy hotels include free Internet but luxury properties charge extra.) Last year, when I mentioned that I had three computers, they gave me a code.) There is a vending machine and an ice machine across from the elevator on all floors. Unlike most hotels, where one finds the vending machine by the noise, these are silent (Silent!) and out in the open. Dining is in the Daily Grill. For world travelers, the Grill is a very popular pub. You can find the menu on the web. I like it so well that I try to eat there at least once on any trip to San Francisco. Transportation The Handlery is at Union Square, the heart of San Francisco. The garage entrance is two blocks up Cyril Magnin from the Powell Street BART station, 30 minutes and $8.10 from SFO. One can spit from the front entrance to the Powell Street Cable Car. There is always a taxi queue at the door. (I shared a cab to the airport with a colleague; the fare was $66- before tip) San Francisco has world class public transportation and Google and the BART app, make it easy to use. However if you choose to drive, guest parking in the Handlery garage is $34.00 per day, a discount from the daily rate for those who are not guests. Other The Handlery is a no-smoking property and one must agree to a $250- cleaning charge if one violates this policy. Of course, many Americans prefer smoke-free properties. The result is fresh and pleasant atmosphere throughout. (I did notice an ash tray by the pool.) I hope that this review has helped you decide whether the Handlery is for you and that, if you choose it, you will have a pleasant stay.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood, central place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Charlotte F", "ReviewID": "UR125532929", "Content": "I stayed here for 2 nights in February 2012 and had a fine stay.

The room was in the \"old part\" of the hotel and, after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I braced myself for a tiny room. I was pleasantly surprised to be given a huge room! It was almost like a two room suite with one queen size bed with it's own TV in one section of the room and another queen size bed with it's own TV and fridge in another section of the room. It was really wonderful. Yes, the heating system was a little loud but it provided the perfect \"white noise\" to drown out any \"SF city life\" noise.

Whilst we did stay a little while ago, I am currently planning a trip back to America, and felt compelled to review the hotel. Originally, our travel agent here in Australia booked us into Hotel Union Square around the corner. We were forced to move from the hotel after being there for an hour because the room was filthy. While my mother and I decided what to do about our accomodation problems, we walked down the road and saw the Handerly. The exterior is beautiful; looks like a five star hotel and is extremely welcoming. While we were standing admiring the hotel (and wishing we were there instead of our disgusting hotel!) the concierge came out to us and asked us if we needed help. Even though it was raining and we weren't even in the hotel lobby, he came to help us. After telling him about our terrible hotel, he escorted us to the front desk. From there, the man at the desk helped us find a room. There were only two rooms available with two double beds; one near the pool or one near the lift. We chose to stay near the lift. Apart from the lovely staff helping us find a room, they also went out of their way again that night. We asked the concierge whether he thought a taxi would pick us up from the previous hotel and drive us around the corner with our two huge suitcases and two carry-on cases. We were expecting to either pay for a cab, or have to drag them up the street. While taking two bags around the corner may not sound difficult, by this point it was late at night and raining, and our bags were very heavy. The lovely concierge told us he would bring a trolley to the first hotel, and wheel it back for us to The Handerly. We were shocked by how kind and helpful he was! He told us to meet him in the Hotel Union Square lobby in 15 minutes with our bags packed. We walked back, and 15 minutes later when we stepped out of the lift, he was there with another staff member, who took our bags from us, walked us to the back entrance of The Handerly and took us straight to our room! The room was clean, quiet and had a nice view of the street. The hotel is in an EXCELLENT location, and the restaurant and room service was brilliant. On the day we left, the concierge got us a taxi as soon as we asked and helped us with our bags. Our stay at the hotel was amazing; the staff were fantastic and helped us with anything we needed. The room was great and big, and the prices are reasonable. I am looking forward to staying at the Handerly again when I return to San Fran!

At the doorstep are a range of galleries and shopping galore, from luxury labels to Levis to more modest options and Chinatown - which is extensive - is a short walk away and definitely worth exploring. Our favourite meals were at an Asian fusion restaurant called The House - divine - (about 30 mins walk away) and the seafood restaurant Fog Harbour, down at Pier 39 (Fisherman's Wharf). We didn't order room service much but we enjoyed what we ate in-house, which comes up from The Daily Grill downstairs. Staff at every level were friendly and polite, and housekeeping is excellent.

Approximately 5 days prior to our arrival, I received a call from hotel staff that the hotel's computer system had accidentally overbooked the evening of Wednesday, October 5 (the big Oracle conference was in town) and that we could NOT stay at the hotel that Wednesday evening. While I was quite upset that we couldn't stay there, management did two things to accommodate our family's inconvenience. First, and most importantly, they put us up at the St. Regis hotel Wednesday evening. We had a very comfortable sleep after flying all night coming in from the East coast! Second, upon our return to the Handlery Hotel early Thursday evening after a busy day of sightseeing, we found a nice \"Thank You for understanding\" basket filled with a bottle of wine, crackers, nuts, etc. waiting for us in our room from Jon Handlery, the President of Handlery Hotels, together with a very sincere apology for this inexcusable screw-up. Bottom Line: My wife and I felt they provided outstanding customer service to \"right the wrong\" that impacted our vacation. We stayed in a room in the new section that overlooked the pool and it was VERY quiet. I pretty much summarized the reviews I had read on TripAdvisor down to two key items: Stay in the new section and get a room overlooking the pool. Our room fulfilled both of those requirements. We had two queen sized beds and a room that, while not large, was spacious enough for a family of four. It was also a very clean room. The only negative, as others have pointed out, was that getting to the room required going up some stairs and then walking down a long hallway. Nonetheless, we didn't find it to be a great inconvenience. Location: This is what we really appreciated about the hotel. It's close to Starbucks, Union Square, a number of amazing restaurants and shops, the theatre district, and it was very close to a great breakfast diner right around the corner (Lori's Diner -- we ate there EVERY day for breakfast and my two kids, wife and I LOVED it!). For a few evenings where we came back late from sightseeing, the Daily Grill, connected to the Handlery Hotel, fit the bill for good overall American Cuisine. Steaks, pasta, hamburgers, seafood -- you name it, they got it. And the overall quality of the food was pretty decent.

Since I am not a tourist, my requirements are very specific regarding location, and I prefer to stay close to Union Square and lower Nob Hill because of transportation, ease of walking to my old haunts, and it being well-lit and well-traveled at night if I am alone on foot. The Handlery is in an excellent location, on Geary Street just off of Powell, with access to buses, cabs, and the Powell street cable car line. This is an older hotel, with a new and an old wing. I had stayed here in 2008 (booked through Expedia, as always) and stayed in the old wing. Those rooms are very small (when they say \"petite\" they mean it!) but had been given an upgrade so the bathroom was quite large. When I booked this trip I did not count on an upgrade due to my length of stay (5 nights) and I expected a small room and a small bathroom. Having read some recent reviews, I knew some recent guests had been surprised at the size of both, but I only stay at boutique hotels in San Francisco so I was prepared. Or so I thought. While the size of the room was in keeping with what I expected, the layout was not. The TV faced the desk, so I guess they expect guests to sit in a straight backed chair with their feet on their dresser to watch TV. ( Or watch with the eyes in the back of their heads while they sit at their desk?) If you want to watch TV in bed, you have to sit with your neck turned as the TV barely turns toward the bed. (Due to a nerve problem with my neck, I ended up with a migraine from this.) And then there is the bathroom. Because the ice machine is directly behind this room, 210, the bathroom is tiny. Oh, it's well lit (although the magnifying mirror on its extending arm was so high and far back on the wall as to do me no good, and I am 5'3\") but the shower (no tub) is LESS THAN FULL SIZE. It's not even a full stall shower! It's triangular in shape and the drain is almost at the threshold of the shower. I don't see how a taller or heavier person could have bathed effectively in it and God forbid a gal should try to (gasp!) shave her legs! In order to get under the shower head I was against the curtain (which, incidentally, smelled like a rancid dishrag). I have short hair so my showers are short but they were not relaxing and who needs a shower to be stressful? The staff were pleasant enough (although no bellman offered to help me with my gigantic suitcase and it took me no fewer than four phone calls to get a sharp knife when I wanted to slice some cheese one evening when I was eating cheese and crackers in my room) and other than the stinky shower curtain the room was clean. I did not ask to move rooms because their business center costs $5.00 per 20 minutes and I was not going to waste my time and money researching their website to see if 3/4 baths are mentioned anywhere. (They ARE NOT.) Even if they were, this hardly qualified as that shower was not even a full sized stall shower. I know--I have lived with several! If you consider this hotel, the absolute pluses are: location, cleanliness and the pleasant staff. But be prepared for TINY TINY TINY rooms and if you can, avoid room 210 unless you are there for a very short stay. I, for one, will not be back unless I can be assured that I will never have that small a bathroom again.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Titusville, FL", "Title": "\u201cLove the Handlery\u201d", "Author": "jpaq68", "ReviewID": "UR121558559", "Content": "A few years ago, while looking for a hotel in San Francisco, I chose the Handlery for the simple reason that it was near my favorite nightspot and I haven't wanted to stay anywhere else ever since.

On the third day, I booked a room and invited my friend. We only stayed one night but the experience was the best. When I booked, I asked for the conference rate because the official hotel was Handlery. I was given the conference rate without a problem for two doubles. I arrived and was initially given a handicapped accessible room with two twin beds. I had originally booked two doubles. I changed the room because the accessible bathroom had a big room to shower in with no shower curtain and a hand held shower head, the windows faced an outdoor hole in the hotel and I felt like I was in a closet with no air flow, and I am tall and can't sleep on a tiny twin bed. I simply asked to be changed. The front desk was calm and nice and had no problem with a switch. I was switched to a very small room with one double bed and had to switch again because of the mistake in needing two beds. No big deal. I went down stairs and waited in line again and was helped at the front desk. I had asked for just the courtesy of a window facing the street because I wanted air and to see the street, any street. The front desk clerk, Matthew, was looking in his black binder to find me a room with a street view and two beds. He has looked on several floors when I asked \"do suites have two beds.\" Matthew replied \"yes.\" He quickly booked me into a family suite for one night. When I got to the room, I was so happy. We had windows! Moreover, I was actually touched at the quality of the service. I went to the windows to catch a glimpse of the street and found that I had a corner room with a view of Union Square's Ice Skating Rink!!!! I also ended up with two rooms so I gave my friend, who put me up at her house for two nights, her own room. We opened the windows and had a great cross breeze and a fantastic view. This room was an entirely different experience. The other two rooms I had to get out of were both like closets. They actually gave me a feeling of being closed into a space that I was trapped in. I could not have stayed in either room. On the other hand, the room I ended up in (family suite) was the best because it had that open feel, the character of the older hotel and the best view I couldn't have dreamed up in my wish list. Each room had a flat screen TV, there was one walk in closet, a fridge and a coffee maker. The beds were great. The pillows varied and I slept fine until the protest at 7am on Sunday morning. There were protesters at the Frank Hotel that woke the entire block up with sirens and mega phone chanting and I resent that because we had been up early every day for the conference and Sunday was our only day to sleep. The noise wasn't too bad for being above the street and I slept fine until the protesters woke me. I don't sympathize with the protesters because of their wake up service. The window with the best view had a broken blind and it was some work to tie it up to really get that uninterrupted view while having company later on the night of our stay. I would choose the family suite again but not the regular rooms. The service was the best of any hotel and they worked with me every step of the way. Some rooms are VERY SMALL.

We visited the pool every day, but the trouble was there was no sun that time of year until just after 4, and it was boiling hot weather when we visited about 90 each day! There are lots of beggars as I was warned, but they were no problem to us. We purchased a 3 day Muni pass for $21 each, which worked out good value as the trams were $6 each way.

I was looking for a hotel in San Francisco that had balconies. Sadly, I smoke, but I never smoke indoors. I feel if I'm paying a good amount of money to stay somewhere, I feel I shouldn't have to be incovenienced to have to completely exit the hotel and go out onto the street in the middle of the night for a smoke. The Handlery does allow smoking on their balconies ONLY. Non-smokers, don't worry, the hotel prohibits smoking in their recently refurbished rooms. Unusual for San Francisco is the fact that the hotel has an outdoor swimming pool, which is large enough to do laps in. They also have a small gym. The hotel is connected to the Daily Grill, which is an upmarket restaurant chain. The restaurant has a good selection of breakfast items, from lox and bagels to eggs benedict. The turkey melts at lunch are delicious. Wasn't so wild about the burger, which I expected to be a little thicker and juicier, it was kind of on the thin side and dried out. They do have a great bar, I have to say, and great for meeting people. The hotel is well-situated next to Union Square, it's easy getting around. Not to mention, if you're taking the train into town from SFO airport, the Handlery is about the closest hotel to the Powell Street station. Don't waste your money on a cab, the train practically takes you to the doorsteps of the Handlery. I loved my sizeable balcony with patio furniture. I could sit outside, have a drink and smoke and watch the cable cars going down Powell Street. Make sure to ask for a room facing O'Farrell if you want a balcony and view of the cable cars. Ice machines on every floor as well as soda machines. Complimentary bottled water in the room and really liked that the room had an eclectric shoe shine which came in handy since I was going to a dressy event. Tony at the front desk was insanely helpful and helped me get a great room before check-in time. Strongly suggest if you are having an early arrival to call the hotel early, early that morning, as I did, to see if they can look out for you once the first room becomes available. If you ASK, they will try to accommodate. Ask and you shall receive, don't and you won't. The lobby was a good place for people watching, though not nearly as large a lobby as say the Hilton or the Marriott. Right behind the hotel is a Starbucks, big plus. Breakfast can be sent to your room by the way from the Daily Grill. I just found everyone at this hotel very helpful, and many went out of their way to help. I've seen complaints on tripadvisor from people harping on about the confusing maze of hallways getting from the old section to the new section of the hotel. Okay, trust me on this one, it's a crazy, isane, whiny complaint. There's nothing confusing about it at all, it's not difficult at all to get around the hotel. The complaint is just crazy. Some people have written that the hotel needs renovation. Well, I'll agree the corridors on the guest floors could be updated and more upmarket, but they were fine. As for the rooms, they have been renovated nicely within the last couple of years and the premium room features a separate boudoir area adjoing the bathroom so your wife can be applying makeup while you shower or use the toilet. The premium rooms have a couch and black marble-topped coffee table which was nice for entertaining guests: a drink in the sitting area and a nice sit out on the balcon--lovely. I didn't want to leave this hotel. It may be imperfect, but it's very homey, and I was sad to leave. I have to admit, as someone who works in film and TV, I really loved the video the owner has online. I clicked on expecting some brainless person saying just how wonderful the hotel is, but the owner does a comedy sketch where he insults the guests, it was hysterical and well-done, he should be acting. I guess I liked his gumption so much that I thought, I don't need to look anymore, I like this guy's spirit and sense of humor, I have to believe I'll have a nice stay, and a nice stay I had. I would definitely go back. Note to families, my premium king had the option of a connecting room. And for those of your watching your pocketbooks, the Handlery is consistently the best value in San Francisco. Truly. I researched and researched, no hotel of its quality ever matches their prices. For this stay I checked the Hyatt Regency which is not even at the center of town, and they wanted more than 550 a night for just a room. For 189 a night, in a very busy hotel week, I had a sitting area and balcony. Staying at the Handlery was kind of a no-brainer. It's not glitz and glamour, but it's a comfy place to stay, paces away from the American Conservatory Theater, the Powell Street cable car, and Union Square. I recommend it. Oh, one last thing, there are complaints on here about too much street noise which worried me...huh? I don't get it. My room was utterly quiet and I was facing the street not the interior courtyard pool. Not noisy at all. Slept like a baby. Nice Serta beds as well and great fluffy pillows, wanted to take them home with me. I had such a good sleep. Nice touch also, you don't have to bring toothpaste or a toothbrush, it's provided in the room, with good quality soap and shampoo. I think they should advertize this on their site. It would have prevented me scrambling for a TSA-approved size of toothpaste before leaving for SFO. This an eco-friendly hotel for those of you who care about the environment.

I had the salmon and shared the chocolate pot de la creme. Delicious!!!!!! That was probably my favorite food during the entire trip.

Not a big deal, but I would advise that you off-load your bags with the bellhop at the front, check-in and then pull your car to the parking lot. Check in was smooth and the staff was friendly. I had a premier room on the 7th floor with a balcony overlooking O'Farrell Street. I LOVED my room. It was spacious with a large main room, desk, living area and patio. The bathroom was average sized but it had an additional vanity outside the bathroom and a good sized closet. Not only was my room awesome, but I also got two free bottles of water and two $5 Starbuck's gift cards. I felt so lucky! I have two complaints. 1. The hotel free WiFi was horrible. I could not video chat, which is a necessity for me because my boyfrined is deployed to Iraq right now and this time is precious for us. Not sure what the hotel could do about the WiFi. 2. If you have noisy neighors, you'll hear everything. I had some loud people next to me and they were talking really loud really late. It almost sounded like they were in the hall, but they were in the next room. You can also hear toilets and doors closing. I realize it's a hotel and there will be noise and it's not the hotel's fault that those people were loud. But, I wish people had more respect...it was the middle of the night! You can also hear lots of street noise, but that dies down later in the evening.

The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of Union Square in downtown San Francisco. From the time we stepped off the plane I decided to call the hotel for a direct but reasonable choice in transportation to the hotel. Immediately I was greeted by Jason an employee of the hotel. He gave me clear and precise choices without being biased over one or the other. Being a person who takes customer service and attention to detail very seriously, my wife was quite impressed with his knowledge of the city and its surrounding areas. As soon as I take a hotel shuttle to the hotel (very reasonable at $17 a person), we were immediately greeted by the bellman Hermie. Now we could tell he's been doing this a while as it seemed like he knew we were coming all along. Very friendly and very efficient. Then it was onto the Front Desk where Tony helped us out of a small jam. Tony gave me a small warning that the Hotel Frank had protests across the street and that may interrupt our sleep in the morning because we were facing the Geary side of the hotel. Knowing I didn't want to get woken up rudely by them he helped me move over to the Premiere side of the building so that we could a more comfortable stay. Great job for that. To our surprise a voice message from Jon Handlery the owner and GM of the hotel was waiting for us! He apologized for not being to meet us in person and that he wished us a wonderful stay in the city. I don't know about you folks but to me when someone from the top genuinely cares about the welfare of his/her guests, then that makes me want to come back again and again. The room was quite spacious with a singly king bed and we were able to overlook the outdoor pool (which is heated by the way!). Along with the usual amenities it was nice seeing a snack bag in our room as we were starving from our long trip from New York. Seeing a mini fridge in the room helped as well as we are not huge eaters and bringing back leftovers is a must. During the rest of the trip I wasn't able to interact with many other staff as I was consistently out exploring the town but I can tell you that everyone I did speak or interact with was very enthusiastic and it seemed like they loved what they were doing. The only thing I would say could use improvement, however, is their air conditioning system. Seemed like everyday it was quite hot inside of the room but the Front Office Manager Catherine, and Engineer Carmelo took care of us to make sure our room was in working order. Good to see an efficient bunch of employees. Overall this is the best hotel we've experienced in the San Francisco area so far.

Thanks to Google maps, I found the \"Shopping Center\" destination to be the closest!). I just walked up Powell, took and left on Geary, and there was the big \"H\" sign for Handlery...easy! The check in was fast and efficient; I asked for an inside corridor room (I needed quiet from the street noise since my partner was flying back from Hong Kong and needed to rest) which the reception desk courteously accommodated and even upgraded the room! Although the room was characteristically \"compact\", (given its vintage era) it was efficient and updated with a large flat screen TV, marble bathroom, large closet with an in room safe (with a \"key\", imagine that?!)

Seriously, if you can avoid taking a car, I would recommend it since public transportation is fairly good, the problem only exists for you real \"nightowls\" who might find themselves stranded in the hood... There were lots of Australian visitors at the Handlery, they shared that the exchange rate is great (in their favor), and there are direct flights from Sidney....hmmmmmmm!

The cost of parking was truly out of line (almost $40 a day) and at the union square location, there are few other options. As for union square - it is centrally located and a great spot if you like shopping. Also a good taking off point for drives as it's not difficult to get to 101. It wasn't a great neighborhood for walking around, especially in the evening. We had a hard time finding a moderately priced restaurant within a 6 block walk. There was an above average diner around the corner. The biggest issue we had was with very aggressive pan handlers who quite literally followed us down the street hounding us and yelling at us in one case. We are not folks who dress extravagantly or otherwise draw attention to ourselves so I'm guessing it's just currently an issue in the Union Square area because of all the high end shopping. So overall - mixed emotions. Nice hotel but it wasn't a bargain, especially after adding on virtually another $50 a night for parking and internet.

We have not completed our stay here yet, however, I must say that this hotel does not come close to meeting our expectations. We even feel a bit uneasy giving a bad review because we are not picky travellers and have never had an experience like this. Throughout this California trip alone, we have stayed in 1-star motor inns, 4 star upscale hotels, and others in between. We have not had anything bad to say about any of our previous acconomodations, let alone what we have already experienced here. Our first encounter was with the valet parking service gentleman. I asked him if I could park my own car in the space as we had a lot of luggage that would require multiple trips. We also had some loose items that we wanted to pack away before unloading. He could barely speak English and just kept saying \"NO, I PARK, NO I PARK, YOU NO PARK\". We come from Toronto and are very used to multi-culturalism, however, we could not understand a word he was saying. I again asked him if I can park myself, and he said \"NO, YOU PAY $38 PER NIGHT AND I PARK\". We unloaded all of our luggage onto the driveway and gave him the keys. If he would have explained it's valet-only, it would have made more sense to me. He could also have offered to get someone to assist us with our bags. From there, we were standing in the parking garage without any idea of how to enter the hotel or reach the elevator. Very poor service and a frustrating/awkward conversation. Especially when it's your first impression. The front-desk lady was very pleasant and professional. She promptly gave us a run down on the hotel as she quickly checked us in. However, when we got to our room and turned on the A/C, it started dripping down water. Unfortunately, the vent is on the ceiling right by the door so we got the moldy water on us. Yes, moldy water. Looking up into the vent, there were green and brown spots of mold from where it was consistently dripping down. We called the front desk and the same lady apologized and set us up with our new room. A guy came to the room, apologized, and asked me if I tried to clean it off. I found that interesting as it seemed as if he was suggesting the hotel guest should attempt to clean mold off the AC unit. For the record, I did attempt to clean it off but it was caked on. The good news is that we are currently in the new room that is mold-free as expected. I'm sure these instances are isolated based on the other reviews. It just doesn't make sense how you can have a valet guy that barely speaks English and is rude and does not even point you in the right direction or offer help. Additionally, having a customer pay $150+ per night to have mold and water drip on them as soon as they open their room door? We are not ones to complain, however, our 1-star motor inn back in San Diego trumps the service here at the Handerly in San Francisco! Perhaps we just caught a new guy on the job and had bad luck on the room allocation, however, we cannot give this hotel a positive or even adequate review.

Tip for riding trolley car - dont stand in the big queues at the end of the line, but try and hop on at one of the many trolley car stops at the stop lights along the route.

We didn't know the good from the bad, and our budget didn't allow for a five star hotel. We saw the reviews, and the hotel owner's videos and thought it would be a good match. We were extremely happy with our choice. After a room move to a higher floor, we settled into a spacious and modern room facing Geary. They are dog friendly which is a bonus for us. All and all the staff is great. A number of individuals went out of their way to assist (Matt the Front Desk Manager, the sixth floor housekeeper, and the overnight bellman at check out). Others were delightful in their interactions (Marty at the desk and the new female intern at the desk in particular) and a whole litany of other staff who really seemed to enjoy their jobs or at least interacting with guests. We did encounter some flat service here and there which became so obvious considering the rest of the staff. At check-in, we asked for the highest floor possible due to street noise (see below) and was told by the agent (name withheld) we were getting the highest floor available on two. Our bags had not even arrived and we knew we wouldn't be happy and called the desk to see about options. A different agent immediately offered a higher floor. Our first agent was efficient but cold as he told us no other rooms were available. This was also the same desk agent who bluntly told us we were wrong when we asserted our understanding that parking was included in our package rate. We asked that he double check, which he did, and low and behold, we knew what we purchased. Not enough to ruin our stay, but certainly stood out against a lot of other great people. Not rude, just flat, blunt and lacking warmth. Like a lot of higher end hotels they charge for internet access. Someday, I hope this tier of hotels will take a lesson from their lower tier brethren and nix the charge. After paying a premium for the room, it's seems like nickel and diming, especially when a Motel 6, or most any other place, includes it as an amenity. The one and only downside, was not their problem...there was a protest of a hotel across the street. Being awakened at 7 am on a Saturday during your vacation by a guy screaming into a bull horn \"no contract, no sleep\" is not fun. We heard this was due to an ongoing labor dispute. They made a lot of noise for four people. It's too bad the Handerly guests have to suffer. Suggest upgrading the windows on the next renovation to reduce the noise. Although, sans the protest, the street noise is tolerable if you've lived in a city if any size. The location is perfect if you are there to be a tourist, which we were. Close to everything. The atrium pool, the quaint but modern layout of the property and the rooms makes this a great place go stay.

As we live only an hour north it's our little getaway from home. This time we had family with us who flew in for my daughter's wedding and as they had never been to SF they wanted to stay one night in the city. We immediately told them we had the THE place to stay. About a month before their visit they called and made their reservation for a Club level room with a street view and two queen beds (they had teenagers with them). I immediately booked a room for my husband and I and requested Club level with a street view and a king bed and asked to be on the same floor as our relatives. The reservation person offered me ajoining rooms which I happily accepted. When we went to check into the hotel I was told that we could only get ajoining rooms with a pool view and that my husband and I would have two queen beds. When I questioned why our original request couldn't be honored I was told that blocks of rooms couldn't be reserved. Huh? Part of the fun in staying in SF, especially for people from out of town, is watching the people on the streets so that wouldn't work for us. We were then offered rooms on the same floor but not ajoining which we decided to accept but then found out that our room had no balcony. I wasn't aware that any of the street view rooms came without balconies and we wanted to be able to open the sliding door and enjoy the unusual warm weather that night so we requested to be moved. We finally ended up on seperate floors from our out of town relatives which was slightly inconvenient but acceptable. Other than the mix up with the rooms, everything was wonderful as usual. Large, modern and clean rooms, helpful staff and great location. We ate at the Daily Grill for the first time and my meal was excellent. We were also offered vouchers for free wireless internet which our relatives used.

After the unavoidable and horrible long flights over from Australia, after which we always feel like we have crawled out of a dumpster, and probably look like we have too unfortunately, at a very early morning check-in, to our great joy and relief we were assigned a room immediately. Bliss. I observed all the Reception staff trying to assign all guests at check-in a room immediately. This is a very commendable practice and shows a hotel with not only well trained staff but a very tight and regimented house-keeping system. How intelligent. And rare! Well done folks. We had an 8th floor room on right side building facing the pool and it had a room like balcony, perfect. The rooms are very spacious and fitouts quite luxurious. The hotel is deceptively large, in a spread out way causing the occasional oddity with lift access up one level to one wing. The staff are abundant and more than obliging helping guests with luggage at all times. However the hotel does cater to guests requiring Handicapped facilities and special access or rooms. Location is perfect. Right in the Retail Centre and Union Square area and an easy walk up or down to the BART station at a cost of only $US 8.10 per person to/from airport. Effortless. Recommend buying the 2 day tickets for the Hop on Hop off Buses and definitely as many rides on the thrilling cable car/trams across as many routes as possible. San Francisco is a vibrant city and great for walking around. Our only negative experience. Ten years ago there was evidence of a drug problem in SFO. This time from the minute we arrived in the CBD we were constantly approached by homeless/beggars. I calculate we (very carefully) handed out what amounted to $US 50.00 in small change across the course of the 3 days. Great care needs to be taken in any public place, Hot Dog stands, the BART ticket machines, similar. They pounce. Usually it is just a request for the change but can be overwhelming.

The hotel staff really went above and beyond in their friendliness and helpfulness. Lawrence at the bell station was extraordinarily thoughtful and helpful to us as we were attempting to check in with our little one and the small mountain of equipment we needed to bring along to change/feed/entertain her. At check in, the desk was extremely helpful in changing us from a single queen bed to two double beds room (we found earlier on in the trip how helpful that extra bed is when you have a little one) and placing us in a room away from the noisy street. Another example of the amazing service, was that my wife and I were talking to ourself about getting a bottle ready for our little one, and hoping that there was a microwave in the room (there was not). The staff must have heard us, because following our check-in and dropping off luggage in the room, an electric tea kettle magically appeared in our room while were out getting our own dinner. That simple act of kindness and thoughtfulness helped immeasurably in preparing formula for our little one later that evening when we were tired after a long day of travel. The room itself was immaculately clean, with nice features and fittings. The mattresses were a bit spongy for my tastes, but that's likely a matter of personal preference. The location can't be beat as you're literally only a few dozen steps from Union Square. One of the cable car lines terminates about 2 blocks from the hotel, so getting across town to Fisherman's Wharf or other attractions is simple. Chinatown is a few blocks away as well (uphill unfortunately) so you can get a good meal or cheap tourist trinkets there. Parking is reasonably priced ($39/day, with us getting a special that reduced that by a further 50%) with unlimited in-out privileges; which is something that costs twice as much in most other places (and probably a third or less of what it would be in NYC or Chicago). Note for those with baby strollers or in wheelchairs, getting from the garage to the hotel proper does involve some stairs, unless you utilize a freight style-elevator which was probably retrofitted to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act and is a bit slow and claustrophobic.

And the beds were tiny! Not even Queen size. I reckon they were king singles. No view at all. Our safe didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work either. And the bathroom was tiny. Again, this could all be due to the previous huge rooms leaving an impression on us. Our 1st night was marred by the fire alarm screaming at 4am. No one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, but standing in the cold S.F. rain at 4am seems to influence your opinions. Perhaps the most shocking thing is the $38.00 a night car parking fee. i dont know if this is a S.F. thing, or a common practise in inner city hotels, but i thought it was a ridiculous amount. I decided to hand my hire car in 2 days early instead of being slugged. Luckily, Hertz is right around the corner. The staff at the Handlery are perfect. Super friendly and helpful. The place itself is very clean and classy. Would I stay here again on my next trip to S.F.? Maybe. If I found somewhere in a similar good location, with maybe a bigger room and at about the same rate, I might stay elsewhere. But if I were to return, I would do so with no qualms. Just maybe, i\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay here first \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then go to the bigger rooms elsewhere in America.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wheatland, California", "Title": "\u201cLocation Location Location!\u201d", "Author": "TheBrowneCouple", "ReviewID": "UR102198492", "Content": "This was our first stay at the Handerly and we loved it.

My husband was timing a 5k for a group of conventioneers early in the A.M on Thursday. So, we arrived at 4 P.M. on Wednesday, in time to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. :) Our room was on the newer side \"Premier\" over the garage. Perfect location overlooking O'Farrell St. We had a spacious, King Premier balcony room. I just LOVED the location and it was on the 3rd floor, just as I requested. And, I really looked forward to the balcony! We were not disappointed! I just LOVE to watch the hustle and bustle of the city streets below. I had contacted Jon Handlery a few days before letting him now how impressed I am that he replies to everyone here on Trip Advisor. I also told him that my husband and I were spending one night at the Handlery for business and to celebrate our anniversay a month late. Next thing you know, he wrote me back even though he was out of the country, it turns out! And, he had his assistant contact me asking what we preferred--white or red wine, or champagne. So, when we walked into our room we were pleasantly greeted with a chilled bottle of bubbly and a bag of snacks and bottled water. And, a nice note. What a WONDERFUL gesture!! Thank you so much, Mr. Handlery! I loved the size of the room. It was perfect having a small couch and easy chair, as well as the desk. My husband needed to access the internet for business. It worked great! I notice the couch opens up as a bed, so there would have been room for our daughter! I really was impressed with the amenities in our room. Also, it really wasn't loud at night, even though we were facing the busy street. It wasn't a problem at all! I realize it wasn't a weekend. But, I love the city, so it wouldn't have bothered me. I loved the lighted make-up mirror and the little powder room, complete with cushioned, rolling stool. A very nice touch. The next morning there was a complimentary SF Chronicle newspaper at our door. And, after my husband got back from the 5k race, we both had a cup of coffee in the room. I would have preferred those little liquid half and half containers over the powdered creamer, however. :) But, the coffee was just fine, otherwise. Strong enough, too! The parking garage was a cinch. After initially working our way through the maze of stairs and hallways to arrive at the lobby, we never had to go over that way again. :) Since we stayed above the garage, it was easy just to take the elevator down and exit out on O'Farrell or pick up the car if needed. Very convenient. The ONLY thing I would change in our room is the MATTRESS and pillows. And, I mean the ONLY thing! :) I have to admit, I wasn't comfortable, although my husband slept like a baby. I'm used to my own feather pillow, as well as the less-poofy pillows I use against my back and between my knees. I also have THE most comfortable mattress in the world at home. Unfortunately, the mattress at the hotel seemed to dip toward the middle so I stayed more toward the edge. Again, I'm so used to my own bed, it's just hard to compare! The best hotel bed I ever slept in was a Heavenly Bed in Seattle a few years back. Oh my! I felt cradled in a firm, but gentle cloud. :) Handlery's bed-issue did NOT cause me to give it any less than 5 stars, though! Everything else about our stay was beyond perfect! That balcony was the selling point for ME! I will GLADLY book the same room or one close by at the Handlery Union Square again! Your family has really done an exceptional job with this hotel.

But do use it if you would like a spoken or pre-recorded guide of the city and making a day or half day of it. There are a couple of choices of routes but one ticket only covers the one route. Longer routes make journys more long winded. Consider the direction of the bus route before commiting to buying a day ticket, which is around $30. The bike route is recommended and caters for all abilities - you can do the entire route or just cycle part of it in one direction and take it on the ferry back to the hire shop.

The bed was comfortable, though housekeeping seemed to never tuck the sheets in correctly on the bed! At the base of the bed the sheets were always coming out. We also had a few itches and a number of other visitors mentioned same issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bites on their body. So not sure if we had some unwanted guests in the bed with us. The staff/team at the Handlery are very polite and helpful. Nothing ever a problem, any issues or questions quickly offer solution or answer. Well presented. We were given complimentary breakfast vouchers each morning, which was a nice surprise as we did not realise these were in our room cost. Three choices of three set meals and tea or coffee. All food OK (eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, waffles, cereal, yoghurt) though meals and coffee was not at hot, (lukewarm) on the first two mornings. Third morning was a lot better. My vote : this is an OK place to stay. The Handlery are close to having a great little spot to stay, and if the hotel could improve on the above mentioned items they could turn this into a much more appealing experience for their visitors.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cawesome location\u201d", "Author": "PalesaM81", "ReviewID": "UR92405922", "Content": "stayed for 3 days with my sister and while the hotel is pretty good - the location is what totally sells it. right next to macys and along a good shopping row. great places to eat around the hotel and easy access to the hop-on-off bus tours. hotel layout was strange though.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bonn", "Title": "\u201cfantastic location, comfortable beds, friendly helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "RobinBonn", "ReviewID": "UR91825581", "Content": "All in all, a great choice for a short stay in San Francisco.

We stayed on the street side during the week and it was fine as we weren't back in our rooms until about 10.30pm each night, but there was some street noise mainly during peak hour and I noticed the glass doors leading to the balcony weren't sound proof. The rooms also had a make up room and the bathrooms were a good size with showers that had great water pressure. We purchased an open red bus tour as well which is valid for 2 days for $28 which left from union square (less than 100 metres away) which got us every where e.g. China town, fishermans wharf, alcatraz cruise, pink ladies, haight, acadamy of sciences,etc. Our flight didn't leave San Fran until 11pm, but the hotel happily held our luggage from check out in the morning until we left the city at 8pm.

We did not have a view, but did not mind as we were sight seeing all day. We did not have the noise from the street either, so it was very quite at night time. Although we were supposed to be room only, we got complimentary breakfast for the 3 days. This was a choice of hot American breakfast with toast, Waffle or granola and fruit and a selction of tea or coffee. This was a pleasant surprise and very generally service at breakfast was excellent, although was often very busy. The hotel was centrally located and just a few minutes walk from the centre of Union Square, the Powell & Mason Cable Car and numerous shops and large department stores. We would recommend staying here rather than Fishermans Warf and Pier 33, as you can travel don to these areas during the day. For us there were several highlights of San Fransisco. Alcatraz was excellent (book online in advance through Alcatraz Cruises, approx $26 each for early bird tour - alot less people at this time). It was great to see the Golden Gate Bridge (although very foggy the first day we were there), eat in the Cliff House Restaurant, visit Golden Gate Park,take in a ball game only a few stops away),Pier 33 and all the usual tourist spots. If travelling on the Cable Car (return journey is approx $10 each) you still need to queue after you have bought the tickets. Even though the homeless guy in the orange vest is shouting that you don't need to! Do be careful as lots of homeless people about and do not walk to the left (away from Union Square) when you me out of the hotel. Generally though, San Fransisco seems fairly safe, just be careful of wallets etc as in any large city. We only wish we had longer in SF as 3 nights was not enough to see all the attractions.

We primary selected this hotel as compared to some of the large chain hotels because of 1) more affordable daily parking rate, 2) complimentary refrigerator in the room, 3) location and 4) daily room rate. My husband, myself and our 2 1/2 year old son and 3 week old daughter shared the room. This hotel is in an ideal location right in the heart of Union Square and near several eateries like Cheesecake Factory, Chipotle, Burger Bar and several fast food places and convenience stores. Honestly, the location couldn't have been better. We arrived around 7pm on a Friday night and were upstairs and in our room by 8pm. We met a few challenges on our first night which were concerning to myself as both a mother and a pediatric ER doctor. Parking is located on the ground level and is valet-only. Because of the way parking is set up, you need to get everything out of your car quickly so that the next person can move in to unload as well. This was extremely difficulty while traveling with children when you have a stroller and a ton of luggage and \"kids things\". We generally like to be self-sufficient in an attempt to save some money (ie: I don't like to have a bell man carry my luggage for a fee when I'm perfectly capable of doing it myself for free). After unloading however, we were informed that there was no way to access the lobby from the garage with a stroller as there is an obligatory flight of stairs between two portions of the lobby. They offered a bell-man to take us back a \"secret elevator\" to the lobby which I was not thrilled about knowing that we were now being forced to use the service because of lack of handicapped access. I asked if there would be a charge for the bell service (never having been to San Fran before, I wasn't sure, as there was a fee for parking etc). and Lawrence (bell-man) responded with \"A tip will do\". Wow. Tacky. And....embarrassing for us as we did not have any cash on us. I'm a firm believer that an establishment should pay its employees a fair wage being that tipping is not mandatory instead of relying on its customers to pay them in tips, and if service is above average, I'll tip. I guess I just don't see why I should give them extra money for doing their job. So basically if you have a stroller or a wheelchair you will be using the bell service and tips are expected so bring cash. There are two sides to the hotel (historic and new). The new side is not connected to the lobby completely by one set of elevators and you need to go up either a very historic looking wheelchair lift for one flight and then transfer to the main elevators or carry your stroller / wheelchair up a flight of stairs so there are obvious safety concerns there. Had we known about this, we probably would have booked elsewhere as it made every adventure outside very difficult with the stroller. The room was very nice however on the first night our room faced O'Farrell street, home to an Irish pub. Extremely loud music was blasted until 1 am or so and the noise from the street was extremely loud, so much that our family pretty much didn't sleep all night.. If you're going out on the town at night and want to have city views this is probably fine. However for a family with two small children on business, this was not ideal. We asked for a room switch which was granted the next day to a room facing the pool, on the interior of the hotel and had a wonderful two nights of sleep there. The manager that switched us was very friendly going out of his way to help with storage of our items during the room switch and the other manager we encountered, Catherine, was wonderful and helpful as well. The Daily Grill inside the hotel is small but very good. The refrigerator worked well for breast-milk storage which was a major concern of mine while traveling with such a young baby. Again, this hotel is probably great for couples without children or needing wheelchair / stroller access but proved to be a bit difficult for us.

We are maybe 2 blocks from main pick up point for the trolley (LONG lines to get on, so we walked wherever we wanted to go) and all the great shopping, in the heart of Union Square. The lobby is quite small, but service was good at the front desk. There are computers in the lobby with internet access, but we didn't use them. We brought our netbook and used the free WiFi in our room, which was very handy. Our room on the 8th floor was nicer and larger than I thought it would be, though the bathroom and closet area seemed kind of dated but was clean and organized. The beds were really comfy. The only thing that I didn't like was the walk from the lobby in the front of the building to the elevator in the back to get to our room. You have to go up some stairs, pass the pool...It was labyrinthian! Not a big deal, but for someone with lots of luggage without a car, I could see how this could be a problem. We had a car, so we parked it in the parking lot as part of a hotel/parking package. It maybe have been a little more expensive to park here, but it was more convenient for us. We exited our room and took the nearest elevators down to exit the hotel through the garage in back. Some tips: Check out the japanese restaurant across the street in back of the hotel. Very good. Also, my friend took us to check out the Castro area, which was lots of fun! She also took us to a restaurant called Andalu, which serves tapas sized plates to share. Delicious and fun for a group of friends. Also in the back of the hotel, to your right as your walking out, there's a sports-themed restaurant where we had breakfast. Very inexpensive and interesting to check out for all those sports fans out there. Another great place to eat is North Beach, a fantastic, Italian restaurante in the North Beach area, which is, I believe their Little Italy. Very good eats there! We walked down...actually, up some steep hills...to get to Fisherman's warf, and that was a really nice, long walk if you want to burn off some calories and check out some of the neighborhoods.

It was incredibly easy to walk to places. After long days of shopping it was nice to have a short walk back to the hotel. Reasonable price -- it's difficult to find a clean and safe budget hotel in the Union Square area. I paid under $100/night which seemed justified. Note that I had modest expectations since San Francisco hotels all seem to have smaller rooms and bathrooms -- this holds true at the Handlery. Everything was clean and the staff non-intrusive. Friendly staff - at check-in they were pleasant and quick. Every morning as we left and every evening when we returned we were politely greeted by the staff. CONS: Exorbitant charges to use their business center and wifi -- in this day and age it should be free. A/C is not the strongest, but I believe this is true of most San Francisco hotels that try to take advantage of the naturally cooler weather. Extra charges on my credit card: When I returned home I discovered that they overcharged me for another visitor's room service, even though these charges were not listed on the bill given to me when I checked out. It took two phone calls to their accounting office to remedy this. The staff was polite but it took two weeks for them to figure out what the extra charges were and to credit my account. Be cautious and carefully track the amounts charged to your account. OVERALL: The Handlery is a good budget option. Expect small but clean rooms and bathrooms. The staff is friendly and alert but be careful to examine your bill carefully at check-in, check-out and after your return home. If you're traveling on business or are tied to the internet, expect charges for wifi access or consider going elsewhere as so many other hotels offer it for free. NOTE REGARDING NOISE: At check-in we were given the option of having a street facing room or something quieter. We opted for being near the street in order to see more of the action. At night we could hear the street traffic, including the group of street musicians playing drums, but we enjoyed this and typically did not sleep until midnight.

Front desk was correct about noise so be sure to request a room facing the interior pool area. We stayed in the newer section in a premier Queen room with two Queens and a rollaway provided at no extra charge...absolutely most comfortable bedding in a hotel INCLUDING the rollaway which was hard to believe. Room and bathroom were nice size and very clean (be sure to request a room with a lavatory in a separate section of the bathroom...our first room had it combined.) Balcony was also a nice addition with two chairs. Concierge (John, I believe) was extremely helpful and always followed up with us about his dining suggestions to make sure that we were happy. Other staff was always attentive and helpful. Location is fabulous for public transportation, shopping and restaurants. My husband would go to Cafe Bellini (I think that's the name) right around the corner and bring us crepes each morning in bed...what a treat! There was also wonderful Italian, Japanese, Indian, American, Mexican, Chinese, Pizza by the Slice, diners within one to three blocks...just incredible. We had no need for reservations which was great especially being tired from touring and sightseeing all day with teenagers! I spent weeks on tripadvisor researching hotels and restaurants. I finally decided on this hotel because of the two queen beds (many hotels only have doubles), location, reviews and heated swimming pool.

It's also close to the trains and tourist information and plenty of shops , both high street and designer. The hotel has a restauraunt and offers room service but we didn't eat there as there were so many great places to eat and takeaways nearby. We had a twin room which was quite small but adequate for our needs as we spent most of the time out and about.

During our stay we did two excursions booked through Viator. The first was a half day trip to Muir Woods to see the Giant Redwoods and a visit to Sausalito. We chose the afternoon departure so we could have a lie in and it was a great trip out . Muir Woods was so tranquil but quite cool at times so take a jacket. Sausalito was beautiful and the market there was fab - biggest and best strawberies I've ever tasted. We also got some great pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge on our way out. We also did the day trip to Yosemite National Park which was a very long day with an early start but well worth it. Stunning scenery at Yosemite but dissapointingly we were unable to see the Giant Sequioas as late snow prevented the coach acessing the area. The quides on both trips were really friendly and informative and certainly earned their tip. All excursions included pick up and drop of at our hotel and were puntual.

We arrived late in the evening (at 10:00 p.m.) and didn't want to waste any time. After getting settled in our room, we wanted to get to know what was around the area. The doorman that evening was very helpful and friendly. Very informative. We received excellent service during the few days we stayed at the hotel from both the doormen and the concierge. The cable cars are located just around the corner and is an excellent way to get around the city. And if you want to travel by taxi, they are usually parked right outside. And if there isn't a taxi parked outside, the doorman will stand out on the street and blow his whistle. In seconds, a taxi is there for you. There are numerous shops surrounding the hotel that display art. And the hotel is a block away from Union Square where if you love to shop, you'll be in heaven. We also found a 24-hour diner (Lori's Diner) just around the corner. It's a diner that takes you back to the 50's. Once you leave the lobby area (of the hotel) and head upstairs to your room, the interior decor of the hotel is kind of vintage, like you were back in the 1930's or 40's. Loved it!!!!

Our room and bathroom were so small you could hardly swing a cat! The air conditioner/air exchanger was not working properly so along with a mouldy smell it was very hot and we could not open the window as no screen and sirens were going all night long. Upon arrival the clerk was sure to let us know that we had the \"internet rate\" and for an additional $30 per night we could upgrade - not very good business practice in my opinion. Very deceiving on the part of this hotel and Kayak as our room looked nothing like the photo and it was non-refundable so we had no option but to stay here for 3 nights. Even the bellman admitted the room was small and gave us this lame excuse that \"people were smaller back in the old days\". We are not LARGE people, this room would have been too small for 2 of Snow White's dwarfs!

The hotel certainly did not appear to be at full capacity so why stick people in the worst hotel room you have?

We stayed here at the Handlery after recommendations from a friend and also the reviews here on trip adviser and we think you couldn't pick a better spot for your stay in San Francisco. This was a surprise trip for my other half for his 40th birthday and we were made to feel as special as this occasion warranted, including being greeted on arrival by the General Manager Jon Handlery himself! (we wish we could have seen him at the end of our stay too to say a big thank you) From the moment we walked through the door we knew we had chosen well, all the staff from the porters to the concierge were so friendly and helpful, this excellent service continued thoughout our stay and made it such a great experience. In particular the concierge Dale with his endless patience at my questions even before the trip when we were still in the UK! He seemed to know the answer to everything and have a timetable for everything too! The doorman Hermie was also a delight, a wonderful person to greet you in the morning before you head out and welcome you back in the evening with a smile. The room was wonderful, well appointed with coffee maker, hairdryer, fridge etc we wanted for nothing. The hotel has just been completely refurbished, we stayed in the historic quarter and it couldn't have been better for us, just charming with excellent views over the streets we had come to visit. We felt right at home! The pool is always warm by the way so pack your trunks you'll need them! We enjoyed a swim on several occasions and it's the perfect way to start or end a day. We found the hotel to be very clean in both the room and public areas, couldn't fault them there either! The toiletries are ethical and they are good too - you can trust the shampoo ladies! You won't struggle to find excellent eateries or things to do in the area either, we can recommend extranomical advertures for a wine tasting tour to Sonoma and we also went to Yosemite with them. The concierge would be happy to arrange any trips with these or other providers when you arrive so don't feel you need to book everything in advance (although we would urge you to book your Alcatraz trip as far in advance as you can online - we've seen the queues!) The Handlery is clearly a popular hotel as it's on every tour companies pick up list, meaning you will be picked up and dropped off right at your hotel door. Breakfast wise you are so spoilt for choice, personally we favoured Cafe Mason just round the corner for blintzies (sweet soft cheese filled pancakes with fruit), Max's over the road for pancakes and Pinecrest for 24hr service with a smile! Try as many diners as you can though we had a different breakfast every day. For dinner, if you have a few pennies spare splash out at Farrallon on Post St (you'll need to book at least on the weekend) it's a unique dining experience with food to match the decor! On most nights we stayed mainly in the French quarter on Claude Lane for quality food at reasonable prices with masses of atmosphere. The Handlery Hotel is located literally a few minutes walk from the Powell St Cable car turnaround so you can get to the wharf quickly and scenically or just about anywhere really if you fancy dinner in another area of the city. Cable cars stop after midnight so you have plenty of chance to get home and the wharf is only about 45 mins to walk anyway (though easier when it's cooler - all those lovely hills!) Buses and trams also all seem to run from this area so it's the perfect base for everything you will need to get to. Take the BART from the airport it's only 30 mins and they run every 15. For $8.10 each way you can't go wrong and you just have a couple of minutes walk from Powell St BART station to the hotel itself, time to soak up the vibe! The ticket machine at the airport shows you simply how to buy a ticket so you don't even have that to worry about. Hire a bike from Blazing Saddles on Mason Street, the guy there, Jeff is much more helpful than the outlet they have at the wharf and he'll take the time to show you the flatest routes too! We were very glad not to have chosen a hotel on Fisherman's Wharf, the area in parts is charming in the day, for example the Blue Mermaid for clam chowder in the sun at the Cannery is lovely, however we personally found Pier 39 a bit too much (all amusements and tourist shops) and preferred the city bustle of Union Square rather than the tourist traffic of the Wharf and Embarcadero area. Union Square and the surrounding streets are fascinating and the buskers and different shops make for a real buzz that you'll miss when you leave! Well we are missing it anyway! We had a peek at some of the other hotels in the square when we went out for drinks, they seemed to be all lobby and no substance behind to us but then we were spoilt with the Handlery! The Starlight bar at the Westin even charges it's own visitors $5 to go to their own bar for a drink - we thought that was outrageous! So in short, you won't regret a stay at the Handlery on Union Square, we'll certainly be returning as soon as we can, we got engaged in Golden Gate park on our last day there so I think a few anniversary visits are also in order! We've recommended the hotel to all our friends and you can't get a better commendation than that.

I also think that their restaurant, The Daily Grill, is some of the best American dinning in the city. Both the hotel and the restaurant is very competitively priced and makes visiting San Francisco very affordable for anyone. When staying or eating at the Handlery you really get five star service and luxurious amenities at competitively low prices. The only problem I see with the Handlery, is that they have valet check in behind the hotel. It would be confusing for first time guests to find their way to check-in. If this can't be changed then an elevator would be great to get down the stairs with your luggage. The only thing available is a wheelchair elevator.

The public transport routes are also right on the doorstep so it means you have quick and easy access to the whole city (a daily pass is $9 or a single bus ticket is $2, though this allows travel for a further 90 mins if you want to swap buses). I would recommend the hop on/hop off super bus tour (blue bus) as a way to get to grips with the layout and size of the city once you arrive, plus you can learn some amazing facts from the eager tour guides...great for pub quizzes!! The Daily Grill restaurant isattached to the Handlery and has an excellent menu, though I never managed to get beyond the amazing pork chop in blackberry sauce - wow! The main road nearby, Powell, has too many eating places to list, though Cafe Bellini deserves a special mention for its great breakfasts and dinners, which are very reasonably priced. The ferries are very straightforward to get to by bus and offer a cheap way to get close to Alcatraz if you don't want a full tour and then gives you a stop in Sausolito, which is an idyllic coastal 'village'. We took the evening Alcatraz tour (4.30pm) which menat that we arrived in the light but managed to see the sunset over the Golden Gate Bridge before we left the island after dark. This tour has only one boat load, rather than the regular 3 or 4 during the day, so you really get a feel of the place and can find yourself being the only one in the main cell building - quite a chilling experience! A ride west (to 33rd) on the 38 bus, from outside the Handlery, takes you to the golf course at Lincoln Park which is the home to the Legion of Honour Museum, a small and welcoming art museum.

We found the staff in the hotel to be very helpful - especially the concierge (great directions and liked his recommendation of the Hunan Home restaurant in China Town) and one of the maids.

Word of Advice: Avoid the convenience store near the hotel at the corner of Geary and Mason (395 Geary St.) called the \"International House of Wines\". We were charged $5.00 U.S. for a large bottle of water that cost $1.99 or less at the nearby Walgreen stores (two locations near the hotel: 1) Geary St near Taylor and 2)Stockton near O'Farrell). The price for pop was also very inflated. There were no prices on the items and I think they charge foreigners more because they think they may not be familiar with the cost of items in the US. On the postive side we rented bikes from a nearby Blazing Saddles outlet (on Mason just up the hill from Geary St) and had a great day biking over the Golden Gate Bridge into Salsalito. The bikes were comfortable and of good quality and the routes were well laid-out and easy to follow. It was well worth the money.

I think we've all crossed the threshold into free wifi... come on, if Days Inn can do it, so can you Handlery. The Union Square area is more of a New York vibe - the good and the bad sides. But there are some great restaurants and bars in the area and tons of shopping if you're into the major chain stores and malls. Many live theatres in the area, too. The Glide Methodist Church down the street is a standard tourist stop and has an amazing choir.

This was completed efficiently by a nice receptionist and we were allocated a room on the 5th floor. The room was at the front of the hotel overlooking the main road. It was clean, comfortable, well furnished, free safety deposit box in your room and with a fantastically comfortable large bed. After a short walk around outside and due to our travelling we were a bit tired that first evening, so we decided to go to bed a little early. Now being a Saturday night it was quite lively outside and with being at the front of the hotel it was quite noisy. With single glazed sash windows this didn't help but they are in keeping with character of the building. However, after that first night we settled in better and got used to the sounds and noises to be expected in the middle of a busy city. Which brings me on to my next comment... It's location. We found this to be perfect for exploring all you have to see in San Fran. The busy shops are very close at hand and include all major names.

Breakfast was mainly taken at Loui's 50s style diner around the corner which was always good. Another tip is to get a pass for the hop on hop off double decker bus. Ours was for 48hrs which enables you to see all the major sites and is regular and easy. [ Pick up outside Macey's, 2 mins away ] All in all the Handlery proved to be a great choice........

I stayed here June 26 for 4 nights to attend a conference in the city. I reserved a Club room 4 months in advance through the hotels website. I selected a Club room based on other reviews that said the Club rooms are nicer and in the newer building. When I arrived I was told the hotel was full and they gave me a room in the old building. I had a copy of my online reservation that showed I booked, and paid more for, a Club room. The man at the desk went into a room and then came back and said they could give me a Club room facing the pool. I had room 381, which seemed to be in a section of the hotel that was in between the old and the new. It was two stories tall and surrounded two sides of the pool. It had the look of an old motor court motel with outside hallways to get to your room. I could see across the pool to the new 8 story Club section, which is where I thought I would get a room. Once I opened the door to room 381, I saw a HUGE dark stain on the carpet. There were also multiple stains on the small couch. I could tell the hotel was calling this a \"club\" room since it had bathrobes and the electric shoe polisher. I noticed the shoe polisher was unplugged due to the lower half of the electircal outlet was cracked off and missing. There was just a hole, which seemed dangerous. There was also a crack in the light switch in the bathroom. The surfaces of furniture looked clean, but any ledges on the sides were full of dust. Also, the door frame in the bathroom had a filthy layer of some nasty gunk stuck to the frame. There was a small stool that pulled out in front of the mirror to sit on when you dress. It was also stained. I booked this room for $188 a night. There are so many other small hotels in the area, I'm sure you could find a cleaner one. The main positive to the hotel is its location on Union Square-- cable cars stop right on the corner and you can walk to Chinatown. Also, there is a heated pool, which is hard to find in San Francisco. However it was cold outside and we asked if they could turn on the patio heaters scattered around the pool deck, but we were told they were broken. The linens on the bed were also in good condition. Maybe I just got a clunker of a room. I have seen the general manager respond to posts here.

At check-in we were given a deluxe room in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153newer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of the hotel. It was a long room with small balcony overlooking the pool. The furniture was tattered and gross. I called down to ask for a for a room change. The helpful front desk changed our room to a suite in the main building. I asked if that meant that the suite was in worse shape, since it was in the older original part of the hotel. She said that it was a better room. Since it was overlooking Union Square. And those rooms do not get as much use. I should have suspected something at that point. But the suite was really charming. Big living room for the kids to run around with lots of light beaming in through the windows. Off to explore the city we went. That evening we came back to find that music from Union Square was louder in our room than it was outside on our way back to the hotel. The kids could not get sleep from how loud the noise was bouncing off the building across the street in into our suite. I called down and the same person that had help us earlier apologized and said that the band playing was doing so illegally and they are supposed to stop by 10 pm! We had the option to call the SFPD to complain. They had no control over the noise. Though she could switch us to a quieter room. Luckily we had not unpacked.

We were determined to have a good time and not spend our time switching rooms. Instead, we should have switched hotels. The problems with this hotel are far beyond the control of the staff. The problem is with those in charge who are not closing it down to make much-needed upgrades.

This exacerbated the damp bathroom problem\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no exhaust fan, so the room stays pretty humid, which is probably why there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mildew in the grout of the shower. Our room number was 660, in the club section of the hotel. This room is immediately adjacent to the elevators, and, while they were not so noisy that they kept us awake, we could hear them quite clearly, so people who are sensitive to noises should probably ask for a different room. The other thing about this room is that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a little balcony, like the rest of the corridor\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe sliding glass doors open, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a metal railing to keep you from jumping or falling, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nowhere to go but down. It was pouring most of our trip, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss having a balcony, but in the summer I think I would have. The base of the sliding doors\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe metal frame\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas quite rusted, and that further undermined my faith in the stability of the metal railing\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI was afraid it would give way if my son leaned on it. We wanted to stay in and watch a movie one night, but the television couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t download the movie from the mother ship, or something, so we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to. The staff couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix it that night, but they did take the $12.99 off our bill (actually, they said they would, but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u201dif we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t caught it, we would have been billed, but they were cheerful about removing it when we pointed it out). One last thing--don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the words \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heated pool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fool you into thinking you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to swim in February, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u201dheating keeps the temperature barely tepid, but since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outdoors, only a masochist would jump in. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sauna, but since our key cards never worked on the door, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a chance to see it.

First of all there was construction going on in the hotel, and as we upgraded to the newer section before they had a lift installed, we ended up having to drag our forty pound bags up a flight of stairs when we arrived. We weren't offered a bellman that day. I'm sure that the lift is now operational so that would no longer be a problem, but it was a bit annoying. Also, the room that we were in faced a VERY sketchy building that made us uncomfortable. It almost seemed like a flop house of some kind. Secondly, our first night there we asked the concierge to call a taxi for us and he refused saying that the taxi wouldn't come. We were then told to walk to the taxi stand at the Westin and to catch one there. It's not that the Westin is far (only 1/2 a block), but I've never had a hotel refuse to call me a cab before, not even 1 - 2 star motels. But what really caused some consternation was that our bathroom wasn't cleaned the entire five days we were there. With the price that we paid, and the level of hotel that it claimed to be, that shocked us. We waited to see how many days they would go without cleaning it rather than saying anything and were surprised that it didn't happen once while we were there. The towels were gathered, but that was it. I certainly hope it was cleaned before the next guests checked in. That being said, I would probably stay there again.

Ok, so now you've parked your car, English as Second Language guy tells you to \"go through there\" and so you sorta fumble your way along, ( porter did ask if he could help, but after $86 parking you're in fear what a porter will expect as a tip) So you bang your suitcase along until you reach a wooden temporary staircase wide enough for one at a time. You now have to carry your bags down a flight of stairs. Then take an elevator back up to street level. Now I wouldn't have known this except for another guest seeing my troubles and escorting us to the lobby. So we shuffle our way down the hall, and hang out for the front desk, all is well here.

This hotel did not live up to my expectations based on all the positive reviews I read on the internet. We chose an older hotel for the historic value and ambiance knowing it would probably not have up to date technology or ammenities but this was really disappointing. The 6th floor room (hotel has 7 floors) was incredibly hot and stuffy for 3 of the 4 days we were there. As luck would have it San Fran was in the middle of a heat wave and the sorry excuse for an air conditioner was inadequate. Fortunately we could open the windows for air - but the view was a lovely blank wall of the building next door that I could probably touch if I could overcome my fear of heights and lean out the window - which I did not. Do NOT attempt to use the TV/Internet. Go to the 2nd floor business office and use the computers there. The room was tiny for 4 adult sized people and 2 double beds. The furnishings were pitiful - not enough storage space or chairs. The closet was equally tiny. The bathroom had only a shower stall that \"spit\" water at you, only one shelf for personal items. One of the two bed lamps was not functional. Housekeeping kept leaving glasses, mugs and coffee for 2 despite the fact that there were 4 of us staying there. Room was dingy and uninviting. On the bright side, we LOVED the staff...especially the concierge's Dale and John. They were awesome! Good location if you want to be in the heart of the city, close to mass transit and shopping. The rooms in the newer \"club\" section near the pool seem to be a better deal for the extra money. Overall I hated the room but loved the staff and location.

Based on other folk's comments, I booked a room on the club floor through Orbitz at $200 a night. Upon arrival I needed to be escorted through the basement work area to get to the other side of the hotel because of construction that is ongoing. There are elevators on either side of the building and my room required that I enter on the O'farrell street side of the building. I heard no construction noise at all during my stay but it was a real hassle if I needed to get to the lobby. You need to take an elevator to the basment and walk through the kitchen area and then take another elevator back up to the lobby. Only one of the two elevators was working. The location is great, right near Union Squire but it is an older hotel with a very small lobby with really no place to sit to wait for someone who might be meeting you. When I arrived during the middle of the day there were plenty of bell people who wanted to wheel my luggage a few feet for me but when I made my way to the lobby on Friday night to ask a question about an airport shuttle, there were only the two ladies at the desk and I needed to wait about 20 minutes to ask my question, I guess everyone else was escorting guests to the other side of the hotel. The club room was nicely furnished and comfortable but with a very old 14 inch TV but the terry robes and bathroom magnifying mirrors were a nice touch as were the above average soaps and shampoo. I had dinner one night at the Daily Grill restaurant that is attached to the hotel. The food was fantastic and the wine list was superb, plus it has a very nice atmosphere. I would recommend the restaurant even if you are staying at another hotel. Prix fix dinner of soup, main fish course and desert at $24.95 was a great deal for this part of town. I had breakfast one morning at a little cafe just a few doors away on O'farrell street, I believe it was called Sunshine cafe.

We were in town for Wonder-Con as well as a vacation. We arrived at the hotel at 2:55pm, check in was at 3pm. Our room was not ready but the hotel staff checked our luggage while we went to eat at a local restaurant across the street, Max's. I had one of the best corn beef & pastrami sandwiches by the way! We went back to the hotel around 3:45 and our room was ready and the bellman brought our luggage up about 5 minutes later. It was worth the wait though! We got an amazing view of the city from our 8th floor room in the club wing. If you have a choice, definitely stay in a club room, they are nicer, roomier and have better views. We only paid $189.99 per night for 2 queen beds. We did have a fridge, 19 inch TV (but who goes to San Fran to watch TV anyway?), a nice bathroom, large closet, desk and a super nice vanity area for me to do my makeup (came with a 3 way lighted mirror as well). The toiletries provided were of moderate value including shampoo, conditioner, lotion, a shower cap and 2 soaps (per day). Towels were ample in the bathroom as well, we were provided 4 large towels, 4 hand towels and 2 face towels. The most surprising part was the bed and that it was actually comfortable. I very rarely have slept in a hotel bed that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have springs popping up, lumpy parts and sunken middle areas. I slept fairly well, even with the street noise, which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as I thought it would be. Our window looking down onto the street had a sliding door, which made the room more comfortable with fresh air. The hotel is located on the edge of Union Square and in walking distance to the trolley stop at Union Square, which is about 2 blocks away. The Moscone Convention Center is about 4-5 blocks away and very easy to get to. Take the trolley to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf, Chinatown and Pier 39. I am definitely staying at the Handlery the next time we come to SF. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat a 2 Queen room for under 200.00 in the city. Even the Motel 6 in the Tenderloin district was 125.00 a night. The concierge was very helpful as was the hotel staff. We always had a taxi waiting and they even provided us a shipping box to ship all of our souvenir\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try the restaurant at the hotel but I can recommend an amazing breakfast/brunch place. Dottie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s True Blue caf\u00c3\u00a9 is about 4 blocks away on Jones, in between Geary & O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Farrell. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tiny caf\u00c3\u00a9 with room for about 20 people, including the counter. We went around 10am on a Monday morning and waited for about 30 minutes to get a table, but it was completely worth it! I had the chorizo, cheddar & egg scramble with fresh salsa and tortilla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and their famous ginger-cinnamon pancakes (which they are known for). I was not unhappy with 1 bite of food. We went again on Friday morning around 8am and we only had to wait for 5 minutes for a table. So definitely check this place out because I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to go back!

When i got there Supershuttle dropped me at the back of the hotel so i had to walk through the parking garage and next thing i know i'm walking through a hotel corridor with rooms, Strange i think but continue on to pool area. Once at pool area i see a bellhop who tells me to leave Suitcase by stairs as they have no lift from there to Lobby. I go to lobby and check in, She tells me i have a Club room and as i'd booked a Historic Section room i think \"Great i've been upgraded!\" So i go to find room, 10 minutes of wandering corridors i still can't find room and housekeeping is giving me funny looks, So i go back to reception and they and bellman tell me room is around there, Long story short and another 20 mins later they finally tell me \"Oh you should be going up elevator next to lobby!\" Which by the way they had previously told me not to do! Get to Room 358 and it is filthy!!!!! Even the cupboards look dirty and there is no bathroom door!!!!! It looks like they've pulled it out! I go to close blinds and blinds rip and fall into my hands!!!!! As i'm jetlagged and considering how incompetant they took to issue my first room i figure whats the point asking for room change and settle in. besides the bed looks clean I go down to see Concierge and he lazily hands me phone for Alcatraz tour i want to book and acts like my asking him to do some work is a huge imposition! Next few days consist of this; - I find Pin on floor in my room, Notify housekeeping and get no apology and they seem very nonchalant about the whole thing despite the fact it could be a legal liability! - Everytime i see Concierge he's rude and abrupt despite my acting friendly towards him - Pool area is clean but has a cheap motel look to it (Super 8 perhaps?) - As i checkout i'm issued with statement of another gentleman from the UK! As i'm in hurry running late for my flight to hawaii i don't discover this until i'm halfway across the pacific. When i ring hotel from hawaii to let them know this i speak to Front Desk manager and he starts yelling at me (Even though i was calm and friendly to him) telling me to destroy the statement, Interestingly enough he never did ask whose statement it was and when i tell him i only used internet he says something about a movie charge! i was in shock at how rude he was! Still waiting on my visa bill to make sure they haven't incorrectly billed me and a little bit concerned on how secure guests personal details are with them. The Handlery's claim to \"Treat Guests like family\" well i'd sure hate to be an enemy if this is how they treat family!

The Room was really comfortable and we were up high so we had a great view. The guy at the check-in desk was so accomodating too.

I called the front desk and although the hotel was very busy, the guy managed to sort something out and got us a smoking room.

It has an outdoor pool on a veranda - courtyard type thing in the middle - looks really cool, but we were there in October so didn't use it!! Apparently is is heated all year round though! The only negative I would have is just my own personal preference. I'm not a big fan of the Union square area. It's just not as nice as other parts of the city. I much prefer Chinatown/North Beach and the Wharf (although the Wharf is sooooooooo touristy, so probably not the best place to stay unless you're into that sort of thing). Also, you have to be careful around the Union Square area. Where this hotel is is perfectly safe, but once you go a few blocks from union sq you're into dodgey areas. There are alot of homeless in this area too - which is not a major problem and I hate to be uncompassionate, but when you're in a bar in the area and EVERY time you go out for a cigarette you get approached by pan handlers, it does get a bit tiresome!

Our room was street facing which subsequently meant that we got absolutly no sleep for the week that we were there. Unless you enjoy the constant horn pressing, the bizarre bin emptying at 3am and the odd screaming match between taxi drivers, who have cut each other up. You, too will end up sleep deprived.

It was charming and old-fashioned with lots of atmosphere. The price was fantastic for the location. Handlery is located 1/2 a block from Union Square in a touristy but charming neighborhood. Walking into the bustling lobby was like hopping into a time machine. Check in was easy, I have no complaints about the service. I ended up extending my stay and my key card was accidentally turned off but the front desk fixed the problem promptly. I did notice that sometimes there would only be 1 or 2 harried staff at the front desk during off-peak hours which meant waiting for a couple minutes while they juggled phone calls. My one complaint was that although they offer room service for breakfast, the menu wasn't easy to find and the housekeeper kept forgetting to leave it in my room. As for my room, it was smaller than a typical chain, but larger than most similarly priced European hotels (that Handlery claims to emulate). Unlike many large chains where two queen sized beds are the norm, it seemed like at Handlery you get what you pay for. I asked for a room for one person, and it was plenty roomy for me but I wouldn't have wanted to fit more than two people in there. The bed was a smallish double with very nice linens. The closet strangely, was enormous-larger than the bathroom (which was comfy for one but on the small side for two). There was a small desk and chair in the corner but I just worked on the bed. I can understand the complaints from couples and families. If extra space is important you might want to check when you make a reservations and see if there are larger rooms.

As other reviews say, the location is good for the downtown shopping, getting to galleries and other spots (some may find the location too 'urban', with lots of homeless milling around, but we're from London so we're used to it!). However, we found the hotel to be only dissapointment amongst anumber of good hotels (at varying price levels) that we stayed in on our trip. Really it comes down to variable service and the hotel being in need of modernisation face lift. When we first checked in, we had polite but hardly friendly service. The initial room they showed us was dark (with only small window onto a dark courtyard) and next to the escalators so we asked to have another room. The next room, which we ended up taking, was small, with not much space beyond the bed, had a low ceiling and faced out onto the street. But it was clean so we took it. However, when we went down later to get the door key changed to the new room we found the man on the front desk very rude and treated us very suspiciously before changing things over. Checking out was hardly better. We decided to leave a night early (despite having paid in advanced for all nights of our stay via expedia) and to head up to Marin County to stay a night with friends up there (which seemed a much better proposition). Again cool service on the front desk and they tried to charge us an extra day for the extortionate $42 for parking. Finally they then lost our bags for 20 minutes when got to the garage to pick up the car. Anyway, as other reviews alude, the Handlery has some period character, and that may be true, but its desperately in need of modernising inside the rooms and in the public areas. We also found the corridors on our floor to be very dark and dare I say a bit smelly. However, on the upside, the price was good, hence why the rating isn't the pits.

The smaller room held a double (or queen?) bed while the adjoining room for the kids was huge with two twin beds and a fold out double sofa bed. With the sofa away, we had a large lounge area with coffee table - perfect for lolling around in after a day on the streets of San Franciso. This kids also enjoyed the pool - which was outdoors but heated. Nearby there are plenty of family friendly options for food, including a Walgreens around the corner where we were able to buy breakfast supplies (there was a fridge in the kids room).

We easily wheeled 7 suitcases between us (yes 7) to the station as it is all downhill and caught a fast and clean BART train to the airport terminal for a fraction of the cost of an airport bus.

Just really really disappointing\u201d", "Author": "jessieleigh", "ReviewID": "UR5981559", "Content": "As I said, where to start? My husband and I spent a month travelling around California in September and early October. San Francisco was one of our early stops. Supposedly it was to be the highlight at the end of a relaxing 10 day trip up the PCH before we headed off to Lake Tahoe and then Yosemite and Death Valley. Figuring we'd be exhausted after moving on every 2 days we booked the Handlery for 4 days. I've visited San Francisco twice before - but the most recent time was 7 yrs ago. And BOY has the city changed! When booking a hotel I avoided Fishermans Wharf area because it was a real dive the last time I was in the city. Instead, I remembered how central and relatively nice Union Sq was. I read trip advisor reviews and the Handlery seemed to be a good option at the time - plus I managed to get a park and pay deal, which when parking is around $40 a day is a big saving across 4 days. Clearly 7 years is a very very long time. I found the city reversed! Sure Fishermans Wharf is now a not very authentic tourist area but compared to Unions Sq it seemed slightly more pleasant - and generally the hotels were a good deal cheaper. Unions Sq was wall to wall beggars - literally one every 10 feet on the sidewalks and had an overriding stench of urine. I work in London, UK so I'm not exactly immune to city life but this has to be the worst case of vagrancy in any city I have ever visited - and the San Francisco I knew 7-10 yrs ago was nothing like this. Now, I have no idea if this is a real problem, although some guide books advised that the beggars ship themselves in from the suburbs and this is their job. I have no idea but the city needs to do something - both to clear up the city and to help those in need. Anyway, as for the Handlery. Well, the staff were mostly nice although not very helpful - except the guy who worked on the front door, i think he was called a \"loss prevention officer\"! He was really great - the only employee in the hotel with an ounce of initiative. He seemed to continually keep an eye out for people who were needing attention and then just help them even though it was clearly not his job. For example, one day the bellhops desk was completely unattended yet he came over, asked us the problem - which was just that we wanted to drop off some laundry (another rant by the way - $4.50 for a pair of underwear? I don't think so!) and off he went with our laundry and came back a minute later with the receipt. I really wish I remembered his name because somebody should give the guy a raise. The concierge on the other hand should be given a talking to - useless and rude. The first room we were given on the 7th floor was tiny, dark and right by the lift shaft - a bit like a cell. I immediately went to the front desk and to their credit they did find us another room on the 10th floor which was nicer - although still a disappointment. I don't know why but the rooms just don't live up to their pictures. It's really weird - we just got our photos back and my husband and I have been showing them to people and they're like what's wrong with it - it looks nice. I agree, it does in the pictures but in the flesh - No. The inch of dust on the skirting board didn't help. The bath towels are the size of what in the UK we call hand towels! Also, I'm sorry but someone needs to tell the hotel that they are based in a city - not having drapes or blackout blinds is insane. The only window covering was a wood slat venetian blind which hung away from the window so people across the way - or indeed the workmen working on the exterior of the building could see inside - not great when you want to get dressed. Plus at night the light streaming in is quite disturbing. Oddly, the noise other people have complained about didn't bother me at all - probably because on the 10th floor we were far removed from it. I definitely won't be going back to this hotel and I would actively recommend against it. Frankly, I'm not sure I'll be heading back to San Francisco any time soon either. Who knows, maybe in 7 yrs it'll be back to the charming city I got to know before.", "Date": "October 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barnsley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location.\u201d", "Author": "alfie92", "ReviewID": "UR5959814", "Content": "It was our 2nd stay at this hotel, again we were happy with our stay.

Recommended! (mostly)\u201d", "Author": "chacharu", "ReviewID": "UR5944503", "Content": "We had a wonderful week in San Francisco and really enjoyed the Handlery. I can't imagine a more perfect location and it's really a nice place. We had a club room and had hoped to get a balcony but they weren't available when we got there. However, our room did have a giant sliding glass door that we really enjoyed. We appreciated the coffee maker and little fridge, too--we bought fruit at the Ferry Building farmer's market and we kept it cooled. We didn't use the robes or the shoeshine machine but they were a nice touch. Also, they had a scale in the bathroom--guess it's to keep us honest with all the wonderful food in the city. As I said, there were just a couple things that keep me from giving the Handlery a 5. We had a few issues with the staff--all of whom were very friendly but generally, not that helpful. First, I had done a lot of research planning our trip and emailing different hotels to see about getting a smoking room. The Handlery was one of the few places that indicated that it was likely--no promises--but likely. As suggested, we emailed a day ahead reminding them of the request. When we arrived we asked again and the clerk said, nope, none available. It hadn't been promised but it sure didn't seem like they made any attempt either. We were there a little early and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have felt better if he had at least been willing to check to see if a smoking room might be cleaned and readied later\u00e2\u20ac\u201danything\u00e2\u20ac\u201dif he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just acted like he cared at all, but it was just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We might well have ended up choosing the Handlery anyway but a lot of the decision was made because they indicated we could probably get the smoking room and after being there I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing that they have very few available. *Note--on the positive side, smoking was allowed at the pool area, which was just a level down and very near our room so my brother didn't have to go out and huddle in the hotel doorway like so many other people we saw at many of the non-smoking properties. The other issue was with the internet connection. We didn't go to SF to surf the net or to work but we both had a couple loose ends to take care of for work. My brother travels for a living so has to connect from hotels wherever he is, so he knew that the problem was not just his computer or his settings like they implied. Long-story-short, they ran us around for several days before a bellman finally admitted that most people had to take their laptops elsewhere and advised us that there was free wi-fi at nearby Union Square. We never found out if it was a temporary problem or they just don't actually have internet available but if they had been honest from the start we could have made other arrangements. Once again, the staff was extremely pleasant but their lack of honestly caused both a lot of frustration and a few problems. *Tip: For the club rooms, the hotel garage entry on O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Farrell is actually much handier than the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front door. Just a doorway down from there is a little print shop called Cyber Copy where they have internet access available. The guy has a bunch of computers already set up and online so no bothering with special logins or passwords to get connected. He just scribbles your time on a scrap of paper and you bring it back when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re done and you can even get pages printed if you need. And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheap, too\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI think it was $8 an hour broken down every 15 mins. For people who just need to check their emails occasionally it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably a better deal than paying for internet in your room\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven if you can get it to work. A note about the noise: I'd seen complaints in this forum about noise at the Handlery and many other hotels night. I thought these must be sensitive folks from quiet towns or 'burbs not used to city sounds. After being there, I got it! It is NOISY at night. A couple evenings, after midnight someone started playing music on the street corner below. Another night a fight broke out and went on and on until the cops showed up with sirens blasting. Complaints about the garbage collections are legit too. I thought people posting that were just nit-picking, but this is one loud-mother operation! For us it usually started around 1AM and went on for about an hour while city workers pick up trash cans left out on the sidewalks--with the perpetual safety-beepers blaring, clanging-banging, and noisy mechanical lifts jamming it into the trucks, working their way block by block. We survived. I was able to tune it out reasonably easily after the first night. Maybe the trick was all the walking we did and climbing up & down those near-vertical streets so we were dead tired by bedtime. But I'd advise anyone who is sound sensitive to pick up a white-noise machine or even just run a loud fan to help tune down the decibels. We were on the 3rd floor but I think it was loud enough that even the higher floors might get their share of the noise. Once again, this isn't an issue with the Handlery any more than any of the other hotels in the area. It's the trade-off to be in a such a great location. Overall, despite the few issues with the staff, we really did enjoy staying at the Handlery and our entire trip. We would definitely stay there again. It would be a great choice for most people unless you are a smoker and you absolutely object to stepping out to smoke or you need to use your computer in the room. Bottom line was that it was very clean and so comfortable after being out exploring the city all day. Not luxury\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut it more than met our needs. One last suggestion: Skip the Daily Grill attached to the hotel and eat at the Irish bar next door--forgot the name now. It's not fancy at all but they've got very good comfort food, meat & potatoes, and more. They serve late and are very reasonably priced.

We arrived from out of town at ~1100 and could not get into our room until 1500. They did store our luggage for us, but it would have been nice to freshen up before hitting the streets.

I read thru all of these reviews and can recommend the following; Stay in the \"Club\" tower of this hotel. We paid 135 a nght (plus tax) and parked down the street in the public Union Square parking lot. (31 a night verses the hotel's 43) The club room was as good as any room I have stayed in including the Grand Hyatt, Pan Pacific, Francis Drake and much better than your typical boutique tourist hotels which have tiny rooms and a cramped feeling. I asked for a balcony room overloking the pool and got a high up seventh floor room with a view of the courtyard. I don't know if an outer room has any better view, but we wanted quiet and were pleased with this option. You won't see much other than the rooftops of other hotels and will get some noise if you are out on the balcony bur inside it is peaceful. I was handled by Shirley, who was totally professional, cheerful and supplied everything I asked for. When there was a delay with our luggage that we had to bring in, an assistant GM actualy hauled our stuff inside and got us in the room in less than five minutes. If you have a lot of luggage just let the bell staff handle it and tip them a few bucks. No worries. I would rate this hotel five stars but that is for a Ritz-Carlton or Bel-Air Hotel type of experience and this is not the same experience (or cost) However the club rooms are quite excellent, a cut above anything I've experienced in the same price range, a dynamite location and well worth the twenty or so more dollars than the older rooms which sound typical. Spend a few dollars more and relax, it's a great place. Did get the daily paper and robes in the new bathroom.

While the rate was fair enough for a weekend, we have stayed at other comparably priced hotels in the city with much better rooms, cheaper parking, and no \"issues.\" It cost us over $70 to park for two nights, while a (quite charming) hotel we had stayed at before about a block away overlooking Union Square had only charged $25 per night. (The only reason we did not go back to the other one is because it had no availability.) The room was fairly small, which is average for San Francisco. The pillows were reminiscent of bubble pack mailers covered with a pillow case -- rather thin. But the thing that annoyed me the most is that the \"designer\" comforter had a stain on the underneath when we pulled it back to go to sleep. With no way of knowing whether it had been laundered, and being late at night, we just removed the comforter altogether. The next day I specifically left a note on top of the stain asking housekeeping to take care of it. Yet, when we went to bed that night, there it was. They had ignored the request!

We have both been to SF many times, and wanted a moderately priced hotel in a good location. I think the Handlery was a perfect choice! Like all the other reviewers mentioned... Location is KEY. Right smack in the middle of union square. It was very convienent to everything; lots of shopping and restaraunts in walking distance. It's definitely a bustling area. When I first saw the candid reviewers photos on here it made me nervous. But our room was one of the newer club rooms. I took several pictures to show everyone that the new club rooms are much nicer and cleaner. Much more modern than some of the other pictures show. So when you book try to ask for a Club Room. Also our room was located thru a different area of the hotel where you had to walk thru a hallway and go up some stairs, then you walk pass the pool area and to an elevator which takes you up to your room. It is not as far as it sounds, but something to consider if you have alot of luggage. Use a bellhop :-) One weird thing about the room was there was no art on any of the walls? Very simple and classic. The room was average size, the bed faced the window/balcony which is a little unusual. But at night you can see the city lights so that was kind of nice too. They do provide a fridge in room which was great, we filled it with bottled water and sodas for the duration of our trip. The balcony was small (but plenty of room for 2 adults) but my husband would go get coffee and a newspaper ever morning and bring it back to the room, sit outside and enjoy! We used the Wi-Fi internet ($10 day). They had an automatic shoe polisher that my husband tried to use but they did not provide any shoe polish in the room. Maybe you have to call downstairs and ask for that? They have a vanity area which is nice for the ladies to get ready in the mornings or before going out. My only complaint would be when the heater/air came on the noise was LOUD. I am not sure if it's because its an older building?

The beds were very comfortable, the room was quiet, and the refrigerator came in handy for sodas and water. We had no complaints whatsoever.

The food was good and service was fast. We caught a cable car on Powell Street, which is less than 1 block away. And it was only a short walk to where we could purchase the cable car tickets. If you don't have much luggage, I would suggest taking the BART from the airport to Powell Street (cost for 1 way to Powell Street is $5.15) instead of a taxi ride which is $40 one way! You can get off the BART (about a 25 minute ride from the airport) at the Powell Street exit which is inside the mall. Walk out the front door of the mall and you are on Powell Street facing the site where you purchase tickets for the cable cars. From there it is only a few blocks walk to the hotel.

The evacuation proceeded smoothly although no staff were in evidence. After some milling about in the street next do we were allowed to move into the function room fo the Four seasons opposite. As it happened the fire was in the hotel next door but it was two hours before we were let back into our rooms. The hotel did put on free beakfast for every one which was a nice thought.

I had read the TripAdvisor reviews before booking through my travel agent, and we hummed and hawed about staying at one of the pricier hotels, (since my husband is all about the 5 stars), but I finally convinced him to try this one since I knew we knew we wouldn't be spending much time in the room, and the extra $$ would be better spent on nice dinner's and shopping. First of all, if you are going to stay there, pay the extra (which isn't that much) and stay in a Club Section Room. Ask for the quiet section overlooking the pool. Our room was 767, and quite frankly we were very comfortable in it. Don't book a room at the Handlery if you want a Luxury Hotel. It is not like that, so if you're going with comfort and functionality in mind, you will not be disappointed. The bed was comfortable and the in-room amenities were useful (bathrobes, fridge, and vanity area). Overall the staff were helpful, although one person in particular, Shirley, went above and beyond to provide great service to us. The location is amazing, and you are a stone's throw from the cable cars, restaurants, and amazing shopping. The Daily Grill has a great lunch menu and Lefty's was our favourite for breakfast, and if your nice to any one of the Handlery staff they will give you tickets for juice with breakfast. The dinner possibiliites are endless around that area, but try to make reservations earlier in the day, or the day before you want to go. If we were to visit San Francisco again, we would probably stay somewhere else, but only because we like to try different things, not because the Handlery wasn't a good hotel. P.S.

The very helpfull staff at reception moved us to a much larger room overlooking the pool area, which we found to be excellent (considering what we paid and the fact that the hotel is only a 3*). In terms of eating, there are some fantastic 'diner' type places all within 5mins walk of the hotel or you can wander into China Town or even through to Little Italy where you will find some excellent restaurants.

What let it down was the room- although it had all the facilities, we were in the historic bit facing Geary St and we found the decor a bit dreary and the noise annoying- expecially from street performers at night - it didn't really feel special given we were on honeymoon. Apparently the club rooms are better, so if you can afford this it may be a lot better/quieter. San Francisco is beautiful- especially by Fisherman's Wharf- if we went again we would stay in this area as it has a much more relaxed/holiday feel to it. We went on the Gray line trolley bus tour of the city for 28 dollars, and this was excellent- Presidio and Fort Point are lovely with good views of the Golden Gate bridge. Also had a tour of Muir woods and Sausalito, which was brilliant. Buy a 3 day trolley pass from the concierge. Foodwise- the Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macys is a must- it is always busy but they have a pager system meaning you only have to wait 10/15 mins for a table. Also had an excellent Chinese banquet for 12 dollars at Chef Hung's in Chinatown- go through the gate and it's about 1/2 mile in on a road to the left.

Cafes, Restaurants and Bars abound, and even Chinatown is just a few blocks away. Being in the middle of it of course means that you do hear the occasional police car wailing by at night, but that never really bothered us. We felt safe an comfortable there, cared for by helpful staff.

My wife and I arrived late evening and was greeted by a non too pleasant gentleman on reception. Said very little with no real welcome given. Allocated room No. 262 in the Club section. Bit of a walk to get to room but it was nice and spacious, clean and tidy. However, we got very little sleep as room directly on O'Farrell Street at rear of hotel. Busy throughout night and refuse collected, noisily, during the night. In the morning we requested a room change and aided by a helpful receptionist we were reallocated to a room overlooking the pool - noise level greatly reduced. We would recommend that you avoid rooms overlooking O'Farrell Street i.e. rooms ending 60, 62, 64, 66 and 68 on each floor. The quiet rooms overlook the Pool. Incidentally we were not the only people to request a room change - we heard of a few requests during our stay. We arranged a room with breakfast package but found on arrival that it was restricted in value - this was not pointed out on our confirmation. We found the Daily Grill very inconsistant on quality and service and after 3 days gave up and looked elsewhere. Didn't have far to look - found an excellent \"diner\" round the corner on Mason Street called Cafe Mason - food excellent and staff friendly and helpful. Max's across Geary Street also good. Location of hotel is ideal if you want to concentrate on shopping, but if its sightseeing you want, suggest you locate nearer Fishermans Wharf where all the tourist action is. Hotel close to cable car line and turnaround but large lines waiting to get on throughout the day. If you want to do Alcatraz, suggest you prebook on the internet as this trip is very popular and books up very quickly. We had to line up for tickets at 7.30am for any cancellations as next available tour was a week in advance. Fortunately we were successful and the trip was great. The city tour by sightseeing tours (gray line) was excellent. Lots of beggars around the Union Square area. Concierge and bell staff helpful.

Once we chose San Fran as our destination, planning the honeymoon was easy. But the hotel part was a bit of a challenge. I finally chose the Handlery based on: price, reviews from this site, and the cordial phone exchange I had when I called inquiring about rates. The other hotels (no names mentioned, but they were all in Union Square and were considerably more expensive) were curt and not particularly accommodating on the phone. But the woman I spoke with at the Handlery was straight-shooting, gave me her direct line if I had any questions, and offered a remarkable rate + a room upgrade since were honeymooners. For first-time visitors like my wife and I, the ride from the airport to the hotel was a bit of an eye opener. You go through some rather decrepit areas. But the block where the hotel is (on Geary) is beautiful. Once we found our room (complete with champagne--compliments of the hotel), we were delighted. It wasn't huge, but it was more than enough, plus it had a little balcony and a small changing room adjacent to the bathroom. The bed was large and comfy and the place was SPOTLESS. I was quite relieved, having only seen a handful of lo-res pictures on some website. The concierge was superb, and advised us (after seeing us hailing cabs the first few days) to use San Fran's excellent public transportation. Coming from Philadelphia, we were skeptical (SEPTA, for those who live in or near Philadelphia, is the most expensive public transport in the country). We found the San Fran system to be excellent and very cheap. The concierge also recommended some great (and affordable) restaurants in the area. Lefty O'Doul's was fun, cafeteria-style dining and it's literally right nextdoor to the hotel. We were able to see many sites (Golden Gate bridge, SBC Park, Chinatown, Haight-Ashbury) via a short bus ride from the hotel. The location was very convenient. Room service was prompt and the food was always delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful. By and large, our stay was near perfect. I have to mention the two things, just to be fair, that kept me from giving it the full five stars: 1. There was what I like to call \"the kiddie\" factor. I don't like screaming kids, sorry. In fact, I'm lukewarm on kids period. But this place, being a reasonably priced hotel in a neighborhood pretty much devoid of reasonably priced hotels, caters (from what I could see) to families. Literally every night (and early in the morning when these dreadful small creatures arise), we had some kids screaming or stomping in the hallway. This is not really the hotel's fault, but it bears mentioning for those who want a truly quiet getaway. 2. Don't let San Fran natives soft-sell you on the homeless person factor. MANY San Francisco residents scolded me for even being concerned. Well, let me tell you, these people hound you constantly and you can't walk 1/2 block without being asked for change. And some of them get downright belligerent. I realize this is a terribly insensitive thing to say, but it wasn't something we wanted to see on our honeymoon. If we wanted to see (and be able to help) homeless people, we would have gone on some kind of Christian retreat. It really put a damper on what was otherwise a stellar visit. As long as you realize going in that it is URBAN, it is the city, you'll be okay. I think the shock of it made it hard for my wife and I. This is not a criticism of the hotel, just a warning to those unfamiliar with the area.

Wolud certainly choose again as San Francisco great fun and Pier 39 and 41 fantastic fun and wodeful seafood.", "Date": "October 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGood time in San Fran\u201d", "Author": "Davynessie", "ReviewID": "UR2601430", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for four nights in September and found it to be well located. Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful although a couple of the staff at the check in desk came over as a little arrogant, standing at the desk and being ignored is not nice. The room as with the hotel was clean and comfortable. San Francisco is a great city and would visit again. Over all I would recommend the Handlery", "Date": "September 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location!\u201d", "Author": "bmam", "ReviewID": "UR2597168", "Content": "The Handlery is in the most perfect position to explore Union Square and beyond. It's right near the cable cars to take you to Fisherman's Wharf, we didn't need our car at all. $29 per night for parking is a bit steep though!! Also a perfect place to visit the many shops and restaurants around the city. The Concierge was very helpful giving us some great places to eat...Yum!! Lefty O'Douls (2 doors down) was a great spot for a cheap and fast breakfast. The Handlery was clean and spacious and our room was very quiet. Pool was heated and great for a relax after a day to Alcatraz!", "Date": "September 24, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2591984", "Content": "We stayed here in August for 1 night for the last leg of our honeymoon. We were upgraded on arrival to a club room by the pool, and received a bottle of champers and a basket of fruit, nibbles etc. The room was clean, airy, quite spacious, and being at the inner part of the hotel, we didn't hear traffic noise. We were recommended to go a door down to Lefty O'Douls for breakfast and so glad we did. They do fantastic omelettes and pancakes and it has a real feel about the place. We also went to a groovy little diner just off Union Square which was done out similar to a Greece set!! Very quirky!! The pool seemed a bit in need of work, but apart form that everything else was fine. A fabulous base to see San Francisco, right smack bang on the doorstep of Union Square, and a tram stop within footsteps.", "Date": "September 22, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Handlery Union Square Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d81019-Reviews-Handlery_Union_Square_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$168 - $334*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">351 Geary Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94102</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "81019", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/6e/d1/f0/handlery-union-square.jpg"}}

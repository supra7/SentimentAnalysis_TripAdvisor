The room size was fine for two adults (standard king). We liked the sleep number bed, but we don't exactly think they're all that wonderful. We never heard plane noise because we weren't facing the front of the hotel. The manager told us this, because we asked for a quiet room and they said then choose something that doesn't face the airport! So we picked the top floor (so we wouldn't have neighbors above us) that faced away. I never heard a single plane and I kept the window open all night long. Which brings me to my complaint. Perhaps it was the time of the year (Febuary) but they said the a/c won't cool to a temperature any lower than what it is outside. (Which really wasn't even true because I couldn't get it lower than 75-78 and outside it was 50). This is after they brought an engineer up to look at it and then had us move two doors down thinking our a/c was broken. So they told us that that was just the way the a/c worked but maybe it would be better by the next time we come back. I told them I had been uncomfortable sleeping for days and at check-out they refunded for about 2-3 nights worth of our stay. The manager was very friendly and tried to help as much as possible. So even though I think Radisson's climate control system is nuts, it isn't the manager's fault and they did do everything they could to try to correct it.", "Date": "Jul 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR264908660", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "westernroadwarrior"}, {"Content": "Nice place to stay My wife and I choose to stay here after a flight from the east coast.

The hotel, while very close to the airport, is not your typical Radisson. I had never before stayed in a Radisson but according to reviews from family members and friends who had, I was expecting a luxury hotel. It appears from the temporary-looking signage and the fact that there is another Radisson three blocks down the street, that Radissson recently acquired this hotel from another chain, perhaps Ramada. This hotel, or perhaps more accurately, motel was nowhere near the standards of luxury. I was disappointed and also glad that I had only booked a room for one night. I would not have been happy to have had an extended stay at the Radisson. It was subpar, at best. My main gripe were the beds, which were very motel-like and certainly not equivalent to what actual luxury hotels are currently offering like Sweet Sleeper's and the Heavenly beds.

After a shower, (which wasn't very clean), I tried to use my phone and it wouldn't work. I called the front desk to find that since I hadn't left a credit-card imprint, they wouldn't turn my phone on. I explained that I was only making a calling card call anyway, and was told to bring my credit card to the front desk or forget it. I explained I had just gotten out of the shower, it was almost 1:00am, and I'd gladly read my credit card number to him and let them run it in the morning. He basically said that it wasn't his problem, and if I really wanted to use my phone that badly, I'd bring my card up front! Then, out of desparation, I asked if he would call a number for me and just have them call me back, and he said NO! A while later I called someone else at the front desk and requested a wake up call. Well, luckily for me, I set the alarm, because they never called me. Not only that, but 2 out of 4 glasses in my room were disgustingly filthy. I took them to the front desk the next morning and the lady was appauled at their condition. When I told her of my entire experience, she was nice and offered to pay for my room.

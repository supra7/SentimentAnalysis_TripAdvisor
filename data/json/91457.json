I have been a Hampton loyal customer for years and will now start entertaining Holiday Inn Express for a better nights sleep. Was very disappointed when the girl at the front desk ignored me when I told her the bed was killing my back. It actually had slat board ripples in it. Hell Ive sleep on the ground deer hunting and didnt wake up this miserable. I refuse to stay here again as their just are to many other choices. I left early after being ignored and slept in the car at a highway restop. So much for their guarentees.

The hotel appears to be an older Hampton but was very clean and well maintained. Our room, with a king bed and sofa bed, was smaller than similar accommodations at other Hampton Inns. The desk and closet were built-in along the outside wall and the sofa bed was against the inside wall. This made a very tight arrangement. When someone was sitting at the desk it was not possible to move between the desk chair and the bed to get to the closet. Even when the chair was empty it was a tight squeeze. The furnishing were all in good condition as was the room. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean. There were a large number of channels on the TV and internet connection was easy to hook up and was fast. The breakfast selection was pretty standard but well prepared and tasty for this type of buffet. The buffet and eating areas were clean and neat. The fitness room had a couple of treadmills, an elliptical and stationery bike, please free weights. All very well maintained. The highpoint of the hotel was the staff. The person who checked us in, Tyler, was excellent. Took care of getting us checked in with no fuss. I needed to send a fax and he tried several times but it would not go through. Since he was able to receive and send other faxes that day with no problem the issue must have been some kind incompatibility between the sending and receiving machines. But he did his best to make it work even while dealing with other check-ins and guests with questions, etc. He is a real valuable asset to this hotel. The person who took care of the buffet (I didn't get her name) was also very friendly and helpful She kept the buffet stocked and clean. The desk person on the morning we checked out was also very friendly. All in all, the staff was great. The only complaint I have is that the bath tub in our room is set about 1-2\" above the floor, This is not problem when getting into the tub, but if you are not aware of it when stepping out it is easy to lose your balance, as I did. I was able to regain my balance without falling but I did bang my shin against the tub. I don't know if this is standard layout in all of the rooms but I think it is a real safety hazard. I agree with others who commented that the rate is a bit high. I think it is on the high end for what you get but this is in a metropolitan area. If we are in this area again, this Hampton would be considered but I would also look at other options that perhaps offer a bit more for the money spent.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfortable, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Jen K", "ReviewID": "UR119392393", "Content": "This hotel was recommended by management at nearby restaurant.

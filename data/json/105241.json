Even though located just off the interstate, inside the hotel it\u2019s quiet. - no worries about road noise. The complete renovation is underway and almost finished. By the time you get here it will be. Earlier posts complained most about being old and rundown - that's been corrected! During my stay, most of the other guests were business types and airline flight people. The shuttle to the airport and back seems to operate all the time. I was warmly greeted for my 130pm \u201cearly\u201d check-in at the front desk, with my reservation completely in order. Upgraded to a small suite, I found a room with plenty of lighting, a microwave, small fridge, coffee-maker and two new-model TVs. The sitting area also included a sofa-bed, desk with chair, coffee-table and an upholstered chair. The two TVs received all the channels including many I never heard, BUT, how annoying is it to watch old analog TV stretched to fit the screen. No one has that anymore. The free internet access worked fast and easy. There was a new super-comfy king bed made up with Marriott\u2019s soft sheets and six pillows. The usual Fairfield continental breakfast was as expected, and also fresh and nicely presented. There is a full-service Marriott right next door. Other than that, not much nearby but fast food. Otherwise the area around seems off-track, but around the Marriotts it's completely safe. As a recently retired premier road warrior, I recommend this Fairfield and would return to it when back in the area.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cNice renovation\u201d", "Author": "Whererwe2day", "ReviewID": "UR118085943", "Content": "The 4th floor has completed renovations and the rooms are very nice.

My 5-year-old takes his shoes & socks off the minute we hit the room and believe me if the carpet is a little dirty we will know within minutes (I have checked out of hotels because his feet were black with dirt). Overall this place is clean. The room did not come with microwave, or small refrigerator. Breakfast just OK 9would expect better from a F airfield)! Also has a pool OK. The front desk staff is friendly. If you need to stay in the Memphis, TN area this place is OK for a short stay, but you can do a lot better for the price. Price line gives it 21/2 stars, it's 2 star at best! The beds were very soft (mushy) would have preferred a little more support! Very noisy at 4:30 am it sounded like we were under a flight path.Although this is not considered the airport area. The area is run down and the parking lot is dark seemed OK but may prove scary for some. The hotels and some of the business's around this property had 6 foot fences surrounding their parking lots & facilities some of these were secured some were open and you could just drive in giving you one point of entrance.

The location is good with very easy access from route 240 and an easy 15-20 minute drive to downtown. Compared to other Fairfields and other hotels in the same price category, we were disappointed. The hotel wasn't kept up very well. Nothing really dirty, just in need of a remodel. The shower didn't drain properly, the mattress was poor, and the entire hotel had a bit of a dingy feel. The TV's color was mis-adjusted and there was no way to fix it, even with a request to the front desk, and not all towels were replaced when the room was made up. There were some positives. The free breakfast was better than average, and the free wireless Internet service worked very well. Also, with the exception of one person who checked us in, the help was always friendly. The person who checked us in was terrible. As he was checking us in he was ranting about how much he hates Memphis and can't wait until he can leave. This is our first visit to Memphis, so his \"welcome to Memphis\" ws odd at best. Hopefully he'll get his wish, and find work in a non-service industry. (Note: This didn't effect my overall rating since it was one bad egg, who most likely won't be there long.) Overall, although we like Fairfield's in general, we wouldn't recommend this hotel.

Lounge chairs were scheduled to be added within a few days. The new hotel manager was always around and seemed to be very involved in putting the property back on the right track. The exercise facilities were well-equiped, however the airconditioning was out in that room, making it uncomfortable in the summer heat. The best and most redeeming quality of our stay was the complimentary breakfast. We expected cereal, bagels, and muffins and were pleasantly surprised to find a much more extensive menu.

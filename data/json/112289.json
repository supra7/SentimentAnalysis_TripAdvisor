It was my first time alone, w/o my partner, and the room served it's purpose.Much to my surprise, all my cruising was done away from BECKS, and it was a great, satisfying trip. **All in all, I would stay again, and again at Becks....as I feel they are still concerned w/pleasing the community.", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR337087848", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Longbeachmjc"}, {"Content": "DECENT VALUE IN A GREAT LOCATION Considering what this place used to be years ago (a drug den)they have vastly improved. It is really nothing more than a cheap motel but it was clean and reasonably comfortable. As a lodging provider myself, I would notice anything that affects cleanliness and I could find no problems. The bathroom seemed immaculate and the linens did as well. The beds weren't the most comfortable but they were also not the least comfortable. They do provide a small refrigerator which was an unexpected convenience.We were there during weather that is very hot for San Francisco. Keep in mind that the daytime high during summer is usually in the low 80's but it was pushing 90 while we were there and the typical evening cool-down was non-existent. If I ran a motel in San Francisco, I wouldn't have installed air-conditioning so the fact that there was none at our motel wasn't a huge surprise to me. They did provide box fans which helped somewhat, along with keeping the door open. If you want A/C, you should go someplace more upscale.Keep in mind if you keep your door open, some other guests look at that as an invitation to stop and peek into your room, so don't be surprised. This IS the Castro, after all, and some habits die hard.The location is excellent, provided you wish to spend time in the Castro area. You are only a block and a half from the intersection of Market  Castro, and you can get onto the Muni Metro light rail which will take you into Downtown, Union Square or any place else you might wish to go.Would I stay there again? Probably. I normally prefer a slightly more upscale experience when travelling but I really can't complain about Becks at all.", "Date": "Sep 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR529212060", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BBLodger"}, {"Content": "What a let down!!       tiny tv", "Date": "Aug 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR803358584", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KittyLosAngeles"}, {"Content": "Be very careful before booking Use extreme caution before booking here.

Two of the three lamps were broken, and a towel bar was broken. There's a serious ventilation problem. The bedroom window can be opened only a couple inches. The bathroom is actually more pleasant since it has a small barred window which admits fresh air. Worst of all is a sleazy lockerroom ambiance (and I'm not talking upscale lockerroom here) which is caused by constant aggressive cruising. In fact, the word aggressive hardly covers it.

I have never posted a comment before about anywhere I have stayed but I feel I needed to take the time to let others know about how horrible the staff was. Those who are familiar with San Francisco would know Union Square this is where I always stay at the Parc Fifty Five. I am in SF at least 4 times a year. I booked the trip I am speaking of less than 24 hours before leaving. I was just going up for the gay bars this weekend. So I thought I would stay at Becks for the location and the Motel has always had many gay people there. It has probably been there fifty years and has been known that is where gay people stay. To give you my review of the motel I would say I was not expecting much it is just a Motel. But of course one expects to be treated kindly. Lulu should not be working as a Motel Manager she needs to learn alot about customer service. What happened was I checked out of my room today at 12:30 PM. I left my luggage at their check in and I went to lunch. My ride to the airport was at 3:45. So at 3:30 I came back to the Motel and told Lulu I wanted to say goodbye to a friend I had made there. I aksed could you please ring the gate open. By the way the gates were just installed less than 2 weeks ago. For decades you could just walk upstairs and knock on anyones door. Lulu refused to let me in. I only had 15 minutes until my ride and just wanted to say goodbye to my friend. I knew his room and I could point to it from her office. She said she cannot give out a room number. Mind you I also did not just come in off the streets, I was a guest there only two hours ago. Lulu then asked what is his name and I said Bobby. She said there is no Bobby here. She said what is his last name. Of course I did not even know I met him two days ago and went clothes shopping and to had a drink with him. I said do you just want me to call his name from downstairs, he would hear that because it is not a large place. Of course you said you could not do that and I would not have anyways, it would be silly. My point here is she had every opportunity to help me say goodbye to friend that I made. I said come with me, let someone else go with me. I said Lulu could call him etc etc..... She said she was too busy and could not do that. She said this conversation is over. I could not believe this. She works in the Hospitality Industry. I told her she was very rude and left it at that. A few minutes later she said we have a Robert here, I said in English Robert and Bobby are the same. She then said he checked out allready. She was lying to me he was not leaving and his curtains were shut in his room. When you check into your room the curtains are open.   I should have knocked on my friends door before I took my bags downstairs. But when the time was 11:45 the maid was banging on the door and calling on the phone to tell me it is my check out time. I called the front desk asked if I could have a little later checkout. It is Tuesday not busy there. She said you could have until 12:45 otherwise they would be charging a half day. The maid came back and said she goes home at 1. The entire staff in not truthful. My room was never cleaned until after 3 everyday when I was there. I know I have said alot but I do think it is important. I am a avid traveler and when I am with my Parents I stay in rooms that are more than a 1,000 a night. People who work at the higher paying establishments do everything to make a guest happy. My point I am making here is that it should not matter how much you are paying. The people at Becks are in the hospitlity industry and should want to make there guest happy. This experiance would never happen in Italy. They would never let you leave without saying goodbye to a friend.  One more reason I would not stay there is the motel has many drug people there.

Why ? you ask after reading some of the reviews. To tackle the good points, the location is brilliant particularly if you want to be near to the Castro area. Everything is outside the door literally. There are dozens of good cafes for breakfast, and even more for lunch / dinner and lots of coffee shops. A lot of these are filled with locals having a slow breakfast reading the paper, and are quite willing to chat. There's a coffee shop / internet cafe directly opposite along with a good bookstore, Tower Records is a few doors up, a large Safeways for groceries down the road, all the bars of Castro surround you, and ground zero of the Castro gay district is an easy 5 minute walk away. As far as transport, there is the Muni underground, plus historic old trams from all over the world that stop outside the hotel and take you in a straight line down Market Street right into the centre of town. What a way to get there ! Here you can do all the touristy things, cable cars, shopping etc, but get away back to a nice area after. The hotel will cost $100 - 130 or so, which is a fraction of those in downtown, but you are so close. Additionally, particularly if you are a gay man, there are plenty of gay tourists staying here that you can hang out with (particularly good if you happen to be passing thru on your own), and of course, some of these can be more friendly if you want them to be. Whilst this means that at times, men hang out of the balcony, they are usually very friendly, and lets face it, with the set-up, no-one is going to break into your room with people watching 24/7 (and there is security on at nighttime who challenges outsiders who just walk in). The other big plus is that the hotel has parking. What a god-send. You can zip out for the day and park when u get pack. Most streets around here have cleaning each night between 2am and 6am - which is no good when wanting to park your car to sleep for the night! On the downside, the majority of rooms face the balcony (the definite choice) but only have windows on the front, which means little airflow. The rooms used to smell of gas, but they overcame this by leaving the heating on low all the time. During the height of summer this is just ridiculous as there is no air-con, but at other times of the year (and lets face it, SF is not San Diego when it comes to weather) this doesn't matter at all - particularly in the evenings. The rooms are clean, the carpet can be ratty, but generally are 1 or 2 double beds, cable TV with 80 odd channels, a walk-in wardrobe, and a decent sized bathroom with vanity lights, fan etc. The trams can be a bit of a problem at night at the front if you are a light sleeper, and the wooden construction, means you can hear people walking on the balconies thru small creaks, but this is nothing too major. These small problems aside, I think for a gay man, the location, car parking, companionship of other guests etc. all make it a good choice particularly for the price. I would never recommend this hotel for straight couples or straight businessmen as they might be put off by other guests standing on the balconies (in reality they shouldn't as they pose no harm and in fact are a security feature), however it is not unknown for non-residents to enter and peer in windows with curtains open in the off chance they are invited in for ---. Just ignore them and they move on straight away - this is the Castro after all, and theres a lot more fish in the sea. Would I take my parents here - probably not but possibly due to the location, ease of access and parking. Would I go alone, bring my partner here, or stay here with mates - definitely. Lesbian couples seem to have a good time as well. Open minded straight couples - yes, but the bible-belt non-worldly types might be offended (or be so oblivious to it all, they might miss everything!). I can't see the point of staying here on business, unless you want the Castro for RR. When I stayed at Becks last week, I met a gay guy with his straight sister who were both enjoying it tremendously - so it really depends on your mindset of whether you want to be in this location with many gay guests or not.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR920765471", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "koalahead"}, {"Content": "not what we expected When we arrived we found our room to be verry stuffy and warm.

It was expensive for the room and facilities (I paid extra for a room at the back with a king size bed and an air conditioner). A fridge was provided as well as cable television. The room was a reasonable size but basic, clean, with the bed made up and towels replaced everyday. There was a coffee maker and hair dryer in the room. The staff were helpful when asked. The area is safe and convenient for visitors.If you're not gay it is probably a bit too cruisy and upfront (you certainly wouldn't want to leave your door open at night). Not a place for Grandma or a family with kids. The cruising is obvious in the less expensive rooms facing Market Street.If you're gay and single its good fun.

I didn't ask for anything out of the ordinary, just questions over the phone when I arrived, but they reacted like they really were inconvenienced if they helped me, so you know how that came across. The last straw was when I asked them to actually do something, which was to fix the fireplace, well they simply wouldn't. At that point I finally got upset over their service and confronted them on it, which is when they were apologetic and accomodating and immediately sent someone to fix the fireplace. So they knew they were in the wrong the whole time, but wasn't going to do anything about it until someone said something.As convenient as they are, I would rather stay somewhere further, than put up w/ them.

I spent a week at Beck's around the holidays. I like it because it's clean and relatively inexpensive, and I stay there fairly often. It's also one of the few lodging choices in the Castro area of San Francisco. I checked in on a Saturday. The very next day the lock on the room door stopped working, so I went to the desk and explained the problem. The clerk took a while to figure out what to do. Ultimately, she offered to move me to another room. The new room was smaller than the original room but the rate remained the same. I persisted in requesting some compensation for having to move. The clerk appeared somewhat dumbfounded that I would ask. Reluctantly, she took $4 off my room rate each night for the remaining nights. I thought that was fair. Be aware: this motel is a cruisy place for men seeking sex. While walking down the stairs to get ice, I was propositioned by a man who smelled heavily of alcohol. It would be inappropriate to repeat what he said, but it was rather crude. The cruising begins when darkness falls and continues throughout the night. The morning I checked out, I counted no less than 5 men wandering around. So, if you want a clean place to stay in this area of San Francisco and are willing to put up with the cruising that goes on here, this is a nice place to stay.

But it's a great homebase from which to journey out from. As far as the cruising issue goes, the clientele is predominantly gay men, so cruising is a given. And I find that if you don't engage them, no one will engage you. Just mind your business, and basically they'll mind theirs.

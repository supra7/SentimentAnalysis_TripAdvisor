The worst thing for me is the lack of maintainence. The elevetor in the garage tower-pretty bad. The bathrooms-old and not very clean. The TV was from the mid-90's I bet. The beds seemed ok. Not nearly enough outlets in the room for re-charging stuff. Did have free internet. Fairly quiet. Free breakfast was coffee, orange juice and a box of doughnuts! Well, the doughnuts were pretty good, fresh, but not the healthiest of meals. The garage was strange-one level only, and you had to back out onto a ramp that goes right onto the street.

The lobby was okay, but once you go up to the rooms the halls are dim and the carpet is pretty worn out. The rooms had a funny smell, like old people. On our last night, I stopped by CVS and bought a travel size Febreze to freshen up the room. The bathroom sink looked dirty because it was scratched up. The drainage hole in the sink basin that prevents water from overflowing was clogged so it had a mildewy, rotten smell from the stagnant water. Our shower was missing a towel bar so there was two big holes in the shower wall. Some of the windows had no window screen so if you plan to go during bug season don't open the windows. The hotel states on their website that there is free high speed wireless internet in every room but when we tried to logon it was absolutely pointless. We stayed on the 4th floor and the signal was so weak we couldn't even get to logon page. It kept saying connecting, but it never did. We just gave up and settled for our IPhones' 3G network, but was disappointed for the wasted space in our carry on luggage. One morning, we walked down to the lobby and there were 5-6 people on their laptops. I'm guessing you have to be in the vicinity of the lobby to get their free wifi? Location was quiet and there were many restaurants located within walking distance. If you do stay here or around K-Town, walk on over to Kalbi Burger. The burgers are juicy and delicious. The hotel restaurant boasts that they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily however it was not open for breakfast (we dropped by on Tuesday @ 8am). If I plan to travel to L.A. again I would never go back there. I picked this place because it was close by to the wedding I was attending and the inn had free parking.

For the price, the room really wasn't that bad but it's one of those things that if the room cost much more than it did (an average of $85 per night) I wouldn't be giving it as good of grades as I have. Like many Los Angeles hotels, this Ramada isn't in the best of neighborhoods but we didn't feel like we were going to get mugged while outside at night. The restaurant inside of the hotel was closed due to health concerns, which is a red flag but there are plenty of food options within a very easy walk from the hotel. The nicest thing about its location is that it's only a block or so from a Metro subway stop which made it extremely easy to get to the convenvtion center. The room wasn't the best we've been in quality-wise but at least it was clean. The beds were comfy but the floor was lumpy, which was odd. All of the electronics worked fine as did the free WiFi. The bathroom was also clean and well-stocked. There was one thing that stuck out, though: The flush handle on the toiled liked to pop-off. It was easy to re-install each time, but the hotel's maintenance guys should think about putting a dab of glue on the mount to prevent this from happening. The Ramada Inn at Wilshire Center isn't a bad hotel at all (for the price). So long as it doesn't get any more expensive that $80-something per night, it's a good option.

The location is great - proximity to everything is a big advantage. Some people say the neighbourhood is scary & unsafe. Well, that is not true. Sure it's no Beverly Hills, but it's absolutely safe and not scary at all, though walking there during the night hours probably ain't a good idea. Another great advantage is two parkings, one of them underground, with lots of free space. I personally never had problems with finding a place to park my car, no matter when I returned to the hotel during the day or late at night. The price of the parking is great too - 10 dollars for the whole period of your stay. As for the room: it was clean, spacious & had everything one might need: a TV, an air conditioner, a hairdryer, a fridge, a telephone, an iron & a coffeemaker. To sum up I think the hotel is great for the young people, who plan to rent a car & go around LA either for business or for pleasure... Great location, convenient parking, comfortable rooms - that's quite a good deal in LA for that kind of a price.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Paso", "Title": "\u201cPleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "rockyb42000", "ReviewID": "UR18776118", "Content": "I was a little worried because I found this room cheap on ebay.

The best thing about it was the vast size of the room. It also had the customary iron, ironing board and fridge. I would speculate that this room may have been considered lavish thirty years ago.

Sure enough, thats what we got. The moment we got there I was expecting a rude staff member and thats exactly what we got. The guy was wicked unfriendly and would not make eye contact with us. The guy is working customer service and when you choose to work such a job, you are supposed to be friendly, etc. Next we pulled into the parking garage which was not so bad and headed up to the room. We got in the room and smelled a strong smell of smoke which pretty much sucked because we booked a non smoking room. When we checked into the hotel, the guy said the place was booked solid so we didn't even bother with requesting another one. We scoped out the room and it had old stained furniture, the tv cabinet was warped and looked like crap. The sheet that in normally supposed to be fitted to the mattress was just a regular sheet so as soon as you sat down or got in it, the sheet would start coming up to show the nasty mattress. Speaking of the mattress, the thing had no support at all, one of the worst mattresses I have ever layed on. Onto the floor, it had stains all over the place and even a piece of gum was stuck to it. The painting were crooked, there were cracks in the walls. Ok, so now we checked out the bathroom. More cracks in the walls, the tub itself had dirt in it. It had not been cleaned and looked straight up gross. We had to put down a towel to walk on when we took a shower. The toilet seat was not attached to the toilet so it just fell off. This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and I would give it less then a 1 if I could. The neighborhood that the hotel is in is really not that bad. Within walking distance are tons of places to eat. We got some Korean BBQ that was really good and it was right next to the hotel. Also next to the hotel were several sushi places and other food joints. So I really have nothing bad to say about the area. It is centrally located between Santa Monica and Hollywood. Now there is a bar thats attached to the hotel or apart of the hotel, how ever you want to put it. It was a chill atmosphere but I got the feeling that the Asian girls working in it and sitting at the bar were prostitutes. They had couches that were blocked by fold up walls where I can see seedy stuff going down. That is just the vibe me and my buddy got but we could be wrong. It was nice and the staff was friendly though. The only type of person I would recommend to stay in this hotel is maybe some party kids who will be out all night and are just using the beds to crash and do not really care about anything else but even then, I would probably say steer shy of this place and look at different hotels up on this site. We booked the hotel from orbitz for 2 days and canceled the 2nd day as soon as we arrived. We got charged 25 bucks for canceling but it was worth staying somewhere else. We were paying a 100 bucks a night at this place and then I went looking on here for better hotels for the 2nd night and found The Omni for 160 and decided to go with it. The Omni was one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in and can't be beat for the price. It was wicked nice and the staff was awesome.

My fiancee and I found this Ramada Inn available somewhat last minute after having previous hotel arrangements with friends fall through prior to a conference in late May 2006. We stayed for a total of 4 nights. We booked on-line (ramada's website), and felt the rate was decent, but almost cancelled later once we read the reviews on this site and a friend familiar with LA told us were were going to be in Koreatown. In the end, we didn't cancel, and overall I'm glad we stuck with the reservation. Here are some plusses and minuses of our experience there: Advantages/Expected: 1) Parking: We paid a total of $5 for the entire stay, the lot is half a block down from the main entrance and you can put your car in a gated, enclosed structure if you choose to do so. Of note, we made good use of our rental car while we were in LA. 2) We were upgraded for free since we were staying for 4 nights into a suite so perhaps the following amenities are not available in every room but we had the following: a) Two telephones b) Television, sofa, study desk, dresser c) Well kept, clean, well-lit bathroom with two sinks d) Small refrigerator e) Room was spacious, with a sliding door diviion between the bedroom area and the desk/sofa area While we didn't spend that much time in the hotel room, it was nice to have so much space and all the basic amenities in good order. 3) Climate control was easy to adjust and came in handy when it got humid 4) Free internet access on a computer in the lobby area - unfortunately, it was popular to use, and since there is only one... 5) Breakfast - We may have figured out why the reviews are so varied, the earlier one goes, the more that is available (they're not really great about re-stocking). It starts at 7:30 am - there are bagels (plain, sesame, etc.), simple breads, jellies, juice, water, whole milk, three cold cereals, coffee, and oranges available. They have toasters there for use as needed. It's not gourmet, but is a nice simple option overall. The pickings were definitely slimmer when we swung by around 10am one morning as compared to 7:30 when it starts. 6) Overall rate was within our limited travel budget, and we felt we got/did slightly better than what we paid fo. There were no funny/unexpected charges as was the case with some other hotels I saw reviews on. Disadvantages: 1) Floor was wet around the refrigerator when we initially entered the room on the first night - ? were they defrosting it, this wasn't an issue afterwards 2) Location - Not really quite a disadvantage since Wilshire Ave is a good East-West throughfare of LA so it was easy enough to find, get to places (e.g. Hollywood/ Airport/ Beaches on the West/ Convention Center) overall with a car. We weren't disturbed by traffic while in the room. A subway line is a few blocks away, though we didn't use it. Nonetheless, it is in the northern part of Koreatown, and probably wouldn't be a place you want to hang out by yourself at night. You're probably not going to go for a midnight stroll just to see what's around, or open the curtains in the morning and smile at the amazing view. 3) Front desk staff is not the most friendly in the world - they're certainly not mean, but I guess smiling doesn't exactly come easy either. We were a little scared going in when we called to let the hotel know that we were going to be getting in late, and unfortunately we could not communicate this since the two people at the front desk at the time (late night) could only speak Korean. By the time we got there though, the shift must have changed because everyone spoke English - and we never had a problem throughout our stay. +/- No goodies in the hotel rooms (e.g. small chocolate bars, etc.) to pick on. The television had basic cable - no frills. +/- Nightclub - there is a nightclub that had some loud dance music blasting when we got there. While we actually checked it out for a bit just for fun (there is a back entrance into the club area from the lobby) we decided to call it a night early. Luckily we were a few floors up and on the opposite end of the nightclub so the music wasn't a nuisance, but we could still hear it slightly. This might be something worth asking about if you make a reservation over the phone and are planning to stay over the weekend.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Apple Valley", "Title": "\u201cDispointing Experince.

I had requested a non-smoking room, and was placed on a non-smoking floor however the whole floor was saturated with the smell of fresh cigarette smoke. The room itself was less then desirable. There were no towels in the bathroom, and when I went down to the front desk the clerk working had no customer service skills what so ever! She questioned why I needed towels, and refused to give me more then 2 towels. I was appalled by the staff's rudeness, and the over all filth of the hotel. The elevator always seemed to have a questionable smell. I couldn't wait to check out of the hotel.

Sure the room was decent for the price. Not the Ritz, but it had the necessities.

I had prebooked and prepaid through Expedia, however Ramada still charged my credit card. Each time I called the hotel about my refund (which they assured me I would get after they were paid by Expedia), it was the same, \"just wait until your next credit card statement.\" After at least a total of 10 phone calls to both Expedia and Ramada (it was the principle now more than the actual money), Expedia kindly offered me a settlement. Point of my story: DON'T waste your time, long-distance minutes, and frustration on this backwards place.

The suite was spacious though and the amenities were at least what we were told they would be. Parking was only $5 for the two nights we were there.

It is in Koreatown, only one block away on the same side of the street from the Wiltern Theatre. I was not charged for parking and found a great spot on the upper level of the garage next to the elevator. We were so close to buses and the Metro that we used them to get to the museum for the King Tut exhibit and Hollywood & Highland but please bring plenty of dollar bills for tickets since making change is a pain. The cozy lobby has a complimentary computer with Internet access but no printer. The quaint dining room is used for continental breakfast which was decent. I recommend the Junior Suite for small families since there is a pull-out sofa separated by a door to the bedroom. The Internet rate was under $90 a night for 2005. The only drawback here is the customer service at the front desk is less than stellar. Please make sure you take all of your belongings from the hotel and get your receipt when checking out (since they did not offer one) because you may not get any cooperation once you are out of there.

We needed a hotel close to the LA County Museum of ARt because it was showing the King Tut Exhibit. Fortunately, by the time we drove to LA from San Francisco it was already after 7 pm and the start time on our tickets was at 8 pm. So, it took only less than 20 minutes to drive down the street, find parking and line up for Tut. The room actually was a suite with a big living room area connected to a bedroom with louvered doors and a big bathroom with 2 doors from each room to match. The room was very clean and newly remodeled which my wife was very appreciative of. The neighborhood was in Koreatown and after the exhibit, we ate at a rice bowl restaurant that was open after 10pm Friday night. Parking was free which was great considering how at some hotels its another $15 charge. And, last but not least, they had an absolutely beautiful continental breakfast of bagels, cream cheese, choice of cold cerelals or oatmeal, fruits, juices, coffees and donuts. When I called Ramada's 800 reservations was able to get me a $88 rate for AAA members. The front desk was nice but I had problems when I called from Las Vegas searching for a lost credit card and the day shift f/d lady agent claimed that nothing was there sort of abruptly without asking my name, when I stayed, etc. A small negative compared to a wonderful stay.", "Date": "September 5, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ramada Wilshire Center", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d84480-Reviews-Ramada_Wilshire_Center-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$78 - $137*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3900 Wilshire Boulevard</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90010</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "84480", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/97/c6/97c6faf623a74f4c0921aa1a423e61394large.jpg"}}

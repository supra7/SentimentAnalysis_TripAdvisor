This includes ones in soaps, cleaners, detergents, etc. If they are used in room cleaning, I am in trouble. Well, I called ahead and spoke with the Guest Services Manager, Chuck Hernandez. He was very accomodating. He made a note on his computer and got with the room services manager the day before. They worked very hard to make sure my room was perfume free! They did a great job too! When I arrived, I was greated by, Kenneth Price, he is very nice! I was concerned about the chair in my room, and he arranged to get me another one... I am a person of size and the chair arms were very narrow and uncomfortable. That night for supper, I went to the hotel restaurant. My server, Diane, was so nice! I am not accostumed to traveling alone, and therefore it was nice to have a friendly face in a very nice restaurant. The food was excellent! The next night the head over the restaurant came to my table. I was sitting with new friends, I had met at the meeting I was attending. He spoke to us, asked how all was going and was very plesant! The food was outstanding! I hear they have a new chef... great job. The breakfast buffet has eggs, waffles, pancakes, etc. cooked to order on a flat grill... delicious. The shuttle driver/bellmen were all very nice... They worked hard and gave me excellent directions to places I was driving. Including which lane I should be in, etc. My only negative was one time when we had to wait a while because traffic had caused our shuttle driver to be late. (I actually think it was because the group before us was not all ready on time to leave and caused a problem, but they said it was traffic.) I suggest a couple of benches outside the building for people to sit on while waiting. The building is nice, has beautiful grounds, close free parking, and shuttle service, accomodating staff, comfortable beds, quiet zoned floors, indoor pool and spa, exercise room, and gift shop. The furniture in my room was a little scratched. I only include the couple of negatives so you will know I am being upfront. This is a wonderful place to stay.

Room never cleaned. When it was cleaned we did not get clean towels. Took some from the pool area. 5. ran out of ice 6. ran out of tortillias 7. hassled people about drinking their own beer and eating food they brought in the lobby but only had one bar tender and no food.

Expected us to eat in our rooms no one cleaned, over flowing tiny trashcan, and a toilet that did not flush. 8. Checking people into the hotel knowing they had just told us they had no idea when or if they would have hot water. Watching the desk staff not mention it to anyone checking in to make sure they even wanted to risk it. This was particularly sad because the kids they were checking in were on their way to basic training and this hotel would be their last civilian experience. Luckily by 10 pm hot water had returned.

We are Priority Club members and was shocked by this hotel. 95% of the hotel staff were courteous and seemed like they were trying to make things right, but we will not return. It was just too stressful of a stay. 1. Check in was fine. 2. No housekeeping for two of our three nights. Had to beg for towels. Front desk did not seem sympathetic. Finally after several calls and threatening to walk down to the desk in my bed sheet or naked and wet, towels arrived. Toilet paper was also not replaced. 3. Ran out of hot water on our second day. The front desk sent someone within an hour and fixed the problem, but the hot water was gone again within two hours. I did not call back - just endured it. Our sink and tub would also stop up intermittently, but drained on their own after a few hours. 4. Wifi is hit and miss, but it's free, so you really can't complain about that. 5. Most of the front desk workers were unable to answer questions about directions and area businesses/restaurants. 6. Went to the restaurant at 12:05pm on a Saturday. After 55 minutes, only a third of our party had received their food. After cancelling our orders due to time constraints, the waiter came running out with our order, but most of it was incorrect. They left with our glasses to get refills, but only a few of them came back. Our checks were incorrect, but again, due to time constraints had to guesstimate the total and left cash on the table for hopefully the correct amount. There were only four other tables in the restaurant at that time, and some received their food that had come in after us. We did not order anything special - burgers, soup, etc. No lunch for the diabetic that day. 7. The business center was a nice touch and you could make free copies, but the computers and pringers functional ability was hit and miss also. 8. Room keys stopped functioning several times during our stay. 9. Driver of the free shuttle was nice, but only used on our first day because he warned us that the service may not be available because their schedule was full. It should also be noted that there is nothing but a Jack in the Box and a Shell station is safe walking distance. You definitely need a car if the shuttle's schedule is full. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to complain, but I do not want anyone to have to endure the issues that we did. It seemed like they meant well, but just couldn't pull it off. They comped full nights to other members of our group, but I had to ask and only got 50% off of one night. The building, while old, is perfectly fine to look at (not including plumbing issues).

The restaurant and bar are very near the lobby and are always filled with guests having a great time, and the food is pretty good. The elevators are very fast--an important element to those of us who need to get out of the hotel quickly in the mornings.

The hotel made dinner for our group that night that included salad, chicken, potatoes, veggies, rolls, & dessert. All of it was really good for a hotel food. The next morning, the shower was extremely strong and felt so good. The bathroom had some small areas of mildew.

Our stay began with the unprofessional check-in where we were not even recognized as Platinum members. One of the room packages we had booked included breakfast, but did not show up on the computer system at the front desk. We were told that we would have to go to the Exec Business Center and print it out before they would recognize that breakfast was included in that room. After printing it out and returning to the front desk to make sure that we would not be charged for breakfast, my husband didn't even receive an apology for the mix up and inconvenience of having to do everything himself to prove that we the breakfast was included in our booking. Once we arrived in our room, which had a wonderful view over Dallas, we realized there was no safe deposit box in our room. We were told to come to the front desk to deposit our valuable, but at the front desk my husband was rudely dismissed and passed on to someone else. The front desk clerk told him he was too busy to help him. That is not customer service. The hotel had apparently been \"recently\" renovated and the interior is quite nice. The housekeeping staff could do a much better job of keeping everything in good order if they would do more than just the basic cleaning. The front of the dresser with the TV didn't look like it had ever seen furniture polish or a cleaning cloth. It was full of palm prints. We wanted to take a picture of the Dallas skyline, but we had to first clean the window because it was full of palm prints and head prints. The door frame in the bathroom looked like it had blood smears or who know what. The duct for the A/C was absolutely filthy. The A/C in our room was not working adequately, and can only be controlled by what looks like the original A/C controls from when the hotel was built. This should have been upgraded to a digital system along with the renovations. The floors in and around the elevators on the Executive Floor had papers, toothpicks, etc. which no one had bothered to clean up. The bathtubs are rather slippery and we phoned down for a rubber bath mat to be brought up. On the first try, a full size mattress and box spring were delivered. We explained again what we needed, and on the second try a full size refrigerator was delivered. On the third try, and English speaking gentleman came to the door with someone from Housekeeping who only spoke Spanish. We explained again what we needed and were told that they didn't have anything like that. About an hour later, a rubber bath mat was delivered. When we were removing the plastic wrap around the mat, the whole thing disintegrated. We were able to poke wholes through the mat. It also looked as if it had been around since the opening of the hotel. I brought it back down to the front desk to ensure that we would not be charged for it and she just laughed and shook her head. We filled in the questionnaire that was in our hotel room, and put it in an envelope marked with the name of the hotel manager Jeff Woods. We handed this in to the front desk staff when we checked out, but weeks later we still have not heard anything from him.

Lobby Bar - Having noticed a bar off the lobby when we were checking in, we invited our fellow dinner companions back to the hotel for a drink. The bar was pretty busy, and you had to get your own drinks (no waitstaff), but we really enjoyed ourselves.

The furniture was fairly new after a remodel...scratched but still new looking and up-to-date. The standard room had plenty of space to sit with 3 comfortable chairs and 1 desk. I loved the view of downtown in the distance. There was just something about my room that seemed lacking. The bathtub was stained from what was probably old slip resistant stick-ons. I traveled solo, but booked the room for 2 adults and 2 children-- but there were only 3 bath towels. The bed looked like it was hastily made. The bed linen on one bed was not neatly tucked in which gave the appearance...well travelers want to think no one else slept in their bed :-) so when linen is not neatly tucked...some of us question why especially in such a nice hotel. The other posts were accurate except the equipment has been updated. The staff was professional and friendly from the pool area to the dining room. The made-to-order omelets were great and the dining room staff did a great job not only for me but others. They were especially kind to another family traveling with young children. The orange juice was a bit sour so just try it before you drink a big gulp like I did. The indoor pool area appeared clean and neat as did the exercise area. The operator button on the phone did not work when I wanted to ask for help because the remote on the TV did not work. I decided to go to bed early. There is a Starbucks one block north on the West side of the highway. There is a regular shuttle to Love Field.

The next night I stayed at a sister facility a few stars less and everything was clean, neat, new looking and the remote worked. The prices were about the same. The 3 1/2 stars for this facility may be misleading because people are expecting more than a regular Holiday Inn, and it is more. This is a Holiday Inn with an indoor poor and on-site dining that looks really nice after the upgrades, but still shows its age. Like getting an expensive facelift, but the neck still shows signs of age. Major overhauls take time.

It is surrounded by busy highways and no restaurants or shopping or anything nearby. The highway is complex and hard to navigate.

I decided to try a low ball bid on Priceline.com., I put in a bid of $35.00 for a 3.5 star hotel near Love Field and Crown Plaza picked it up.

An absolutely gorgeous view of downtown Dallas. Free parking. The best staff I have seen at a hotel in quite some time. We had a nice dinner on the premises. The resturant was not busy at 8:30 PM preceeding a holiday, but the chef delivered our food to the table and exchanged plesantries with us for a few minutes. The food was scrumptious.

The elevators definitely have a moldy odor to them, which is occasionally mitigated by a good spray of Febreeze during the daily cleaning rounds. The rooms are very poorly lit. My room has two full-sized beds and is illuminted by one desk lamp, and two tablelamps, for a total of four of those new flouroescent bulbs. One end of the room remains depressingly dark, even with all lights on. The room is full enough with a TV/dresser, work desk, nightstand, and two beds, but then they add two sitting chairs and a table between them - and the room is just claustrophobically cramped. Housekeeping service can use some emphasis on attention to detail - when restocking my in-room coffee, I was left with one coffee amenity pack, instead of the usual two. Not a major, until I went for my 2nd cup of coffee this morning. The neighborhood around Mockingbird/IH-35 isn't the nicest part of town to be sure, so the parking lot security is a nice touch.

On the up side, the front desk staff was very polite and helpful and the hotel and room did appear to be clean. Nice comfortable beds and bedding and the signature crowne plaza sleep package with spray and light sleeping music. Everything was clean except for the very dirty looking indoor hot tub which appeared to have some sort of dirty foamy soap on the top of the water.

I was worried that perhaps the a/c or heat would not be up to par, but I was delighted to find that my fears were unfounded. I loved that every lamp in the room (four!) all had an extra electrical outlet on their bases making it easy to plug in my phone and PC chargers. Nice! The bathrooms have been redone with a nice shower head with consistent water temperatures. The bathrooms are not huge nor the tubs deep, but they are nice and have extras like curved shower curtain rods and double sinks. Towels were better than similar hotels, and amenities in the bathroom included mouthwash. (Nice extra touches!) Lighting was excellent (a pet peeve of mine in other hotels) and the room was quiet. I travel a LOT and this was the very first time that I received a thank you note from Housekeeping for the gratuity I left for them. (We stayed two nights).

Good pillows, and pillowcases that were actually soft. The breakfast buffet was really terrific. Great CRISP bacon without having to ask, and the usual spread put on by good hotels. The remodeled dining area was fresh, clean, and open. The hotel is just minutes (5) from Dallas' best \"restaurant row\". We loved our $$$$$ dinner at Pappa's Steakhouse but really enjoyed getting back to our room just 5 minutes later!

They offered some extra amenities such as a free relaxation CD, linen bed spray and earplugs. There were two sinks and a make up mirror. All the rooms were close to the elevators. Upon arriving at the room, found there was no hotel guide or guest service directory, except for the room service menu. Had to call the front desk to get any information. A decorative pillow on the bed had something dried on it. We found the rollaway bed to take up too much room and on our way out the next morning requested that it be taken out. Upon arriving back at the end of the day, found that our room had not been touched that day. We called Front Desk and informed them. They said they would have adjusted our charge if we hadn't prepaid, and offered us free breakfast, which did us no good, as breakfast was included in our conference meals. We requested again that the bed be removed when someone brought up the clean towels. The towels were brought and the bed was left behind. The following day thankfully our room wasn't skipped. They finally took the bed. They left no liner for the bathroom trash and no new coasters for the water glasses. I considered using the workout machines on the first floor during the stay, but found that only 2 of the six machines were working, and were constantly in demand. All in all, while some of the amenities were nice, I would have enjoyed the stay more if the service had been better.", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cPoor attitude\u201d", "Author": "Gearoid9", "ReviewID": "UR7476128", "Content": "I stayed here for one night, my flight from DFW having been cancelled.

Wanted a Diet Coke before bedtime and gave up looking for a functional vending machine after 06 floors. Staffing in bar at night was insufficient. Not enough personnel on duty and nobody to assist the beleagured bartender. The location was convenient, but if you are with your spouse and using this as a place to stay for relaxation, dont' do it. It is in a bad part of town. I would not have stayed there if my wife was with me.

Adjacent to the pool is a fitness center. This area closes at 11:00 p.m. I was surprised to learn that this hotel is pet friendly, a nice accommodation for travelers traveling with pets.

There is a small area with a table and two chairs. Plenty of closet and dresser drawer space for clothes. Being so close to the freeway, I was pleasantly surprised to have found the room quiet.

I was attending a conference at the Adam's Mark but didn't want to pay our reduced rate of $115 plus $12 for parking, especially after reading that the rooms weren't all that great. So, I went on Priceline and bid $45 for a 3 star hotel and Crowne Plaza accepted the bid. I checked in and the front desk staff was really friendly. They checked me into a corner room with a king size bed and non-smoking on a high floor, as I called and requested. Unfortunately, I was called around 8 PM and told I had to change rooms...the one I was in was blocked off and I was put there by mistake. I had just ordered room service and they offered to pick up the tab and buy me breakfast in their restaurant. Not bad. Now for the bad stuff...the second room wasn't nearly as clean as the first. I was on the 19th floor and my new room (same location--corner room) had the added bonus of elevator noise. I called to complain but nothing was done about it. Every time the elevator moved you could hear it. Pretty annoying, but that's really as bad as it got. Crowne plaza has gotten new beds, and they give you a sleep mask, ear plugs, a CD for relaxation, and lavender spray for the sheets as part of a new \"sleep better\" program. Wireless internet was 4.95 a day, 9.95 a week; pretty reasonable compared to other hotels I've stayed at. Parking here is free! The breakfast buffet resembles Embassy Suites...made to order eggs, pancakes, waffle, etc. Room service was just okay. I highly recommend the Crowne Plaza, based on my room rate.

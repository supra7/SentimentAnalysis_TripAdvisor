Good rate for a decent and clean room. Breakfast is LQ standard. Elevator was filthy, floor littered with peanut shells and M&Ms. I would have given this place a 4 if the catalytic converter hadn't been cut out of our car while we slept. Looking through trip advisor, it seems that LQ has a crime problem in this city. We went out of our way to empty the fully packed car because of that, only to have someone remove a section of the exhaust. Won't be comin back, Indy.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here.\u201d", "Author": "FLBRIAZ", "ReviewID": "UR119981728", "Content": "While moving across country we stopped here with all our belongings in tow. We checked in around 11:00 at night after 13 hours of driving. Our room was on the back side of the building about 10 yards across the grass from where our trailer and cars were parked. At 5 am I woke up and heard car alarm. Our car alarm. My husband went outside and found the lock to the trailer cut with bolt cutters and the passenger rear door window smashed in. All our electronics taken. Where it gets worse was the staffs reaction. We had plastic but needed tape to cover the shattered window. Upon going to the front desk and briefly explaining why I needed tape, the attendant simply stated, \"oh\" looked around the desk and stated they didn't have any tape. No sort of offer to call police (although I already had) or help in any way was given. Later my husband went to see if there were any cameras pointed in the direction of our car and trailer. Conveniently they said that camera had been out because it got wet. Really? The detective that came out was personable, but this hotel was shadey. We stayed here after reading decent Google reviews.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gulf Coast, USA", "Title": "\u201cNice rooms, good location.\u201d", "Author": "Mickispa", "ReviewID": "UR117976096", "Content": "We had a king room on the 5th floor as did the couple traveling with us. The room was clean and spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. They are opening up a lounge but it is two weeks away. Too bad because the sign on the building said it was open. The only real problem we encountered was the constant key card failure. One of the staff cleaned the key locks but it didn't really help. Everyone we saw on our floor had the same trouble. It wouldn't have been a big deal had we not been carrying a ton of stuff back from our convention.

Was in a good location with lots of places near by for shopping, gas and dinning. Wal-Mart, K-mart, Target, Kroger, Meijer all near by. Check in was easy and quick, the rooms were Very comfortable. The only thing we noticed was there was no in room safe, which kind of confused us. We declinded room service for this reason, not feeling we had the best security we wanted since we had traveled here straight from work, and had some items we wanted secured. House keeping left a note on the door handle each day telling us they couldn't clean our room because of the DND sign. Left me a bit annoyed since we were gone all day, it was evident to anyone who walked by that our room was unoccupied. The doors were a bit hard to close, we informed the front desk and they told us they'd been hearing that a lot. You definately had to PUSH to close the door. Beds were very comfortable, and rooms had microwaves and fridges. Overall we were pleased with the rooms, we had several of them in our group, and all of them were good, no major issues. Great value for the price.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cBedbugs.\u201d", "Author": "36928Cosmo87", "ReviewID": "UR115547953", "Content": "Stayed there with two friends. One of them woke up and was complaining of itching and had noticeable welts. Though that he had been bit by mosquitoes the night before. The next day it was worse and we got suspicious. We pulled up the sheets and mattress and found the bugs. Put one in a glass and took it to the front desk and checked out. They were nice and apologetic -- and didn't charge us for the room. But it was unsettling and I am still worried I brought some home. I had stayed at this hotel many many times for business.

A friend recommended this hotel. I had never stayed at a La Quinta before but decided since the price was so reasonable it was worth a try. I found the room to be comfortable and clean and the staff very friendly. The hotel is right by the highway so I could hear the traffic but, again, for the price I paid I'm not complaining. The fridge and microwave were a definite plus. The breakfast was simple and did the trick and the free wi-fi was very much appreciated. In fact when I got to my other hotel, I kept commenting on how I was paying three times as much for my room but still had to pay for breakfast and wi-fi. Would recommend this hotel chain to anyone looking for a no-frills, good value hotel.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Value": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cNot too bad for the rate\u201d", "Author": "DJwog", "ReviewID": "UR37688875", "Content": "Arrived for a weekend trip. 3 nights and got the special $59 weekend getaway rate. Room was on the 1st floor near the elevators. Room mildly reeked of carpet fresh or some other artificial air freshener. Room was clean and nicely appointed. Bathroom was clean. Large king bed. Room was smaller than most I am used to, but the make over was well done. Flat screen TV was ok. Not HD and not a lot of channels. Upon further inspection we founnd that the hair dryer was missing from the bathroom. A trip the the front desk found that the housekeeping staff had the key to the room they were in to call in the AM. When that rolled around they said they would get one to us. An hour later and we are still waiting. We finally had to hunt down housekeeping our self and get one. The Breakfast was well stocked and busy. Arrive early. The front desk staff was ok but really didnt go out of their way to do any thing. They do allow pets here and you will hear dogs bark in other rooms at times. Location was great. Plenty of parking.

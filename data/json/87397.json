We stayed March 9th through March 19th. I booked through whatahotel (loraine travel). Because of this we received the full buffet daily ($85 dollar value a day for two people), a lunch at Ferraros ($85 value), room upgrade based on availability, and every 5th night free (so we had two free nights). The buffet was great, but not sure I could justify $85 a day if it wasn't included. The lunch at Ferraros wasn't that good. My wife got the lobster salad sandwich and I got a burger. We have had better of both at many restaurants. A room upgrade wasn't available right away. I asked to be placed on a wait list (I realize an upgrade for 10 nights wasn't going to be easy). After 3 nights we were upgraded from our partial ocean view room to an ocean view prime. Both rooms were on the inside of the resort looking into the gardens and out onto the ocean. One was farther back (still a good view in my opinion). The prime ocean view was closer to the ocean. Definitely not worth it if we had to pay for it, but it was a good view. Because we spent such little time in the room, I would most likely look for a garden or mountain view next time. What we really enjoyed that made our stay excellent: - Room service & staff - Workout area & staff - Outrigger Canoe Program (free): Saw whales & turtles - Valet guys top notch with directions, blankets, water & towels - Duo: Again, we really liked the buffet. We also went here once for dinner. Really liked the dinner. It was expensive (just like Spago & Ferraros), but we felt it was worth it. - Pool & Beach service was great. I did feel the serenity pool is somewhat over rated. We liked hanging out closer to the main pool near the lawn. Those chairs have really nice ocean views. What could be improved: - My wife thought the rooms were dated (carpet, furniture, bed). Bathroom, amenities & house keeping service were great. - Spago: I'm more than willing to drop money on a meal if it's worth it. Our meal was good, but not worth the money. - Ferraros: We were expecting better based on the reviews. Our lunch is mentioned above. We also ate here once for dinner. Again, not that great. My wife had the seafood pasta (don't recall the name, but it was recommended by the waiter as their signature dish) and I had the short rib & gnocchi. Mine was good, but serving size was really small. My wife didn't like her order, but it was huge. - I know we were there in March, but the resort is really focussed on families. Some days it annoyed me a little and other days it didn't. I could see how some people could be put off by it.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cReally nice for a QUIET getaway!\u201d", "Author": "scottie138", "ReviewID": "UR126365694", "Content": "We stayed at the fantastic Four Seasons Hotel in Maui in January.

I wasn't staying there, but I went with my parents to check out the properly. I was amazed and told myself that one day I would stay here. Fast forward and my husband and I made reservations to stay for one week. It was one of the best travel experiences we've ever had. As soon as we arrived we were greeted with a friendly aloha and received leis and a cool refreshing beverage. The check-in was fast and friendly. Our room was not available yet, as we were a little early, but they took all of our luggage and sent us a text message on our cell phone an hour later when our room was available. We had an ocean view room, which was large, quiet, spotless and comfortable. The beds were heaven...all of the linens were so soft and the bed was so comfortable, I slept better than I have in a long time. In fact, I was in need of a new bed and ended up ordering a bed and the linens from the hotel because I was so in love with waking up without back pain for the first time in many, many months. The housekeeping service was great and didn't disturb us at all. If we were taking an afternoon nap, housekeeping would leave a message on the phone telling us to call them if we wanted our room freshened up. I would call before we left for dinner and the room would be done by the time we got back. They even have an iphone/ipad app that I used to request additional pillows in our room - amazing! Every employee we encountered was extremely friendly, always willing to chat and answer questions about the properly. At the pool, I was always greeted by name. I spent most of my time at the serenity pool. I did get up early to reserve a couple of chairs, but I didn't find this to be an inconvenience. They kept really good track of people who have been gone for longer than he allotted time and they pulled their towels so other people can sit there. They brought around goodies every once in a while - pineapples, brownies, popsicles, and if you're there early morning, they even bring muffins. They brought around cool moist towels when it was hot out and, one day when it was kind of rainy and windy, they brought warm towels. The food service at the pool comes from the Duo restaurant just downstairs and is very good - wraps, burgers, salads, sandwiches. The drinks from the bar are also very good. The concierge was very helpful in getting us rides into Wailea (this is provided by the hotel within a certain radius of the hotel), a taxi, booking excursions, etc. If we needed a ride, it was there within minutes. We ate at all three restaurants while we were there. We loved Ferraro's even though it was closed the first two time we wanted to eat there because of bad weather. When we finally did go, we found it was well worth the wait! Reserve a table at sunset for a romantic dinner experience. We ended up eating there twice. We also went to Duo three times - another great experience. The steak and mahi mahi were both excellent, and the breakfast buffet is wonderful. We were less thrilled with Spago's. I was expecting great things, but we had to wait quite a while, even though we had reservations, and the pork chop I had, while abundant, was somewhat bland and unexciting. We did not go back there. The grounds of the resort are immaculate and very beautiful. The resort is pretty small, but it never felt crowded. The beach is shared with the Grand Wailea next door, but, again, it was usually pretty quiet. There is a paved walking path that leads to the Grand Wailea and beyond on one side, and past some gorgeous homes on the other. It was nice to be able to walk at night after dinner (bring a light at night, so you don't step on any frogs)! I had very high expectations because of all the reviews I'd read here. Was it expensive? YES! This was by far the most I've ever paid for a hotel room. But I have to say, it was worth every penny! I can't wait to go back! I almost feel like the people there are family now!

This place is a secluded piece of heaven. The location the hotel itself, the service, the food and the celebrity spotting. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never want to leave. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons in Maui in May 2011 for 7 nights. The experience was just pure indulgence from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Greeted so warmly with a Lai and a tropical mocktail we were quickly and easily checked in whilst chatting to the friendly staff who all seem so happy to be working in such a nice place and willing to do anything to make your stay enjoyable. Our room was perfect, spacious, elegant, comfortable and impeccably clean. When we arrived in the room there was a gorgeous long stem red rose and a bottle of champagne waiting for us. The view from the room was beautiful, landscaping beautiful Maui in all its beauty. The other reviews here are right. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever feel like leaving the resort. The grounds are so lush and well groomed; the pools (including the adult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only infinity pool) are amazing. We spend some time at the infinity pool just relaxing drinking cocktails at the swim up bar, enjoying the view and soaking up the sun on the very comfy lounge chairs, but the highlight of the infinity pool is the AMAZING service. Your ice water is always topped up; you are served fruit, iceblocks, muffins and lots of treats by the pool all day, not to mention lunch and yummy meals any time you like. A lovely lady will come and spritz you with Evian (srsly right?!), you can lay back and relax with cucumbers on your eyes and a cold towel. I spent a few hours lying by the pool, reading a kindle (the hotel provides to you for your stay) and really relaxing. You are treated like royalty. We saw Hillary Duff and her sister at the infinity pool throughout the week. A cheap thrill for a pop / Disney kid like me. Hehe. We booked a Snorkelling tour to the Molokini crater through the resort. They recommended an awesome company to go with and it was one of the most fun snorkelling experiences ever. We swam with heaps of turtles, so many varieties of fish and enjoyed a sunny day on a yacht including a nice lunch and drinkies as well as comfortable transport to and from the hotel. Thanks so much to Wendy for booking that for us we had an unforgettable day. My husband and I had a couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spa treatment at the hotel and it was sublime! We spent 5 hours being pampers, massaged and taking a relaxing journey to heaven and back. We came out of our spa day feeling like brand new. A must do\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6pure Bliss! I also got my hair cut in the salon and they did an awesome job. I was very happy with it. They even styled it for me for dinner that night. We also went on the Outrigger Canoe Program on a beautiful sunny morning which was a highlight for me and my husband. We saw turtles, learnt the traditional ways of the Hawaiian canoe and got a bit of an island tour from the fringes of the ocean. It was wonderful. I also did yoga a couple times on the beach on the morning. It was very nice and peaceful. Meals at the hotel were perfect, 5 star and left you wanting for absolutely nothing. The evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s musical accompaniment with dinner at Duo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was so exquisite. A perfect 5 star meal, under the stars, in the candlelight, looking out onto the ocean with the most beautiful music around you. It was just magical. I have so many nice things to say about Four Seasons Maui, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I have done it justice in this short review, but I would definitely recommend that you spoil yourself and go and check it out.

I can't believe I'm saying this about such a luxurious place, but there were some big problems combined with such a touristy, crowded, Disneyland like atmosphere that ultimately we were disappointed about our big splurge. First of all, our \"Garden View\" room was so bad that we paid a big chunk of money in order to be moved to an Ocean View room. \"Garden View\" is a euphemism for \"gardener's alley\" -- it's the cramped landscape strip between the Four Seasons and the adjacent hotel, and it's where all the property maintenance staff start up their mowers and power tools, roll their service carts back and forth, etc. It was so loud from all the machines and the traffic noise above Wailea that I couldn't open my lanai door to enjoy a breeze -- my ears literally were ringing. The Ocean View room to which we moved was truly a spectacular view, but they only gave us a minimal discount; mostly we paid dearly for the upgrade. I didn't like the touristy feel of Maui in general, Wailea, nor this Four Seasons -- the hotels crowd together in cheek-by-jowl, and it's just a monoculture of tons of mostly white rich tourists and locals who barely hide their resentment at us. The staff at this Four Seasons were all solicitous and accommodating, but it didn't feel genuine; there was a coolness behind their polished exteriors. The beach boys were an exception -- really nice guys, intelligent and funny -- amazing considering that they have to wait on guests hand and foot, right down to spritzing people with water or doing foot massages for sunbathers (honestly, I was embarrassed to even witness this). Spago (the much-touted Wolfgang Puck restaurant in the hotel) was mostly glitz and self-congratulatory presentation: I've had better food for less money. There were some things I loved about it: the infinity pool is breathtaking, and the bartenders there are excellent -- what mai tais! The spa was lovely, with good masseuses and a eucalyptus-infused steam room. The rooms were immaculate and housekeeping was very good, although I felt they messed around with my stuff a little too much to make it personal (setting up my jewelry for me on special little tatami mats, rearranging my things on the bedside table). Beds and bedding were really comfortable and, as you'd expect, luxurious. My favorite Four Seasons, though -- believe it or not -- is in Las Colinas outside of Dallas, Texas.

BUT, we have one very large complaint. There was a noisy road, the entry road to the hotel, just outside our room. For the ocean view, you had to look across the noisy road, across condominiums and then the ocean. You could not hear the ocean, because of the road. Sometimes tour buses sat for an hour with the engine running, drivers music blaring. We did not enjoy spending time on our lanai, like we usually do, and it was too noisy to leave the door open to enjoy the breezes. I stay in a lot of hotels for business and I can't believe for the money that this room was a long a noisy road! I can't believe more people haven't mentioned this in their review!

Preferred hotel partner packages include an upgrade when available, free breakfast for two at Due every morning ($85 a day value), and a $85 credit for lunch at one of the other restaurants on site. The breakfast buffet is probably the best one I've ever had. They have multiple stations of both prepared and made to order food and a wide selection of juices, fruit, and pastries. When we arrived, we were welcomed with leis, refreshments, a small dessert in the room, and an upgrade from a Garden View room to a large Garden View suite. The bell boy showed us all the amenities of the room before leaving. The resort does not nickle and dime you - bottles of water, fresh towels, and sunscreen are given out freely all over the resort. You can even borrow towels straight at the valet desk to take off the resort. All the cabanas and umbrellas are included in the room rate except for the extra fancy cabanas with flat screen TVs and mini-fridges, which are $300 a day. Since we left our son with his grandparents for this vacation, we took advantage of the gorgeous adults only Serenity Pool almost daily. To get the best chairs, however, you have to get there right before it opens at 7 am. This is easier than it sounds if you are coming from the US mainland because of jet lag. You can still get chairs most of the time if you go later, but they will be further back from the ocean view. My husband would go and reserve a chair and chill out while I got ready in our room, then I would meet him there before we went to breakfast. The staff will hold your chairs for an hour. At the Serenity Pool, staff will walk around with free fruit and aromatherapy spritzes. They also offer massages and mani/pedis for a fee.

There are literally no other parking options at the resort and to access the internet at the resort, it was $10 for slowish wifi and $20 for the \"premium\" internet package.

Other than that we literally did not leave the hotel and I don't really know why you would ever want to. The next time we go back we have decided we are not renting a car since the Four Seasons will shuttle you to nearby locations and other than that, the hotel has everything you could need- breathtaking views, delicious restaurants, pool, beach...it is luxurious relaxation at it's finest! I cried when we left and dream everyday of going back.

It was great to be back, would have liked to stay longer (however I think SAP booked every room for the days I was looking at). Yes this place is pricey (not nearly as pricey as FS Hualalai), however you get what you pay for and more. Booked using $100 day/credit package, plus got free breakfast, room upgrade and $85 lunch at Ferraro's for our 3 night stay. This is probably the nicest beach my family as ever been too. Sand is silky smooth. Water is not too rough, but can be still used for ocean games. Free snorkeling right off the beach. Rent kayak's, SUP's, etc. Set up lounge chairs with umbrellas for you. Excellent view. Superb. One thing that always makes us come back, and we always do: OUTRIGGER CANOE EXCURSION. If you have the chance, do this. My 9-year old son had his first trip. This is memorable, not only for the trip, but for the guides/people that bring you out that give you knowledge about Maui and the surrounding islands, history and canoeing. My 6-year old daughter loved the FREE Kids For All Seasons activities. She actually wanted to go there more. Gave Mom and Dad some free time. Room and bathroom were huge, though we were at the back of the resort for a little longer walk. The FS Maui is all about luxury, service, relaxing, fun, sun, swimming and beach. It is our families favorite hotel. Hopefully I'll be able to write a 4th review soon.... Oh, and the beds are to die for. I don't think I've had as good a night sleep as I had there.

It was our first trip to Maui so we cannot compare it to other hotels and resorts on the island but we can compare it to the few other 5 star hotels we have stayed at. We booked through whatahotel.com and that is the only way to go. They are a preferred partner with 4 Seasons. We got a free upgrade, breakfast buffet each morning, and one lunch for up to $85.00. The breakfast was very good and never got old. You can get eggs, pancakes, french toast, waffles, and omelots to order along with a buffet featuring a ton of fruit, hot breakfast items, pastries, and other baked items. Our lunch at Ferarro's probably rates a B+. Good but not great. All of our other meals were eaten off site while we took in the sights and sounds of Maui. Unlike other resorts, for the most part you are not nickle and dimed at 4 Seasons. There is no daily resort fee, no fee for cabanas and beach chairs, ice water at every turn, free bottled water in room, treats poolside and at the beach throughout the day, cumcumbers for your eyes, evian spritzer water, and free sun screen. The pool and beach workers are always right there but not intrusive. And the L'Occitane bath products are certainly top of the line. My only complaint is with the fee for in room internet service. I find it incredible that a resort that offers all of this finds it necessary to charge $10.00 for internet service. Really???? I have no problem with the parking fee but the internet? The staff and attention to detail is what really sets 4 Seasons apart. From the moment of arrival you are pampered (and let's face it, we all like that). The check in is smooth with someone at your side at all times. The room is waiting for you with treats and welcome cards. The evening turn down service is just another touch. When reading about that service before our stay, I wondered how necessary that was. While not necessary, being at a beach resort it is really nice. We had a way of really messing up the room through the day so this was a service we very much appreciated. Again, the beach and pool help was exceptional. And the concierge service was just as exceptional. They gave great information and took care of anything we asked. Everyone who works at 4 Seasons looks as though they love their job. A scowl was no where to be seen. The infinity pool is a great spot. While it could certainly be larger, we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was always quiet even though it was generally full. It was not a problem for us to go down early for the chairs since we are early risers anyway. On the couple of occasions where we planned to go later, a spot quickly opened up and we were paged. The beach is very close and was never crowded. We got our one hour free snorkel equipment at the hut by the beach. The reef to the side of the beach was okay for snorkeling but not great. It will depend on what you are used to and your expectations from that standpoint. We enjoyed the lobby bar and the nightly hula and music. A great place to people watch, whale watch, and sunset watch. I strongly encourage everyone to rent a car. Maui is very easy to navigate and the expense is well worth it. We drove every day and I cannot imagine not having the ability to do that. We reserved through discounthawaiicarrental.com. Four Seasons certainly is not cheap but the experience is one of a kind. My only reason for giving it four stars is that I think the room charge is a little high and to also make a statement about the internet.

One week visiting a good friend and then ending our trip at the wonderful Four Seasons Maui. The resort lived up to our expectations and more. Room: We booked a Garden View room but were upgraded to the Executive Suite Ocean View. The room was very spacious with a separate living and dining area, two balconies, a large bedroom and bathroom with Jacuzzi tub. The king bed was very comfortable although we found the feather pillows too soft but were able to select different pillows from their night time menu. We really enjoyed having the balcony space to sit and relax just listening to the wave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crash on Wailea Beach. The room was very clean, not a spot of dust to be found, and turn down service was always consistent. Hotel: The hotel is beautiful. It is not as large as some of the other hotels in the area, which was nice. Then resort never felt crowded. There were always staff members throughout the hotel willing to help you. The grounds were meticulously maintained. The staff members always seem to remember your name. We only had one issue with the concierge on our last day, she was supposed to schedule an airport pick up for us at 7:30pm but never called and we did not get a pick up till after 8pm. I was disappointed she did not remember to call for our taxi pickup since all the other services we received were top notch. We really enjoyed the nightly hula show and torch lighting ceremony in the lobby lounge. It was a great way to end a day at the pool with a cold beer and some lovely Hawaiian music. Dining: We booked through a preferred partner and received the daily breakfast buffet and a lunch credit included in our rate. The breakfast buffet at Duo was excellent. All the food was fresh and there was a huge selection of items. You also receive a smoothie shot with your breakfast and the flavor changes each day. Dinner at Duo was good. The service was a little slow but the waiter was very friendly and the cotton candy at the end was a nice surprise. Lunch from Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was excellent. The portion sizes are so big that my husband and I shared a lunch each day. Dinner was also great. Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transforms in to an Italian restaurant at night with some great live music. The homemade pasta was excellent. The ocean views are very nice from Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for lunch and sunset if you have an earlier dinner. We ordered from the pool side menu a couple times and the food was excellent as well. Pool/Beach: All the pool areas are great. We thoroughly enjoyed the serenity pool. You do need to wake up early to get a good seat but we were up at 7am anyway so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us. It was worth it to have the seats with a direct ocean view. The main pool was also nice and you never had to fight for a seat there. The pool side waiters always kept your water filled and asked if you needed anything. They also come around with different goodies throughout the day such as muffins, fresh fruit, cold towels, and brownies. The beach in front of the hotel was very nice. There are always staff members around to set up the beach chairs for you. You do share the beach with other hotels and all the beaches in Maui are public so it can get busy at times but there are designated chairs for Four Seasons guests. Overall: A wonderful hotel on Maui worth every penny. If you have the budget for the Four Seasons there is no question you should stay here. The service here does not even compare to other hotels on Maui. We look forward to returning to the Four Seasons Maui in the near future.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England, UK", "Title": "\u201cNice short get away\u201d", "Author": "BetteNoir", "ReviewID": "UR125072479", "Content": "My husband and I left the baby with grandma for 4 nights and headed over to Maui to stay at the FS for a short getaway. First trip to Maui for both of us, although I lived in Kauai for two years when I was young. This was our second Four Seasons property that year, having stayed at the one in Nevis in April, and I have subsequently stayed at the FS in Dallas as well. Positives: I would say that in general this is a lovely property and I experienced what I would consider a standard FS experience = value for money, etc... The rooms are large, the bathrooms cavernous. The location and ocean view is outstanding. We spent most of our time at the adults only pool and loved where it was situated on the property. Food is of course excellent\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6at the standard FS prices. ;) Slight negatives: When we checked in we were taken to a room that smelled strongly of mildew. They did quickly change our room, and said it was probably due to carpet cleaning that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dry well. But if they know this is a potential issue, one would have expected them to check it out before they put guests in that room. The main pool was kind of dirty and the tiling and fountain could use a good cleaning and repair here or there. That surprised me a bit, as I usually find FS properties to be immaculate. Needless to say, I never used that pool. The resort was pretty full, and you felt it. It was always a wait to get into breakfast, and we had trouble getting dinner reservations at times or places we wanted. As a recently frequent visitor to the FS chain, I felt a bit of a lack of acknowledgement. In contrast, when we stayed at the FS Dallas we were personally greeted by the resort manager and upgraded to a larger suite. On Maui I just felt like one of the masses\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and I never felt the service was anything other than normal. What I like about FS properties is that I find the service to be above and beyond normal. Maui disappointed on that regard.

Very nice common areas. Room was tired looking, old carpet, although spacious. Very comfortable beds. Duo breakfast buffet was excellent, every single day! Duo dinner was very good one evening and very poor another and quite expensive. At one dinner at Duo the service was very slow, but the restaurant was slow? We ordered the duck and really couldn't tell even what it was, at one point, we perhaps thought it was a tough steak. Pool is quite small. When we went to watch the moon set/sun rise at the beach, the cabanas all had already had books and sandals...at 5:30 a.m. We spent most of our time at the beach. The attendants at the beach did a great job. Two mornings had small muffins offered and a few days had water offered, hit or miss. No special treats; however, overlooking the pool service during lunch at Ferraro's (which was very good/good value) the pool service offered many more treats/water than the beach. Also, at the pool there were people who had cabanas that were also lounging in chairs, outside of the cabanas, and the pool is so small, there is not room for that. Check in was great as was the concerge. We took several trips to the Shops at Wailea via hotel transport, those drivers were very nice and very accommodating. There was a great paved path just off the beach that ran the length of the resorts as well as condos next door. Was lovely; however, be careful on the path (wide enough for 2) as there were joggers that were very obnoxious \"on your left\" \"on your right\" and even some of the older people on the path had a hard time keeping up with this. On Wed night there was a \"Manager's Reception\" that we attended. It was very nice. Only for an hour, could have been longer as many of the guests were talking and it was enjoyable. Some of the employee's of the resort were there, they were all very nice, making sure there were no pressing concerns. I would certainly say this resort is a couples resort.

It's with good reason that this resort is considered one of the finest in the world. The size is big enough to have every amenity imaginable yet small enough to retain a sense of intimacy and peacefulness. The resort is staffed with well-trained and friendly people in every corner and practically every interaction with a staff member was pleasant. The common areas are kept immaculately clean and the decor is contemporary, classy and beautifully maintained. The location is ideally suited for an island vacation; Four Seasons is elevated from the beach and set back from view of the neighboring (immense) Grand Wailea and condo rentals. Every typical Hawaiian activity can be had here: sunbathing, pool and ocean swimming, snorkeling and SCUBA diving, whale watching, kayaking, paddle-boarding etc. are all based on the resort premises and rentals easily charged to the room. The health club and spa are beautifully maintained and in the case of the former, at least one attendant was always present making sure the equipment is kept clean, water bottles are full and headphones are working. Additionally, the resort offers several complimentary activities during each day...check the schedule. There are two swimming pools, one is for adults-only and a small grotto with a waterfall. The resort offers one breakfast location (DUO) with a la carte or three levels of buffet dining with typical resort-hostage pricing. Lunch is served either at your pool/beach chairs or the ocean-view restaurant (Ferraro's) and plates are easily split for lighter dining. Light snacks and coffee are available at the beachside snack-bar, Snorkels. There is also a nice sized cocktail bar off of the main lobby that features music every night. There is a path that connects the Four Seasons to the other resorts and to the mall (about one mile walk). The resort access road has a cycling lane and sidewalk perfectly suited for jogging/walking. Lounge chairs can be claimed at 7am and 'protected' by the attendant for up to one hour. The Four Seasons does a very good job of this even on busier days. The attendants keep the towels fresh, water or drink glasses full and bring occasional treats like pineapple, mini-muffins, cucumber slices, cool towels and water throughout the day. The resort also provides three choices of sunscreen complimentary to its guests at various stations throughout the deck areas. My wife and I stayed in an ocean view suite which was amply sized, clean and regularly 'freshened up' by the staff during the day. Small tokens of appreciation (bookmarks, sunglass wipers, slippers) were left in the room by the staff...although there was no pillow mint with turndown service (haha). The air conditioner worked great and the sheets & towels smelled nearly as fresh as home. The room had a lanai with chairs and table offering a lovely view of the water just beyond the resort grounds and driveway...technically an 'ocean-view' to be sure. In short, the Four Seasons Wailea lives up to every expectation we had for the resort going in, yet..we were strangely not overwhelmed. I attribute this to a couple of factors: first, there were several company groups staying at the resort during our stay. Perhaps they required special attention of the staff. Second, I recently stayed at the Four Seasons Vail (Colorado) where the staff was so attentive and sincere I was truly overwhelmed. By comparison the staff in Maui seemed to be well-trained and hard-working. Finally, the Four Seasons charged approximately 35% more than the next most expensive hotel I priced (The Ritz at Kapalua) and nearly double the rate of the neighboring Fairmont. With that came perhaps an in-kind expectation of value. My final comments notwithstanding, we will return to the Four Seasons the next time we visit Maui. After all, nobody's perfect and I'm quite sure there is nothing even approaching the high standard set on Maui by the Four Seasons.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular.

Originally, we were going to book the Ritz-Carlton, but after reading reviews we found out that the Ritz is located in a rainy part of the island. So glad we listened- that is a well-known fact on the island! The Four Seasons rooms were comfortable, not the best I've stayed in but clean and comfortable. The staff was amazing, accommodating and friendly. The restaurants were magnificent- very good food. The concierge was super helpful. I participated in sunrise meditation and oceanside yoga- I highly recommend both. I received an outdoor massage- absolutely perfect.

My husband and I stayed 6 nights in Feb and it was glorious. I knew we had to stay there after watching the Modern Family episode. It all lived up to our high expectations and more. We went through what-a-hotel and got the free level upgrade, free buffet breakfast ($35 per person + gratuities), and a free $85 lunch at Ferraro's. I would definitely recommend that. We paid for the mountain side (parking lot view) room but got the garden view room as the upgrade. There wasn't much of a view as expected but we didn't spend much time in our room either. Room: Very spacious and the bathroom was even more so. Bed was very comfortable and there was also a sitting area and office space. I have stayed at some hotels in NYC where the rooms are smaller than the bathroom at Four Seasons. I enjoyed the L'Occitane bath products. We also liked that they also provided an after-sun lotion which is great after a day at the beach. Check-in: Quick and easy. We were greeted with pineapple, lemonade and a refreshing towel. We got leis upon entry and everyone was so genuinely friendly from the start. There were also small biscuits in the room waiting for us. The little things are truly appreciated. Grounds: Everything was immaculate. From the lobby to the tennis courts. From the pools to the beach. I don't see one leave out of place. Care is taken to keep this hotel in top notch shape. I normally try to stay at newer hotels but this property proved that an older hotel, when managed and kept properly, can be just as amazing. Service: They are soooo nice here. Frozen lemonade and pineapples and towels by the pool. Ice water is refilled every time you run a little low. When you leave your food at the buffet, your waiter will cover the food so that the birds do not get to it. Everyone greets you when they see you. We woke up early one morning to go Whale watching and we enjoyed the free coffee and baked goods at the front lobby. Lemonade stand was also appreciated mid day there. Valet: If they know you are going for a long trip, they provide you with bottles of water in the car. Another small yet nice gesture. When we left, they gave us goodbye jelly beans. Sweet. Pools: Various levels of sunscreen were provided by the pool which was appreciated. Whether you are at the infinity pool or the fountain pool, you will enjoy yourself. People wake up early to get spots at the infinity adult pool. We were there for 2 days but found the fountain pool just as good. We however did enjoy the swim up bar at the infinity pool. There aren't too many people there so things never got too rowdy. Beach: It was great that the cabanas were free. Other hotels charge $20 per day. Take advantage! We saw other families with babies got a crib from the hotel staff by the beach right beside their loungers. Perfect for families with small children. Wailea beach is beautiful. the sand is soft and reefs are nearby for snorkeling. We could always find chairs and if not, the staff could easily set one up for you. The view is spectacular and the beach area was easily accessible from the resort. Food: Duo breakfast was excellent. I loved the change up at the buffet so that you don't get bored. I really enjoyed the crepes and the pina colada waffles. The miso soup and dim sum also catered to the Asian palette. The daily free smoothie shot was amazing. Yum! Pool side, room service and Ferraro food were pretty much the same and expensive as expected. The food was OK but can get boring after a few days. Go out and eat at other locations to make it a little more exciting. We tried Tommy Bahamas (at Shops at Wailea) and had our reservations but it turned out much better than expected. We ate at Spago one night. Once again, very expensive but the food was excellent. We recommend the seafood red curry. It was a great setting with great service. The waiter really took care to give us his food recommendations and made the night enjoyable. Activities: There were plenty of activities like yoga and snorkeling to keep you busy at the resort. We also liked the activity centre with pool, table tennis and shuffle board when you just want to escape the sun for a little bit. The gym was well equipped and the open air cardio area was just another plus to the hotel. Shopping: I managed to find a few great deals at the shops at Four Seasons. A dress was 50% off so shopping can be done right on site. The local artists that were there every morning also provided venues for one-of-a-kind gifts and souvenirs. Lobby Bar: Live music and hula dancing were a great way to move to the evening and watch the sun set and fire lighting ceremony. Tip: Make booking the free outrigger program the first thing you do when you get to the hotel. The spots fill up quickly. I would even e-mail the hotel in advance to get a spot if possible. There were 3-4 sessions per weekday and each spot only allowed for 4 guests. It was a popular activity. The instructors were amazing and even did double duty as island tour guides telling you stories and history of the island. We got in at the 7:45AM spot and enjoyed the morning whale watching and sightseeing. One small negative was that we did have to pay for our wifi internet. We also stayed at Grand Wailea and Hana Kai on this trip and both of these locations had free wifi which in my mind should be standard. Location: The resort is a little far from Lahaina, which is where all the action is at. We had friends in that area and we thought we would see them more but we ended up just meeting them for dinner. We did spend one full day at Lahaina with them also but driving back at night was extremely tiring after a full day's of activities. At the end, we were sad to leave.

After a rough trip over from Tampa, complete with a flight change and 3 hour delay in Dallas, once we arrived at the Four Seasons, we immediately felt welcome and relaxed. They make a point to go the extra mile, remembering your name, making reservations and recommendations for you - basically catering to your every need before you have to ask. The adult's pool area is great, I only wish it was bigger because the chairs get filled up fast. But, there was always plenty of room at the main pool and the attendants would let us know when chairs became available at the adult's pool. It was also nice to receive complimentary snacks such as otter pops and jello, as well as cold towels as we lounged around the pool. We had a lot planned during our stay, since it was my husband's first time to Maui, and many of the guests don't leave the resort. I kind of wish we had spend more than two days at the resort itself and enjoyed all the amenities. The location of the hotel itself is in the most desired area of Maui and was about 20-45 mins to every adventure we planned. We went next door to the Grand Wailea for the spa, since it had so many great reviews (and it was amazing) but the hotel itself was way too overcrowded with lots and lots of children running around. We were torn between the Grand Wailea and the Four Seasons and after visiting the Grand Wailea, I knew we made the right choice. Spago at the Four Seasons was one of our favorite places for dinner and we had the breakfast buffet as well, which was also good. The bar food wasn't all that great and limited in selection while being overpriced. One of the things we really appreciated was the Aloha Suite on our way out. We took a red-eye flight home, so we checked out in the morning, spending the day at the pool and were able to shower and refresh before our 9 pm flight courtesy of this suite.

We stayed here 4 nights, followed by 3 nights at the Sheraton in Kaanapali, then 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt in the island of Kauai. This was our favorite stay between the 3. I think we paid $460 per night for the cheapest room option which ended up around $500 per night after tax. If you're looking for value in the traditional sense you're probably not looking here. That being said, there are a lot of perks and this is pretty much the best money can buy. Here are the bullet points: - We were upgraded to a corner suite garden view. It was peaceful on the terrace. I don't think there is value in paying for a view, it was pretty much irrelevent to our stay. - We received a free bottle of champagne for our honeymoon - The room was average for a 4-5 star place - The bathroom is incredible. Huge, all marble, radio for the shower, L'Occitane toilertries. - The whole place is open air. If there was a typhone the whole place would get wet! - Partly outdoor fitness center, a game room, not much shopping on site - The valet is awesome and really your only option. Free water, free towels, printed directions, etc. \"Free\" but gave $10 every time which I personally think is the floor at a place like this. - The lounge is $10-12 per drink with some light entertainment - There is a nice pool in the middle and an adult pool. You need to get up at like 8am to reserve a chair at the adult pool, otherwise they'll take your phone number and call you in 2-3 hours. - Free sun lotion and lemonade stand - The waiters bring you iced water cups even on the beach (free, like everything else) - The beach is really great. Very clean. Pretty quiet since there aren't too many kids at this hotel and its not a public beach. - Free chairs, towels, umbrellas, scuba gear, etc - employees on the beach to help you. The scuba is pretty good by the rocks to the left. We found it good if not better than the infamous black rock in Kaanapali. - The area isn't like Kaanapali by the way. It's more like a retirement community than a village. - We ate at Ferreros and Duo if I remember the names correctly. Both were good but not amazing. We had a comparable meal at the Ruth Chris Steakhouse. It's at the shopping plaza which is a 10-15 minute walk. The shopping plaza had a mix of cheap places and not so cheap places. - I played golf across the street at the blue course and it was ok but nothing special. Overall service was impeccable.

It was expensive, but well worth it. From the minute we arrived, we were treated like royalty, starting with a room upgrade and being called by our names in virtually every interaction we had with staff. There is no detail too small and nothing is overlooked, from the complimentary sunscreen around the pool and beach, to the complimentary iced tea in the lobby. We went with our 2 young children (5 and 7), and I was amazed at how family friendly this resort is. When we got to our room, there were sponges laid out in the bathroom in the shape of letters spelling our children's names, miniature bathrobes, a \"welcome\" cookie decorating set, and a \"welcome\" stuffed Hawaiin Nene bird for each child. We used Kids for All Seasons (the kids camp/daycare) just once for a few hours, but it's free and my kids loved it. It allowed my wife and I to use the spa at the same time (which was extreme serene) and the adults-only Sereneity pool, which wasn't as serene, but had amazing views. However, space is at a premium for lounge chairs at the Serenity pool - you have to get there early to secure a spot. Even if you can't, the Fountain pool is also wonderful and if you have kids, the kids pool is great too. My wife took advantage of the spa at others times and had two wonderful massages. Aside from spending a ton of time swimming at the pools and beach, we took advantage of the complimentary tennis, yoga and croquet. The games room was really fun, too! Not complimentary, but also fun, was having the resort pack us a picnic lunch that we took with us on an outing to a local state park. For dining, we ate at all three restaurants, and all were superb. In my opinion, Duo had the most interesting food, Ferraro's had the best views and Spago was the best overall experience. We celebrated my wife's birthday with dinners at Ferraro's (with the kids - all restaurants have a kids meno by the way) and Spago (without the kids). Both times, the resort, knowing we were celebrating, provided us with prime ocean view seats. In short, this was probably the best vacation we've been on, largely due to the staff and environment at the resort.

The \"Serenity Pool\" was not very serene, over-populated by party animals frolicking in the pool with their drinks, making a lot of raucous noise, and generally behaving like the sales reward winners they were. Too few chaises means you go on a \"waiting list\" for one. Really! But the view is sensational if you can ignore the rest.

From the moment we stepped out of the car we felt welcome and special. We mentioned we were going up to Haleakala the next morning for sunrise and the guy who greeted us said he would check the weather for us and informed us that they would supply extra blankets for our trip up there. We didn't even ask for it. Check it was a breeze and totally stress free. The room was GORGEOUS! Huge bathroom, double sinks, marble floor, seperate shower. Excellent welcome snack. Huge balcony with super comfy chairs. They thought of everything! The only complaint that I had was how they handle the chairs at their serenity pool. Apparently you have to get there at like 7am to get one and its sort of a stressful free for all. I didn't do that. I did notice that the chairs seem to open up a lot more in the early afternoon so if you really want one but don't want the stress, just get on the waiting list. I still say they should have a reservation system with a waitlist to fill in people who don't show or as people leave, but thats just my thought. As it turned out, it didn't really matter anyway. We discovered that if you can get a chair facing the ocean at the main pool, which is pretty easy to do in a cabana in late morning or early afternoon, that its just perfect. Sure theres a few kids around, but they're no more annoying than the LA d-bags at the serenity pool. The views are amazing from there as well and service of course is excellent. The restaurants are very very pricey...BIG TIME. I'm talking $90 for a steak pricey. Luckily theres a lot of great restaurants around in the area like the Monkeypod which is very cool and we loved the Kai Japanese Tapas place down the street as well. I have never stayed at such a great hotel in the US. A few in Thailand like the Oriental, Penninsula, etc, but never in the US and this one is amazing. Service is perfect, the rooms and hotel are amazing and the food is fantastic. Whatever you need, you will almost never hear no, they will try to find a way to take care of your needs. As a matter of fact, they do a great job of trying to anticipate your needs which is even better. Sure, it costs a little more, but its worth it, and that level of service and maintenance isn't cheap.

It really is a beautiful resort, with amazing staff and amenities. My husband and I spent 5 nights here on a 10 day trip to Hawaii (last 5 nights at the St. Regis Princeville in Kauai - do not stay there). Our entire trip was incredible from check in to check out, truly a five star experience. Everything here is thought of for you, the staff anticipates your needs and goes out of their way to make sure you are enjoying yourself. They do all of this with huge smiles and \"of course, no problem!\" statements and attitudes. Rooms: We had a club level room, and if you have the opportunity to book this category of room I would jump on it. The Concierge's are amazing, there is a breakfast spread that changes daily, afternoon tea and snacks, and appetizers in the evening. Probably the best value is that cocktails/wine/beer/soda/water are also included. The rooms are beautiful and spacious, very nice bedding, and the bathrooms are to die for. There is plenty of counter space, a double sink and separate tub and shower. The shower is awesome, great shower heads, water pressure and bath products. Housekeeping is also qucik, attentive and curtious, they leave no detail undone. I left my sunglasses out on the table one night when turndown had come in, they not only cleaned them for me, but laid them nicely on a glass cleaning cloth. Now that is service! Personal note on Concierge service - I wasn't feeling well one night and my husband went to the club lounge to grab a snack, when Rowena (amazing amazing person) asked where I was, and he mentioned I wasn't feeling well she offered to come check on me, to keep me company, offered to get anything I wanted for supper (we went with chicken soup!). And it really was just genuine caring service, which was unbelievably appreciated :-) Food/Drink: All of the offerings in the club lounge were very good. We did spend a lot of time at the Serenity pool, enjoying cocktails and lunch daily. Cocktails at the pool were from $13 - $15, wine $16 - $22, beer $6 - $9. Everything we tried was delicious (Bloody Mary's, mixed cocktails and Mojitos). Food was awesome, large portions, and reasonably priced. We shared a spring roll appetizer and a turkey wrap with onion rings one day and it was a huge portion of food for about $35. Most appetizers are from $10-$20 and entrees and salads from $15- $35. Lobby Lounge: Again, very good appetizers and sushi. Cocktails/wine/beer same price as above, excellent popcorn shrimp appetizers and spicy tuna roll sushi. Spago: Food here was excellent, great experience great servers, nice atmosphere. Definitely make reservations! Dinner can get pricey but it is well worth it! Resort Amenities: Here is where the true value of the Four Seasons Wailea shines through. Morning Yoga on the beach - included and a great program! Coffee in the lobby available for guests, sunscreen available at the pools/beach, all sunchairs have a nice cushion on them so they are very comfortable, snacks at the pools, (pineapple, ice pops, mini muffins,etc) Outrigger canoe (make reservations early for this, and just to note it does not run on weekends), snorkel equipment available for 1 hour a day. Scuba shop on site to rent all kinds of water sport stuff, we rented a kayak for an hour for $40 and were able to see fish, coral, and sea turtles! Finally, the Serenity pool a truly Heavenly experience! We traveled between 1/5/12 and 1/9/12, we arrived at the pool around 7am to reserve a seat, usually only a few people were in line, and we always got a great spot! There are probably about 50 chairs so it fills up quick, but we had no problem on any day we chose to go. The pool itself it beautiful, and the staff is very friendly and attentive, always filling up water glasses and coming around to see if you needed anything without being pushy or intrusive. Overall this was a truly amazing experience, and if you are going or planning on going, you will, without a doubt, find every need or want taken care of long before you need to ask anyone. This is a relaxing, happy, easy-going place to be, and you will probably want to pack up the entire staff and take them home with you at the end of your stay, they really are that amazing!

You see the ocean as soon as you step into the beautiful lobby. The check-in was smooth and they had a little treat for my 9 month old. But that was only the begninning! We were upgraded to an ocean view room and once we got to our room, we were amazed at all the personal touches. They had treats for my husband and I, and plenty of personalized toys (with her name written out) for my daughter. I have never heard of or been to another hotel/resort that does that. It was really special. The room was immaculate! Spacious, clean and well decorated. Our view was of course amazing! And every morning, I saw a variety of different birds from my balcony. As a birder, this was awesome as I didn't even have to leave the room to do some birding. The pools were amazing, especially the Serenity Pool. When you first see the view from that pool you are just blown away. It couldn't be more perfect. We traveled on three of the five days we were there and the valet guys were always so helpful and informative on how to get to places plus provided us with good tips on where to eat and what to do. Yes I did say Valet and not concierge. We knew what we wanted to do so we didn't really go to the concierge desk but just chatting with the valet guys while they got our car was so helpful. All of the staff was always smiling and we always got an \"Aloha!\" from all of them everywhere on the resort. There is a shopping mall about 10 minutes away (walking) from the resort which is wonderful. They have a great gift shop there which is very affordable for all you knickknacks and souvenirs. We ended up eating breakfast at one of the restuarants in the mall, I think it was called Blue cheeseburger but I'm not sure. We all got the breakfast special which was delish! Hint:Take the shortcut by passing thru the Grand Wailea Resort next door. Plus you get to see their grounds, which are beautiful, but you can compare and tell that you are staying at the best resort at the Four Seasons. Make sure to take advantage of the complimentary snorkeling. We ended up doing this the last day we were there and I regret not doing it more often. The fish are amazing and my husband saw two sea turtles!Yes i despise him a little because I did not get to see them. I'm sure if we went more than once, I would've seen them. The entire snorkeling trip takes less than two hours and is a great workout. Again, I wish we had done it earlier and more frequently during our stay. There is a garden pathway to the left of the resort. This is the pathway you want to be on while the sun is setting over the ocean. You can't really see the sunset from the lobby as we found out. So if you want to take pictures of the sunset, this is the place to be. Or even if you don't, this pathway is beautiful and a nice place for a relaxing walk in the evening.

We had a fabulous time and will definitely book this trip again next year. Overall, if you have researched this property, everything you have read is probably true. There are many wonderful features, and \"value added\" reasons to book your stay at the Four Seasons. My husband and I stayed on the club level and it was definitely well worth the extra investment. While the food on this level wasn't exactly gourmet, it wasn't bad either. Some items being much better than others. Dining in Maui is expensive and we found great value in the club level. The alcohol selection on club level is top notch though. Only high end liquor and wine available. We dined at the pool on once occasion and thought the food was very good. (Nachos about $25, pina colada $16) We ate at Duo for breakfast and dinner and loved it both times. The breakfast bar is $35 per person, but the pancakes with warm coconut syrup and macadamia nuts are to die for and worth trying. I won't forget those for a LONG TIME. We ate at Ferraro's twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. We found it to be better for dinner. Unfortunately, other than pool food, Ferraro's is the only restaurant open for lunch. While vacationing, I was able to borrow a kindle (at no charge) from the concierge and read several books during my stay! The fitness center is more than adequate for any fitness enthusiast. They have many fitness group classes to choose from. I took part in the spin class and it was a killer! I want to touch on the serenity pool while I'm on this subject, because this is a hot item at the resort. If you are travelling without children, then you will definitely be sucked into the serenity pool \"quicksand\" once you get there. The serenity pool is beautiful, no doubt. It literally looks like a postcard. Unfortunately, this little slice of paradise only accomodates about 75 people. Expect to wait in line at at least 6:30 am, yes, 6:30am, (They start seating at 7am) to get a good spot at this coveted pool. There is nothing anyone can do to help you get a spot- everyone waits in line. You can leave your seats for an hour at a time. I had a few issues with the serenity pool, one being that the sun isn't even out until at least 9-9:30am, and since it's shade, it's cold! Remember that you get your seat at 7am, but there's no service in this area until they open the bar until 10-10:30am (I can't remember exactly which.) So basically, they force you to \"protect\" your spot, with no service, while it's still cool and there's no sun. They also do not allow you to talk on your cell phone in the serenity pool area. If you rent a cabana, you can blab away as loud as you want too. But if you are in the chairs around the pool, they will discreetly and politely tell you it is not allowed. Don't forget to turn your ringer on silent- they will hear it. The housekeeping service was twice a day and excellent.

Shame because it was a good place to get a steak and the breakfast buffet is served there. They switched the buffet to Spago which provided nice views, but buffett was smaller. Other than that they were doing some general maintenance in our hallway and on grounds which is my only real complaint since I have never been there when they were doing this kind of maintenance. I usually go in September and it is a little warmer and sunnier than when we just went in November, but we all had a great time and you get what you pay for. The spa was wonderful as usual and we had great meals at resort and at shoppes of Wailea. A couple of tips: The lounge is a nice place to hang out and they have a dinner menu. Get there 30mins before sunset and get a good seat for their sunset entertainment. Secondly Ferraros is an awesome restaurant especially for dinner. Try and get as close a seat to ocean as possible and 20-30 mins before sunset for a beautiful sunset dinner. As is gets darker their live music kicks in and the night sky is awesome. Oh one more tip. If you plan on doing some activities get to the concierge in the first day or two to review and get reservations for activities that way you are not waiting till the last day or two to try and do something.

The infant was cared for from the start, from the little baby care products in the bathroom, the crib in the room, already setup when we checked in, to the complimentary playpens by the cabana, or the pool loungers. The teenager got the boogie board from the hotel shop and spent the holiday chasing waves.

After agonizing over the best hotel to stay in Wailea I think this may be it. The beach front and terraced areas that have umbrellas and covered cabanas are amazing. I didn't see this in any other hotel I surveyed in Wailea-- from almost any vantage you have sweeping views of ocean! The pools are great. For kids, there aren't the big kid play areas like other places (which was good for me, as I was looking for serene, quiet). The adult serenity pool was very nice, with a swim up bar. I will note however, to secure a nice beach spot on one of the prime terraced umbrellas/cabanas you have to get up at the crack of dawn and reserve at 7am-- and it can be a bit competitive. The service was overall pretty good but perhaps not fantastic. I hesitate to put this here, but I did fine urine splashed on the wall in the bathroom (reminiscent of my stay at some horrible roadside hotel many years ago). I cleaned it off with a washcloth, and then had some elses gross urine stained washcloth in my 5 star hotel bathroom. I did tell concierge and they were nice about it, I guess. The other downside is that the menus cater to the American mean-- that is, the food is \"pretty good\", but certainly not catering to the vegetarian-quinoa-organic set, and overall, not a lot of healthy menu options. These small inconveniences were offset by all the other perks, including the fact we were upgraded from a garden view to an ocean view at no additional cost.

The hotel is beautiful and is located right on Wailea Beach, one of our favourite beaches in the world.

The staff goes out of their way to be helpful and really make you feel at home. And the list of complimentary activities is endless: yoga on the beach, pilates, aerobics classes, tennis camps, and the traditional Hawaiian Outrigger Canoe Program (which was so much fun). If you have kids, the camps are also complimentary. The rooms are very spacious and impeccably clean, with maid service twice daily. The on site restaurants are amazing, especially Ferraro's, and are destinations in and of themselves, so make your reservations early. I suffer from severe food allergies so restaurant dining can be an ordeal for me, but the staff went above and beyond to make sure that I was not only comfortable, but thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience.

I am not against these folks making $$ or changing things in an economic crisis, but somehow I hate having to pay extra when I get there.

There's no great secret to operating a hotel, but it takes a remarkable amount of effort, management and customer focus to make it look this effortless :) Rooms were excellent, well kept and clean. Beds were comfortable with the soft pillows I like. With kids we had an interconnecting room which worked well. On arrival we had all our three kids names spelt out in bath sponge letters in their bathroom. Very cute and a nice touch. The hotel is extremely well kept and maintained. The facilities are first rate. During the day we pretty much roamed between the Cabana's surrounding the main pool, or on the beach where the staff are only too happy to either pitch an umbrella or beachside cabana. Great restaurants including Spago's for fine dining or Ferraro's for a little more \"casual\" dining. Mind you the view is simply amazing and there's nothing casual about the service, the food nor the location, it's just what the people wear :) It's things like \"complimentary hotel car\".

This was our 3rd visit to Maui Four Seasons and again it was fabulous. We were upgraded to a partial ocean room and were amazed with the views from our lani. In past visits we have stayed in mountain and garden view rooms. To me an inner courtyard room either garden or partial ocean view made for a more relaxing visit. We spent most of our time on the beach. It is an exceptionally beautiful beach with crystal clear blue water. To me it seemed that the service at the beach was more personable then that at the serenity pool. I also found the beach far more interesting than the pool [saw whales from the beach]. When we visited FS in 2010 housekeeping was inconsistent with some days our room not being serviced until after 4pm. This trip our room was serviced in the mornings or early afternoon, while we were at the beach. 99% of the staff went beyond expectations in anticipating our needs and attentiveness to needs. The only negative I experienced came from Spago's [and I think that Spago's is managed separate from the hotel]...okay, that explains the \"attitude\" at Spago's. We ate at Ferraros one night, good service however, the food is average at best. We ended most evening having cocktails in the lobby lounge listening to the live music and found this very enjoyable. Duo's was closed during our stay so no comment on that restaurant this stay.

Upon check in, we were greeted with Leis and warm towels, and a little cup refreshing mint tea. We were upgraded upon check in to a wonderful room overlooking the back of the hotel and the ocean. This was the perfect area of the hotel to stay since we had wonderful views of the Maui sunset. I posted a picture of the last sunset of our stay. The hotel, grounds and room were immaculate. The space is large, and airy. Open and comfortable. It's never overdone or uptight. There is amazing Hawaiian art all over the resort. The flowers are beautiful, as is all of the other spaces of the hotel. The bed was very comfortable. My favorite touch was the pre-set radio stations in the bathroom. I always set ours to Hawaiian music. The bathrooms are huge, well appointed and also immaculate. We sat in all areas of the resort including at the beach (more on this later) the fountain pool, the lawn overlooking the beach and the serenity pool area. Service was attentive and fantastic. Drinks were wonderful as was the Mai Tai in the pineapple! Food served at the pool was great. Yes, the serenity pool is crowded and you will often not be able to get a seat here. Put your name on the wait list first thing in the morning after breakfast. This was not a big deal for us since we preferred sitting by the pool or overlooking the beach. Overall, service was fantastic, and everyone greeted us by name. We needed a shuttle to run to a dinner reservation (because DUO was closed) in Wailea and were taken in a very nice late model Cadillac with wonderful service. We ate at Spago, Ferraro's, the Lobby lounge, the pool and had room service. Ferraro's was our favorite. We had a wonderful server who was Italian and had a nice chat with him about Italy. We loved sitting in the lobby lounge drinking wonderful Mai Tais, watching the hula dancer and listening to music. I had a neck and shoulder massage by the pool which was amazing. The staff is very attentive and came around with cucumber slices, cool towels, Evian spritzer and little treats. This was our favorite part of the stay...sitting on the lawn overlooking the beach reading and enjoying the service. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 got a mani-pedi. When she accidentally chipped off the nail polish, they fixed it for free. We took the outrigger canoe class on Friday and that was fun. Great to be out on the water and get a different perspective of the island. All in all, If you are looking for the perfect blend of relaxed, but attentive service, with a nice sense of being in Hawaii, this is the perfect place. Now for the two slightly less than awesome aspects which is saying a lot because basically everything in this resort is wonderful and excedes expectation. Everyone who works here should be proud. DUO was closed for repairs which meant that the breakfast buffet had to be held upstairs at Spago which made for a less than an ideal set-up. Some of the buffet foods were cold and the space was often a little messy and crowded. Also, we weren't told of DUO being closed until check-in (don't think there is anything on the website alerting people? Or maybe I missed it.) However, since we booked through American Express we had breakfast credits, so we just went with the flow. The second issue was the beach staff. Every morning I came down in hopes to snorkel but was told that the conditions were too rough. I explained that I was an excellent swimmer and would be happy to rent the equipment and sign a waiver. With that said, the conditions often did get rough towards the evening. During the day, however, the conditions were quite calm and I saw everyone else at other resorts along the beach snorkeling. I'm not sure what the conditions needed to be to allow snorkeling? It's an ocean. Not a pool. Adding to the frustration might have been a bit of a gruff attitude of the employees. Contrasted against the perfect services elsewhere in the resort I noticed it here more. Also, the service down at beach wasn't the same as the rest of the resort. Here again, a bit of gruff service. I wanted to ask about the beach activities (boogie boards, kayaks, etc.) but didn't feel very welcome. The staff huddled around the umbrella stand at the back of the beach and seemed to reluctantly come out to help set up a chair. Specifically, I very politely asked one of the employees to please help me out and keep an eye on our bag (which was under our chair, it wasn't as if I was asking him to personally hold it for me) for 20-30 minutes while we took the outrigger canoe course. This is a public beach, and I don't think I was asking for anything that outrageous. It was early in the morning and not that many Four Season guests were on the beach yet. In hindsight, probably should have run the bag up to the room and avoided asking which resulted in a snippy response about how safe the beach was and how that wasn't his job. I explained that I wasn't going to hold him accountable, just needed a hand since we didn't plan well and left valuables in the bag at the chair. Finally, the water trampoline was not in the water. Perhaps a small thing, but together with the other issues at the beach, we felt a little let down with the beach services overall. I would suggest if you really want to take part in beach activities (besides sitting on a lounge chair) you should book specific activities through the concierge. Overall, an incredible experience and we are looking forward to returning and staying at other Four Season's resorts around the globe.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cFantastic experience\u201d", "Author": "Michelle T", "ReviewID": "UR121248758", "Content": "Very kid friendly and pampering experience for the entire family.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermont", "Title": "\u201cA slice of heaven here on earth....\u201d", "Author": "iluvsophia", "ReviewID": "UR121241842", "Content": "I ended a two week stay on Maui with 3 nights at the Four Seasons to celebrate my fiance's 50th birthday.

If we would have had to pay for it though, I'm not sure it would have been that awesome. Don't get me wrong, there was not one thing I can think of to complain about. It's just that for the price you pay, I guess I would expect exceptional service, food, accomodations, etc. My husband and I both agreed that it was a vacation of a lifetime since we could never bring ourselves to spend that type of money and come back. Guess it's all relative to how much money you have and where your priorities lie. We were on the club floor and took use of the free food and beverages in the club lounge. Everyone there was so nice and helpful, always greeting us by our names. We couldn't figure out how they were so quick to appear when you entered the room until they showed us tthe hidden motion sensor. The breakfast food and snacks and desserts thru out the day were amazing and always very good. Some things were almost too pretty to eat. Service at the pool was also amazing. They were constantly filling up your water and asking if you needed anything from the bar. We enjoyed talking to the staff and hearing how they ended up in Maui. We took advantage of the free canoe trip they offer from the beach. Be sure to sign up for this right away since the timeslots fill up fast. It is only a half hour and you don't need to be in great shape to do it. There is a lot of rest stops where the tour guide stops to talk. We also took advantage of the free snorkel gear. Not much to look at compared to the catamaran snorkel tours we have done in the past. We regret not booking one this time. Hotel room was really nice. We were joking that there must be cameras in the room because it seems everytime you leave, your dirty towels get replaced with clean ones. The main area of the room was pretty basic but the bathroom was amazing. It was huge and fully stocked with lotions, soaps, shampoo, conditioner, etc. We ate at the 2 of the restautrants (Duos and Ferraros). Both were really good but then again, when you are paying $50 or more for an entree, would you expect less? Overall the property is well maintained and very pretty. Unlike other resorts, they are very detail oriented and try to make your stay as wonderful as possible.

The pools, rooms and restaurants are all first rate as one would expect from this chain. In addition, I went for a couple of scuba dives with the on-site dive shop and both were excellent. I received just the right amount of guidance after explaining it had been a few years since my last dive. Generally speaking my stay there was as great as I expected it to be. With that said, there were a few disappointments. If you have stayed in a smaller Four Seasons before, understand that this is a massive property and as such it seems impossible for them to be quite as attentive. Another casualty of the sheer size of the place is the serenity pool. This pool, similar to their other resorts, is wonderful and definite step up from the larger family pool if you don't have kids. Unfortunately it became a stress point for my girlfriend and I as everyday became a race to get down to the pool in the morning to reserve a chair before it filled up. If we were later than 10 - 11am, we were put on a waiting list and were forced to sit at the bar and watch the attendant expectantly for our turn in the que for a seat - a process that sometimes took hours. Even more frustrating, there was no process for advance reservations. My suggestion to them is to provide advance notice to guests of the popularity of the serenity pool at check-in and offer a reservation system of some sort so other plans can be made on days when the pool is exceptionally busy. A couple of other small issues: We had some tiny bugs crawling around our room. They weren't bed bugs and were harmless but nonetheless we noticed the hotel sent a memo around indicating to guests that some sort of insect spraying was under way. Also the beds are unusually soft - if you like a firm mattress you may not sleep as well - I didn't.

First a few negatives. Price - it is expensive and there is no way around that. Our expectations - the reviews on Trip Advisor are almost universal in that the resort caters to your every need, and for the most part that is create, however, there was some inconsistent service at the pool area. Again, for the most part the service at the pool was great but we had one bad experience in the middle of the trip in which the service fell below our expectations. We had a garden view suite and the view from lanai was as advertised but also included annoying noise from delivery trucks. Also, the house cleaning service on the whole was good, a couple of days it fell below expectations (however, I have chalked this up to us having an infant who was napping in the afternoons and we had to turn away the maids and also the resort did send someone by asking our thoughts and I said everything was great, as such I give the resort a pass on this). Now the great - location, we have always stayed at the Ritz in Kapalua, Wailea and the Four Seasons is a much better location. The beach and beach service is absolutely great. The overall staff is top notch and very friendly, again we had a infant who could be loud and the staff loved him. The grounds are perfect and spotless. The resort was busy but never had a real busy feel as there was always a beach chair or pool chair avaiable. Room service was the best I have ever had and on the whole the restaurants were top notch.

The purpose of our trip was a baby moon, so we were not super active. We paid about $400 / night in the end for our trip, including the 5th night free discount. We signed up using Whatahotel, a Four Seasons partner, and as a result got a free breakfast every morning. We did not get a room upgrade due to lack of availability. Pros: 1.) Room service twice a day - very useful at the beach 2.) Fabulous free breakfast. We LOVED the breakfast and looked forward to it every morning 3.) Various free classes onsite. I took the water aerobics class at the beautiful outdoor pool several times during our trip. 4.) Large, spacious rooms. 5.) Free, covered cabanas at the main pool 6.) Uniformly friendly, helpful staff. We particularly loved the servers at breakfast. 7.) Beautiful, uncrowded beach with places to sit and umbrellas for Four Seasons guests Cons 1.) Cost, cost, cost. We could have had a wide open ocean view for the same amount of money elsewhere. Hard to say if it was worth it. 2.) Room service came rather late most days. 3.) Lunch options at the resort were all $20 or more - absolutely no options for less than $20 per person (including food only, not any kind of drink). Drinks were obviously very expensive , too. As a result, we ended up going to Safeway and making ourselves sandwiches. $60 or $70 / days for lunch was just more than we felt like spending (including drink, tip, etc.) 4.) Dinner options also overpriced, so if you don't have tons of money, you'll end up driving most nights for dinner. 5.) Rooms, while very nice, were a bit old - you can tell the place has not been renovated lately. 6.) The Serenity Pool is famous, but it's always packed. You have to get on a waiting list to use it, after which you may wait a couple hours or more (they'll call you) only to get a seat w/o an ocean view. Their main pool is very nice, but the Serenity Pool is overrated. Overall, we loved it. We are borderline on being able to afford it, and it definitely wouldn't be an annual trip for us. We did stop next door at the Grand Wailea, and it's clearly not nearly as nice as the Four Seasons.

While the hotel has been renovated and the rooms do not lack anything at all, the building is not a modern one. The service however is superb: the people at the Concierge desk are simply incredible and make everything easier for guests. The other staff is also incredible: Mr. Amante was just amazing while Brandon Clark was always courteous and helpful. One detail that was just beyond expectations is that there is a courtesy suite for people who have already checked out but whose plane will leave later on the day: you can take a shower and relax at the courtesy suite before your plane leaves. This is something unique and made us feel really pampered. The food at the hotel is just OK. The breakfast buffet is acceptable but nothing extraordinary while dinner at the other hotel restaurants (Spago, Duo) is above average but nothing out of the ordinary, especially if you consider the high prices you are paying. Probably the thing that we liked less about the Four Seasons Wailea is the ambience. This hotel is targeted to a mature and upscale clientele (50 years and older) and it shows. The ambience is very quiet: for instance, the last seating at the restaurants takes place at 9 30 pm so the hotel is practically dead after 11 pm (and you can say the same of all Wailea). Further, guests seem to be more comfortable at the pool than at the beach so the beach service is not as good as the one you get at the pool: no food or drinks and the beach chairs are not as comfortable as the pool chairs. The beach however is really nice. It is really sad that guests just don\u00c2\u00b4t appreciate the beach. If you want to lie around a pool you can do that in NY city! If you want a more active vacation you can rent a car and go outside of Wailea. Either you can drive to Hana or go to Makena beach which is just 10 minutes away and it is the closest thing to a Caribbean beach that you will find in Maui.

This is the case today as I write my review on our recent stay at the FS Maul. Don't get me wrong. We think that the place is FANTASTIC and will be back again as soon as possible. The reason that I suggest that I am giving a them a slight pass with a five star excellent rating is that we stayed during slow season. I think that the few minor staff issues were a result of the hotels low occupancy numbers and the hotel stretching their employees a bit to save some money. Overall the property is in excellent condition. It is hard to believe that this property is 20+ years old as the design, finishes, and architectural style is still competitive or better than most hotels being put up today. It is well thought out and the rooms and bathrooms are done to perfection. We were upgraded to a very large one bedroom suite (#451) that faced the ocean and had a walkout terrace for our daughter to play. It was an excellent choice. The check in and front desk staff are excellent and made us feel so welcome. Chris at the lobby bar was also excellent at making guests feel welcome. Even when he was very busy he was able to meet each guests needs and make them feel special. The breakfast staff at the DUO buffet were at times slow and not up to the normal FS standard. On multiple days we had to track someone down to get drinks, clear plates, or ask for our bill. It was not their normal behavior. The housekeeping service was not timely. One of the housekeepers explained that during slow season they had \"many more rooms\" to attend to each day. It was apparent in timing but not in quality. They did an excellent job! During the day we were not getting service before 3 or 4pm. On two nights we were back from dinner before turndown service had been performed. This is not a huge issue but unfortunately our daughter woke up when they came to bring fresh towels one night. Anyone with kids will tell you that was a bit annoying. We realized that it was our fault for not putting out their special \"hush\" sign so that they would know to knock softly. That special baby sleeping sign is truly a FS touch! Finally the pool staff was also a bit stretched. Overall they were excellent however at times it was hard to get another drink. Many people had to flag them down to set up cabanas or get fresh towels. The best way I can describe it was that they were in a reactive mode instead of a proactive mode. Perhaps it was because we spent most of our time in the kiddie pool area. Since my last stay the addition of the adult only serenity pool was an awesome touch! Overall I highly recommend this hotel.

The same treatment appears to happen at the pools, but we were too enamored with the beach to hang out at the pools. There is no alcohol allowed on the beach and no food service, so we did lunch by the pool. I highly recommend the fish and chips and the blueberry mojito!

Everything about this hotel was amazing. At check in, we asked if any complimentary honeymoon upgrades were available, and not only were we offered a partial ocean view room, but the front desk representative showed us the room we were initially scheduled to be in as well as the proposed new one to allow us to select the room we preferred. At that moment I knew that the Four Seasons in Maui would live up to all the other fabulous reviews here. The room was breathtaking - very spacious, and the bathroom - WOW! The pictures are online, but it had every amenity imaginable, including L'occitaine \"after sun\" lotion, which helped my skin stay moisturized after long days in the sun. The hotel also leaves a great beach bag in your room for you to use during your stay for no cost. Like many other reviewers, we loved the serenity pool. You should plan to get there early to get a good seat (7 a.m. when it opens). You can leave your stuff there for an hour to grab breakfast at Duo, which is amazing. I loved the full buffet, and the service was (once again) amazing. At the serenity pool, the great service continues. I don't think I ran out of ice water once, and any time I wanted food, the pool assistants were there with a menu. One day I said we did not want to eat at the pool because I wanted something from Ferraro's (a restaurant at the resort), and I was immediately told they could order it for me and have it delivered to the serenity pool!!?!? Yes, they are that amazing. Then, around 9 a.m. they come around with these pastry bites for a snack (complimentary), around 11 a.m. they come around with fresh pineapple (complimentary), in the early afternoon they come arond with cucumbers, cold towels, and evian sprtiz (complimentary), then around 3 p.m. they bring around Flavor-ice pops!!! (complimentary), then around 5 p.m. they bring around rice krispie treats drizzled with chocolated (complimentary), and finally, before the serenity pool closes at 7, they come around with little cups of aloe vera (you guessed it, complimentary). It was amazing. Also, no need to pack sunscreen because there is plenty of it in all SPFs near both pools. In the pool, the underwater music is so soothing as you float on your back, and my favorite was the \"french bubbler\" sections - about 6 inches of water that you could sit in while you read (well, that's what we did). The main pool was also great, and the complimentary amenities were offered there as well. Although, I would say the servers at the serenity pool were more attentive...perhaps because they had less guests to tend to. Every restaurant at the resort was amazing. The food, the service, and the ambiance. Ferraro's on the ocean is beautiful, and the food was great. Duo has a fresh seafood bar one or two nights during the week with king crab legs, lobster tail, oysters, etc. It was awesome. Spago was also superb, and if you're looking to save money at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, opt for the pre fixe 3-course menu (with or without wine pairings). It was excellent! The one feature that was the most impressive was the quality of service - never have we ever been treated so spectacularly on vacation. The way the hotel employees always said \"Aloha\" and the waiters at dinner knew what we did during the day was amazing. It was like they really cared that we were enjoying our honeymoon. Finally, one thing I did not see anyone else write about, which we thought was so great, were the backpack picnic lunches the Four Seasons prepared for us for the day we drove the Road to Hana. We opted for the \"Road to Hana\" picnic, and we had a salumi platter, roasted veggies, hummus, pita, cold fried chicken, maui chips, sparkling water, french bread, and cookies. All this was packed in these amazing cooler backpacks (no need to bring any other bag with you on the Road to Hana), with real silverware, cloth napkins, and...wait for it, a real tablecloth!! They are sold per person, I believe $35/person plus tax and service charge, and we got two. We both eat quite a bit, and we had many leftovers for the next day's lunch. You could definitely get one picnic backpack lunch and have enough for two. The Four Seasons exceeded our expectations (and we are very particular).

The price is higher than the average but it is worth it. We checked in around 1PM and greeted with lei's for my wife, daughter (age 4), and me. Our daughter also got a toy and we all were offered a small piece of pineapple and juice. Check in was quick and accurate and they took us to our room. Waiting for us was a nene goose and treats for our daughter. Our view(room 490) was towards Grand Wailea but we didnt mind since we usually spend very little time in the room. The decor wasnt modern hawaiian but the more traditional clean hawaiian style. Not over done, and less is more in this case. Room: Plenty of drawer space, huge bathroom, and large sized room to walk around. Bed was king size and moderately firm. Couch was also firm and comfortable. Plenty of water pressure and hot water came out quickly. Pool: Our trip began October 30th for 5 days and it was low season. There was plenty of cabanas and plenty of chairs available on the beach. Again this was low season but more importantly there was no indication of less staffing. We were quickly offered towel service for anywhere we wanted to sit and always ice water next to our chairs. They have complimentary sun block spf 8,15,30 and they smell very good. Maybe every few hours or so someone came around with treats (cherry jello, pineapple on bamboo sticks, etc.). There are 2 jazuzzi's both the same size holding about 8 people comfortably but more can fit. One is adults only since it was closer to the bar at Ferraro's. The water temperature I thought was very hot. My wife and daughter liked it but I coudnt stay in there when it was already 84F outside. Kids pool: Kids can swim anywhere but they have their own upper pool with a small slide, waterfalls, and a toddler area with water about 1 feet deep. Water was warm but not uncomfortable. Toys were already in the pool for kids. We brought our own floatation vest so cant comment on the ones hotel provides. Beach was nice with minimal waves, not enough to boogie board. Fairly calm but still need to keep an eye on kids. Once on the beach someone also got our chairs, umbrella, and table ready with towels and cant forget the ice water. Water is typical Hawaiian temperature, which is not cold and can just jump right in. Snorkeling is 1 hour complimentary and there was plenty to see about 50 yards off the beach in front of the hotel and the deth is about 20 feet. We noticed a lot of people from other hotels were using the Four Seasons area to go snorkeling. Ferraro's: We had dinner there once with no complaints. I had the braised beef gnoochi and our daughter had grilled cheese sandwhich. We had lunch there many times and its also the only place open for lunch. We tried many different item menu and were pleasantly surprised everytime. I actualy wish we stayed 5 more days just to try every lunch item. Duo: Breakfast: I had crab egg benedict and it was the best i had. I also enjoyed the granola parfait very much. Our daughter had the buffet and it was also very good. Dinner: We ate here everynight but one and it was also very good. We had the prix fix menu item twice and wish also had more time to try other items on the menu. I recommend everything. Thursday thru Sat. they have fresh seafood( i saw raw oysters, lobster, shrimp and others I cant remember), i think its all you can eat. Serenity pool: Didnt go but took a look and it seemed nice. Service: With out a doubt Four Seasons Wailea does a great job trying to anticipate your next move and needs. They seem to make it an art trying to be one step ahead of your thoughts to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Im not sure how they filter out staff with all the same qualities but that must be a trade secret. I left some stuff out so you will be pleasantly surprised when you stay there.

The beachside views were just amazing, the walk along the beach every morning was just breathtaking, they have a path that wraps around the ocean and each time you turn it is as if you are in a new paradise, yet no too strenuous that you must be in tip top shape. My favorite time was the rooftop couples only pool in which you have music underwater in the famous infinity pool seeming like you are about to immerse right into the magnificent ocean. This is a fabulous honeymoon spot as well as couple or family vacation. The children are entertained and they are not overwhelming to those that dont have children with them. The golf course, although i am not very good was perfect for my husband to play and me to join him for the day! I took magnificent photos of the course! The spa was lovely and the staff over the charts, especially at the times when they delivered to your chair fresh pineapple or other mouth watering treats. i loved pool/beach side dining for lunch with so many delicious options accented with a glass of wine!

The Four Seasons is well on its way to cultivating a loyal customer for life in him! It started with check in - lei welcome with a refreshing juice and pineapple slices for the three of us, plus a cool color-change nerf football for our son. Then as we got settled into our room, a knock on the door revealed a tray of treats, rubber ducky family and a stuffed Nene bird. The bathroom was kitted out with a kid-size robe and slippers, kids' toiletries and letter sponges that spelled out our son's name. It didn't end there for him with the gifts - the day before check out, he received a Maui hardcover kid's book, juice and cookies! The kid's swimming pool and rec room were amazing. Pool/beach toys were provided. My husband and I were still able to partake in our usual vacation activities of golf, tennis and spa treatments.

Our positive thoughts and experiences are: - nice, clean, airy feeling, amazing first impression from lobby of the ocean and resort -everybody at the reception really polite -hotel was quiet, in spite of the size and the non stop almost weddings taking place -Spago Restaurant was really accommodating of our child's food intolerances and well as taste buds. -beach very nice and nice snorkelling by the rocks -nice pool for adults and kids Negatives: -we asked for a room with no mold, we suffer from mold allergies as a family, and they gave us a beautiful, big, quiet room, with MOLD! An air purifier was stationed in the room, only in our room, as we learned later, for the precise purpose of cleaning the mold from the air. After 2 nights of mold, we had sores in our noses and my toddler son's eyes and nose were achy,my husband refused to sleep in the room and camped in the hallway on a chair until 3 am. The 3rd day we asked to be moved in another room, only by late afternoon did they find another room. They said the room did not have mold but was mildew that we sensed, not true, the sores in my nose were certain of what grew in the carpets of that room. At the reception they said that they cannot say the room has mold, because they would have to decommission the room and the hotel is full, cannot afford to do that! The manager, a young lady who dealt with our issue, gave is a much smaller room (albeit, she argued its the same size only different compartmenting, but its not true. It was missing a whole sitting area the other room had, and our toddler help getting bumps from the crib, and the 2 queen beds (we asked for 1 king!) in the small room.). The manager offered to pay for dinner one night for us for basically wasting our entire 3rd day moving, packing and unpacking, loosing my hair brush in the move and having to heal from the sores in our noses and respiratory systems! The matter closed. Our second bone of discontent was the fact that in spite of the fact that the hotel/ restaurants have a seemingly sympathetic take on food intolerance/ allergies, they are very inflexible. We asked for warm goats' milk for our son, they wasted 2 days and kept blaming each other for why they could not come up with it.Then they basically put it in the fridge of the room, and when we asked them how to warm it up, they provided a broken bottle warmer and 2 plastic bottles. We ended up warming it up in the sink, in a glass. At the restaurants, hit and miss again. We asked to sit down with the chef to come up with a meal plan for our 2.5 son, the chef finally did only to tell us to talk to the waiters each time. We did that, only to have a guy at one of the restaurants yell at me: \"what do you want ma'm?!\" when I asked for some lemon and another piece of fish! We asked to have food that was tasty for the toddler, only not to contain egg, wheat, cow's milk, coconut or orange. All other condiments and spices in the world were fine! They brought us the same thing over and over: steamed broccoli and carrots and when I asked for something like asparagus, the waiter yelled at us, then did a loud \"Grrrrr\" behind my back that embarrassed and startled me and went shouting and gesturing at the manager! The manager was nice and brought us the asparagus and lemon. At Duo, their other restaurant, we had to argue with the waiter for mashed potatoes that had no cream for the child. We said: can you just take a backed potato from the main manu (they have a children's menu) and put a little olive oil and salt and bring it along with meat? No, of course not, for that we have to call in the morning and ask for the chef to find a small potato, etc. In the end, if we pay $5 for it, of course they could find it! In the end, going to any of their restaurants was stressful and we tried to avoid them. We started to order room service, and upon talking to the rooms assistant manager, Chris I think was his name, he took it upon himself to help us and talked to Spago, the 3rd restaurant, made reservations for us and then and at Spago only, things were good. We got there and food was tasty, looked good, waiters were respectful and a little stressed by the thought that we may complain I think. We are not people who complain, we try to take as much as we can, that's why we put up with the moldy room for 2 nights, started to buy food outside resort, etc... Anyway, thanks Chris, for all the help. When it comes to ensuring our child is OK, it made a big difference to know he will finally eat... My last complaint is about the cleaning staff, hit and miss again in the second room we were given. They completely forgot to clean one day, they did not replenish anything until the last night, left garbage in the room at times, not very careful. thorough. My general impression of the hotel is that its a big institution rather than a romantic hotel. The many workers are well trained to be nice, they occasionally drop the ball and the managers are busy to fix the errors. It sa somewhat fake culture and I did not buy into it. The lack of flexibility and errors in EVERY department we encountered made us feel alienated and not very happy most of the time.

Every morning I walked down and got my Kona coffee and a few steps later I was back in the room relaxing on my deck. All day long the club had wonderful breakfast items, snacks, hors d'oeuvres, drinks, and from 5-7 they had alcoholic beverages. They also had a personal concierge there just for club floor guests. Highly recommend booking on that floor! Overall the service at this hotel can't be beat. The valets are wonderful. Pool staff works their tails off! The second you arrive at the pool you are greeted by someone who will put towels on your chair (including a nice fitted chair cover). Moments later someone else will pour you cold ice water and that water will be refilled all day without you ever even having to think that you wish you had more water. You will receive fruit, popsicles, cold washcloths all while just relaxing in your chair. Going in Oct was perfect because we could arrive at the pool anytime of day and have our choice of seats. I hear in the summer it's crowded with lots of kids. You can also choose to use the adult infinity pool but I found that more crowded and louder. The food in the hotel is wonderful. Ate at Spago and Duo and loved both. Lunch we always had poolside and it was great as well. If you go to Duo for breakfast it will be very expensive, but if you have to worry about price for things don't stay at the Four Seasons. One day instead of eating the continental breakfast in the club we had the buffet at Duo and yes it's about $35 per person but it's wonderful!!! Don't look at prices, just enjoy your experience here!! Another thing we loved was you are able to have spa services poolside. We had foot massages in a cabana after our Haleakala bike tour and it was the best massage I've ever had!! My husband used the gym and said it was small but very nice and clean.

I hadn't been to the resort in a while & wanted to end our trip with a bit of luxury. It didn't disappoint! While the rooms of course are dramatically smaller and more expensive than the Honua Kai, it's that service & attention to detail that make this place so special.

From the moment we arrived, the kids had special things waiting for them in our room (stuffed animal, mini-robes to use, treats, their names spelled out in sponge cutouts, special bath products). We had some little treats too for us. While the pool wasn't really anything special for the kids (a very baby slide, kind of boring pool stuff for my 9 & 7-year olds), they had the kids club, which they absolutely loved and were always begging us to take them to, as well as a game room with pool tables, ping pong, table shuffle board and several video game consoles. There is also a really nice beach in front of the resort (although it got VERY windy in the afternoon), as well as locals who for a fee will let your kids go on an on-ocean trampoline. I also really love their massages there. I always get the massages in the Hale/oceanside, they are really amazing, so relaxing to be right next to the ocean, and I've never had a bad therapist. Every time we left the valets gave us cold bottled water, and when we checked out, they gave us water and little treats for the kids. Be prepared to spend a lot poolside if you eat there, but as always, really great service. I went to check out the \"Serenity Pool\", which is their newer adults only pool. I'd say calling it the Serenity Pool is a bit of a mis-direct. It was very rowdy and loud, it was like a Vegas pool-scene for middle-aged folks. The big pool down below was WAY more tranquil and relaxing. There aren't many chairs available either at the Serenity Pool, although they have cabanas available to rent for almost the price of their cheapest rooms. Only 4 bad things the entire stay: 1) our friends in another room found a roach in their room. Yes, they have big roaches in Hawaii, and I guess sometimes they end up in the room somehow. Still, eww. 2) the first night, we had to call to have turndown service. For some reason they'd forgotten and we had a pullout bed for the kids, for which we needed linens, kind of unusual for their service (you get to expect a lot from them!) 3) when we checked out, we had a ton of luggage with the other family and it all got scattered between the 2 cars. However, when we got to the airport, I realized we were missing a small carryon bag. After realizing that it was unlikely it got taken at the airport, I called the Four Seasons. They said they'd check & call back. About 10 minutes later, they called to say they'd found it thankfully, and that they'd be driving it to the airport. I am very thankful that that happened not only at a resort closer to the airport (than Lahaina) but also that it was the Four Seasons because they did the right thing taking it out to us. 4) No free wi-fi??? Really??? I would think this would be standard now at almost all hotels, especially high-end hotels. (I mean, Honua Kai had it!) I think this is a really lame thing for them to charge for, especially when they are otherwise really good at not nickeling & dime-ing people there (no charge for game room or kids club, for example). But wifi? They include wifi at the Serenity Pool cabanas. I just think that is very odd on their part. But despite the negatives, I do love this resort, the whole place smells amazing like a spa, it's relaxing from the moment you arrive, and you just cannot beat the service (3 o'clock otter pops!) We'll definitely be back someday!", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel ever!\u201d", "Author": "Sharon B", "ReviewID": "UR119554710", "Content": "Open air lobby, excellent service, breathtaking views, outstanding restaurants....what more do you need?", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPure Bliss\u201d", "Author": "ALJeff", "ReviewID": "UR119526228", "Content": "My husband and I spent our second half of our Maui trip at the Four Seasons Wailea. We just arrived back home yesterday, and \"cried\" as we drove away from the Four Seasons. We ddin't want to go home. All I can say is, why didn't we spend the entire trip at the Four Seasons? As soon as you pull into the circle drive, you are greeted by a number of friendly faces. I originally booked a Garden View room, but we were upgraded to a Partial Ocean View room. What a wonderful surprise!! Our room was not ready but we were already dressed for the beach. The front desk told us to not worry about anything but to enjoy their facilities. As soon as we walked onto the beach, Sam set up 2 beach chairs, a table and an umbrella. He set it up in less than 5 minutes and said if we needed anything, to ask them for help. After all, we were on vacation. Everywhere we went, all the employees were smiling and greeted us with an \"Aloha.\" After spending most of the day on the beach, we checked-in and our bags beat us to the room. O.M.G. Amazing. The entire hotel room and bathroom is 100 times more massive than our master bedroom and bathroom at home. And you could smell how clean the suite really was compared to an ordinary hotel. Just like everybody said, it was home. The truly amazing thing was that the housekeeping did an amazing job cleaning up our room. We had wedding cake and rose petals everywhere, and you couldn't tell if there was a mess earlier. She even cleaned my husband's jeans that had sand all over legs, after our 1st anniversary photo shoot. The L'Occitane products were a pleasant bonus for us. When we went out to Mama's Fish House for our anniversary dinner, the valet called the restaurant to inform them of our upcoming arrival. We didn't have to inform them that we were running late, but the valet took it upon themselves to inform the restaurant. Again, something you would not expect. The canoe program was a pure blast. Not only did we get a fantastic workout, but we saw tons of green sea turtles. One actually swam under me and came out. No way you could see these gracious creatures unless you snorkel out there. My husband did snorkel out in the cove and saw a lot of sea turtles and eel. This is the cove next to the Grand Wailea. We ate at Duo and Ferraro's which were both great. We had the Wailea Buffet at Duo since we weren't craving a heavy breakfast. Quite pricey for pastries and fruit ($30). We ate at Ferraro's for lunch. We decided take out since eating lunch on the beach was a nice way to depart our stay. The serenity pool was awesome. The water in the pool and spa were at the perfect temperature. But the best part of the pool? The amazing view. We didn't have any issues with getting 2 lounge chairs since this is their low-season. However, there was still a crowd at the pool. Although our 3 nights went by so quickly, we will be returning in the near future. Hopefully for every anniversary and any other holiday.

My 3 year old son was excited to get so much toy delivered to our room. We spent the days lounging by the pool and the beach. The free sunscreen by the pool area was so thoughtful. Salt water pool was very clean with beautiful view. There was never too many people in the pool and tons of empty cabanas and lounge chairs around. Pool side serivice was excellent. The servers constantly filled our cups with ice water and passing around bite size dessert and fruits. There were so much toys in the kiddie pool area, that my son never played our own toy. The small waterslide kept him busy all day. Food at the hotel was delicious. We tried all three restaurants in the hotel, our favorite was Spago. We usually make same day reservation and there was always table available for us. We had the buffet breakfast everyday and loved it! Our room was spacious with garden view. I had the option to upgrade for free but then got lazy to do so. We didn't spend that much time in the room anyway. I loved the toiletries made by L'Occitane, made my hair so soft and shining. Even though the hotel was more expensive than most of the others on the island, but we felt that we were getting so much more in return. On our last day, I left cell phone and passport in the room. Four seasons sent someone driving to the airport and delivered everything to me. I was speechless, that was 5 star service! Overall, Four seasons was well worth every penny and deserves the 5 stars.

I think we made the right choice after much reading on Trip Advisor and getting our travel agent's opinion. The Four Seasons is loaded with top notch restaurants for each meal of the day. Breakfast was the best buffet we have experienced ever. Lunch at Ferraro's was delightful near the pool. Duo was a fantastic dinner spot. We elected not to go to Spago and eat at a different location instead. Next time we'll definitely try Spago. The service, professionalism and cleanliness were absolutely perfect. We enjoyed the complimentary outrigger canoe program, although we would love to have stayed out on the water longer! The beach was very nice, but not as nice as some of the West Maui beaches. One thing to note, and I confirmed this with a couple of folks who live in the area: Most days around noon, the wind and water kick up and can make things a bit dicey in the water, but still pleasant. The serenity pool gets quite windy since it is on an elevated section of the resort. On the subject of the serenity pool, we noticed that a lot of people complained about the limited chairs available and getting in line early in the morning to reserve one. We really didn't have much trouble here. We usually put our name on the list and were called within and hour to come up and claim our spot. My only issue with this resort is a personal one, and might not mean nearly as much to a majority of people. When I go to Hawaii, a big part of the draw for me is the culture and the style of the islands. I love the lei greetings, luaus, Hawaiian music, Hawaiian art, hula, and the perpetuation of all things that make this place unique and special. The Four Seasons has the lei greeting, the outrigger program, a couple of hours of live music & hula in the lounge each evening, and some Hawaiian art scattered in the lobby area. But I miss the Hawaiian music constantly playing in the background, the weekly luau, the sound of Tahitian drums from time to time, and need I say it again? more Hawaiian music everywhere! Maybe it seems incongruous with the more European styled hotel? Just sharing my thoughts. The Hawaiianness that exists there is very elegant, but sparse and sterile feeling. Beyond that, our experience at the Four Seasons was phenomenal, especially when we realized we had been upgraded to a suite, which we attribute to American Express.

Their resort is immaculate, beds are incredibly, blissfully comfortable, the staff is attentive and professional. It was our anniversary and we arrived to find a bottle of champagne in our room. We chose the club option which is so worth the extra you pay. You have incredibly scrumptious foods at different times of the day, breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktails in the evening with more yummy delectible goodies. My favorite was the chocolate croissants baked fresh every morning from their bakery. Always someone on staff to assist you personally in anything you need, reservations, directions, local information. The rooms are large and spacious. There was even a DVD player so I could still do my Zumba (had to work off those chocolate croissants!) The pools are beautiful and poolside assistants come by with assorted complementary fruits, muffins, water while you bask in the sun. We always would come out fairly early to find our places to lay in the sun as people would all be doing this to get their favorite spots. They will hold them for up to an hour unattended. So we would find our location, lay our things down and then go back up to the club floor for some breakfast goodies and then ooze back into our lounges. The Serenity pool for adults only is our favorite, but you really have to be wanting to get up early for that. People line up around 6 a.m. to get in by 7 a.m. However, worth it, so worth it. So we did that once or twice for a quiet, blissful day sans the noise of happy blissful children playing in pools elsewhere. Love children, just nice to have an adult break. Swim up pool bar... awesome. I wish they had more than one Serenity Pool! Walks along the beach... what can you say? It's Wailea Beach. Like viewing the world in Techni-Color. The colors are so vivid it's hard to look away. The Spa offered complimentary yoga and we enjoyed that on the beach in the early morning. Speaking of the Spa... truly that was our only disappointment. As Spa's go, and we've been to quite a few, it was a bit of a let down compared to everything else at the Resort. And way over priced, as most are at resorts of this caliber. We had a couples massage in huts on the beach and unfortunately my husband didn't ask about the cost. Five hundred dollars was a bit much and our massages were not stellar. We may have just caught two of the girls on an off night, so I wouldn't rush to too much judgment. But it was way over the top on the cost. We booked a couples massage at the Grand Wailea next door a few days later for $295 and it was incredible. Soaking in mineral baths, citrus body scrub, and massage. I would definitely recommend their spa. Grand Wailea had been our second choice for our stay and frankly, you can't go wrong with either if you're willing to indulge a bit with your finances. We did not eat at the restaurants onsite (Club kept our tummies most content) however, we definitely recommend for over the top service a splurge at Nick's at the Fairmont down the road and also Mulligans on the Golf course (Irish Pub). And if you have a rental car and plan on driving around, Mama's Fish House (I believe that's what it's called) should not be missed. Absolutely the best fish we've ever had, but also a splurge. After a week, we headed on to the Grand Hyatt on Kauai. When we checked into our room and checked out their club option, we wanted to cry and run back to the Four Seasons. Not in the same ballpark. The Grand Hyatt was nice (beds horrible) and the staff nice enough, but it's a horrible shock to your system after staying at the Four Seasons.

The view was amazing from the huge lanai and we enjoyed a number of room service meals from there (fabulous food also!) The end of September is more into the low season, so the resort was not crowded at all and we did not have to struggle to find a spot at the Serenity Pool nor the normal pool, which was nice (at any time of day). The Serenity Pool was nothing short of amazing and the drinks were muy bueno! It did become windy around noon every day, so unless you like sand blowing in your face, it's best to retreat to one of the pools. The pool attendants are just wonderful and bring you everything from muffins, water, fruit, cool towels, etc. For restaurants, we ate the full breakfast buffet at Duo every morning and just loved all the options. We did eat room service several times (more due to laziness, than anything else! ha!) and the food was really great all around every time. We ate at Spago our last night there and while the food was great overall, it didn't really blow our socks off. We also ordered food at the pool for lunch (the nachos with chicken are awesome!) on occasion as well. We did rent a car, which came in handy for heading up to Haleakala early one morning (we do not like to do group tours at all) and we also headed over to the Shops at Wailea, which is a nice shopping center. We also went into Kahului to the shopping center there (needed to fix the iPhone) and had fun hanging out there also. Beyond that, we really just did not want to leave the resort...it was almost similar to the feeling you get when you wake up on a cold fall morning and just don't want to get out from under the warm covers (we're from NY!).

Both the living room and bedroom had balcony access with full views of the upper courtyard, the ocean, the island of Lanai and absolutely beautiful sunsets. The suite included a full bathroom off the bedroom and a \"guest\" bathroom off the entry hallway (one for each of us). The king bed was very comfortable and the entire suite was very well decorated and appointed to meet every need. Housekeeping was unobtrusive, yet somehow able to freshen the rooms twice a day, including turndown service. We ate at all of the restaurants and had room service and pool service and can attest that you cannot have a bad meal at the Four Seasons-Maui. I think our favorite of the three restaurants was Duo, although that may have been because of the fantastic breakfast each morning. Spago and Ferraros were both very good, but we went back to Duo for our anniversary dinner. Both the food at the pool and the room service meals arrived hot and fresh - not always the case at other resorts. I can almost believe the entire resort staff is telepathic as everyone seems to know your name as soon as you check in. I'm sure it is more likely a result of Four Seasons emphasis on personal service blending with the Maui spirit. You can't beat the pool service (Thanks - Fredo, Rowena and Greg) or the wait staff (Thanks - Sophie). We were also impressed that several of the managers approached us to introduce themselves and ask how we were enjoying our stay. A couple of tips. First, if you are celebrating a special event (birthday, honeymoon, anniversary, etc.) let them know when you book your reservation. It will be noted and recognized. Second, book your reservation through Ivonne at Whatahotel.com. They are a Four Seasons Preferred Partner and you will receive a room upgrade, free breakfast each day of your stay and a lunch credit at Ferraro's, all at no increase in rates.

However, I thought it might be helpful to provide families traveling with children with a review that is specifically geared towards the family experience. We went to the Four Seasons Maui in August for 10 nights with our two children aged 4 and 6. Overall, I would summarize the family experience as consistent with everything else that has been said about this place. The hotel and its staff think of everything and the family experience at the Fours Seasons Maui was fantastic. Here are some of the highlights: Room: We spent the first 5 nights in a garden view room and the second 5 nights in a garden view executive suite. Both rooms were great but the suite provided added privacy since the kids slept together on a sofa-bed in the room adjoining the bedroom. The sofa bed was more comfortable than a typical sofa bed and the children slept very well. As has been stated in several other reviews, the room has several surprises for the kids upon check-in (a stuffed animal, their names spelled out in sponge letters in the bathroom and child-sized four seasons robes to use). Kids for All Seasons: This was, for us, the real wild-card. We had no idea whether or not the kids would take to the KFAS programming. As it turns out, they LOVED it. We sent them to KFAS for 6 of the 10 days we were there and they did not want to leave when we picked them up. The programming is varied and well thought out and the staff was fantastic. I could not have been happier (nor could the kids). On their first day, each child is given a cubby in which to keep their arts and crafts. There is an outdoor activity, swimming, indoor play time and movies daily. It is a perfect combination of activities and rest and my children really enjoyed meeting the other kids. My youngest (the 4 year old) had to be accompanied by a caretaker (arranged through the hotel) but the whole thing worked seamlessly and my little guy enjoyed the program as much as my older child. On one evening every week, there was a special activity organized for the kids (at an additional cost). When we were there, our kids got a tour of the 4S kitchen, got to make their own pizzas and cupcakes and, after dinner, watched a movie. It provided a great opportunity for my wife and I to have a nice dinner together without any guilt. For their part, the kids had a blast. The evening activity was a little on the pricey side, but it was well worth it. Nanny: My youngest child had a nanny when he attended KFAS because the program requires supervision for kids under the age of 5 (it has something to do with licensing). We arranged through the concierge to have a nanny provided and requested that he have the same nanny for the entire stay. This was set up in advance and it worked out nicely. The nanny was great, came with activities, and really developed a good rapport with our child. We also had her babysit one night and she kept both of our kids occupied and happy. The cost was $20 per hour. Meals: The kids at for free at Ferraros and Duo (provided that parents are also ordering meals). For some reason, the kids don't eat free if you order food at the pool (even though it comes off the same menu as the childrens' menu used in the other restaurants). Overall: The pools, the beach, the facilities... they are all perfectly suited for children. There were many kids at the end of August and the hotel was bustling. However, the kids at the resort were generally well-behaved. While I was a little reluctant to take young kids at first, based on this past experience, I would definitely bring them next time.

We had just flown in from the mainland and picked up our dog from the kennel. Our flight to Maui was late, but we thought we would try to catch the last ferry back home to Lana'i. Oops, didn't work out. Not thinking that ALL the hotels on Maui might be sold out, we started our frantic phone calls. Not only did we need a place to stay for the night, we also needed one that accepted small dogs. Our first choice due to location and rate was the Westin. They were sold out. The second choice was the smaller hotels and VRBO rentals. No such luck. We finally called the Four Seasons and they were able to get us in at the last minute at a kama'aina rate. They knew we were beat and hungry when we arrived. The concierge immediately started calling around to see what dinner options were still available. Great service! And the best part, they allowed us to bring our little dog. The resort is stunning and first class all the way. I usually prefer a more intimate setting, but I don't know anyone who would complain about the gorgeous room we received (was this the run-of-the-house last minute bring your dog room? Wow!). It was quite spacious and the bathroom was fit for a queen. The view from the lanai was serene and beautiful. I did find the pool and beach area to be crowded (especially compared to FS Manele Bay, Lana'i), but it was still lovely.

The staff and service stood out the most - just excellent. Everyone did whatever they could to make us more comfortable or get us whatever we needed. I was continually surprised at how many of the staff learned and remembered my name. Beyond the service, the property is gorgeous, rooms are very nice and immaculate, pools are great, and they are on an outstanding beach. It's honestly difficult to complain about anything here. If you are looking for a relaxing trip where you spend many of your days lying by the pool or on the beach and don't even want to leave the resort, I don't think you can do better than The Four Seasons. It's not cheap, though. We got a mountainside room, which is they're cheapest, but I have to say I would totally get it again. Considering that the room itself is the same as nicer-view rooms, and you get all the same service, I'd recommend it. We overlooked the parking garage, but it was covered and there was nice landscaping right outside our balcony. The only reason to splurge and get a nicer room, IMO, is if you really like to sit out on your balcony and enjoy coffee or breakfast or something. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with a mountainside room if you are trying to get The Four Seasons into your budget. Note that they provide many amenities for free that other hotels charge you for. The only extra thing we paid for ever was overnight parking ($20). Fitness center, spa with steam room, cabana by the pool with great service - all free. They have 3 restaurants, and we tried all of them. They're all expensive, as you'd expect. Spago had outstanding service and generally excellent food, though it is very expensive. Ferraro's wasn't anything special to me. Duo was not bad - this is the one I would rely on for dinner if you don't want to leave the resort but you're not looking for a super-special meal or anything. Duo had great, but not too formal, service, and the food was quite good. It's still expensive, but as long as you don't get carried away you can keep the bill reasonable. If you want to get out of the resort for a more reasonable dinner, Kihei seemed like the most residential town in the area, and was not far away at all, but you do have to get the car. Some quick tips: 1. We booked through WhataHotel, which got us a free full buffet breakfast every day, plus a free lunch at Ferraro's one day. That was a better deal than anything that was being offered on the Four Seasons website, so definitely look into it. I'd never used WhataHotel before, but they were great and easy, and I'd use them again. 2. Poolside chairs and cabanas are first come first served, and sometimes they can go early. We ended up waking up around 7am or so most days, headed down and reserved a nice spot with one of the pool attendants, then went to breakfast. That worked out really well. If you make friends with the folks around the pool, they will help you find good spots. 3. The Serenity Pool is great - it's adults only, and is an infinity pool. Chairs there get snapped up really early. We spent one day up there, and it's great, but I have to say we enjoyed other days by the other pools more. We did not find noisy kids or anything like that to be a problem, and we would just walk up to the Serenity Pool when we felt like taking a dip in there. 4. Try to grab one of the spots on the terraced hill overlooking the beach. They are private, a little more quiet, have a great beach view, but are also not far at all from the pool. You'll get sun for much of the day, but you can put up the shade cover there and it's meshy enough that it allows good airflow so it's not too hot. 5. Get out early and enjoy your lounging, because it does get windy in the afternoon in Wailea. The mornings are calmer and little more peaceful. 6. We got a couples massage in the oceanside hale. It was awesome. It's screened from the beach so it's private, but being able to hear the waves and have a breeze blowing through was fantastic.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Resort\u201d", "Author": "Mrs_Best1", "ReviewID": "UR118256464", "Content": "This resort is heaven on earth.

Typical day is 6:30am sunrise walk and stroll on the gorgeous Wailea Beach, maybe some mediatation or yoga with wonderful instructors, reserving your favorite poolside cabana at 7am with the super-friendly pool attendants. Then proceed to the fantastic gym and workout facilities that make long workouts pass in a tropical luxury setting, enjoy the cold towels and refreshing drinks. Must have a relaxing breakfast at the Duo patio restaurant which must be the best buffet anywhere in Wailea or Maui and a great value for the exceptional offerings that change daily. The kids/keiki's loved the chocolate croissants and the malasadas or local donuts anf guava juice. Macademia nut pancakes with lillikoi syrup were a hit too. Hang around the many pools and then let the kids enjoy some funtime in the kids luxurious playroom with pool tables and ping pong when they need a break from long swims. Go set-up on the beach for some quality snorkelling and boogie-boarding on perfect waves and by 12 noon the wind shifts and the most beautiful breeze and winds come along to cool you off while enjoying the brilliant sunshine. Wander back to the pool to enjoy some gourmet poolside lunches and drinks in the cabana, the daily fresh fish offerings were so nummy. Afternoons it is time to wind down and have a drink up at the amazing adult serenity/infinity pool, fun to sit there and sip a cocktail or cold longboard draft with lemon, so relaxing. Enjoy sunsets and tradewinds from your 5 start hotel lanai and room before heading downstairs to Duo or Spago for world class dining. Dinners at Spagos are unreal and the sunsets are always spectacular. The wine list is tops too.

These people flooded every area of the hotel and were boorish and incredibly loud. Even though we woke up very early to secure chairs at the coveted serenity pool (which was a beautiful area), these sales contest people were also there -- and did not understand that the area was for people who wanted quiet.

Top notch service, great comfort, great facilities and good restaurants (although restaurants aren't PERFECT like the resort). Main considerations: 1) Serenity pool - swim up bar, NO KIDS!!!!! (no one under 21 allowed). Has an infinity edge pool looking out at ocean with great sunset view. Bar tenders at the serenity pool alone are enough to make me go back to this place every year. 2) Service, yes, its a 4 seasons but this is the best 4 seasons. The bar tender was telling me that 4 seasons employees from all over the world come there to train b/c its their highest revenue grossing hotel (and its clear why when you're there). 3) Food options are good. Spago is a Wolfgang Puck restaurant (saw Oprah there one night last week when I was there). Ferraros is good italian (limited menu options for dinner... BUT AMAZING lunch). Serenity pool has its own menu, Duo is great for breakfast and for dinner. 4) Great beach, great ocean out front, great snorkling on property. Some of the most exciting marine life I've ever seen snorkling has been outside of this resort just heading out into the water in front of the hotel and sticking my face in the wtaer (saw eagle ray, turtles, tons of fish, octopus, etc.) 5) One thing I will say, the spa here is ok, but not the best. I'm not really a big spa guy, but my wife says this one is good, but not as good as places that focus on spa access. Just an FYI. This is the best in the world, go there or you will regret it.

I was well aware of this going into it as I have stayed at other Four Seasons and this is Hawaii so fair warning to the budget travelers this is not the spot for you even if you get a really cheap rate on the room you need to be prepared to spend quite a bit. Also if you do not like the be around the high roller crowd it might intimidate some people. No free Internet, no self parking, sodas are $5 cocktails are at least $15 and up. Nothing is free and nothing is inexpensive. You will spend at very least $500 a day on meals and I think that is a pretty modest estimate we are wine drinkers so it was more like $600 per day. Now the good stuff...The service and staff is of course immaculate which is what the four Seasons is renowned for. The restaurants were really good especially Duo, the steak house, they have a raw bar a couple days a week that is outstanding, fresh lobster tail, mussels, oysters, shrimp, clams. The breakfast is great and different everyday they have an omelet/ pancake station that is to die for. The pool cabanas are first come first serve. You must get out there early in the am to reserve yours (before 8 am). They will hold the cabanas for an hour at the time and for two hours between 12-2 pm for lunch. This is the best part, get a cabana with a great view of the ocean. Our kids are old enough that we went up to the adult pool a couple of times and left them to swim at the main pool. The adult \"Serenity\"pool is an infinity with a swim up bar, great Jacuzzis but be aware this area is more for rest and relaxation so if you have had a lot to drink and want to take the party up there I would recommend keeping it down. The good news is that for people who don't want to be around screaming kids and loud partiers this adult pool is certainly a retreat! This hotel has a fantastic reef just there off the beach where you can snorkel and see sea turtles, eels, fish, everything! My son and husband went diving both in front of the hotel and out on an excursion and the hotel was the best. Rooms are fantastic, we had an ocean view double. Housekeeping is great, anything you want you can get as they are very accommodating of course.

Just rent a car (the hotel can help with this) and get a map! It is absolutely beautiful you will not regret it takes about 6-8 hours so start early.

The connecting doors did not provide enough sound proofing in such a way that it felt like the kids were in the same room as us. Having kids myself, I know how they can be...but it really did affect the ambiance of the room, and made us uncomfortable given that it seemed the children would never settle down. So after day 2 when it was apparent that the family next door were neither leaving or would keep their kids in line, we decided to ask to be moved. We were promptly moved to another building but it was on the ground floor, with no ocean view. :-( In fact we felt we had to take a lesser room to avoid the noise. If we had received a similar room, or even a slight upgrade, we would have felt the dis-accommodation was OK...but this really was a penalty for having to rectify the problem. It was a pain to move, so we just took what we got and went on with our stay. But I think the Four Seasons could have done better. The Four Seasons made the stay wonderful with everything else, but the resolution on the room was not as good as it could have been. We will stay at Four Seasons again...and keep our fingers crossed that we will not have a disruption like this again.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cIncredible experience\u201d", "Author": "Bdwfe53", "ReviewID": "UR116532437", "Content": "Everything was far and above our expectations, even for a four seasons resort.

The resort is the cleanest I have ever seen, they clean your room 2 times a day! I surprised my husband with a 50 minute hot stone massage by the ocean, worth every penny and he was so relaxed after, he couldnt stop raving about it and he said it was the best massage he ever had! We ate at Duo and Ferraros. Wasnt a big fan of duo and loved Ferraros. We dont mind paying for good quality food but I think for the price, the food at Duo was sub par.

With the exception of one day, the poolside service was out of this world. Our first day, Freddo made it seem like he was our personal pool attendant, checking in frequently but not intrusively. The next day we had some other staff members at the pool and by the end of the day I remarked to my husband that the pool attendants wouldn't take notice of us if our hair were on fire in our pool chairs! I had to walk to the towel hut myself to order food and drink and to close out our check (put away your hankies, my friends, it was only a 25-foot walk), and just as we were leaving the pool attendant came by with another copy of our bill to sign, because I guess he was paying attention, after all. That experience was the only reason I gave the resort four instead of five stars. The day after that, though, we had great service once again. We ate dinner at all three restaurants on the property, and they were all top-notch in terms of food and service, and one night we went off-property to eat at Capische, which suffered by comparison with the Four Seasons restaurants. The resort seemed pretty full when we stayed there, and there were a LOT of families, which surprised me because while I would say the hotel catered to children with kids' menus and some activities, the pool was not large and the stretch of beach was crowded and also not that large. We have children of our own but had foisted them off onto my in-laws, so the noise of children by the pool was not that troublesome to us; we did try to get seats at the kid-free Serenity Pool and weren't able to, and apparently those chairs get spoken for not long after the pool opened at 7am. If you don't feel like getting up that early, I recommend putting your name on the waitlist. We put ourselves on the wait-list (with no guarantees by the staff that we would get seats), and we did get called for openings at the Serenity Pool but we were pretty well settled by the family pool at that point and declined to move. We got a couples' massage in one of the Oceanside huts, and we agreed that we had each just had one of the best massages EVER. There are also some massage services available poolside, which we did use the first day and we thought it was very enjoyable. My one regret was that I would have liked to get more of a feel for Hawaii while we were there, my first (and so far only) trip out there. The food and service were outstanding, but it could have been a Four Seasons anywhere. For first-time visitors I would recommend venturing out for some excursions, like maybe a Luau, the Haleakala bike excursion (which we did and I highly recommend), to get more of a \"taste of Hawaii.\" One final story to give credit to the concierge desk: I asked the concierge for help printing my boarding pass to return home, and it wasn't that easy to print it, since I had booked through one airline but the flight was operated by another. The concierge tried both airlines' websites but was unsuccessful, then called both airlines, and finally got the double-secret confirmation code that allowed her to print my boarding pass. After dealing with all that on my behalf, which would have raised my blood pressure dangerously high, she then pleasantly thanked ME for MY patience while she resolved that issue!

We stayed at Hualalai a few years ago and loved it. I remember talking to people there (mostly honeymooners) who were on the circuit - i.e., Four Seasons Maui, then Four Seasons Hualalai, and all seemed to say Hualalai was way better. So we were reluctant to go to Maui instead of back to Hualalai. But they're both fantastic. Totally different, but fantastic. Four Seasons Maui is less nature-y, less secluded and it's a bigger resort. (If my husband were writing this, he would want to point out that the major advantage of Hualalai is the gym, lap pool and tennis courts which blow Maui's facilities away.) Back to Maui -- at first we were disappointed there wasn't more seating at the 'serenity pool', but we found plenty of other quiet places to sit and this wasn't an issue at all. Yes, people get up early to get prime seating at the pools, but there are more than enough decent (and shaded) places to sit. If you want to sleep in you'll be fine. The pool attendants were great and anticipated all your needs (including some needs you don't know you have, like rice krispie treat afternoon snacks). Spa was great, and nothing weird like 'signature foot bath rituals' that waste ten minutes of massage time. Lots of stuff going on at the resort -- yoga on the beach every morning, kayaking, paddleboarding, snorkeling, lectures on eco-friendly cosmetics (huh?) -- most if not all of it included. All very family friendly. I thought the crowd would be more Real Housewives of BH/Ari Gold-like, but maybe they're all in Cabo. In general the staff was great but not overly solicitous, and this can be a hard balance to strike. When you go for a run in the morning, they greet you with water and gatorade upon your return. The room looked like the rooms at the Ritz in Beijing (again, huh?) - i.e., nothing location specific about the decor - but there was a huge mirror cleverly placed to reflect the ocean so the decor fade into the background and it's all about the view, at any angle (unless you're looking at the flatscreen). The bathroom is huge but has no windows (am I the only person who cares about this?). We were graciously upgraded from a partial ocean view room to a prime ocean view room. Two [petty] criticisms. First, they only have one person making omelettes/pancakes/waffles at the breakfast buffet and the line gets really long. Second, you have to pay for wireless. I think $10/day for unlimited devices. You're paying $800+/night. It makes me want to steal $10/day worth of towels and L'Occitane soaps.

We booked through WhataHotel which was a brilliant decision. They are a Four Seasons Preferred Provider so we enjoyed an amazing room upgrade. Our enormous ocean front balcony gave us a full view of the pool, ocean, Molikini crater, and also the gardens where we saw weddings taking place. The accommodations were well worth the expense and the staff is second to none. They are over the top accommodating. We have tween-age kids and they know how to treat them ... not like the little ones ... more like teenagers. They enjoyed finding \"teen\" menus that were a nice bridge in between the kid and adult menus. Food throughout the property was fantastic. Best breakfast buffet anywhere with nice touches like little smoothies that changed daily and they offered to pack extras like chocolate croissants to go for snacking later. And, our fabulous breakfast was included each day, again thanks to WhataHotel. I'll be booking through them again! If you happen to be going to Kauai too (like we did), be warned that there is nothing like the Four Seasons available there. So, I recommend you go to Kauai first so you are not let down with your hotel! Go there first, then move to the ultra-luxurious Four Seasons next. One more food tip - the risotto appetizer at Spago is amazing. And one activity tip -- the scooter snorkeling and/or scooter diving is a lot of fun! And you can go right off the beach at the hotel. Outdoor spa treatment was also a treat - and they happily allowed my daughter to participate which is not always the case (some insist on 16 and up or 18 and up).

The adult serenity pool was built after our first visit and I must say that it has greatly improved an already outstanding resort hotel, especially for couples traveling without children. I guess the downside is that you have to get there around 6:30 in the morning to get chairs for the day when the pool opens at 7. They will hold your chairs for you for an hour, two hours between 11 and 2. The beach is excellent as well. This time we took advantage of the outrigger program, snorkeling, and kayaking and really enjoyed it. All in all, just a great, relaxing experience. The staff is great of course. We reserved the least expensive mountainside room and they upgraded us to a huge ocean view prime suite with a full separate living room and two bathrooms. We were blown away by this generosity. I suppose I can find some things to complain about. You have to walk a long way back to your room. The poolside drinks are $13 or $15 but extremely weak. The lounge chairs by the main pool should be replaced pretty soon in my opinion. They just are not four seasons quality. Also, the pools didn't look to be as clear as they should have been, though this may be a function of the fact that they are saline pools. These are pretty nitpicky and do not detract from the overall experience though.

We have stayed in most of the high end ones so I am comfortable saying this. If you have kids, this is the place to be. If you don't have kids, you can find seclusion here as well. They perform an incredible balancing act here. We didn't stay here when we first starting visiting Maui hotels because of the price, but it IS worth it.

It honestly was night and day and our experience was amazing. The service at this hotel was over the top and the staff anticipated our every need. In the mornings we would go on a long walk and when we would arrive back to the front of the hotel the bellman would greet us with a cold towel and water. While at the adult pool (which is incredible) they staff would come around hourly with fresh lemonade, fruit, aloe vera and ice water. Most people think this is fluff and your paying extra for all of this but our room rate at the 4Seasonas was $85 less per night than at the GWailea. The size and accessibility of the property was great and super manageable and you could get around this property very quickly and easily. The rooms were awesome and the beds were impossible to get out of in the morning and included a \"turn down\" service with fresh towels, slippers and little treats every night. We ended up eating at all of the restaurants and nothing but good things to say. When planning my trip I bounced back and forth from the 4Seasons to the GW and ended up picking the wrong hotel. I wish I would have know what I know now prior to booking. Luckily we were able to get out of our GW reservation without a penalty and ended up extending our trip from 8 days to 12 days. The only negatives I could find about this property would be for breakfast you really had only 1 option and it was kind of pricey and the chairs at the adult pool would be booked by the early am. What we did was put our name on the list for chairs and head to the beach and the staff would call our cell phone when our spot opened up. I would recommend this property to anyone that wants to be treated like royalty. The hotel is child friendly but if you have a large family and want to keep the kids busy I would also check out the GW. Hope this helps.

We did it all! We relaxed on the beach under an umbrella while listening to the surf. We also did the morning yoga class on the beach. My daughter and I had facials and took advantage of two complementary add-on treatments (it seems that there are specials everyday). You should go early and sit in the eucalyptus steam room. During our stay, the surf got stronger as the day went on. Watch the flags; red flag means it is a strong surf. Every day the beach guys had to rescue a guest from getting slammed into the lava rocks on the south end of the beach. We rented boogey boards and enjoyed them by staying in the middle of the beach. Plan on all your water activities early in the day and schedule your spa treatments in the afternoon. Since we are from the midwest, getting up early was not a problem. The mornings are the best for jogging/walking on the beach path. We snorkeled (1 hour free/day) and paddle boarded when the surf was still not so strong. The nights are quiet in Maui so going to bed at 9pm suited us just fine. The 6th floor roof-top tennis courts are nice. The surface is nice even for those of us that have knee problems. The hotel provides complementary rackets and balls. We scheduled 6:30 court time and the court was already shaded. Schedule the outrigger canoe (complementary) before your trip 7 or 7:45am. This is a MUST-DO activity and the canoe will fit a family of 4 plus the two staff members. We were able to do the activity twice (you can get the second by being on the wait list if someone cancels or if no one signs up). You will get wet in this activity, but bring your camera so that you can take a picture (they store it in a dry bag). At the end of your outing, the staff provides pineapple! The grounds are lovely. Everyday there was a wedding ceremony held in a different part of the hotel. One afternoon, my husband and I were reading in two chairs under a grass hut by the hammock in the meditation grass area when the staff started putting together the wedding alter and the dance floor. The staff puts it together quickly, quietly, and without any problems. Had we not been watching them, we would not have heard them. Each bride looked radiant. We took the Trilogy Molokini snorkeling tour. It takes about 30-40 minutes to drive to the marina. We did the regular snorkeling. You do not need to do snuba unless you just want to try it. The water clarity is excellent so you will not miss anything. We saw 3 large sea turtles. The porters gave us towels and water bottles when we left the resort. We also went on the sunrise Haleakala van tour with Polynesian Adventure Tours. We got up at 2am for a 3am pickup time. There are muffins or banana bread in the lobby. The porter gave us blankets (we scheduled this trip the day before so we didn't have our cold weather jackets). It can be 40-50 deg F at elevation 10,730 ft. We saw some tourist bring their hotel robes plus blankets. The weight room is excellent. We like to work out atleast 3 times per week and they have all the equipment needed for each muscle group. The cardio equipment is outdoors under ceiling fans. When you are done, grab a cold wet towel and an apple at the desk. Four Seasons has a game room that anyone can use. They have two pool tables, ping pong table, two internet stations, and video playing room with Wii (guitar hero) and 4 game videos. I never saw this room empty in the afternoon and evening. If the kids were done with being in the pool or the beach they were in this room! The parents could be taking the afternoon class or working out while the kids were entertaining themselves.

While the generic room decor was a bit disappointing for the price, the hotel more than made up for it with the exceptionally spacious bathroom, gracious staff, wonderful food, and excellent location. On the room: I think I can be forgiven for expecting more from the hotel room, given the gorgeous public areas of the hotel. The suite was decorated in earth tones - it was not as \"rustic\" as the decor at the Four Seasons on the Big Island - but more resembled what I'd expect to find in a mid-tier hotel. Forgettable, nothing special. Stepping out on the balcony of the room and looking back at the patio doors, I got that same feeling. I expected more. The bathrooms were stocked with L'Occitane toiletries. The room had a partial ocean view from the living room and the balcony and faced another Wailea hotel. Perhaps for my next stay, I'd ask to have a room facing the inner courtyard (where the main pool is). Extras The internet in the room was an extra $6 (what's another $6 when the room costs upwards of $1,000/night, but still), while parking was another $20 per night. Didn't mind the parking fees as the attendants were wonderful. That said, I was so thrilled with the rest of the hotel... Food The hotel has a branch of Spago, but I was told it wasn't really part of the Four Seasons. The food wasn't bad. What I really liked were the1) buffet breakfast at DUO (the only place where breakfast is served the the hotel; get a table near the smaller pool); 2) poolside meals (fish and chips and the lobster salad were standouts); and 3) Ferraro's for dinner (great food all around, plus a beautiful setting) Facilities The hotel had everything from a large beach right outside (FS staff provide water, chairs, and umbrellas for hotel guests), several wonderful pools (including an adult-only \"Serenity Pool\"), and a large rec room (great for rainy days). The lush grounds were a treat for the eyes (unlike the surprisingly \"threadbare\" grounds of the Four Seasons Dallas at Las Colinas).

The 3 restaurants in the hotel are upscale restaurants and the breakfast buffet is very high at $35 a person but even in the restaurant the service goes above and beyond. Each time I opened a packet of splendor and put the wrapper on the table it was cleaned up in less than a few seconds. I have to say that this was the best hotel for comfort and service that we had ever stayed at. This made our 30th anniversary very special.

I had read all of the glowing reviews on Trip Advisor about the Four Seasons before we booked last fall and our trip. I honestly had a hard time believing that all of the \"over the top\" reviews of the Four Seasons could be accurate. I must tell you that I was wrong. We have been blessed to be able to travel all over the world, and without exception, the Four Seasons was the best. Best service, best accommodations, best of everything. From the minute you arrive, you are not just another guest. You become one of the family. You hear a lot {usually hype] about living aloha on Hawaii. They do it at the Four Seasons. Some tips from our trip. 1. We stayed on the Club floor in an upgraded room. This was an amazing value. You receive personalized service, and all 6 of the Concierges were very personable and helpful. There is breakfast, light lunch, cocktails, finger food around dinner and nightcap drinks all inclusive. Trust me; with the prices in Hawaii, this is a true bargain. We ate out each night but honestly you could skip the dinner and enjoy the fantastic service and food in the Club. If you can swing it, definitely upgrade to the Club level. 2. The hotel is stunning and the service exceptional. You can read all of the reviews already written that go into some detail about this, but all I can say is that the service is flawless. From the watermelon served as you sun bake [burn?] on the beach to the service in the Hotel, we had perfect service. 3. We ate out each night and would recommend DUO, especially the raw bar on the weekends. You cannot eat all of the seafood. We also ate at Spago and Ferraro's. I did all of the planning ahead but the concierges at the Four Seasons were a big help getting us excellent tables. I would rank the restaurants in this order; DUO, Ferraro and then Spago. 4. We also ate at the MALA in the Marriot and the food there was the best of the entire week. We also ate at Capische and I would not go back. Ruth Chris was also consistent with other one's we have eaten at. 5. We didn't really do any sightseeing this time, as we have been to Maui before. So we were, I hate to admit it. just lazy and sat at the Beach. Wailea Beach is exactly as advertised; beautiful, especially the sunsets. Heaven on earth. I could go on and on but don't want to bore anyone. All I can say is that we went with high expectations, and they were exceeded in every respect.

As we checked in (fairly late, nearly 11pm because of our flight arrival) we were offered cold lavender towels and cucumber-infused water. The amazing service continued throughout the entire stay. The pool staff is constantly bringing by complimentary refreshments: assorted muffins, Evian sprays, chilled towels and cucumbers, fresh fruit, ice water, popsicles, etc. The list goes on and on. And they never seemed to be *too* attentive. They simply anticipated guests' needs and exceeded them. I would be thinking, \"It's warm and I'm getting thirsty,\" and there was immediately someone there refilling my water glass or beverage. Amazing. We ate by the pool most days and the food was delicious. We also had breakfast several days at Duo and dinner at Ferraro's. All were great and the service - again! - unbelievable. Everyone called us by name and ensured that every need was met. The Lobby Lounge is also nice. There is Hawaiian music every afternoon and other types of music nightly. The housekeeping staff cleans the guest rooms twice daily. And they really pay attention to little, tiny details. For example, my husband left a book open, face-down on the coffee table and when we returned the housekeeping staff had put a bookmark in the book for him! We were floored. The attention to detail is what makes this hotel stand out from every other. The grounds are lush and beautiful and the guest rooms are spacious and spotless. We had an ocean-view room and enjoyed sitting out on the balcony to watch the sunset. We spent most of our days by the adults-only Serenity Pool. Future hotel guests, be warned: to get your choice of lounge chair (or any chair at all) be prepared to line up around 6:30am daily. It wasn't difficult for us because of the time change, being from Minnesota. We were up anyway. Though the days we did decide to sleep in a little, we ended up sitting by the Fountain Pool. Also nice and just as great of service, though a little louder because it's filled with children and families. If you're looking for a fun splurge, reserve a Luxury Cabana by the Serenity Pool. We reserved one of these cabanas twice during our stay and it was a great decision. The cabanas have wireless internet and huge TVs. They also come with complimentary champagne and fruit plates and the service is even better! They really are amazing and its provides a nice reprieve from the sun.

See attached pics of the Four Seasons. The FS gave us a complimentary upgrade from the $465 per night room to a partial ocean executive suite with free bottle of champagne. UNREAL room. with HUGE bathroom. Everyone has pretty much stated that the FS resort is unbelievable. They are right. Service is impeccable, resort is amazingly clean and the scenery is incredible. Rented a luxury cabana at the serenity pool one day over memorial day weekend. If you can swing it, I would say it's worth it. We paid about $350 plus any food/drink/tips...the front facing ocean view cabana's are $395...I actually think the cheaper ones are better. We had no problem getting a chair or cabana at the regular pool (which is still great, but definitely a little more noisy). We didn't feel like rushing to get in line at the serenity pool at 7am for one of the regular chairs so to us it was worth having our own space, etc. Plus, it was nice to live large for a day. Serenity pool is fantasitc...you can obviously use the serenity pool/bar even if you don't have a chair reserved...but you do have to reserve (free of charge) a chair at the serenity pool). Food: Ate breakfast at Duo. Yeah, it's on the pricer side but the bacon, eggs and hash browns were all awesome. Probably the best bacon I've ever eaten. We don't do large breakfast's often so it was worth it. Had dinner at Duo and Ferraro's. Both great, but favorite was Ferraro's. Try the seabass if you like fish. Melted off the knife like a piece of steak. Bar apps were pretty great as well. Chicken nachos were our fave. Off the resort...the pizza up the road at Matteo's was great. Ate at Monkeypod by the shop at Wailea. Thought it was above average, but not amazing. Good food though and great selection of beers. Played golf at Wailea Emerald. Great views throughout and course in awesome shape. Lots of bunkers! Good sports bar (had NHL hockey on which I was looking for) is Mulligan's right by Wailea Blue course...cheap local beers at happy hour. $20 per day for parking (valet only). Didnt' love the valet only option...the resort will also drive you any where local you want to go free of charge (sans a tip for the driver).

The cleaning staff was spot on, they brought me extra feather pillows with no problem. I think the great things about the FS chain is \"service without an attitude\" all staff is friendly and seems like they like their job which shows thru to the vacationer.

There were alot of kids which is a downfall if you are looking for romance but all kids we encountered were well behaved.

Its the top class experience with amazing rooms, lovely restaurants and you can do as much or as little as you want. There are fun free activites like outrigger canoe lessons or you can hire snorkel gear or paddleboards. Just off the beach you can snorkel with sea turtles which you don't need to go on a tour for. One tip with that is do it forst thing in the morning- before 9am thats when the turtles are feeding and getting cleaned just off the beach. We had a relaxing time here. But one annoyance was the whole 'hogging beach chairs' thing. People have a tendency to put there towels there and then go off to breakfast etc. IF you don't mind sitting on the beach I recommend this over the pool chairs. The serenity pool is very nice to relax and have cocktails in the pool but can also get busy. Do head out of the resort for meals as there are some great casual dining options in Waliea village - the Japanese cafe is fab and we ended up going there twice. I also recommend you get a hire car for a day or two and explore the island - I organised a picnic pack with the hotel and we had a romantic picnic at Big Beach which was lovely. The Hana Hwy is also worth a whole day - make sure you stop in a few small towns and go past the end of the Hwy.

To start with summary: This location is very much worth the higher price of the rooms and you will be glad you did. First, we found that the various employees here were uniformly helpful, engaging, and always tried to be as helpful as they could. Even the cleaning ladies were cheerful and pleasant. One day we were out on the lanai of the room the entire time they worked on the room. Instead of just slipping out when they were done, they opened the door and asked if they could get anything else for us. A simple thing, but repeated many times during the stay. Though i am usually one to spend little time at the place of lodging and most of my time exploring or doing activities, this is one occasion that you may just want to enjoy relaxing with the service provided amidst beautiful ocean/beach/garden views. We did very little offsite for 5 days and were glad we did. Each morning we found it easy to get up early (because of time change) and enjoyed their open air aerobic facilities with plenty of amenities. For some reason, we both found it very easy to get our exercise \"out of the way\" here. Because we booked through whatahotel service we both enjoyed the morning breakfast buffet at no charge every morning. Frankly this was probably the culinary highlight of our trip as the quality and quantity of selection was wonderful and it was simply a delight to enjoy this meal each am. We usually enjoyed this big meal around mid morning and found that the last 3 days of our trip we only wanted two meals a day with this being the first. Another tip: for me i love simpler food--which means cheaper food. Each evening we would take a short drive to Kihei to eat something simple--even plate lunch (which i love) sometimes and then would go to a small place for a different flavor of gelato ice cream each evening. Definitely a situation that kept food costs way down and we enjoyed the food.

The serenity pool is a fantastic place to hang out, but if you aren't able to get a spot here, consider one of the spots tucked into the hill between the resort and the beach. There are some great views there, and you'll get plenty of peace and quiet. As another side note, there is some top notch artwork all over the resort. If you're into that sort of thing, it's worth walking around just to take it all in. I would really have to struggle to find fault with this place. If I could offer one bit of constructive criticism to the folks at Four Seasons that I suspect are reading this, it would be this: for a resort of this quality, the toilet paper is oddly pedestrian.

When we arrived at the hotel, there were several valets available to park the car. Our check- in was smooth and quick. There was a problem with our room, but it was addressed and resolved efficiently by Housing Director, David Crouch. We utilized the kids club, which my son thoroughly enjoyed -- there were plenty of children his age, and the staff provided a variety of engaging activities throughout the day. He had a wonderful experience, and met several little friends to play with everyday. The breakfast and wait staff were very also accommodating --- we have a child with nut allergies and they made sure his meals were cooked separately to avoid cross contamination. They also ensured that my daughter had a cooked sweet potato waiting for her during lunch everyday, so we would not have to wait 40 minutes for the potato to bake. We had a late flight out on our last day, and after with speaking with my travel agent at WhataHotel!, the hotel allowed us to remain in the room for the entire day, which was wonderful, since we could swim, relax and pack in a leisure fashion -- and the children could take a long nap before the 10 hour flight home.

If you can afford it splurge it's definitely worth it. The views and grounds are beautiful. Another great plus is that Wailea is the driest part of the island. The breakfast was great, but for dinner I recommend going off property for dining. Not a big fan of Spago's. You will get better options going to Lanai City Grill, Mama's Fish House, Halimaile General Store to name a few. My boyfriend really enjoyed Emerald and Gold golf courses while I enjoyed the fabulous spa, in-hotel boutiques and also Wailea shops. We do not have children and loved the serenity pool (adult only) which has an infinity pool that has the most breathtaking view. I recommend getting chairs really early because they run out rather quickly. By early I mean 7am..Not too bad for the east coasters :) The rooms by far are spacious and the bathrooms were wonderful too. The service is also worth the money. If you can request a room on the left wing of the hotel I think it would be better. If you get put on the right side you have to walk forever to get there.

That's how impressed I was! To say they went above and beyond my expectations is an understatement. We arrived for our five year anniversary - 5 night stay (booked the one night free special). For our honeymoon, we didn't get the R&R experience we wanted. So for our five year, we really wanted to go all out on a no worries, mind numbing, life of luxury vacation. The Four Seasons really delivered. We booked a partial ocean view room. Let's just be clear from the get go that booking this trip was well outside our financial comfort zone. We're very frugal and never splurged like this on a vacation, the bar for \"making it worth it\" was high from the start. The resort outdid themselves by upgrading us to a prime ocean view suite since it was our anniversary. Not only was it an amazing view, we even had a lawn outside. Why is grass important you may ask? Well, when you have a little lawn like this you can pull your private lounge chairs out onto it, lay back and star gaze over a bottle of champagne. Oh yes, did I mention they gave us a free bottle of champagne to celebrate? As I said, the bar was high but they went well beyond my expectations. They really made the trip feel special and unique from the moment we arrived. In regards to the serenity pool, you need to be up and at them by 7 am to select your prime spot. If you're visiting some other time than spring break, you may be able to have your choice around 8 or 9 am. Four Seasons will only hold the chairs for one hour if you leave, but it's not enforced while seats are still available. The Serenity pool is amazing. We watched the whales play in the ocean all day. Pool side service the first day was perfect. On the first day, the staff frequently came by to check on things (Water filled? Check. Drinks? Check. Cold washcloth? Check. Watermelon? Check.). The morning of our second day, the Japanese Tsunami hit HI at 3 AM. Many of the staff had been evacuated the night before and had not seen their homes or checked in with family before reporting to work. As a result, the remaining days were good, but the frequency of service was less. No big deal. Food on property is good, better than off property (HI is not known for cuisine). The best value and end-to-end experience is the daily full breakfast buffet. The service there was consistently great. We ate in the lobby bar one night - sushi. It was good, but overpriced for a casual dinning experience. The truth be told, two of us dining on a light dinner in the lobby and eating a full meal at Ferraro was within $25. Our stay was wonderful. From the room service, house keeping, valet, and concierge, it was amazing how gracious these folks always were. We'll definitely be staying at a Four Seasons again (my wife is already planning our next trip, Italy, and of course the Four Seasons is now on the list).

Fortunately the wave action only created minor damage on Maui and nothing to Wailea beach or the Four Seasons. Other than that experience it was very peaceful and relaxing. The room also has a huge bathroom and a good size lanai. The pool area is relatively small for a Hawaii resort, but more than adequate and you can always go down to beautiful Wailea beach directly in front of the resort. Once again the employees at the pool were exceptional. We only tried Spago for dinner on our first night and were mildly disappointed due to cold food and I have reviewed the restaurant separately. We used the club room for breakfast and a light lunch and the food there was great so why use a hotel restaurant. The grounds of this Four Seasons were extremely well cared for and quite beautiful.

From the minute we got out of our car the staff was there to serve our every need. We got a free upgrade and had a room that was a palace. The location of the hotel is PERFECT if you are looking for a place on the beach. Many hotels I read about like the Ritz Carlton in Maui did not seem to have promising beach situations. I assure you the beach is wonderful here. We saw sea turtles just from snorkeling right off the hotel beach. They have tons of water sports like paddle surfing right there available for you to rent. The pool is beautiful and the infinity pool was everything people have been saying about it. It has gorgeous views and it's very peaceful. The hotel is definitely expensive, however it's worth the splurge. The only thing that was a little overrated was Spago. We knew the price was going to be alot, but we weren't all that impressed. Down the block make sure you go to this restaurant in the Wailea hotel. I forget the name offhand, but that was one of our best meals in Maui. The concierge can set you up with reservations, info, and they even set the car for your day with water and snacks. I can't say enough about this place. It really has everything you can want and expect in a luxury hotel. There is live music every night too which is nice.

We really love this hotel. But we learned early on not to go during high season which is Thankgiving thru New Years and 4th of July weekend. Honestly the best time to go is mid January thru February. The weather is gorgeous, hotels are half full, and the whales are swimming through on their annual migration pass. The hotel is located an easy 30-minute drive from the airport. We always rent a car at the airport and drive ourselves to the hotel. It's really nice to have your own car to have the freedom to go for a drive to shop or dine. We book the car as a package with the hotel. We don't get a convertible anymore. Actually kind of a hassle, it gets windy in the afternoon and the sun gets hot. All of the convertibles we ever rented had black interior so it feels like you're cooking inside the car. So now we get a regular car with good air conditioning which is cheaper than a convertible. The Four Seasons (in the quieter seasons) usually doesn't have too many kids as families tend to stay next door at the much larger Grand Wailea which has more kiddie attractions and fun swimming pools. We always get an ocean view room. Even though we are not in our room that much during the day, it feels like a true Hawaiian vacation to see the ocean from your room. The pool is great, and we usually lay out in a cabana facing the ocean. Best to limit sun exposure because you will burn fast. The breezes keep you cool ,and it's easy to be fooled that you're not frying. You see a lot of people sunburned lobster red and they look pretty miserable. The pool service is excellent. They are always walking around with a smile bringing fresh towels, cold water, menus, sunscreen, etc. The spa is small but very good. We usually have massages at the beginning of our stay to get us in a relaxed mood. Love the breakfast buffet. It is expensive but honestly all food in Hawaii is expensive. Lunch is usually poolside - hamburgers, shakes, etc. Dinner we usually drive somewhere to Kihei or Lahaina. There are several good restaurants that the concierge can recommend. For snorkeling or diving, the little dive shack is a good place to get outfitted. You can also get certified through them, which we did, and had a lot of fun doing our dives including a night dive. In summary, it is a luxurious hotel. Very clean, well decorated, friendly and efficient staff, and good food. Is it expensive? Yes, it's a Four Seasons, not a Holiday Inn. If you want to splurge on a relaxing vacation and feel spoiled, I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable Service\u201d", "Author": "traveler32678", "ReviewID": "UR94434940", "Content": "After researching on this and other travel sites, my only concern about this hotel was that it had the potential of being overhyped. Every aspect of our stay here either meet or exceeded our expectations. The grounds are beautiful, the serenity pool was amazing and the service is second to none. Its hard to describe what makes the service so exceptional. Its only noticable when you go to another hotel and experience the difference. I will say that our meal at Ferraro's was slightly above average. The ambiance and service were great but the food was so-so. A friend recommended a place called Capesce that is 5 minutes away and the Four Seasons provides a free ride too and from. The food was great, the service was good and the view is really nice. It's a pretty good place to see the sunset but Ferraro's view is better. We booked a snorkeling trip through the hotel and that was decent. The boat and the staff were great but the actual snorkeling was poor. If you have ever snorkeled or gone diving in the Caribbean you will be incredibly disappointed. It was great to be on a boat and searching for whales but the actual snorkeling portion was weak. They have a snuba option that is an additional charge and it is a total waste of money. There's absolutely nothing to see an additional 15 feet down. Dont be fooled by the overpromising sales presentation on the boat. The fitness center is great. The cardio equipment is outside and has a great view. The weight room has everything you need but is a little cramped. The other guests were extremely curtious so it wasnt a big deal.

When we arrived, no other rooms were ready, so they escorted us to a \"mountainview room\" but told us not to unpack. The room was perfectly acceptable, and though there is no view, they had disguised the parking garage and the landscape was lovely enough that it was fine. We spent some time cleaning up from travel and then exploring the resort and checked back with the Front Desk. They had already collected our suitcases and moved them to a ground floor garden view executive suite. We LOVED this room. There are some perks to not having an ocean view--primarily PRIVACY. Our room had two lanais, which was nice as well. They have added doors so that the living area of the suite can be separated from the bedroom, which is quite nice as well. While we spent as little time as possible in the room, it was the height of luxury. Lovely, lovely, lovely. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was spacious and divine. Public areas of the hotel are to-die-for gorgeous because they have truly taken advantage of their seafront hillside. The vistas are amazing--from the lobby bar, we could watch whales playing out in the bay. Magical. As my mother had been kind enough to plan this mother-daughter trip, I booked us 80-minute \"Mele Wailea\" massages in the oceanside \"hale haus\"--what a treat. Also, very nice after the long flight from the east coast! The little massage huts are tucked away from the main hustle and bustle of the beach and pools, so they were very quiet. Massages were very good. The spa facilities were very nice--was particularly enamored with the Toto Shower Towers. Absolutely lovely. That said, we also visited the Grand Wailea spa... While the FS spa was in much better shape, it had many fewer amenities... Ocean was lovely, but my mother is not super fond of sand (she prefers to look at it rather than lie on it) so we spent most of our time at the pools. There are many little nooks and crannies on the terraced hillside to lounge as well. Pools were both lovely. We only spent one day at the main pool, however, and then only because it was too windy up at the serenity pool. It was not too noisy at the main pool, but it was not as... serene ;) Oh, the serenity pool. Perhaps my favorite place on earth? They are quite serious about the age limit--I am in my twenties and was definitely asked for ID--be forewarned if you look young! Their are ample loungers (and those with covers if, like me, you burn easily) and they are wonderfully comfy. The serenity pool is located on a little cliffside and the views from the infinity pool are amazing (more whale watching!). Service is superb with all of the cold towels/cucumbers, water, evian spritz, cold fruit, etc. Swim up bar makes excellent drinks--I was particularly addicted to the blueberry mojitos. There is also a nice hot tub. Love love love. Activities: I had arranged all of our off-resort activities before the trip. I highly recommend a private \"road to hana\" tour--yes, you *can* drive it yourself, but then the driver misses out on the views. We did the full loop which was very interesting. We also did a helicopter tour of Wailea and Lanai--can't recommend highly enough. So beautiful--and this time the whale watching was as if you were a national geographic cameraman! I would skip the luau's unless you have at least a group of four--you need to bring your own party, if you know what I mean. The only resort activity we did was the sea-kayaking expedition to watch whales--HIGHLY RECOMMEND! We even perhaps got too close, but WHAT an amazing experience. DO IT!!!! RESTAURANTS: Overall, I'll tell you straight: there is no reason to leave the resort to eat UNLESS you are out sightseeing. We ate at \"nice\" restaurants at the nearby mall, and the food was middling. FYI, I also give the famous Cheeseburger in Paradise a C-, so skip that unless you're in the neighborhood. We definitely found the food at the Four Seasons far superior to anywhere else. Room Service: We were wiped out the day of our \"Road to Hana\" tour and ordered pizzas and salads in our room. Pizza was hot, salad was crisp, and service was prompt. Breakfast: Our package included a continental breakfast with an amazing array of pastries, cereals, and delicious tropical fruit. They also brought us a different \"special\" smoothie each day--though somedays were better than others. On our \"Road to Hana\" day they let us pack a to-go breakfast. One day I did upgrade to a full, hot breakfast which was delicious, though not absolutely necessary. Ferraro's: I'm ashamed to say we only ate lunch here one day--but it was VERY tasty. Poolside dining: Sooooo embarassing, but every other day we were on the resort, we ended up ordering food to eat poolside. There were a lot of nachos! What can I say--it was so gorgeous up at that serenity pool I never wanted to leave! Lobby Bar: At least two nights we ended up making dinner out of selections from the bar appetizer menu. Most of the choices weren't particularly fancy, but they were yummy if you don't feel like having a formal sit down dinner. Duo: Very good steak house. We ordered pretty standard fare--it was excellent. Spago: I would say a step above Duo, if only because the menu was a little more adventurous. Absolutely delicious. Wonderful views. OVERALL: Beautiful, beautiful property. Wailea is magical. Definitely would go here again. This place DEFINES 5* properties. Not enough can be said about the quality of the staff. LOVED this place.

We did have to get up around 6:30 AM to be in line to secure our seats by the pool when it opened at 7, but this wasn't a problem for us at all since we are naturally early risers, especially in Hawaii. We would spend hours by the pool, being waited on hand and foot. The chairs were very comfortable and covered with a fresh clean towel just for us, and we could leave at any time for up to an hour and they'd save our seats. This made it possible to go to the breakfast buffet or take a brief swim in the ocean.

Go early to spend some time in the locker room/steam room, it is very nice. I got a massage and a facial. The massage was awesome, the facial was pretty good.

Rooms came with a big plasma tv, complimentary water, and a dvd player (for which guests could borrow dvds free of charge from the concierge!) The people at the hotel gave you water and towels, too, whenever you went on any excursion. What placed this hotel above all others is the quality of the service. You are not allowed to lift a finger and they anticipate every possible need you could have. For example, they set you up at the pool chairs by helping you find a spot, arranging your umbrellas, lying out towels for you, getting you ice water (and filling it every few minutes without being in your face). They bring you ice cold towels by the pool to refresh with, and cucumbers for your eyes, while offering to mist you with this cool aromatherapy water! There are pumps of sunscreen by the pool (waterproof in different strengths) that smell amazing so you needn't fret if you forget to bring your own. I literally could go on for hours about all the little things they do that put them above any other hotel (even other Four Seasons establishments). There is the main pool (with a kiddy pool offside) which is spectacularly gorgeous, and then the 'serenity pool' which is for adults only. The serenity tpool has an infinity pool which looks as though it runs into the ocean. It's a bit quieter and is definitely worth going. It's smaller, which means it fills up quickly, but you get on a waiting list and will be in fast, and they will call you when they have your chairs set up for you! Though some may find this to be annoying, you can still stay at the other pool which is just as beautiful....plus, the size of the serenity pool is what makes it special and quieter! The concierge and staff are wonderful, and they take pride in offering recommendations and arranging your activities. They even send your ininerary up to your room for you to keep track of everything! Their recommendations for activtiies and restaurants were always spot on - when we followed our own paths (instead of listening) the meals were never as good (but hey, sometimes you have to be adventurous!) There were lots of good places to shop nearby, too! The spa was wonderful with a very serene atmosphere and lovely products. They had a reasonable deal going on at the time, two services for $200 so I ended up getting a 1 hour facial and 1 hour massage and was thrilled with both. The buffet breakfast was the best we had out of all other hotels - the pastries were fresh and kept under a warmer...nothing like a toasty croissant to start your morning! And they had custom omlettes, waffles and pancakes made just for you with lots of toppings to choose from. We had dinner at the hotel's restaurant DUO one night at it was one of our favorite meals of our whole trip - definitely try the mac and cheese, you might die from deliciousness. My only regret was not coming to the four seasons as the last stop on my honeymoon, as nothing could compare. This is the hotel that all other hotels in the world should aspire to be. They have many staff who have been working there for 10 years plus, which is clear as they cater to your every need with a smile. What's more, if you offer them tips they seem genuinely surprised...not like those other hotels that go above and beyond but do so with their hands out. If you're looking for heaven on earth, stay here and don't consider for a milisecond staying anywhere else! I will forever spend the rest of my days figuring out how to get the hell back to the 4SW!!!!!", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cIncredible, Over the Top Service at Four Seasons Maui\u201d", "Author": "Manihi", "ReviewID": "UR89927836", "Content": "WOW!

We had a partial ocean view room, which was on the 4th floor of the resort and you had a side view of the ocean. While the 4th Floor sounds high it was really on the ground level and we had a corner room so the steps exiting that floor were to the left of our balcony. The balcony was large, but the location not ideal. To be honest, we barely used our balcony due to its location. People tended to smoke on the stairs. The room was also next to the supply room for the cleaning crews and it got a little noisy at 7.30 am every morning (it was room 413). Our air conditioning tended to be noisy too if it was on low. All small things, just minor annoyances. No other complaints with the room, large bathroom, double sink, comfy bed, complimentary water in the room and wherever you went in the resort. The resort and grounds were really top notch. We only had difficulty once getting seating at the serenity pool and put our names on a waiting list. We loved the convenience of the adult pool, but I would have liked it to be a little larger. This was the first time I'd been to Wailea and absolutely loved it! We used the beach front pathway to venture out at night to dinner. We walked over to the Wailea shops (15 min walk) a couple of times and the other direction towards the Fairmont (about 10 mins). Be warned especially heading to the Fairmont at night, parts of the pathway are pitch dark. I loved Nick's at the Fairmont, more upscale, white table cloths, etc. Highly recommend it, great food. We also went to Humu Restaurant at the Grand Wailea next door for my husband's birthday. Nice, but not great, I wish we had gone to Nick's for his birthday, more of an occasion place to go. Loved Ferraro's at the resort, great service good food. They had an extensive Italian wine menu that we had difficulty navigating but the food was great. Great buffet at Duo's in the morning (about $30 p/p). All these places were very expensive (drinks at the pool were expensive), but just factor that in before you get there and the sticker shock will be better! We did visit the spa. It was very nice and relaxing, I wouldn't say it was anything extraordinary but very enjoyable, not crazy expensive either. We had a car and explored the island quite a bit. If you don't have a car you'll most probably spend more time at the resort and the beach. Either way you can't go wrong! All in all it was a very relaxing 5 nights. I would categorize the resort and the experience as understated luxury.

My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights on our honeymoon. Happy to say it lived up to much of its hype. The property is very nice and the service is above any other place I have been. We had booked a garden view and got upgraded to a ocean view suite which was great. The week after thanksgiving is a quiet week so the place wasn't too packed which was a perk. In a crowded week, I can imagine the fights for pool chairs is annoying as even we had to get down by 8am for chairs in the sun. We rented a convertible and did a drive on the road to Hana - an interesting thing to do once in your life. Did dinners at Ferraros and Spago on property, plus drove outside to Mamas Fish House, Capische, and Pacifico. All quite good. Highlights: Pool and resort service is great and what really differentiates this place, including staff knowing your names and constantly bringing ice water, cold towels, pineapple, sample shots and smoothies of the days, sunglass cleaning, avion sprays, etc. The adult serenity pool / hottub have amazing views and a nice bar. Property itself is gorgeous. Outdoor gym is nice. Eat offsite a few nights to get out and see scenic parts of Maui. Beach is great. Paddleboarding was a blast. Downsides: Long trip from NY. Its also a big hotel that sits on a popular beach next to a few other hotels so you are reminded that this is a crowded beach destination. (For a more quiet and private feeling, go to the Four Seasons Hualalai on the Big Island - we went there for our next week and its like your own private island vacation). Prices are ridiculous but you know that going in - but eat offsite to save a few bucks and stock your fridge from nearby stores.

We had booked a garden View room and upon check-in were upgraded to and ocean view that was just awesome to relax out on the balcony and see the sunset. The room was spacious and bathroom was large by other hotel standards. The mini bar was stocked with waters ,coffee and ice and rooms were serviced twice daily. The staff placed different bedding schemes to keep the room looking new. The amenities were abundent and was impossible to take part in all that is offered with this fine resort. The beach is public but maintained by the hotel. During our stay,We met \"Manny\" who was responsible for your needs on the beach . Manny greeted you and set up your chairs and umbrellas at your favorite location on the beach. The reef in the morning was calm and had the best visibility to snorkel and take pictures. The afternoon was when the waves grew and was awesome for body surfing or just having a good time. The beach staff would come around and hand you and ice towel to cool off or jello's . The hotel had three restaurants on the property and we dined at DUO's and was not disappointed. As with this type of five star hotel,the starting menu price for a three course diner will be around fifty dollars per person and increase depending on your selection but well worth it . There are local restaurants down the road at the Wailea Shops if you wish to venture off the hotel grounds and offer a good value for the price.

However, after a recent stay at the Four Seasons Wailea, I will definately choose to stay there again. What really made our stay extraordinary at the Four Seasons-Wailea was the people who worked there. Everyone, from the valet, receptionist, housekeeping, pool attendants, and restaurant workers were friendly, caring, and attentive. They worked extra hard to make sure our stay was a pleasant experience....and it truly was! I booked my stay through the What a Hotel website. The perks they offer, plus all the \"little extras' that the Four Seasons provides, adds up to a good savings. We went on the outrigger canoe; a couple of exercise classes; played pool; borrowed CD movies; and had a private cabana..... all for FREE! No additional resort fee here! (Though there is a $20 parking fee per day.) Awaiting us in our spacious and beautifully decorated room was a plate of scrumptious tea desserts, water (in the mini fridge), coffee, and a generous supply of L'Occitane bath products. Though I hesitantly booked the least expensive room (mountain view), I was very pleased with it, and would do it again! I liked the spacious balcony, with comfortable furnishings to view the mountains and surrounding trees. The parking garage below my room was partially concealed and did not hinder my enjoyment of the room and surrounding view. Infact, I barely noticed it because the mountain view was so pretty. There is a bit of car noise, however, from the nearby street, but it was minimal or non-existant with the sliding glass door closed. We ate twice at Ferrarro's because the food was so good.

On night four, we decided to try the Four Seasons and see what all the fuss was about. We had absolutely no plans - just wanted to relax and have some fun. We booked a mountain view room, but were upgraded to a partial ocean view room upon check in. That was a nice surprise! We had a ton of bags crammed into a tiny convertible, but the bell man was a pro and handled all of our luggage with great care. He was extremely pleasant and offered us many good tips for the rest of our trip. Before our room was ready, we did a quick walk around the grounds. A gentleman working at the pool greeted us and answered some questions we had with a smile, and also offered to take a picture of us. The service at all the restaurants and bars was wonderful. We ate dinner at Spago and it was very good, although be prepared to pay big bucks for it. We also sat in the lobby bar area for the hula/torch lighting ceremony, and it was pretty cool. On our first day, we spent most of our time at the main pool right in front of the beach. It wasn't a problem to find a covered cabana, and the chairs are the most comfortable I've ever been in. We went upstairs to check out the Serenity Pool, but there weren't any chairs available so we decided to come back first thing in the morning. We ate breakfast at 6:30 in Duo (best breakfast I've ever had, actually) and were ready to snag our chairs at 7:00. There was a short line of people waiting, but we got the chairs we wanted and there were plenty left over for at least an hour or two.

I had forgotten about that, so it was a surprise when my husband and I went underwater. The pool bar opened at 10AM. The beach is really beautiful and nice. We didn't spend a ton of time on it because we were really enjoying the pools. We did get some coffee and the little snack bar by the beach (called Snorkels, I think?) and it was pretty good.

It's expensive. Once you accept that, you are free to thoroughly enjoy the frankly remarkable service this place has to offer. We were upgraded from the partial ocean view room to a suite for free, and we did have a partial ocean view which included the mountains in the distance (stunning at sunset and sunrise) but the drawback was that part of the parking lot was below. Not really a problem unless you're a very light sleeper. I know that we never even mentioned it to each other while we were there. The room came with dvd players in bedroom and living room, a minibar with creamer for the complimentary coffee and two free bottles of water every day. There are no other drinks in the bar, but you can call down for anything you require on their list. Room service has a very full selection and you can also order picnic baskets which come with blankets, coolers etc in case you are taking a road trip. Very thoughtful! Many people have complained here about the lack of room at the pool. I will say we tried to go to the serenity pool once, but it was booked all of that day and the next. Not very serene! The pool itself looked fine but nobody was using it, and loungers were close to each other there. We went to the main pool and had our pick of chairs at 9 or 10am every day, and once at 4pm. There was never a problem getting two adjacent chairs in a secluded area, and all kids were well behaved. Mind you, this is november and the situation is likely very different during the holidays. Most smaller children were in the kids pool area near Duo's. Pool service includes your choice of drinks and food from a menu so we had lunch at our loungers once. We tried the beach, there is less space there but we had no problem getting chairs. The snorkelling was fine but the waves were a bit strong so we had to be careful not to get washed closer to the rocks. Beautiful parrotfish and other species, but if you are used to snorkelling coral reefs this will not compare. Duo's serves a great a la carte breakfast, which is all we tried from there.

After all, it only means it's time to get back to reality..work, stress, etc. This time I cried (I am not at all a crier)! What can I say about the Four Seasons Maui that hasn't already been said? First of all, Maui is heaven on earth! Staying at the Four Seasons Wailea was just too good to be true. We had the most perfect honeymoon I could have ever imagined. Our intention was to go on a few tours (Road to Hana, helicopter ride over Haleakala, luau, etc). Well, we made it to the Old Lahaina Luau..on our last night!! Why would anyone want to leave this resort? We were pampered from the moment we got there till the moment we left. We got the honeymoon greeting (champagne, personalized note, rose). The day we were leaving, we decided to splurge on that \"pineapple drink\" we saw everyone drinking (I believe the drink is $20 each). Well, when the pool attendant brought us our pineapples, he told us they were \"on the house\" and said they were sad to see us go and hoped we would return for our anniversary. I mean, if that isn't great service, I don't know what is! Those were just two of the many, many things the staff did to make us feel special. I know these people are trained to use guests' names in the restaurants, around the pool, etc., but it's amazing how they remember your name even when they see you around the resort. Every new person I met congratulated us on our marriage and asked us if we were enjoying our honeymoon. The day we were checking out, so many people wished us well and hoped we'd return the following year with a little bundle of joy. I can't say enough about this hotel's staff, the grounds, the food, etc. Everything was absolute perfection.

There have been so many good reviews, I'm just going to hit some high points. The service: The people are SO nice and fall over themselves to help. On one occasion I was at the scuba shop which is right next to Ferraro's. A waiter dropped a glass on the path next to me. I wasn't wearing any shoes as I had just come from the beach. One of the waitresses brought me a pair of slippers and 4 different people came by to appologize to me for the inconvience of broken glass. The Food: We had the breakfast buffet every morning. It was always amazing and even though you pay more for it, it's totally worth it. We had Ferraro's for lunch and many many cocktails. We were never disapointed. We had dinner at Duo's and it was outstanding. We didnt LOVE Spago. Too fancy for our taste, but if eating foods that are decorated so elaborately you can't identify it, this is your place. *The food at this resort is the best I've ever had, ever. With that said it's crazy expensive, so if you have to pack granola bars and head out elsewhere for dinner, it's worth it to experience the best place this side of heaven* Amenities: In the room you get the holy trinity plus shower lotion, after sun lotion, packet woolite, q-tips and more! Maid and turn down service. Housekeeping does a great job. There is a charge for parking ($20 nightly) and wireless internet. There are so many cool things to do at the resort, you really dont need to leave. Snorkel gear is complimentary as is the outrigger program ( I highly reccomend this). You can rent boogie boards, canoes, and paddle boards. The paddle boards are crazy fun, give it a shot. There is a really nice game room where there are video games, shuffle board, billiards, and ping pong. On Celebrities: Yep they come here. On our stay Mick Fleetwood, Jerome \"the Bus\" Betis, and Larrry Flynt were all there. We didnt see them, but some of our friends did. Overall impression: I LOVE THIS PLACE!

It was our first trip to this hotel, and we had high expectations due to prior stays at the Four Seasons on the Big Island. We were a bit disappointed. Is this the nicest hotel on Maui? Probably. We explored the Fairmont, the Grand Wailea, and the Ritz, and the Four Seasons seems to top them all. Our main complaint is that the hotel is just too crowded for the price. Things we liked: - staff is friendly, as you'd expect. - beach is lovely; location within Wailea is nice - outrigger canoe program very enjoyable - beautiful view from adult pool - Spago exceeded our expectations - the hotel has local artists in the lobby each day, so you can decide to check out their booths or not. Things we didn't like as much: - As others have noted, the pools are crowded, especially the adult pool. I had hoped that it being September, the pools wouldn't fill up as fast. Wrong. We had to be at the adult pool by 7:20 every morning. Then there's the ability to leave for only an hour at a time (2 hours for lunch). We had a few occassions where after a morning walk or some other activity, one of us had to go back to check-in before we could get cleaned up or grab breakfast. To me, that's just ridiculous, especially when you're paying so much per night. - Our rooms were far from the elevators, and our partial ocean view was a view of the ocean about 500 yards away. I normally don't mind walking, but the walk wasn't scenic at all (just inside the hotel cooridors). - I felt the rooms and most restaurants did not have a good sense of place. The rooms are pretty generic and you could be anywhere. Ferraro's lunch menu does not use many local ingredients (eat at the pool instead). The spa is generic luxury. Even the main pool looks more LA than Hawaii and you can't even see the beach. I did apprecaite the Hawaiian artwork in the hotel common areas, and wish they could have incorporated it more into the rooms themselves. - Pool service at the main pool wasn't great. We waited for towels and water, and were offered very few of the goodies that make a Four Seasons experience what it should be. We had the opposite experience at the adult pool, where service was wonderful. - cardio machines are open-air but tucked in a corner without a great view or a nice breeze. It can be quite muggy outside in Maui. If you can, a jog or stroll on the beach path is the way to go.

I don't always need/and or want super attentive staff, plush settings or daily valet service. With that said, I would not stay anywhere else on the island of Maui. Being our honeymoon (and for the fact that we made it through the wedding with ZERO debt), we went for the splurge. No regrets! Wailea is a beautiful, serene setting. We have wondered into Lahaina and Ka'anapali a few times and every time we do, we are even more thankful for our decision. Wailea does not strike you as a tourist trap. Although it is a little drive to most activities (give it a good hour to get to Lahaina), the benefits far outweigh the negatives. We are in the Ocean Prime room (upgraded at check-in) which offers a diagonal view of the ocean as well as the lush gardens and fountains. This room is definitely sufficient! We entertained the idea of upgrading once more, but due to unavailability we couldn't. That's probably better anyway, seeing as we underestimated how much food would cost here! That's my only negative comment- be prepared to spent at least $70 a meal (for 2 people, including tax and gratuity) for room service. We made it out of Ferraro's for dinner at about $180. But can you really put a price on the pictures we got of that sunset??? Bottom line- just know what to expect and prepare for it. This resort is far superior to the other options. If you have made it to Maui, you might as well get the most out of it. The beach is awesome and the attendants make it that much better. Out of habit, I went to grab my towel as we were leaving. Before I could touch it, a voice from across the sand- \"I will get that! You don't pay all of this money for nothing.

The Grand Wailea was also beautiful however it seemed a bit run down and the pool was very loud...like a zoo. We shared the pool Regis Philbin and his family one beautiful afternoon! A nice surpirse! We enjoyed all restaurants on the property as well as those off the property. They were all very good. I would recommend making a trip to a market to stock up on drinks and snacks as everything is pricey at the resort.

This resort has hundreds of rave reviews and that is the reason we chose this resort but I want to recognize the phenomenal staff that we \"fell in love\" with while we were staying at the resort. The door men/ drivers( Eli, Chauncy and the crew) were so genuinely warm and welcoming. Anything we needed or thought we would need was already thought of and provided. The fabulous pool attendants WOW!! My husband and I were so impressed with all of them. Jeff, Chris, Kevin,Brian, and Thea! Those guys are amazing and exceptional people thank you for making our days so fun and enjoyable. There attention to detail is staggering! We felt like royalty! The Restaurant staff at Duo, breakfast was always a treat with Erin and Mia. Can't thank the chef enough for making my favorite pineapple muffins especially for me! I felt so special. Dinner was wonderful with Brad as our server. We really enjoyed him and all of his tips! Ferraros is a great Italian restaurant but this place transforms from a casual restaurant during the day to an extremely romantic restaurant at night. We spent our Anniversary dinner with the lovely staff at Ferraros. Renato was our server and he was such an integral part of our magical evening. He knows his wine!!! Renato was stellar in every way. Grazie Renato!! Jamaal is a genius, he can make you the most delicious and refreshing drinks - I am so coming back for that Pineapple Mojito!! Austin was our Ferraro server second night he was so great too very accomodating and personable.Katie who works the shack - That gal rocks! Thank you for going above and beyond. Don't miss the Outrigger Canoe program its an incredible opportunity that is given to everyone that stays at the resort. Gary and Rob are First Class and so knowledgable. It's truely and experience you cannot miss. Gary and Rob are absolutely the coolest guys you can't miss meeting these guys. The Scuba program was wild my husband dove for the first time and he is hooked. Blaze Anderson spends most of his time in the ocean and he is the best instructor you could ever hope for. Last but not least I received the most relaxing and wonderful massage from Margo. I chose to have a massage in a hale by the ocean and it was the best decision ever! Listening to the waves crash and feeling the wind blow while being pampered was spriritual! Margo is extremely talented and has 30 plus years of experience with the lomi lomi massage.

We just had a vague feeling at the end of the trip that overall we had not enjoyed the Four Seasons as much as other hotels in Hawaii. Part of the problem is that we didn't feel entirely comfortable - everything is just too nice and perfect. And we are not ones to wear $1200 shoes to breakfast or show up at the pool with Louis Vuitton bags. If you are, you will be very comfortable at the Four Seasons showing off your wealth to the other guests who will then show off their wealth to you. Also, it just didn't feel very Hawaiian. The views were great, and the hula in the evenings was nice, but while at the resort we never really felt like we were in Hawaii. It's basically a nice hotel that could be anywhere, with some Hawaiian decoration, but not a major Hawaiian theme. Other than that, my only complaints were that there wasn't really convenient self-parking (I hated always having to use the valets even just for quick trips to Starbucks) and that they charge for internet access. The pricing of food, wine, etc... are higher than anywhere else - probably no surprise there, but when a glass of wine in the restaurant is more than the entire bottle at the store, that's more than the customary margins. The breakfast buffet was good, but at $34 was it better than $22 buffets at other hotels? Not really. Having said that, though, my kids had no complaints at all. Great pool area for kids, lots of gifts and personal attention throughout their stay, and the Kids for All Seasons club room was very well done. They didn't want to leave. Four Seasons has definitely perfected the idea that a hotel can be luxurious and very kid-friendly at the same time. Probably the best hotel for young children that we've ever stayed at.

We had 2 rooms connecting.. each had a crib and little gifts for our baby. In our room, we had a bottle of champagne and some snacks for our anniversary. My mother in law came with us so she put the baby to sleep while my wife and I walked around. The grounds are AMAZING, as is the crescent moon beach. Our first night was pretty uneventful. A quick review of our 5 days.... Pros - The service here is top notch. All of the workers are friendly and helpful. The cabanas are great to have with a baby since they will bring a pack-n-play to keep them in the shade. You get quite a bit of \"freebies\". The cabanas are free, fitness activities (except for spinning classes) are free as well as the water activities. The first hour of snorkle is free. We ate at Spago and Duo and both were amazing. The food and service at both were top notch, as well as the price tag. Around 350-375 for 3 people. Cons - the valet. this is the only way to arrive/leave the resort.

We decided to go in August because we were told that it is not too crowded at this time with kids going back to school and people don't really travel. The rates were extremely good at this time. We had researched and spoke to people on where to stay on the island; we decided we wanted to stay in Wailea, but we did not know which resort was best for us. We compared prices and looked at reviews. The following 3 were our choices and why we did NOT go there and why we are so excited we stayed at the FS: The Fairmont- this was really our second choice. We walked over there and would have stayed there; however, 2 of the 3 pools were under construction. Also, the reviews stated you were nickeled and dimed for everything. Grand Wailea- too big...there are over 700 rooms on this resort. We walked around it is so big, you get lost. There were kids all over and it was VERY crowded; it felt dirty. Marriott Wailea- it does not have a beach; my husband loves the surf and wanted to stay where there was a beach with beach chairs and beach access. Also, the reviews stated it was difficult to get a chair to lay out while you were there. Now on to why we stayed at the Four Seasons: Service, value, and size of hotel were the main reasons: Service: The service was incredible! If there was something that was forgotten (water at night, room service mess up), they would come back immediately and bring it. The men at valet made sure you knew where you were going that day and if you were going on tours would give you water, or blankets (for Haleakala). When you would go to the beach, you could get a chair set up any where you want...no charge! You could then go to the pool or the lawn and get a cabana/chair/or a chair with shade and they would come around to fill your cup with ice water as well as get your drink/food order! Value: It is EXPENSIVE, but Maui is expensive! We felt that out of the hotels we were looking for, this one offered what we were looking for and the prices were pretty comprable. We did not feel nickeled and dimed for anything. We got fruit and popsicles by the pool; sunscreen everywhere, so you do not have to pack it; cabanas and chairs near the pool, on the beach or wherever you would like that was available...all for no charge! We had water/ water bottles anytime we asked for them...no charge! We really felt as though we had paid for what we got and there weren't any \"hidden fees\", which made us REALLY enjoy our time. Size: The hotel has less than 200 rooms, I believe. It felt small and not overcrowded. You felt like people were around, but you had your own space. The hotel was VERY clean and I believe that comes from the small size of the hotel being able to be maintained. The grounds were kept very nice; people were always cleaning and it did not feel dirty. Suggestions: We do suggest you wake up early to enjoy the surf; the waves pick up about 10:30-11 ish and it is very windy. We did drive to Big Beach down the road from the hotel and the water was very calm; it is a great beach to hang on. Kihei is the small town next to Wailea; there are great restaurancts beyond the FS property. We did go to the FoodLand in Kihei to grab some snacks. We decided to do this after we got a cheese plate for 1 that was $45 from room service! The cheese and crackers was perfectly fine at foodland; there is a small fridge in your room to store a few small items. Arriving and time change- I read a review from someone that ate @ Ferraro's when they arrived; they stated they enjoyed their meal and went straight to bed. We are 5 hours ahead of Maui, so we booked a 6pm dinner at Ferraro's for when we arrived. It was perfect; we ate and were in bed by 8:30pm. We did the Haleakala tour the next morning b/c we were still on our time, which worked out to be great! In closing, we wanted to stay in Wailea and drive to different parts of the island to see all Maui had to offer. We were very glad we stayed in Wailea; we had high expectations that were all met! I do think, you have to be careful with your expectations because the people at the Four Seasons are wonderful, but they are human! Go enjoy the beauty of this island and place....you will not be disappointed if you splurge and enjoy some time at the FS.

I saw the Four Seasons & kinda felt a need for some pampering so I said, \"why not?\" I arrived & was blown away in a positive way regarding the level of sevice. The staff were all very pleasant & seemed very genuine. The grounds were impecable- perhaps a little too manicured for my taste. The views were magnificent. I was originally placed in room #626 but wasn't too keen on looking at the putting green & asked if there was another room with a different view that was in the same price category. Boy am I glad I asked! There was indeed! Room #679 which was a 100% better view- the entire gardens with a partial ocean view. The staff was so helpful- it was not quite 3 pm (regular check in time) but my 1st room was available so they let me check in early at 2 pm. When I requested a room switch they offered to move my luggage for me once my room was ready- nice! I went to the pool in the meantime. Wow... I loved the serenity pool, but there was always a wait list for a chair- forget a cabana. There was nice music playing underwater in the serenity pool which is such a nice touch. The restaurants were not that impressive for the money, but ok. I liked the breakfast buffet at Duo. Drinks were very, very good- loved the mai tai. I spent one day in the spa. It was nice, but I was disappointed that there wasn't a jacuzzi in the spa- only a small wet sauna. The prices are through the roof for typical services offered in most spas. I had an oxygen facial that was just ok. I was not really able to relax though because she kept talking about which product she was using next & what it did. ugh... I should have got a massage. I spent 5 glorious nights here. I even had dinner in my room one night. The staff that delivered the meal set up an entire table setting w/ flower arrangement for me- nice touch. I especially loved the music channels that you can play in the bathroom. I would leave the Hawaiian music playing so it I could hear it upon entering my room. Housekeeping comes twice a day. They provide a turn down service in the evening & will even place houseslippers near the bed for you. The bed is just heavenly... like laying in a big fluffy cloud. I really want to duplicate the bed in my own home. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here, but I don't think I will do it again. I prefer a hotel with more personality. I also felt that Wailea was similar- nothing like the character of Paia. I wish I could have stayed at Paia Inn, but they were booked.

The rooms here are nice and the service better than average, but it lacks personality and is still very expensive and even more so if you want an ocean view. It ticks the boxes on paper, and we don't mind paying more for something special, but this hotel loses something in translation. For starters, the pool area is too small for such a large hotel. As mentioned in previous posts, you have to get up very early to secure a sun lounge by the pool. There were quite a few noisy kids about even though there was supposed to be a separate kids' area. The pool menu specifically mentioned that games like Marco Polo were not allowed at the big pool, but there were MP games every day. We headed to the beach to get a lounge and were amazed (especially for FS) that there was no service on the beach. The beach is nice and the water is wonderful, but having to go all the way up to get anything is annoying. That said, the snacks from the pool bar are tasty and the drinks were very good and I had a lovely spa experience before our dinner at Spago. We ate at Spago and it was good but not fantastic (the three tuna cones were the standout). We were surrounded by children and it was a lesson to us about different ways of parenting. Where one couple (he was a star of a well-known crime drama) was having an animated discussion with their very well behaved daughter, the other nearest table plonked a DVD onto the table for their daughter with the volume turned too loudly so that we heard every song from The Little Mermaid. We went for a drink at the main bar where Jennifer made a mean margarita, but were surprised how early it closed. We went out for a few meals and our favourite was Sorrento's at sunset.

For lunch we tried Ferarro's and eating poolside, both were great. Dinner at both Ferarro's and DUO was exceptional and we went early enough to get an unobstructed view of the sunset. The main pools are quite loud and full of families, but the serenity pool area is wonderful for a couple on a romantic getaway. The beach is perfect white sand and the ocean is very clear. There are rocks 20 yards out but there is plenty of white sand to swim and play in the waves. Waves usually come in the afternoon. Right beside the beach there is a reef that is filled with snorkelers and fish. It is true what they say about celebrities, they are all over the place here. We saw some very big names hanging out. It's great how no one disturbs them and the hotel staff treat everyone the same. We even got a better table than one of the celebs (we were blocking their view of the ocean :) Service was amazing. They kept coming with water and treats all day. They would even use your name on the beach (I'm amazed how they keep it all straight who is where on the beach). One time my wife went to throw out some garbage and one of the attendants intercepted her and took care of it! Even the sunscreen is included. Room service leaves on the radio and fills the ice... there is hardly anything you have to do for yourself EVER. Overall we had a fantastic experience and I can't wait to go back.

Self-serve is NOT an option here (Get used to it and you may like it) - Get to the serenity pool by 6:00 if you want a seat, otherwise use the waiting list (they will call you, it's actually not a bad option if you want to spend the morning on the beach/garden/main pool) - If you miss seats at the serenity pool try the ultra private seats beach facing in the garden (fantastic place to spend the day) they are limited but we found spots as late as 7:30 - Unless you plan to eat away from the resort plan on at least $200 per adult per day minimum for food. With gratuity and taxes. It's pricey but really good food! There are not really alternative inexpensive options in the area. You can save on drinks by going into Kehei or the Shops at Wailea and stocking your in-room fridge - Snorkeling gear is free for the first hour and you don't have to go very far to see tropical fish and turtles - There is a $6 charge per day for internet and $20 per night for valet, but you will quickly not mind since it is a fraction of the burn rate at this place :) There are a lot of complimentary items (use of beach tote, morning coffee, muffins, freezer pops, sun screen, etc).", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Honeymoon Indulgence\u201d", "Author": "GHC3", "ReviewID": "UR77731609", "Content": "As everyone says, absolutely amazing.

We did not eat at Ferraro's, but, Spago and Duo were fantastic. The spa facilities are not what I expected for a resort of this caliber. There is no sauna or whirlpool in the spa, and, the showers are quite small. It's not the type of spa where one would want to hang out and relax for a long period of time. It's more functional than luxurious. We booked the 80-minute couples oceanside massage, and, it was fantastic. I would recommend this over a service in the actual spa.

My expectations were extremely high (voted #1 resort in the U.S. by Conde Nast readers, AAA 5 diamond award, Forbes 5 star award, raving TripAdvisor reviews, etc., etc.). And the resort delivered. It is absolutely stunning, and the service is amazing. However, my lofty expectations were not exceeded. First, some awesome (and expected) aspects: -They upgraded us 2 levels to Partial Ocean View ($825/night) from Mountainside ($445/night). Room was unbelievable (expected). -Spago, DUO, and Ferraro's were all outstanding. Service at each was superb. We enjoyed the food at DUO most, though Spago had excellent kobe beef sliders and unbelievable bread. Ferraro's had the best dinner atmosphere (oceanfront outdoor sunset view). All three were truly memorable dining experiences. Also, you MUST try Mama's Fish House up in Paia (just past the Kahului airport on Hana Hwy). Second, there were a couple of small details that could be improved: -I expected awesome service -- and generally got awesome service. However, when we lounged by the pool, my water cup sat empty for 10-15 minutes on multiple occasions. I expected butler-level service by the pool. However, each pool attendant takes care of roughly 10-15 cabanas, and this caused my water cup to not always be full. Not a huge deal, but could be improved. -We asked one pool attendant where we could find a newspaper. She said, \"they have those up at the concierge.\" She should have, instead, gone and gotten us one. A different pool attendant, when asked about magazines, referred me to the pool stations for selection. Again, should have gotten the magazine for me instead. -The housekeepers failed to give us turndown service one evening by the time we got back from dinner at 8pm. They knew we had 6pm dinner reservations, or at least should have known. Yet they failed to turn down our room on time, so I put the \"privacy please\" sign up. They also failed to re-stock our matches 2 times, and our coffee 1 time. Very small details, but I expected absolute perfection at this highly acclaimed resort. All in all, this is a superb property with a superb location and superb service. If I hadn't already read 200+ raving TripAdvisor reviews, I would have been absolutely stunned at the service, beauty, and location of this resort. Even with my extremely high expectations, I loved this resort. We walked past the Fairmont and Grand Wailea properties, and they did not even come CLOSE to comparing. We also walked around the Ritz property up in Kapalua, and it did not compare either - much farther from ocean with sea-weed waters at the beach. However, we did prefer the Hotel Hana-Maui to this resort, albeit slightly, because it was much less crowded and in a much more genuine Hawaiian location (Hana, as opposed to over-developed Wailea). But that's more of a matter of personal preference. Ultimately, this resort is AWESOME. I strongly recommend it to couples. There were some screaming children around the pool areas, but most parents knew how to keep their children quiet. If you have screaming children, please go stay at the Grand Wailea, not here.

So here goes: This was our third trip to the Maui FS in the last year (April 09, October 09, April 10) for a combined total of 26 days. We arrived at the hotel with a mountainside room booked \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 since on our last two trips we were given complimentary upgrades were almost expecting one. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anticipate an upgrade because at the time of our stay there were two very large corporate groups (same as October) and also some film stars with their respective entourage. So, we were disappointed to find out that they had given us one of the very farthest rooms facing the Grand Wailea parking lot. We asked to pay for a garden room upgrade but nothing was available. They finally offered us an upgrade for $200 extra per night, but after some intense negotiations :), they agreed to $100. Okay, as tacky as everyone may think, it was both mine and DH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 40th birthdays this week and we felt that this would definitely warrant an upgrade (plus we had already been to the hotel twice in the same year). Wishful thinking I guess. And we were very happy they agreed to the upgrade. Thanks 4S! Okay, now in our super fabulous $1200 per night room directly facing the beach, we were feeling a bit guilty for getting this room for $525 per night. Saying that, I would never pay $1200 for a room like this. It was the exact same layout as the other less expensive rooms and the balcony had a lot of direct sun on it. I only went out once to listen to some bad karaoke that was blasting until 10 p.m. one night as part of a corporate function. Not cool. To repeat the good aspects of this hotel would take a long time as there are many. However, I should say that the staff continues to amaze me at every turn. They are truly the best part of this hotel. But here are some observations/recommendations of our 3 stays in general. 1) Noise/Crowds: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a super quiet experience at this hotel. The pool is busy, the beach is busy, the restaurants are busy, the lobby lounge is busy, the valet area is busy, the adults-only pool is busy \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 etc, etc, etc. But overall the staff manage it pretty well. We had a serious noise issue in our room for 4 days - the people above us were opening/closing their very heavy balcony door every 10 to 15 minutes most of the day/night (this is reminiscent of a recent stay at the Ritz Carlton in St. Thomas \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 same exact balcony doors). We tried to take a nap a couple days but finally gave up. We called down to the front desk at least 4 times, but the situation wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handled at all and when we checked out a manager met us at the front desk to apologize and let us know that when we returned to the hotel 4 days later (from the Big Island) they would make sure that our stay was peaceful. (they did honour their word and put us in a nice quiet upgrade to a partial ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 thanks 4S). That being said, they should have notified the people above us to explain how loud their door was in our room. I had a feeling it was a family/or celebrity entourage and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to upset them. 2) Restaurants: We ate every meal (except two) at the hotel over 9 days. If you want a good table for dinner/lunch, make sure you ask for one. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better to make reservations (even for lunch). Generally speaking we found that the corporate groups/families get priority seating (especially in Spago). This is common theme we have experienced as travellers and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really a thorn in my side. The food at all the restaurants is very good to excellent, with Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still being our favourite. We love the lunch menu (seafood cobb salad, kobe beef burger), and the dinner experience is truly lovely \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 make sure to request a table in the front row \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect them to offer this right up \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you have to ask. We have visited Spago three times over our three stays and it has always been a great meal. Although, the service is confusing and awkward as they have 4 or 5 people serving your table. Generally the service has been consistent and always with a smile, but, the difference over the past year is that the staff are really, really busy. They are truly worked off their feet and this is really noticeable in the lobby lounge area. Fortunately, the quality hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffered, but we did have to wait most nights for a table at the lobby lounge. It seems to be the place to take the kids and extended family for the torch lighting ceremony/dancers. They need to create a more adult friendly lounge and make their guests without children happy too. We were patient enough to wait for a table each night, but we saw several people leave the lounge area looking perturbed. And there really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t another alternative for drinks except the bar area at Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (which was always very busy as well). 2) Quirks: Our toilet overflowed and basically flooded the entire bathroom. It took 3 very excited calls to get someone to come up. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quick enough to lift the toilet lid and lift the stopper \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but eventually we figured it out (as well as remove the carpet on the floor.) To apologize, they sent up a note and a box of chocolates. I thought that was a nice gesture. Also, the new sheets they are using to replace the well-known 4S sheets with brown trim aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that great. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not kidding, it was if we were the first to use them because they actually scratched my skin to the point of redness. I mentioned this to housekeeping and the next day they put on the older version \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 ahh, what relief. 3) Pools: The pool service is great but I felt that this time the main pool needed to be better cleaned. It felt a bit slimy from all the sunscreen, and definitely too warm for my Canadian blood. I hate warm pools. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even try the serenity pool this time because in October 09 we could never get a chair, or the ones available were in the hot sun. If I could have one wish for the 4S it would be to somehow make more natural shade areas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I find the cabanas can get very hot. 4) Misc: The Orchid Salon is not worth the price and I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it. Although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not part of the 4S brand, it is located on their premises, so they should be aware of the quality or lack of it. For $150 for a mani/pedi, I expected it to be in a nice relaxing setting. Instead there was a very loud women somehow indirectly related to the hotel (not sure what her job was exactly, or if she was in fact an employee) who sat next to me and basically gossiped about all the celebs that were staying there, etc. This was tacky and annoying. And the light on the manicure table was burnt out so the manicurist had stand and struggle to do my manicure in an awkward position on the pedi chair. It was uncomfortable for me, and I am certain it was uncomfortable for her too. We continue to love, love, love this hotel and have always felt they offer a premium product. We are returning in April 2011, even though the prices have gone up considerably \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least 25% over two years. We have booked through a Four Seasons Preferred Partner, and with this we get free breakfast and an $85 lunch credit. If you love great and friendly service, if you have lots of money to spend, and are okay with a busy hotel with lots of small children, this is the place to go.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel but Overpriced\u201d", "Author": "ramblindave", "ReviewID": "UR75836109", "Content": "We were there last week for three days and two nights.

We booked our trip months in advance, and both my husband and I called the resort to let them know of our special situation - that it was our anniversary, we were traveling with our 2 1/2 year old daughter, and that I would be 7 months pregnant by the time we got there. We requested that they give us a room that would be close to the elevators so that pregnant me and my toddler would have easier access. When we arrived we found lots of toys, books, and snacks for our toddler, and also a nice bottle of champagne and chocolates for our anniversary. But the one thing they seemed to have overlooked was our request to be close to the elevators, and after consulting the hotel map, we realized that not only were we far from the elevators, we were in the farthest possible room from the elevators. As soon as we realized this we called down to the front desk and asked them for a change of rooms. We were told that since it was a holiday weekend, there wasn't another room available. When I asked them why they didn't inform us of this earlier, they claimed that they did not know I was pregnant or that we requested a room close to the elevators. I suppose that is possible, but since both my husband and I both called, and the hotel noted that we were traveling with a toddler, it seemed suspect that they would not have noted our request for a room closer to the elevators. Some of you reading might be thinking \"what's the big deal?\" , but for anyone who has ever been pregnant, walking starts to get difficult around the 7th month of your pregnancy, not to mention a 2 1/2 year old also can't walk very far without wanting to be picked up. And all this would have been fine we were were able to leave the room in the morning and not come back to the hotel until the evening, but as anyone with a toddler would tell you, it is nearly impossible to not have to return to the room for something - kid's nap, diapers, snacks, toys, change of clothes, etc. - at least twice during the day. After a while we really dreaded the walk. The location of our room and the inability of the hotel to change our room is really my only complaint. Other than that the resort was wonderful - the hotel is beautiful, the food was delicious (and yes, pricey), the service was great, particularly around the pool and the ocean. The restaurants were all extremely accomodating towards parents dining with children - every one of them had crayons, toys, and ample highchairs for the kids. The kiddie pool was beautiful, the beach almost felt private and the water was very calm. You can also do light snorkeling right off the beach, there is a small reef about 30 yards from the beach that is teeming with fish and sealife. Our room was surprisingly big, as is our bathroom, and we never heard our neighbors, so great soundproofing! The hotel contracts out for babysitters, but you can get a sitter as late as 4 hours in advance. The Kids for All Seasons children's program and room was great, with lots of fun activities and excursions. The sunset dinners at Farraro's was my favorite part, the wait staff was so accomodating, taking photos after photos of couples and familes against a gorgeous Hawaiian beach sunset. The spa was small but tranquil, and I highly recommend getting a massage in one of their seaside cabanas.

We stayed 2 weeks on the club level (8th floor). The service that we received was above anything imaginable. They were at our beckon call. My 9 year old son did not want to leave. He spent many days at the Four Season's Kids Club. That was hard for Mom and Dad, we would describe ourselves as over protective. Within a few days we became very comfortable with process and people that ran the camp. (They made each clubber take a swimming test each day. If they passed they gave them a wrist band that allowed them to swim at the pool.) Here are some things we found to be above and beyond: 1. Concierges on the 8th floor. (Look for Kimberly she was fanstastic) 2. They have a car to takke you anywhere in Wailea. (We never waited more than 5 min's) 3. Pools (WOW) 4. Beach was perfect. (It has a reef right off the beach. My wife had a turtle swin up to her goggles) 5. Food (Great but, very very expensive) 6. Kid Club (Your kids will love it. They do crafts, swim, tour the resort on hunts, have a mini rock wall, show movies (needed down time), will feed lunch (each day they offered a buffet at the pool for kids), computer games,) 7. View - You will see when you arrive. 8. Need a drink at the pool or beach - Watch for them they will be around soon. 9. Always had a chair, umbrella, or cabana. Had to get up by 8 -9 am to get the good ones at the pool. 10. Beach walk - This was nice stroll. Take your camera. You will not believe the sunsets. 11.

While lounging by the pool, you are approached by staff members that offer cubes of either pineapple or watermelon, mini muffins, refreshing ice cold face towels, glasses of ice water, as well as frozen ice pops. (the ones wrapped in plastic that the staff would cut open for you) Another feature we enjoyed was the complimentary sunblock that was by the pool, and also by the beach. The hotel provided SPF 8, SPF 15, and SPF 30. One downside to this hotel was the adult only Serenity Pool. Unless you get there bright and early, you were not able to utilize this facility. There are only a certain number of chairs, and once they have all been reserved, you are put on a waiting list. My husband and I waited for almost three hours before we received a phone call, and at that point, we needed to start to get ready for dinner, so we were unable to claim our seats. Another negative to the Serenity Pool is the early closure. The area is only open until sunset. We found this unusual, as many people enjoy swimming in the evening. Another downside was the noises that we heard from our hotel room. We booked a mountain view room, and to our surprise, learned that our room was above the parking garage. We would hear horns and back up warning beeps, early in the morning. We are from New York, and are used to the noise, but were not expecting to hear that while vacationing. Overall my husband and I enjoyed our stay at the Four Seasons so much, that we have already began discussing the next time we want to vacation there.

We spent 7 days at the resort and everyday was amazing. We loved going to the infiniti pool for adults only. It's the newest addition to the hotel and the views are honestly breathtaking.

We decided upon the Four Seasons (FS) Maui because we wanted a first-rate experience and because of the overwhelming ratings here. We had developed high expectations based on the generally glowing reviews. We booked a garden-view room under the fifth-night-free promotion for ten nights 6/13-6/23 (paid for eight). I requested a refrigerator and microwave for convenience as we had our 2 \u00c2\u00bd year old son with us. Upon arrival at OGG our driver was waiting for us as we exited the aircraft, not down on the transportation level with all the other greeters. How they arranged that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never know. FS contracts with an upscale Maui company for airport transportation. We were promptly driven to the FS in an Escalade. Not cheap but nice to arrive in some style (~$220). Our return trip to the airport was via taxi happily arranged by the concierge. FS uses a specific (Maui Island Taxi?) company so I suspect they are reliable. The arrangement was automatically confirmed for us by the concierge the night prior to departure. Cost ~$60 before tip. No problems and we would use them again. Check in was efficient. We were upgraded to a garden-view executive suite from our standard garden-view room. I can only conclude that they had capacity and our ten-night stay justified the upgrade. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re nobody special and first time FS visitors. My math tells me we had a room that retails for $980 daily and we were paying $476 before taxes (reflecting promotion plus upgrade). No complaints here. Nice way to build customer loyalty. The room was ~850 square feet with a decent view of western Maui and the ocean. We had two balconies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one with loungers and the other with a table and four chairs for entertaining. We also enjoyed two large plasma televisions and a dining area. Our son loved \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sofa bed. Sure enough we had our microwave and actually had two refrigerators. We had a nice anniversary amenity waiting for us when we arrived, including a stuffed eagle-ray with the FS logo embossed on it for our son. The night before our departure we received a very nice dessert tray including a white chocolate conch shell we initially thought was real, a signed thank-you card and a Hawaii-themed children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book for our son. As for the grounds, as others have commented, they are really something - take the time to examine the flora and fauna. One thing I did not care for that I mentioned during check-out; on our last day a vendor was allowed to sell stuffed animals by the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool area. The concession was literally12-15 feet from the edge of the lower children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool. Now, they had a machine that actually injected stuffing into the animal of your choice. I suppose is there some novelty to that but it struck me as a bit tacky and opportunistic. It just did not seem right. Besides, junior already had his FS souvenir stuffed eagle ray. Rather than expound further about the stay I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d prefer to try and offer some useful observations and tips. As others have mentioned, things are not cheap here, come here with that in mind and that the cost is the cost. I guarantee that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a more enjoyable visit. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a budget I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d probably avoid this area. Full buffet breakfast is around $80 for two with tip. Kids eat free at Duo and Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Busiest time seems to be between 8:30 and 10:00 a.m. and there can be a wait if occupancy is up. I recommend getting up early with the sun, walk on the beach with a cup of complimentary coffee then grab an early breakfast. The weather and surroundings are beautiful. Sleep when you get home. Unless you are complete novices to the ocean and snorkeling, I recommend using the one-hour daily free gear rental (and float belt) and swimming off the south end of Wailea beach. You will notice several tour boats visiting the area daily. As long as the yellow flag is displayed the water is fine but always use good sense. We followed a sea turtle along the rocks perhaps 50 feet from shore. That was neat! If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re new to the ocean I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d consider asking the concierge for assistance in planning an organized trip that you are comfortable with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ocean is still the ocean and not to be taken lightly. We used the nanny service for toddler-sitting during our snorkel excursion. FS uses an outside company and the concierge will happily arrange it for you. Our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnanny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was a pre-school teacher and mom. Our son took to her immediately. They played on the beach and in the pool while we enjoyed the ocean. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a three-hour minimum at $18 per hour. Probably one of the cheapest conveniences in the area. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d easily use the service again (I wish we had\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). If you want to enjoy the nightly hula dance at the lounge I suggest getting a seat around 5:30 or so as it can fill-up pretty quickly. One of two fellows light the torches each night after the hula dancing (my son called him torch-man). They are friendly and glad to pose for pictures with you. Make reservations for dinner if you want a guaranteed table at any of the three restaurants. They can sell out quickly, unless you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind eating at 9 in the evening. Keep your eyes open for the daily activity sheet. They had a lei-making class for kids although my wife enjoyed it more than my son. All are welcome. My wife enjoyed the yoga class on the beach each morning. They have also meditation and tai-chi a couple times a week - all complimentary. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a vacation, try something new! Use the complimentary hotel car service to the Shops at Wailea. Get your souvenirs and snacks at the ABC store. We had a good dinner at Longhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. I liked the fact that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a local chain. Longhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also serves breakfast daily but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get buffet \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgrazing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 privileges or the FS view of western Maui. I have to admit we also had a decent dinner at Tommy Bahamas, also at the Shops at Wailea. The concierge desk handles Budget car rentals. We grabbed a car for a day to go into Lahaina \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very convenient and easy. As we were considering what size car to rent it occurred to me to ask what parking is like in Lahaina \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I was told tight. We opted for the small car. Traffic can also get pretty snarled during rush hour. Ask the concierge about conditions to avoid any unexpected surprises. We intended on spending most of our time at the resort so we did not book a car for the entire stay. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying more than a few days grab a car for an excursion and consider visiting the Safeway a couple of miles north for casual snacks or lunch items or beer to keep in the fridge. The food at the resort is generally quite good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it just became a bit much for us given the length of our stay and we started craving more basic items. The only real stumble we encountered was when we returned from our excursion to Lahaina. The bellman asked if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like our groceries delivered to our room as our hands were full with a tired child, a car seat and a backpack. I said yes and gave him our name and room number. The groceries were apparently delivered to another room and I ended up calling to ask where they had gone. The eventually found us. Not a huge deal but a bit odd and something that should not happen. And, we found our bed too soft for our middle-aged backs. You can request things you may not be accustomed to requesting elsewhere. On our second day I left a note for Housekeeping requesting chocolate milk for our son each evening as a bedtime snack. Each afternoon a box of chocolate milk was delivered to our room. On those days we had the DND on the door a voice message was left indicating the milk could not be delivered and to please call for delivery. The cost was minimal and the convenience was wonderful. At a dinner at Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s we requested cucumber in lieu of carrot/celery sticks as a side for our son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meal. Sure enough we got cucumber (no cost). At breakfast if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the exact item you want ask what they can do. If they have the ingredients they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do what they can. Coconut pancakes not on the menu? Just ask. Need a mango sliced? Just ask. The kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s club is open for younger kids (<5) when accompanied by an adult. Our toddler son loved afternoon visits there with my wife as a break between pool, sun and ocean. There are crafts, puzzles and DVDs to watch although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not big on video for our toddler. There is also a secured outdoor area for more physical play. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a small rock-climbing wall. We were always warmly welcomed. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not wealthy folks. This was a treat for us as a family anniversary celebration and we wanted to try the FS experience. It was not cheap but we all enjoyed ourselves as much as I believe we could at any major resort.

In fact I am your typical marriott or hilton guy. I dont have the money to go to the four seasons usually, and although Im far from poor I tend to watch what i spend. My wife and I splurged and decided to go to maui for a nice vacation. We were torn between Ritz and four seasons. Let me just say after seeing both there is no comparison. The four seasons is so much nicer. It did not rain once from July 3 to July 10 when we were there. Wailea hardly ever has rain. We checked in and everyone was extremely nice. Rooms are absolutely gorgeous. We were upgraded to a garden view room. (we could see the ocean) The resort is so beautiful, and they had a huge staff out at all times picking up leaves and taking care of flowers. The grounds were overwhelming. It was about 87 degrees the whole time we were there, but it felt good. There was a constant breeze that made it feel more like 80. Our main hangout was the serenity pool. Its just astounding how nice it is. The only problem, which is actually pretty nice, is they only allow enough people in as there are chairs. This means if its busy you may get put on a waiting list. (never longer than a few hours) The swim up bar is amazing. The bartenders were very friendly. Rob was one of the nicest there. He is a good bartender too. Eric another bartender that is amazing. He made the best drinks I've ever had. Ask him for his watermelon gin drink. Absolutely amazing and I hate gin. We did have an older man that wore a hat and sunglasses that worked around the pool that was rude, but other than that we had the friendliest staff. They constantly walk around and give you water or fruit. The hotel spares no expense in any of their landscaping. The whole place will amaze you all week. Everywhere you look there is something new to surprise you. We stayed on floor number 4, and we actually had a celebrity on the same floor as us. (She is the main character on the city) Everyone said that they have celebrities here ALL the time. Food was a major bummer here. Ate at all the restaurants but Spago. We didnt eat at spago because the others were so bad. It gets a little expensive. We ate at ferraros for lunch twice and dinner twice. Burgers for lunch are 19 dollars and wife had a little pizza for 22. Dinner is around 30-50. Duo was disappointing. I had a ribeye that was one of the worst Ive ever had for 46. I also had ahi tuna that was above average for 44. Our best meal was at nearby capische. Go around 6 to catch the beautiful sunset. For anyone on a budget check out Cafe O'lei in kihei. (5 mins away) or make the 20 min trip to a little place called beach bums. Beach bums is a bar the locals go to, but they had some great food for 10-30 bucks. All in all this resort is expensive. Its beautiful, and its worth every penny... but its alot. We had a blast and I feel that the experience was well worth the hefty cost. The other wailea hotels are not anywhere as nice as this one. The Grand Wailea is rundown and has a feeling of an overcrowded theme park with a ton of people that seem like they belong on myrtle beach with cut off jeans. The Marriott was pretty ugly and old. Food was terrible when we ate there. The Fairmont is the second nicest in the area, but all the white can get a little ridiculous... Also went down to Makena resort to catch our boat to Molokini. Makena is similar a marriott. The other hotels just werent that nice.... The sheraton in kaanapali didnt look that nice. Hyatt was nice and Ritz was nice... but once again nothing like the four seasons. The grounds werent as pretty, and the serenity pool at the four seasons is the most gorgeous pool ive ever seen. The ritz pool was unimpressive from what I saw. The other problem is all the rain at the ritz. Its rainy and windy. Who wants to go to the beach to have it rain. Go to wailea where it hardly ever rains and it is beautiful every day. You wont be disappointed. you might want to see if a conference is scheduled when you are there. we had GSK there when we were there, and they kind of felt like they ran the place. They were loud and some seemed like they just had no manners. The serenity pool is supposed to be quiet and relaxing and many were yelling or talking on cell phones. It also made the place crowded.

They aim to please you any way that they can. They go above and beyond your every single need, and they even anticipate the things that you will run into based on the sites that you will be visiting. The valet boys would ask us where we are going and give us the appropriate goodie bags to go with our itenaries. This is the type of service that you should get when you are vacationing in the most beautiful place on earth. The facility is wonderful. The pools are very beautiful. I recommend their serenity pool because it is on a higher deck and you do get a slightly better view of the ocean but you still don't see that much of the ocean though. In either pool you can wear the waves though so you really can't go wrong with either pool. The fitness area is a bit too small and the treadmills are outside so it gets muggy and hard to breath especially if you workout in the afternoon. Workout in the early morning instead. The weight room is unfortunately way too small but who comes here to lift weights?! They have a beautiful garden which I think is the best hidden secret of the resort because it is really serene, full of beautiful tropical flowers, and has several hamacks. There is nobody in sight for hours, and at night of course the famous tiki torches go up. I would spend 2-3 hours in the garden in the morning and enjoy my peace and quiet. The rooms are just very classic good four seasons standards - nothing to really add. The restaurants were very good but a bit too pricey even for New York (where I'm from) standards. But you didn't come to Maui for a cuinary trip, right? The Wailea beach and the resort path: being that this is my 3rd trip to Hawaii I have some good comparisons. I honestly think that the Wailea beach is the best beach so far in all of the Hawaiian beaches. (I've only been to Oahu and Maui so far, so I might change my mind later). Waikiki and Haunama bay are too crowded. Lanikai and Kailua beach have serious erosion problems (beautiful, regardless). North Shore Oahu too wavy and can break your neck. Ko Olina is impossible to get a parking spot. KaAnapoli is too crowded (albeit nice as well). Makena is beautiful but the waves are too scary. Now there is something about the Wailea beach that is just right. The turquois water is absolutely stunning and with the golden sand in it, it looks like flecks of gold under the bright Maui sun. The view is also breathtaking - you can see the west maui as well as the Lanai island. I would love to return to this area again some day. Now the resort path is shared by multiple mega resorts such as Grand Wailea, Fairmount, Marriot, and some other private rental condos, so it does get crowded especially in the late morning when people start to jog around, but that didn't bother me so much, perhaps I'm from a crowded place? Compare to the Wailer's Village or Waikiki, the South Maui is very peaceful and quite.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA Real Treat\u201d", "Author": "Aussies1", "ReviewID": "UR70434347", "Content": "Our family of five arrived at the Four Seasons after 4 days in Kaanapali. Upon checking out of our condo in Kaanapali we filled in time by driving to Twin Falls which is half way along the road to Hana. Quite a nice drive though not as amazing as I expected. Lunched at Mama's Fish House on the way back. Lovely atmosphere on a beautiful beach. Arrived at Four Seasons at check-in time to make the absolute most of our 3 days there. Were pleasantly surprised at our upgrade from POV to Ocean View. We were a little concerned at how we would all it in the room (after been spoilt in our beautiful spacious ocean front villa at Kaanapali Ali) but it proved to be large and very comfortable. Thoroughly enjoyed all the luxuries and great service at Four Seasons. Definitely the best choice in Wailea. Though our 14 year old son enjoyed the pools at Grand Wailea where friends were staying. Our 16 and 19 year old daughters loved sitting by the pool up on the grassy area which overlooked the beach. Found the adult pool a bit pretentious. Snorkelling on Wailea beach was fantastic. Very clear with many colourful fish and turtles. Much better than Black Rock in Kaanapali and probably even better than Honolua Bay which was also pretty good. Even the tour boats stopped outside Four Seasons for snorkelling. Yes, it is a very quiet area with not much to do but just make the most of the wonderful resort and relax for a few days. We had a car but only used it to drive to Wailea Hotel's restaurant Capishe. A lovely meal with great views at night. We also dined at Duo (had the $49 three course meal). It was pretty good but the service and atmosphere wasn't great. Probably should have dined at Spago. We also dined at Ferraro's which had a lovely night atmosphere on the beachfront. Average food though my gourmet 19 year old daughter said she had one of the best meals at this restaurant. Great games room with Billiards, Table tennis, etc and a separate video games room. We found the free internet service in the games room to be more than adequate for our purposes. Also free tea, coffee and newspapers each morning in the games room. Ridiculously priced boutique though judging by some of the guests at the hotel probably not a concern for them. The resort could do with a general store type shop to purchase essentials such as breakfast items. I walked to the Fairmont next door for these. Back home now in cold Melbourne, Australia.

This was my second trip to Maui (last trip was more than 10 years ago) and the first trip for my husband and 2 kids, ages 8 and 5. We were meeting up with my sister's family to celebrate her 15th wedding anniversary and all our kids birthdays were in June/July and our own anniversary in late June so it was a great reason to splurge a little for our trip. This was the first time that our family stayed in a hotel as nice and expensive as Four Seasons, usually I only stay at 3 star hotels or less. I did my research onlline first to find the ideal hotel for us in Wailea. My sister had stayed at Grand Wailea 5 years ago for her 10th anniversary but I wanted to try Four Seasons based on all the good reviews I read through Maui Revealed and Tripadvisor and especially since it included a lot of complimentary things that most other hotels would charge for. The concierge was excellent and e-mailed me back with my many questions I had as I was doing research of what I was planning to do when we got there. When we arrived, we were greeted with flower leis (the guys got painted macadamia nut leis (I think that's what they are) and personal greeting and taken to the hotel lobby with our luggage and our rental car taken for valet parking. My sister had reserved 2 mountainside rooms months in advance for the regular rack rate $425/night (we didn't care for the nicer views) and we requested to be near each other but unfortunately we were placed a floor above each other. This place is huge so it took a long time to get to the elevator from where our room was located just to get to each other's room, but we found the stairs to be a shortcut. When we arrived to our room, we were pleasantly surprised with a happy anniversary card (belated) as well with bottle of complimentary wine left in the refrigerator as well as some yummy goodies on the table in celebration for my daughter's belated birthday. The unfortunate part was that the ants from outside also found it to be yummy and thus we couldn't enjoy the goodies. So housekeeping had to come back and spray and I never bothered to call room service for the replacement. The next morning the ants followed the same scent trail despite no more food and I had to call housekeeping again but soon the ants disappeared with no food present. We were also pleasantly surprised with 2 spotted eagle ray stuffed animals left for my two children. On the day of my son's birthday (2 days later), we were pleasantly surprised with a drop off of balloons with a present (juggling balls) for his 8th birthday and they also included a present (wooden puzzle) for my daughter's belated 5th birthday (2 wks prior) at the same time. Later when I returned in the afternoon, a small dessert/cake with M&M's were left out on the table for him but of course the ants came back again. I had to call room service and housekeeping to let them know what happened again and this time, they delivered a new one in 1/2 hour after housekeeping came again and sprayed right away. My sister who was one floor below us in the room below had no issues with ants coming in despite food on the table. We had dinner at Spago the first night we arrived for my sister's anniversary and the food was EXCELLENT. We love Wolfgang Puck restaurants and the service was excellent, expensive but everything was great! We had poolside food as well for lunch and the food was okay but my sister didn't think the pizza was that great for the price they charge. We didn't get to try Duo or Ferraro restaurant but figured it was less expensive to eat off resort. We also tried out the complimentary outrigger canoe and booked this in advance and it was a good learning experience, and we left our 2 kids in complimentary Kids for All Seasons camp for the morning briefly (you would only pay $15 for lunch if they stayed for such). The kids had fun making a \"volcano\" in the sand, but I went back after we were done with the outrigger canoe and they rather be picked up than stay. if your child can not swim, you had to come down in the morning at 11 AM to watch them anyways when they were going to the keiki pool. In their game room, they had ping pong, video games (Guitar Hero and others), foozball and table shuffleboard and pool tables with complimentary internet/computer access. They also had a business center that was also complimentary which I used as well to print out boarding passes on day of departure. So I didn't need to use laptop or get/pay for internet access. I also tried their complimentary Zumba class and had a blast. Staff was helpful in finding complimentary cabanas near the poolside as well as down at the beach which was a nice plus, and setting them up with covering or umbrellas and providing towels, but of course we tipped them for their help. If you stayed at the poolside long enough, someone also comes out and gives out ice pops, as well as fresh pineapple or spritz your face and put cucumber slices on your eyes - these were kind of neat. The rooms were huge and spacious and the beds were comfortable. Nice small refrigerator with 2 water bottles given per day, with coffeemaker and usual coffee (would have been nice to have tea bags in the room), also had DVD player. Bathtub and separate shower with option to play various types of music in the bathroom. Bathrobes for the adults and little bathrobes for the kids - how cute. They even supplied kids' shampoo/bubble bath and sunscreen as well. They had turndown service in evenings as well. One day I left tip and daytime housekeeping didn't even take it. We also took complimentary shuttle down to shops of wailea and nearby restaurants in Wailea. They do charge overnight valet parking at $20/day but I wish they had option to self park. We never bothered taking our car out. Never tried the adult serenity pool, but they have a small keiki pool for the little ones and then a 3 1/2 foot pool area and then a larger family pool with hot tub for family and separate one for adult. Nothing fancy about their pools, but wasn't too crowded. There's not as much to do in Wailea compared to Kaanapali but it's less hot in Wailea and a bit windier in the afternoons. This is a great place to do serious R&R. I think it's great if you come as couple without kids or come with kids who don't mind staying in the kids camp. Of course there's the option to arrange for water activities such as sailing/snorkeling in nearby Maalea Harbor which we didn't end up doing after all in Wailea (we canceled a sailing trip due to recent sunburn and seasickness from another rafting/snorkeling trip we took few days prior while in Kaanapali). If you don't mind paying a bit more and tipping people to be pampered (I wish I knew the tipping etiquette well enough so I'm not under or overtipping), and have many amenities included, this is a great place to stay. I wouldn't recommend it so much with families with teenagers b/c I think they would get bored more easily and the pools at Grand Wailea would make more sense for them although Grand Wailea is much more expensive and charges extra for cabanas, etc. Overall there were more posiitives than the minor negatives that we experienced.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cElegance & Perfection\u201d", "Author": "SamuraiBlue", "ReviewID": "UR70097895", "Content": "Hands down the best hotel in Wailea, and possibly on the island of Maui.

We are experienced travelers. I think that this is the best hotel on the planet. I have not experienced a comparable level of service anywhere. Pools - We had no problem with pool chairs and cabanas at either the Serenity Pool or the main pool. The hotel was at/or close to capacity but you would never know it. Everyone is provided cups with water, that are continuously refilled, frozen pops are served poolside, cucumbers for the eyes with a cold cloth, and of course the evian spritzers. Food - Breakfast and Lunch are expensive. If you live in a major metropolitan area, then you will not find dinners at the Four Seasons or area restaurants any more expensive than dinner in a nice restaurant in a major metropolitan area. We ate at Ferraro's and Spago and they were wonderful. The ocean side ambiance of Ferraro's at night is truly wonderful. For breakfast , we tried the different hotels and Longhi's at the Wailea shops. They all were good but expensive. The best, for breakfast were Duo's at the Four Seasons and Longhi's at the Wailea shops. Lunches were spent mostly poolside with menus from Ferraro's. Lunch is expensive, but honestly, my wife and I would share a sandwich after having had a big breakfast. To reduce breakfast and lunch expense, it is worth a trip or two to the shops at wailea to pick up cereal, milk, deli etc to keep in the fridge in the room. It can make a significant impact. Also, it is worthwhile buying your favorite liquor at the shops, it you enjoy having a drink on your lanai in the evening. The Room - the rooms are clean and very nice. The hotel's grounds are spectacular. We stayed in a garden-view room that had a private patio. It was wonderful to go out on the lanai in the evening , read, surf the internet, talk etc. We were offered an upgrade for $50/night to a partial ocean view room or $100/night for an ocean view room. I do not think the partial ocean view rooms are worth the extra money. The hotel is set back, and I do not think the view was really better than the garden view room we had. Likewise, the ocean view room is also set back.. but at least you have a direct view of the ocean. I probably would have spent an extra $50 a night for the ocean view.. but our room was very comfortable. The rooms in all three categories are the same and have the same amenities. Getting Around - The hotel does a wonderful job of providing you with free transportation around Wailea. We didn't take a taxi anywhere in Wailea. However, as soon as you go outside Wailea (dinner at Sorento's) you need a taxi. Fitness Center - One of the best that I have seen at a hotel. Cons - $6 a night to pay for internet in a room that costs (at standard room rates) $595 a night??? The Hotel does not nickel and dime you except for the internet. The only service problem we experienced was our first day when the maid service apparently forgot to make up our room. We spoke to the front desk and at 3 pm the room was made up . However they returned for the turn down service at 5:30 PM while we were getting ready to go out for the evening. We went to the front desk, told them our typical schedule and we had no problems for the remainder of our stay.

My wife and I were traveling without our 8-year old daughter, seeking some quality time together in luxurious surroundings without having to worry about the quality of the Kids Club and those other concerns that accompany family travel. The Pros, Cons, and everything in between... Location: Maui is a beautiful little island, lush with beautiful tropical foliage and blessed with incredible weather. During our visit, the weather was consistently outstanding: warm, sunny, with mild trade winds virtually every afternoon. Great weather for being outside, catching some rays, snorkeling, or just about anything else one might wish to do outside. The resort's location is quite good and the beach (public) is conveniently located at the back of the resort, just a short walk down some steps. While it is a public beach, it is not particularly crowded. We stayed in a Prime Ocean View Club Suite (on the private access 8th floor) and enjoyed it. Be sure to check out the photos on the website, because even when paying top dollar for a Prime Ocean View Club Suite room, you'll still only have an angled view of the ocean and quite a bit of \"interior courtyard\" (which, while relaxing and nicely done, isn't what most of us want to see). We knew this going in, so we were less disappointed than others who might have expected a \"true\" ocean view. The room was well appointed, nicely maintained, and sufficiently spacious. The bed was very comfortable and provided a reasonable balance of support and comfort. The bathroom was quite large, with a good layout, lighting, excellent water pressure, and a deep tub. The Four Seasons got this part right. The Club Lounge was of a very high standard and compared favorably with any we've experienced anywhere in the world. The team there (including Pat, JiJi, Chris, and all the others) does a great job; they really make you feel welcome and will do their very best to take care of you. The various presentations throughout the day are generous and of very high quality, and for those inclined to enjoy a drink or two, alcohol is included in the price. If one were traveling with a family, this could be a particularly attractive option. On some days, we noticed couples who were virtually having their dinners using the afternoon presentations and evening dessert offerings. The restaurants on-site are generally of high quality. Spago delivered as expected, stylishly presented, tasty cuisine, with impeccable service and a price tag to match. We found Duo to be underrated: here, again, the service was quite good and the food quality very high---they fall down on atmosphere, though. Be sure to try the Gingerbread Peach Caramel sundae---my wife claims to have discovered a new \"favorite\" dessert. And, if you don't have room for a \"full dessert,\" they offer smaller, \"tapas-sized\" versions. Very thoughtful. Ferraro's is overrated: while the atmosphere is good, along with nice views of the beach, the service was not of an equal standard and came across as amateurish and a bit coarse for the Four Seasons. There are many other choices available off property of equal or higher quality and within a short drive by taxi (US$10) or for free using the House Car. We strongly recommend Capische---very romantic, great views, and very good food. From what we saw of the Fairmont and the Grand Wailea, we were very happy with our choice. The former came across as very tired and worn, while the latter was sprawling and constantly filled with masses of bodies milling about, particularly large, LOUD groups of companies on business / incentive travel. We could hear the crackle of the PA systems down the beach on a few evenings, accompanied by the monotonous droning of the MC who welcomed \"winners from across the globe...do we have anyone here from Europe...Canada, okay, that'll do...\" We were very happy to be ensconced within our tranquil sanctuary at the FS. The pools: the adult-only Serenity pool was not our cup of tea. One major design flaw: the tile captures and retains heat very efficiently and will effectively sear the soles off your feet. The US$350 private cabanas seem pointless and designed for posers and newlyweds who are enjoying the largesse of their parents. For anyone else, we can't imagine \"why.\" If you relish \"being seen\" and enjoy wearing full make-up and jewelry while catching a few rays and speaking as loudly as possible about your last 3 vacations at other FS resorts, you'll definitely want to consider this venue. We strongly preferred the beachside seating, with outstanding, unobstructed views of the ocean and islands, and delightful service throughout the day: endless glasses of ice-cold water, pineapple and other frozen treats to refresh you, cucumber eye wraps and Evian facial spray, someone to clean your sunglasses, etc. These services and treats are truly memorable and distinguish the FS from other properties. The fitness club is well appointed and should meet the needs of most everyone except \"hard core\" free weight buffs. The spa is small, but of good quality. No need to come early as there isn't much to enjoy beyond your treatment. And the treatments are priced at the higher end of the luxury spa continuum. For those of you who have traveled across Asia or in the Caribbean, you will be disappointed by the price vs. value equation. In terms of activities, one could easily stay at the resort and spend the day sunning, swimming, snorkeling (right off the public beach---my wife and I saw eels, sea turtles, and all kinds of beautiful fish, anemones, and coral), etc. We rented a car for a few days and took the \"Road to Hana\"---a tortuous trail with relatively little to see as the waterfalls were quite weak. But the weather was great, and we stopped at Paia for breakfast on the way out and an early dinner on the way back. Good food in this funky little \"hippy town\": outstanding macadamia nut banana pancakes at Charley's (one order is enough for two people); great gelato at OnoGelato; and exceptional pizza at FlatBread (if you're a fan of Mellow Mushroom, you'll really like this organic pizza). Lahaina is also worth visiting: lots of touristy t-shirt shops, but also some good restaurants, great art galleries, and jewelry to suit most tastes and budgets. While we didn't have our daughter with us, the FS Maui definitely came across as very \"kid-friendly\" and the children we saw here, many in the 2-10 year old range, seemed quite happy. We would definitely consider returning to this resort, especially with our daughter. Overall, a very enjoyable stay. Everything here is done very well and you pay handsomely for it. Rather than highlighting anything that was truly exceptional, what was most memorable about this stay was the absence of anything negative. A subtle difference, but one that should resonate with those who have traveled extensively and enjoyed high-end properties across the globe.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAmazing\u201d", "Author": "jcyy", "ReviewID": "UR69538475", "Content": "There is a reason why this particular hotel gets the best ratings and is one of the best hotels in North America. It's all to do with the excellent service that the staff provides for every guest that enters their property. No matter who you are, whether you are just having dinner or on your honeymoon, the staff are polite, helpful and always smile. It makes a world of difference when the service is this good. The \"good\" stuff: - The staff. Really, I can't stress this enough. - The property grounds are always spotless, yet you don't ever see anyone cleaning or pruning the gardens. - Great pool service, clean pools, great cabanas, complimentary classes, children's toys and scuba diving taster. - Beach service is just as good. They'll set up your chairs and umbrellas, come round with mini muffins, water and fruit. 1 hour free snorkel hire. The sand is so soft and there's no debris to be aware of. If you can swim out far enough there is a reef with lots of colourful sealife. - Chamber maids do an excellent job. They leave plenty of towels, bathroom amenities, water. - Free tea and coffee outside DUO's in the mornings. - Concierge are efficient and have some great recommendations for whatever you may need. - There is an empty fridge in the room, so feel free to stock it up. - Use of a beach tote was very helpful when it came to days out. Valet will provide you with extra towels and bottled water. - We ate in all the restaurants and thought that Spago's was probably the best. They change the menu daily depending on the produce they get. The food was delicious, the service was not too intrusive and the views of sunset are priceless. The \"not so good\" stuff: - Paying for wifi. Surely a hotel of this standard would have free wifi for their hotel guests? It seems silly to be that you are charged daily plus an internet tax! - I saw a few ants in the bathroom. They were tiny so I can understand that they may get in . - The safe in our room didn't work properly for the first day so we called for maintenance to come and take a look. Thinking that the battery was flat they changed it quickly and left. The next day the same thing happened so they changed our safe to a different one. Very quick and efficient. Third day....again, the safe wasn't working. We just ended up locking our valuables in a suitcase. - Food and drinks by the pool weren't as good as they should have been for the prices that you pay. Alternatives are to eat at the restaurants or go to nearby Wailea shops and grab something there. Recommendations: - Renting a car. We splashed out on a convertible Mustang which is great with the roof down. Visit some of the quieter towns on Maui, explore other beaches. Valet at the hotel is $20 per night. Valet to other restaurants are around $8-10 (free with validation). Shopping malls are free with validation. - Bring your own snorkel gear and visit the many beaches on Maui. Long beach, Turtle Beach (where you will definitely spot a turtle or two). - Sunrise bike tour to Mount Haleakala. We booked through the Concierge and it was a great experience and lots of fun. - Drive to Hana. If you're brave enough to drive this then ask Concierge and they will provide you with a cd detailing places to visit on the drive to Hana. Do not attempt the unpaved roads, it isn't nice and a lot of car rental companies will not cover you if you breakdown along this stretch of road. Bring plenty of food, drinks, suncream. You'll need flipflops, trainers, towels and swimwear. Bring a waterproof camera too because there are some beautiful hidden waterfalls along the way. - Make reservations for the restaurants early sometimes a week early if you are going during the peak season. Sunset is the most popular times for meals because the views are so beautiful. - Try and make time for the outrigger canoe programme. It's informative and great fun. Again book way in advance as it's so popular. - If you're not keen on surfing then you could try paddle surfing. It requires some good balance but it's lots of fun and a great work out.

The resort was a perfect blend of luxury, pampering and beauty. What set's this property apart is the staff. When is the last time you said what a great job the valet does when they get your car? Every person who works at the property wants you to enjoy this special resort, from the valet to the pool attendant. We rented a car and took road trips several days and then truly relaxed the next few days at the serenity adult only pool. We never had a problem getting a lounge chair. The resort was sold out during our stay and it never felt crowded. Five days into our ten day stay we were upgraded from a partial ocean view to a prime ocean view. The front desk knew it was our honeymoon and went our of their way to make it even better when space was available. Restaurants on property were excellent - We loved the menu at Spago which changes daily and also the view from the outdoor patio at Ferraro. It is expensive, but not more so than any other top level restaurant on the island. Only two small complaints - the drinks at the pool bar and lobby bar were just OK. For $16 a drink they were not worth it, and not that special. A second small complaint is charging for Wi-Fi on property - seems petty when you are paying $600+ a night. We will be back and if you are considering the Ritz on Maui - the Four Seasons is head and shoulders above in every way. We had a great lunch at the beach side restaurant at the Ritz after snorkeling at Honolua Bay ( an absolute must visit as this is where all the snorkel cruises go - you can drive there, park and walk to this unbelievable reef). Ritz is nice, but again, you get what you pay for - the Four Seasons is the top resort in Maui if not all of Hawaii.

Complimentary sunblock and ice water infused with cucumber are always on hand at the pool as well, which was such a nice touch! The service is exceptional.

You can walk there, but it's a little tricky to find a pathway up to the main road off of the beach access path. We used the complimentary golf cart service to take us to lunch one day at a nearby pizza place. It was wonderful! Spago, Duo, and Ferraro's on property were all amazing. The Reuben sandwich at Ferraro's was to die for. If you like to work out on vacation, their outdoor cardio area is beautiful. You can run on a treadmill or use an elliptical with a view of the ocean. That was enough motivation to get me down there each day! You must rent snorkel gear (free for an hour - that's all you really need!) and swim around the reef right off of the beach. We saw sea turtles, eels, and other beautiful fish without having to swim far at all. We also went scuba diving from the beach. The Four Seasons has their own dive center right on property. So convenient! FS Maui had the best beach and best swimming area of the 3 locations - no rocks or stones to avoid while swimming like other Hawaii beaches. All in all, the Four Seasons in Maui was our favorite spot out of the three FS locations we visited in Hawaii.

We rented one in Vegas at Bellagio and it was fantastic. This one, not so much. I was impressed how staff greeted me by my name each time they interacted with us.

For 35 pp you can get practically everything on the rm service menu for a fraction of the price! The hillside cabanas are AMAZING and lend a fantastic view of Wailea Beach, which I found a great compromise since alcohol is not allowed on the beach thus there is no beach service. The hillside cabanas give you a feel of being on the beach but you have the service! Speak of the service, all I can say is WOW! The Four Seasons has service down to a fine art. It's impeccable! They don't ask you for a room number when you charge something to your room, they ask for your last name! How's that for personal? I liked not feeling like a room number!

Ferraro's was our favorite for lunch and dinner. We tried Spago but it didn't live up to the hype. Ferraro's just have a more romantic atmosphere and we liked the food better. We used the gym and outdoor cardio. The equipment is TOP NOTCH and I loved being outside while working out. I did not use the spa but I did go to look at their locker room. They only offer a wet sauna and showers, no other added amenities. I was disappointed in that as I expected their spa to be larger. The frozen mai tais in the pineapples were our fave! The grounds are just immaculate and stunning, everywhere you turn it's beautiful. I was a bit confused at the lack of in room toiletries. We are used to full toiletries in our rooms at other places we've stayed and I didn't even see a shower cap until we got into the suite. Now, don't get me wrong, all I would have had to do is call for it, but I'm just noting this. Valet was great, as was the concierge. I used the business center and the in room wireless and loved both. You MUST do the outrigger canoe!!! by far one of the BEST things we did while we were in Maui!

The resort was full while we were there but we didn't have to get to the pool at 7 to get a chair or anything, there was always availability. The rooms no longer have whole bean coffee and grinders, they are auto drip cuisnart makers if anyone was counting on whole bean coffee grinders.

The hotel is located in Wailea and is situated on a very nice beach flanked on either side by the Grand Hyatt and the Fairmont. The area is very busy and is a center for upscale resorts and high end second homes. We stayed at the hotel during the busiest time of the year (over NYE) so I think this negatively affected our experience. The hotel has a lovely open lobby with a view of the sea, the grounds and the pool. Our room was spacious and finished in a neutral fashion.

Staff are generally very friendly and attentive. The concierge staff is very helpful although we did come across one unhelpful concierge. There is a tennis court located on the roof where we had a tennis lesson with a pro who was more interested in getting ready for his next tennis match than teaching us some basics. My main problem with the hotel is that the main pool and adult pool were always crowded. There is an adult only pool but you have to get there by 7am to get a spot. I know the hotel was at full capacity but you could never relax by either pool as there was no space and everybody was on top of each other. I think the resort could be designed better to comfortably accomodate guests during busy times. In addition, the beach is relatively small for an area with so many large resorts. Some of the other large resorts seemed to have bigger pool areas and I didn't get the impression that they were as crowded.

Not only was the car ready but they also packed a couple of blankets (which came in handy) and bottles of water for the trip. The service by the pool is truly top notch as they would set up your chairs for you, refill your ice water constantly throughout the day, provide sunscreen, and give you multiple treats throughout the day (pineapple, jello, ice pops, cucumbers for your eyes just to name a few). The service is so good they make it hard to leave the resort which can get expensive. Breakfast at Duo was good but it cost us $85 and $95 for the buffet and a la carte respectively which is crazy in my opinion. The lunch fare at the pool is pricey as well with just about every option costing at least $20 (quesadilla's were great). We ate dinner at Ferraro's and I was not impressed with the food but the decor/setting of the restaurant was great. The food at the Lobby Lounge was good (very simple small menu) and it is a nice setting to have a casual dinner and drinks as they have nightly entertainment. We also at dinner at Spago which was excellent. Everything we ordered was excellent but make sure to save room for dessert because the chocolate souffle was A+. We also got an oceanside couples massage in their open aire huts which was amazing and might have been the highlight of our stay. It was definately worth the $400 and the spa runs daily specials so we were able to upgrade from a 50 minute to 80 minute for free. There were a suprising number of families and little kids there but we barely knew they were there. They weren't loud and didn't cause a lot of comotion in the pools. If it does bother you they do have an adults only serenity pool which is also very nice. An extra bonus while we stayed here was Adam Sandler, Jennifer Anniston, Brooklyn Decker, and Andy Roddick were staying at the hotel because they were filming a movie at the Grand Wailea which is next door. All in all staying here is expensive but in my opinion well worth it and I would definately want to come back.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, D.C.", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, but overrun by children\u201d", "Author": "crh436", "ReviewID": "UR62764709", "Content": "Two single girls were looking for a relaxing beach getaway from stressful jobs in a beautiful location. I have been to Maui many times, but this was my first time indulging in a place as nice as the Four Seasons. I had heard nothing but good things about the hotel. Unfortunately the hotel was nothing like I imagined it would be. While the service was absolutely great and the rooms were nice, the hotel is just overrun by families and children. It felt like I was on a Disney cruise ship. There were lines for everything and there was no respite from the families and children. I have no idea how honeymoons occur at this location. The adults only pool is a nice feature, but its tough being relegated to a tiny portion of the property when you are paying $700+/night. Also, the adults only pool was overrun by an on-site convention of adults who were getting pretty loud and drunk all day. There wasn't an attempt to keep the area quiet. We noted our concerns with the manager on the first day and asked to be transferred to another Four Seasons property (e.g., Big Island, Lanai). The hotel said these locations were full and would likely suffer from the same spring break crowds of families in any event. Management said families and this sort of atmosphere was a spring break phenomenon. They did send us free chocolate fondue and a handwritten note expressing regret that our experience was different that we envisioned. I would definitely avoid this place from Feb.15-April 15 if you don't have a family or are looking for romance or serenity. I have to imagine that the focus in on families the rest of the year as well though. If you are an adult, you will be relegated to a tiny portion of the resort and take a backseat to the hotel's efforts to entertain children (e.g., cotton candy machine by the swimming pool).

It turned out to be the best vacation my wife and I had since our honeymoon. We landed late in the evening, but we were greeted with smiles, leis, and an upgrade to an executive suite. Everything was perfect - friendly staff, impeccable facilities, perfect beach. There is even a \"Serenity\" pool, separate from the main pool, with no kids allowed. If you do have kids, the place was pretty child friendly. We saw many families with babies, most of whom were offered poolside playpens, beach/pool toys, their own kiddie pool, and a kid's menu at every restaurant. As we mentioned, we were upgraded to an executive suite. This room was about 1000 sq ft, had a bedroom with an en-suite bath, and separate living/dining areas. There were also two balconies overlooking the ocean. The bathroom was huge, with a great shower, separate tub, toilet closet, vanity, and double sinks. The rooms are turned over twice per day, and the staff had an almost telepathic feel for when you left the room. We never heard them knock on our door. We only returned to a clean room. Our only complaint was the queen sized bed. We worked out in the gym several times. The cardio equipment is outdoors and over looks Wailea beach - can't beat that. The weight room featured brand new equipment, and there are several complimentary classes offered throughout the day - yoga, pilates, tai-chi. The on-site restaurants were pricey, as expected, but every meal we had was delicious. If you eat dinner on the resort, keep in mind, there are prix-fix menus at Spago , Duo and Ferraro's for $49 after 830 PM (830 is standard dinner-time for us anyway). The poolside fare was also expensive ($20 for most lunch entrees), but pretty tasty compared to most resort lunch menus. For lighter dinners, the lobby lounge has live music, drinks, and a short menu until 11 PM. We ate off the resort several times. Wailea is a resort town only, and is about 3 miles from the next non-resort town, Kihei. Cabs are expensive, about $16 to Kihei (30 cents per 1/10th of a mile!), so consider renting a car if you plan on leaving the resort frequently ($60 per day for a compact or $315 per week, plus $20 per night if you plan on keeping it at the resort). Keep in mind things close down early. Last seating at most restaurants is at 930 PM and there is little nightlife in Maui. We went to get shave ice one evening after dinner, only to find they close at 7 PM! During our stay, we arranged two outings through the concierge: the sunrise, downhill bike ride on Mt Haleakala and a car rental for the road to Hana. The bike ride was awesome. It starts at 245 AM, so you can catch the sunrise at the top of the volcano. Painful, but well worth seeing. The ride down the volcano is 38 miles, but 99.9% downhill. No pedaling necessary. Amazing views, three different climates, and we had terrific guides. You ride down the middle of the road, but are flanked by one guide in front, and the tour van in back, so you are never threatened by traffic. Overall, an amazing experience. The road to Hana is a must. This may be the most beautiful drive in the world. The road winds up and down the mountainous north, east and southern coastline with breathtaking views the entire way. The hotel concierge gave us a guidebook that pointed out many stops along the way, including many short hikes, black sand beaches, spectacular waterfalls, and scenic overlooks. The road itself is not for the timid driver. There are many hairpin turns, blind turns, and many one-lane bridges. If you continue along the south shore to get home, the road is unpaved for about 4 miles, with another 15 miles with poorly paved roads. Max speed, about 15 MPH unless you get an SUV. Be careful, taking this route voids your car rental warranty. The Four Seasons Maui is a sure thing.

I went on an art tour of the premise and since I was the only one I got a solo tour. * The chocolate croissants are amazing. * They have twice daily turn down service. Some tips: * We stayed in the cheapest hotel room, and as a result had to walk pretty far to get to the elevator. We got a pretty good rate through Expedia for both flight and hotel, so it came to about $380 per night. If you want an ocean view it's another $400 per night. * I would suggest avoiding the food there. There are so many delicious local options in Kihei, like Izakaya Matsu for Sushi, that you can have a great meal for $80 for 2 at a sushi restaurant... Or you can pay $80 per plate at the hotel. I am a major foodie, and I find that a lot of fine dining at hotels, maybe one or two dishes are amazing, but the rest isn't worth $80. For example, we had brunch at Duo, a restaurant in the Four Seasons and the bacon and chocolate croissants were amazing, but the rest of the food was average/good, not amazing. * Rates are highest during the winter season. During the Christmas/NY season, it's like season tickets there. People who stay there before gets a choice to return, and it's a minimum of 7 night stay. Other people go to the waiting list.

Sightings included Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler (staying at the Four Seasons and filming a new movie at the Grand Wailea next door) if you're into celebs. This is one reason i assume the resort is so pricey, expect $80+ for two (lunch/dinner) and $150+ for two (dinner). Ferrraro's is great for lunch but dinner was mediocre. Try the Shops at Wailea for a great burger joint; Ruth's Chris, Longhi's, and Tommy Bahama's Grille are there as well, all within walking distance from the hotel. The ABC Store and various shops in the Shops at Wailea should suit your snacking, shopping, and art gallery needs at fair prices. Shops include everything from Billabong to Louis Vuitton (LV is cheaper in Maui than elsewhere, ask the store clerk). Overall the Four Seasons Maui is an incredible hotel, at a cost. Had an ocean-view room but heard the mountain-view is nice as well. Bring your checkbook, or at least try the Shops at Grand Wailea as an inexpensive alternative.

The room was beautifully decorated and had a huge semi-private courtyard with a partial ocean view. Every day, fresh orchids were put in our room. At night, his and hers slippers were set by our bedside. The grounds are just amazing: lush gardens, tucked-away hammocks and seating areas, and breath-taking views from every angle. No detail has been overlooked. The spa is worth splurging on. We enjoyed a couples massage in a cabana overlooking the beach. It was the perfect way to begin our vacation. If you go to the spa, you must try out the showers in the locker room. Bathing in these high-tech showers is a spa treatment all by itself. The pools, like everything else, are stunning. The pools are surrounded by beach cabanas and comfortable lounge chairs. Pool attendants come by throughout the day and offer goodies like chilled aloe, popsicles, or ice cold water. Yes, the serenity pool fills up quickly, but it is worth a visit at least one day. We dined at Spago and Duo for dinner and at Ferraro's for lunch. All of the restaurants were very good but the service was the highlight of each. The views from the restaurants are spectacular. We ate lunch while watching whales breach and play. What could be better? Our favorite part of the hotel had to be the beach. It is a perfect, clean, and uncrowded beach that is just steps from the hotel. Be sure to go snorkeling near the rocks to the left of the beach. There are some amazing sights in that area. Snorkel gear is free for guests for one hour each day. In addition, for around $30.00 the hotel offers paddle boards, surf boards, and sea kayaks to rent. We loved sea kayaking. Two huge sea turtles came right up to the kayak to say hello.

I have been to the hotel 3 times on group corporate travel, but this was the first time out of my own pocket and with family. Wow.

They upgraded our room from mountain (which is actually overlooking the parking garage) to garden view and upon arriving there was chilled champagne, a rose and a card congratulating us on our anniversary. The room is connected by glass sliding doors to a small semi-private lawn and chairs. A hedge gives some privacy and you can overlook the croquet court which has a large whale statue. Very beautiful grounds including some more secluded spots. On floor 4 there was a garden, statue, and places to lounge if you want to get away from people - they upkeep the grounds here perfectly. On floor 6 there is a basketball area as well as 2 tennis courts. You can request rackets and play anytime for free, and they offer lessons by a professional for a fee if desired. There are chairs with remote control mist to cool off. They also have cold water available at multiple areas here. We really enjoyed these little hideouts! Duo's for breakfast was very nice, you can get the buffet (different choices up to $34/person) or a single plate for a lower price. The eating area is outside nearby to the children's pool but there were so few kids around that it was very serene. The food was great, you can ask the chef to prepare a number of items including omelets with shrimp, and waffles. They have a variety of fruit and items for kids as well. They bring out a complementary mini drink of the day which is some variant of a yogurt smoothie which was also good. They have newspapers and Times Fax available for free as well. It was a great breakfast. Ferraro's for lunch by the adult pool was also very good, and my husband thinks their burger was the best around. Their blueberry mojito was wonderful. I had the lobster sandwich which was lobster on white bread - good, but I'd recommend trying something else unless you are a big lobster fan. The main grounds is gorgeous and has a heated pool and fountain. The beach is pristine, warm water, not much wind (especially compared to Oahu and the Big Island), crystal clear water that you can see through to the bottom, and a good amount of wave activity for fun. An attendant will come around with water glasses. By far this is the best beach of all the locations I visited during my stay. (I was disappointed in how rocky Waikiki beach is in the water!) Next door is Grand Wailea but this is clearly the place for kids, they've even got an attendant who's sole job it is to bring the tarzan rope over for kids to use. So we were glad to be at the four seasons instead of Grand Wailea since it was just us two. If we were to go back with kids, we'd likely stay at the Grand Wailea instead of the Four Seasons though. They advertised a hula and torch lighting ceremony but we couldn't find it during its advertised time. There is a person singing though. We signed up for a scuba clinic but the water was too choppy for the ocean scuba so that portion was canceled. They said they'd be more than happy to call in an instructor for the pool portion just for us, which was very nice of them, but we declined. All in all this is a pristine place to stay with what appears to be the best beach anywhere in Hawaii. My husband and I are a little unused to all the attention we got there, as we're more accustomed to the 'simple' life, but if you have the money to spend, its a great place to go. We saw two celebrities while we were there, but we understand they are there to get away from the world like we are, so we left them alone and will honor their privacy by not listing their names. Alternatively, we found a small amount of parking just south of the hotel, so one could probably stay at an alternative location so as to save on the cost(we paid $500/night which seems to be the cheapest you can get), and then park here to access this fantastic beach.

We wanted to try something different in Maui, and the Four Seasons Maui did not disappoint. The service at the resort was exceptional. Prior to our arrival, they secured dinner reservations for us, stocked our minibar with some hard to find items (my wife is pregnant and loves diet ginger ale), and made spa appointments. We booked a garden view room which promised no view of the ocean, but we had a stunning view of the ocean from our room. The room itself was very large and quite comfortable. The bed was very nice. The marble bathroom was quite large and nice. The grounds of the hotel themselves were stunning. The pool and beach area were quite stunning. The service at the pool could not have been better. The staff went beyond and above the call of duty in every way. The food served poolside was excellent in every way. Spago's was exceptional, and Ferraros was quite good for lunch and for dinner. To reserve a prime cabana with ultimate shade and top notch views, you had to get up early. But the cabana was free and I was waking up early anyway. The adult pool is somewhat odd. Cabanas are not free and few seats offer views of the ocean. The large pool complex seemed a much better bet for us. Modern Family was filming while we were there. Despite the staff's best efforts to minimize the inconvenience, it was annoying and distracting to have them there. I will say that the novelty was interesting for about the first 30 minutes but the novelty ran out shortly thereafter, let alone the 3 days they were in the pool area. The resort offers only valet parking which was fine by us because the valets were great. We left the resort a few nights for dinner, and the service was always great. Also, I had a computer crisis while there and the concierge went above and beyond the call of duty to help me solve my problem. The spa was adequate but nothing exceptional. The services were great but the facilities were quite lacking. The Hualalai spa is infinitely better in all respects. With that said, they did also offer foot and neck massages while you lounged by the pool which were quite nice. The lobby bar with live music nightly and tapas was quite pretty and quite nice. Highly recommend it. We did not go to Duo's for breakfast or dinner, but others raved about the breakfast. There is a coffee hut at the beach serving coffee, muffins, fruit and bagels if you are not in to the breakfast buffet and you can charge your room. March is a great time of year for whale watching. It was amazing what you could see from the pool area. Also, the weather could not have been better for our trip. As compared to Hualalai, Maui offers a much better beach, more (and to our mind better) food options, and equally beautiful views. It is a bit easier to obtain a prime pool cabana view at Hualalai without getting up as early, but the rooms are much nicer at Maui (except for the fabulous outdoor showers in the lower level rooms at Hualalai). The crowd is different at both. The Maui crowd is hipper and more age diverse than Hualalai. Hualalai is more secluded and private, but Maui is in the middle of the action. There are pros/cons to both places, but the bottom line is that both are fabulous places with different strengths. Relative to the other resort options in Maui, if your budget allows, there is no reason to stay anyone other than the Four Seasons Maui. All in all a fabulous experience and it is hard to imagine a better experience. The crowning achievement at the hotel is the level of service. Every single person was extraordinary.

FS Maul promotes how many free activities they have and they are right to do so. The outrigger canoe trip at the Ritz is about $100 (although it is much longer than the free FS offering). Spago had decent food and stellar service and views. Duo's breakfast buffet wonderful and more or less worth the price. Even the shops on-site were interesting. Every day, local artists would display their wares, some of which were quite good. The only flaw we could find with the resort was its geography and general un-Hawaiian-ness. The setting and beach could belong to a beachside resort anywhere (CA, Florida, etc.). The rooms are just about identical to the ones at FS Las Vegas or Maui - there is really no Hawaiian look to the rooms or public areas (the art collection is very much Hawaiian, though). As for choosing between FS Maui and the Ritz - visit the beaches at the Ritz and walk the Kapalua Ocean Trail - then head back to FS Maui for the night.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cUp to Four Seasons Standards\u201d", "Author": "JVC1967", "ReviewID": "UR58326674", "Content": "A beautiful hotel...you get what you pay for and the Four Seasons is up there.

An Honor-student and all don'cha know...! We stayed 3 nights in Waikiki at the SPK, then it was off to Maui! DW and I had been to Oahu b4 on our Honeymoon in Oct. 1987 at the SPK. So, for corny sentimental reasons, we went back there! Wanted to show DD Waikiki obviously! THEN....it was off to Maui! DW assumed we were staying at the Sheraton Maui that we decided on last spring '09. Then I was clued into this site, and found out about the Four-Seasons! So....secretly...I had our TA just make a fake itinerary for the Sheraton Maui. I handed DW the \"fake\" sheets, and that was that! The REAL reservations were for the Four-Seasons. WOW. Pulling up to the Four Seasons was spectacular! DW & DD were kinda floored. I had splurged at the rental counter at the airport on Maui and rented a beautiful Burgundy CTS at the last second. (looks better pulling up in that, compared to a standard Chevy Impala...!) The valet guys were very pleasant, and unloaded our luggage for us. Wiiiiiide marble entrance and beautiful fountain at the valet-circle drive. Room wasn't ready yet, so they whisked our luggage away to a hold area, and suggested lunch at Ferraro's. Very beautiful ourdoor setting under the BIG umbrella's. Very good food too. Then...off to the room by a very pleasant porter. In the room....WOW. Huge marble bathroom; beautiful, understated room decor; wonderful beds with an I-pod docking-station clock, etc. We didn't eat at Spago, but DUO and Ferraro's were very good. Room-svc. was wonderful. Room-staff come in to your room in the evening for the \"evening\" bed turn-down, etc. Pool-area: The Infinity pool was still under construction in June '09...didn't get to see it...arrggh! The other pools though...WOW. DW & DD were off horseback riding, so I was lounging at the pool. I had been in the water a little while, when none other than Tori Spelling waded by, not 5' in front of me!!!! Then her husband came by, with one of their little ones! The Maui film-festival was the day after we were leaving I found out, so they were there for it. The pool staff, keep your water filled, spritz you with Evian, and offer popsicles every so often! The free poolside L'Occitane products are awesome and appreciated. Concierges were very friendly and knowledgeable. The resort itself and the grounds are SO IMPECCABLE it's ridiculous. I think all the marble on the planet is here! Workout area, and gaming room were very nice. Very Haute, beautiful shops and Spa....this place is a DREAM. The main Lobby hallways are wide enough for 2-lane car traffic I think... All-in-all...I can't get this place out of my head...OR heart. To me, that's the best compliment of all.

We were in room 442 with a courtyard and ocean view. The bathroom is large and has everything you need. We immediately went to adult pool and were set up within minutes. I will say that I enjoyed the larger pool more as the resort was not crowded with kids and liked being closer to the beach and around a more diverse group of people. The first night we went to the shops at Wailea for dunner at Tommy Bahama's which was very nice. The only issue and wasn't really the Four Season's issue was when we booked the trip with Amex it came with a full breakfast and when we went to Duo for breakfast they told me that it was for continental only and the rule had changed the day we checked in. Amex refunded me the charge in the end, but it was awkward when it came up. We went to the main pool and got a great seat facing the ocean outside the pool area.

I love Hawaii. And I love The Four Seasons. Especially Maui at Wailea. This was my wife's and I second time back to the resort. Our first was back in December 2006, during the reconstruction phase and we had a wonderful time. Never thought I'd be back so soon, but with a amazing airfare deal decided to take the whole family (two children, 7 and 4) for a 5 night stay utilizing the 5th night free deal. It was everything I could have asked and more. Best vacation I have ever been on. Unfortunately, our 4 soon to be 5 year-old daughter wasn't quite old enough to be in the Kids For All Seasons program, but they did do some of it during the day. Basically they have a free program from 9am-to-5pm each day for kids 5-12 with activities and such. However, we mainly spent ours days doing: 1. Buffet Breakfast @ DUO (I miss that) 2. Beach time in front of the resort 3. Pool time at either of the pools. With quick dips in the hot-tubs. 4. Some playtime in the Game Room... Being we came with a family, we did not get to spend too much time in the Serenity Pool. I did venture up there. It was nice, but seemed that when the trade winds blow, you are directly in the wind up there. Beautiful pool however. There are so many positives (and most of them free) with the Four Seasons Maui I'm sure I'll miss them.. 1. You can get a free Kindle from the Concierge. With kids no time for that... 2. Free Outrigger Canoe excursion. This is a MUST. 3. Free One Hour Snorkel use each day... 4. Free use of the Spa Lockerrooms.... 5. Free use of Cabanas (not the Serenity Pool cabanas), and towel service... 6. They try up and down to make the kids feel wanted. Free snacks, kids under 5 eat free, free stuffed animals, etc.... Plus its a beautiful location, beautiful beach. Yes its expensive and the food is expensive, but it was worth it.... We stayed in a Garden-View Room. Room 488. Which was very nice. We were very close to the front of the resort, which is a plus. Plus we could see the ocean from our room anyway... Was supposed to get upgraded at check-in, but being presidents week, resort was full....

You can guarantee that any Four Seasons Resort you go to will have impeccable service and facilities. Four Seasons Maui has rated consistently higher than Hualalai in travel magazines, but I'm going against the grain and rating it slightly lower. New serenity pool is located in a far corner of the hotel grounds but it seems very cramped and having to sign up on a two-page waiting list for a chair or arrive at 7am to reserve a spot, doesn't exactly inspire tranquil feelings. Chairs seem very close together - although you can hide yourself with a canopy over some (not all) loungers. The service and impeccable manners of the poolside staff, however, does make up for any disappointment you may feel. When you're bored with lounging, you must try out the free yoga classes on the beach, and definitely give the Outrigger Canoe lessons a try. Your two crew are knowledgeable, patient and very friendly. I had planned to just watch my daughter as she went out, but they grabbed me from the beach to fill an empty spot - and I'm glad I went. However, somewhat disappointed with the location of our supposedly partial ocean-view room (431). We had a peekaboo view of the ocean through the trees, past the croquet lawn and over the lobby entrance when standing on the lanai, and nothing when we sat on the lounge chairs. In retrospect, we should have asked for a room change - especially after our toilet overflowed one night! If you go in whale-watch season, go on Ali'i Nui catamaran - funny and friendly staff. No fighting for views of the whales, very clean and new boat (but you do have to take off your shoes) Food everywhere is expensive. Walked to Matteo's just opposite the Wailea shops - great value, great location and good casual food. Tommy Bahamas restaurant was better than I remember. Disagree about Spagos being overrated - food was amazing albeit expensive. And I thought the server was joking when he asked for my ID when ordering a drink (I'm 53). Apparently he wasn't!

The pool area is wonderful, and they have a large section for small kids. For adults who are looking to get away from the sounds of children and relax in relative silence, (and enjoy a swim-up bar), they have an adults-only serenity pool, one level above the main pool area, with an infinity pool overlooking the bay. I remember reading in Fortune magazine that this resort is one of America's top 100 places to work...and it shows. Every employee I encountered, from the greeters to the poolside attendants to the housekeepers, seemed genuinely happy to both be there and be helping you. All of the food we had was good, and we've now tried almost all of their restaurants. The quality is what you would expect from a Four Seasons. We've also used the spa, and had a great massage there. Of course, the spa does not try to compete with the Spa Grande next door at the Grand Wailea, which I highly recommend you try. The spa at the Four Seasons would probably seem fabulous if it were not right next door to one of the top ranked spas in America, but no problem---the concierge is very helpful in making spa reservations for you at the Grand Wailea, and they even happily arrange a shuttle to drive you next door for your appointment, should you not feel like walking. If you're staying here for a spa weekend, it might be best to use the spa at the Four Seasons one day, for more personalized, less crowded service, and then the spa at the Grand Wailea next door on another day, for a quasi-Japanese sento spa experience. All in all, this place truly has it all. It's a perfect location if you're traveling with kids, as there are many kid-friendly activities and amenities. It's also a perfect location if you're not traveling with kids, as there are many opportunities to find peace, quiet, and relaxation.

This time, we had booked our room with an offer for a $100 resort credit per night. About a week before our visit, the FS contacted us with an offer to upgrade to ocean view for $125 a night and we still get our room credit. It was our 5 year anniversary so we figured we'd spluge and do it. The room was really phenomenal. The location of the room is much closer to the pool/spa/fitness center and the view of the garden, resort and ocean was really breathtaking. we booked an airport pick up through the hotel and wished we would have done this every time. We were met as soon as we got off the plane, whisked down and through baggage claim and quickly brought to the sedan -- i think we made it from door of airplane to front desk in under 30 minutes! Our driver, JT, was awesome and provided fun conversation on the way to the hotel. check in was very smooth with lei greeting and personal greeting by Samuel Davis, assistant resort manager. Upon arrival in the fantastic room, we had welcome gift of pineapple bread and also a bottle of champagne for our anniversary -- really nice touch. In the past, we've had issues with housekeeping (not cleaning room until late, not remembering special requests, etc.) This time was totally different and it was really great. Not sure if it is because they've improved or if the service is better with a better room but everything was top notch. In the past, I requested an extra sheet, this was in our room upon check in and there every day after cleaning. Our room was cleaned every day within in an hour of us leaving for our morning workout/walk. The special little touches are really nice here -- housekeeping always bookmarks the tv guide magazine with the current day on the bedside table, they organize your personal toiletries that you've brought on a nice rattan mat. Only downside is that they only provide 3 bath towels and 2 hand towels in the room -- that is just not enough for 2 adults -- every other hotel we ever stay at have at least 4 bath towels and 4 hand towels -- but this was really pretty minor complaint in light of how everything else is so great. We asked for extra towels when we were in the room one morning and they provided, but then they went back to 3 towels with the turndown service. They really market the new adult infinity pool when you check in. I had a chance to check it out when we were on Maui in Nov. and it is really wonderful although the layout is a little strange in that only a few seats have great views of the ocean -- the rest all face each other and if you didn't know better, it feels like you're at any other pool in Vegas or someplace warm. Other problem is that it was so packed this time, we had to go on a waitlist and it took 2 hours to get up there -- just wasn't really worth it as the other pools are just as great and had plenty of great seats with views of the ocean. I always make an appointment for the signature massage at the spa - it never disappoints. A few trips ago, I asked for a larger robe size and since then, they always just provide me with a locker with that larger robe, i no longer have to ask. those little touches are what really make the Four Seasons the best hotel in Maui. We ate at Spago and Ferraros while at the hotel. Ferraros is an old stand by we always go to for our anniversary. It has really great sunset views -- menu seems to be a little tired -- same ole same ole -- but it is consistently good. We had our absolutely favorite meal at Spage -- the wok fried whole fish with thai ginger sauce and rice and veggies -- it is to die for! It is not actually on the menu but a special they have if they have a whole fish or two in house -- we called ahead and asked them to make it for us and they did -- we felt very special as everyone else in the restaurant was jealous as our fish was being carved tableside -- had Steven, the greatest waiter ever! We can't say enough about this great hotel -- we hope to return every visit to Maui.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago IL", "Title": "\u201cWonderful - one of the best hotels I've stayed in!\u201d", "Author": "JDChicago1", "ReviewID": "UR55402193", "Content": "We just returned from a week at the Four Seasons Maui.

This was pretty much the most luxurious hotel experience I've ever had. We stayed here for nearly a week last November for our honeymoon and by the end, were so reluctant to leave. The hotel itself, while absolutely beautiful and immaculate, did not immediately strike us as being that much nicer or grander than other luxury hotels. It's not over-the-top showy or luxurious. But the longer we stayed, the more we noticed all the little differences and details that added up to an amazing experience. The service at the hotel was absolutely amazing. Service is not usually something I notice, unless it is bad, but I now understand why so many folks comment on it. The service, from literally everyone (from the valet, concierge, waiters, pool attendants), was constantly cheerful, attentive, and incredibly competent, all without being obtrusive or pretentious. I was amazed that it could be this consistently high-quality. Every interaction with an employee was positive. This made the entire stay so incredibly enjoyable - the feeling of assurance that everything would be taken care of. And the little touches were amazing, too. Free popsicles, fruit slices, muffins, and spritzes at the pools or on the beach. A huge list of activities at no extra charge. Extremely helpful pool attendants. The concierge desk was terrific at setting up activities or reservations. The grounds were immaculate. Every detail seemed to have been already carefully thought through. Our room was very spacious, elegant, and pretty much perfect. We had an ocean view room with a balcony. The bed was huge and comfortable, the furniture all in tip top shape. And the bathroom was absolutely immense. We spent most of our time at the adults-only serenity pool, which was fantastic. Very calm and quiet. In order to be guaranteed a spot, you did have to get there early, which was a bit of a pain. But if you didn't mind getting a spot later in the day, you could put your name on a wait list, and they would call your cellphone to let you know when a spot opened up. The main pool was also quite nice, though a bit noisier. The restaurants were quite good. We ate at Spago and Ferraro's, which were both uniformly excellent.

We were happy there, but this place is really outstanding, as well it should be for the price. I have some minor gripes noted below, but would be thrilled to return. Even then, we were upgraded for the same price, so it's hard to complain. A quick summary that reflects many of the comments of other visitors: Room 592 is a very spacious partial-ocean view room with a very large bathroom. I suspect that this might be a handicapped room because the separate room for the toilet is enormous with finely crafted wooden rails. Some object to handicap room, but I wonder why since they are designed to be spacious. Guests might get a slightly better view (e.g. room 590, 588...) because the ocean-front wing obscures part of the view. The king bed was very comfortable. Like many hotel properties, the bedding includes a seoarate sheet and duvet that is often too warm unless you stay at a chalet in the Alps. We immediately asked to have a lighter blanket and were comfortable through our stay. The room is very comfortable and tastefully decorated with comfortable chairs, desk, flat screen TV, coffee/tea setup, iron/ironing board, internet access, etc. that you expect in a hotel of this calibre. The chairs on the patio had hassocks -- a nice relaxing touch. Good storage space in closet and drawers. Dings: the room safe will not accomodate a laptop, and I forget if there is a room charge. There should never be a room charge for internet access, especially at this price. The bathroom is enormous, with separate tub and walk-in shower with seat large enough for two (again, see my comment about the this is possibly a handicapped room.) It was beautifully decorated with marble and glass tile mossaics, had nice toiletries from l'Occitane, lots of high quality towels, etc. Excellent housekeeping that always left orchid flowers here and there. Service is excellent throughout the hotel -- maids, floor staff, concierges, waitstaff, poolstaff, etc. desert best-of-class prize. There is a lot of value here when you consider the pool areas, including complimentary cabana tents. While we usually prefer the calm of the adult-only pools, the main pool had a nicer set-up -- the adult only area only had those shell-like covers for shade unless you wanted to spring for really luxurious wood-frame cabanas, and did not have enough of those to accomodate the guests who wanted shade. The next few days, something went wrong with the adult pool area, so we never got to go back. Still, this was not a problem. The kinds-and-adults main pool area is wonderful, with attentive staff, enough shaded areas for the guests at the time, complimentary treats like ice pops, suntan lotion at the staff stations, etc. The garden setting is sublime. The water was a perfect temperature, unlike the unexpected chillier temperature at the hotel where we stayed in Kanapali. You can easily get lunch from the Italian restaurant served at the pool, and there is a side area from Duo for the pool crowd, I think? For the record: the children's pool area is also really nice with a shallow end and somewhat deeper near a waterfall. Thanks to all the parents who visited at this time for keeping the children's noises her and the main pool to pleasant laughter, and no screeching. We dined at all the resaurant venues at least once, and the quality of the food was excellent throughout. The variety is very good -- the Italian had more Mediterranean items, salads, pizzas, etc. Duo is very good for breakfast, all-around American with Pacific influences. Spago is Spago. The lounge was very good for open-air cocktails and lighter fare. Still, it's quite pricey. The continental breakfast buffet was $27; off-the-menu pancakes $18 and egg dishes in the $20's. Dings: the weak coffee throughout the property really should be better. Spago's food was quite good, except the crab cake served lukewarm. And really -- the semi-rock music at Spago is off for this location. Maybe LA, but not here. But again: service is excellent. The spa looks great, but did not indulge. Wild orchid mani/pedis sound wonderful, as well as a menu of massages and treatments. We also appreciated that the hotel hosts local artists and craftspersons every day. These are high-quality artists, so stop by. The beach here is like many in Hawaii -- close-in surf break makes it difficult to swim, but nice for walking or managing a quick dip. There is lots going on here, from pool tables and Wii game areas, to open-air fitness rooms. Your exerciser machines were never in such a pleasurabel location. Easy walk to Wailea shopping plaza along a paved beachside walkway. The plaza includes everything from an ABC store and General store for reasonable take-out, to Gucci and Bottega Veneta, and some interesting shops in between. It's also easy to walk to other hotel properties for exploring. My only real complaints include the always-irritating mandatory resort fee. It feels unethical to not just include this in the stated room rate, and be clear about what is or is not included. They (and other hotels) never seem clear about what it does and does not include -- and it never seems to include tips for excellent housekeeping staff. FYI: parking seemed like it was valet-only for a $20 fee. While this is not bad, it was never explained whether there was an alternative. Also: local calls get a $1 charge. The nickle-and-diming at this level is irritating. There are other places to dine in the area, but the food is not as good as here.

The only way to describe the Four Seasons is heaven on earth. Everything about it the hotel and staff is MAGNIFICENT. Maui was the 3rd stop for us on our honeymoon, we saved the best for last. We went to Waikiki and Kauai, if we could go back and do it again we would spend all of our time at the Four Seasons in Maui. From the second we arrived everyone knew our names and greeted us every time they saw us. The amenities are wonderful, this hotel gives you so many perks just for being a guest. There are many celebs who frequent this hotel. While there we saw, Joe Montana, Regis, Danny Nucci and Paula Marshall. Denise Richards had left the day before we got there. Pool: The pool and beach butlers are beyond amazing. They will place you in any area you request. They put a nice cover on your chair and if you go for a swim and get the cover wet they will actually come to refresh your chair. While sitting poolside hotel staff come around with chilled towels, ice pops, fruit, jello, and all other sorts of fun things. There is water always available to you and you better believe they will never let your water cup go lower than half full. Try the cucumber water, it is so yummy. There are tons of sunblock dispensers located poolside and their sunblock smells so good!!! The new pool area was set to open a few days after our departure, I heard it was supposed to be fantastic. Beach The beach is just beautiful and the water amazing. You can do great snorkeling right off of the beach. We saw so many beautiful fish. The water is usually calmer in the morning, so try to snorkel early in the day. The tide picks up in the afternoon and so does the wind, so try not too far out in the afternoon. I am about the biggest beach lover, but at the Four Seasons, I was always poolside because that was where you treated like royalty. Food: The food was EXPENSIVE. So worth it though. You have to splurge while you are here. We ate at Wolfgang Pucks Spago which was amazing. The portions are small but you have to def eat here it was worth it. Your taste buds will thanks you. While at Spago my husband and I inquired about Oysters because we expected there would be Oysters on the menu. Our waiter said they did not have them but if we'd like the chef could have them flown in for us. This is a true statement...the staff go so far out of their way in every aspect...it's crazy. We also ate at Duo and I have to say, the steak was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. After you eat your entree they bring you a big cotton candy puff, which I thought was very different and fun. We had Ferraro's poolside for lunch almost every day but did not eat there for dinner. The breakfast buffet is worth it as there are a lot of choices but you can expect to spend about $100 on breakfast for 2 people. We had heard that 2 chefs that used to work at the Four Seasons had left to open their own gourmet sandwich shops called 808 in Kihei. We heard the sandwiches were incredible so we asked one of the poolside staff members and she said she could get a menu faxed over for us. We were planning on taking a ride there but the staff member said she would call to see if they could deliver for us. She made the call, took our orders and had the delivery person escorted to our poolside chairs. Now if this is not above and beyond, I do not know what is. The sandwiches were fantastic. We also ate off the resort. We did go to Mama's Fish House which is better than everyone has described. We loved it. We ate breakfast a couple of times at the Wailea shopping center. Like mentioned above the food is very expensive in all of Wailea. We were at the Four Seasons for 9 days so we did go into Kihei a few times for some cheaper options and variety and the food was very good. Rooms: Perfection, there was nothing more you could ask for. L'occataine soaps are the best!!! Be sure to ask for an upgrade, we didn't but another couple we met did and their room was an incredible suite. They even had their own eliptical on and treadmill on a balcony overlooking the ocean. Their room was bigger than most peoples houses and they did not pay for the upgrade, the room was just available. We did pay for a partial ocean view and we only had a view of a sliver of the ocean. Because everything else was so perfect we did not complain. We filled out the questionnaire before leaving and a week after arriving home the hotel had sent us a personalized letter letting us know that the next time we stayed at the Four Seasons we would receive a free upgrade. Above and beyond again. Excursions: One evening we had called for a wakeup call for around 2am. They asked if we were visiting Haleakala and we told them yes. They told us they would have blankets, muffins and coffee for us in the morning to take with us on our tour. They helped us book all of our excursions. I have to recommend Kai Kanani which is not too far up the road. This was the best tour we took in Maui. We did the early tour to Molokini Crater which is nice because the water is calmer. While there we saw 3 reef sharks and got great pictures. We also did the road to Hana which was beautiful. We did the Luau at the Marriott Wailea which was just ok. The food was not very good and the best part was the flame thrower. Sunsets in Maui are by far the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Be sure to spend plenty of time outside while the sun is going down. Scuba at Four Seaons: The Scuba team was amazing,. I had never dove before and had every intention on diving while in Maui. We took the free intro class and they spent so much time with my husband and I and they were so calm and nice. If you like the intro you can pay to dive off the beach. We started in the pool and I had a really hard time with breathing. They did not give up on me and they spent so much extra time with me going over everything. In the end I did not do the shore dive. I felt so bad because I felt I had wasted there time. They were completely fine about it and assured me any time I wanted to come back they would spend just as much time with me and go over everything again. I did not go back but hopefully one of these days I will be able to. I don't think there could better instructors out there. My husband and I do a lot of traveling and always choose nice resorts. This is by far the best hotel I had ever stayed in. I do not think another hotel in all of Maui could even come close to the quality and service of the Four Seasons. Spend the extra money, it is worth every penny. My husband had wanted to stay at the Grand Wailea and after our experience he was so glad I had talked him out of it. While there we had met a few couples that had transferred from the Grand Wailea and the Fairmont and said the Four Seasons was by far 100% times better. You will be so happy with your choice. My husband and I would like to make a return for our 5 year anniversary.

There is a seperate kids pool that is appropriate for kids 10 years and younger with a beautiful waterfall.

Generally a big rectangle with a huge fountain in the middle that you could use for shade. The rooms were very sizeable, modern, and we were very comfortable. Could use some more Hawaiin influences, but nice overall. My room didn't have a great view, but it was still relatively quiet. Food/drinks wereexcellent and the restaurant at Spago's was delicious. The beach is public but the hotel does a nice job keeping it clean. Very nice beach. Awesome workout facilities.

They also ate at Spago and met Wolfgang Puck there, whom they said was very gracious and personable. They enjoyed both the experience and food there. My only real gripe about this hotel is that it seems to be a bit of Los Angeles, transplanted into Maui. The clientele seemed like a mashup of some of the worst stereotypes of rich California residents, from the surgically enhanced socialite, to the somewhat sleazy movie director, to the Dr. 90210 type. I felt like I was in the midst of \"The Real Housewives of L.A.\" While some of the staff seemed \"local\" a significant number were not. I think it would have been possible to stay at the hotel for a week and never actually talk to anybody who was born in the state. The hotel is a resort dream, but it doesn't represent many of the best aspects of life in this great state. I suppose it's unfair to blame that on the hotel, the hotel is exceptional at what it does, and perhaps the target market isn't really looking to eat squid luau or learn pidgin or actually meet the \"natives\" or do anything authentic. Maybe, I'm just not accustomed to living in that stratosphere, and that's just the way things are done. To me though, those are some of the best parts of traveling. If you're going to come to Hawaii just to sit by the pool, well, then why come? Regardless, my friends (not from Los Angeles) found it very relaxing and had a great time.

I will say that the Mountain View room seemed much nicer due ot the high ceiling, but other than that the rooms were the same, and both were very dark. BTW, we were NOT offered an upgrade despite the frequency that reviewers here report an upgrade, even though they knew we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary, we are frequent guests at Four Seasons hotels, and the hotel was nowhere near capacity. So don't count on it. Other than that, the new adult pool makes this hotel given the high number of families, and without it we wouldn't have enjoyed our stay. They offer spa \"tapas\" at the pool, so if you just want a foot massage, or a head and neck massage, you can have it done right there as you bake in the sun. Snorkeling is quite good right on the beach. Without a doubt, and like most Four Seasons, it's the people at this hotel who make it a wonderful experience. For cheaper food options, the Grand Wailea next door has a nice cafeteria like offering that is open for breakfast and dinner (why not lunch, I don't know) but the other restaurants at that hotel have similar prices to the Four Seasons. Also the Shops at Wailea have many dining options, but it is a good 20 minute walk from the hotel so you may prefer to drive. There are so many nice restaurants on Maui (Haile Maile, Mama's Fish House) that I would avoid the ho-hum, overpriced dinner options at the hotel. If you're foodies, avoid Kihei like the plague (except for Sansei, but it's quite crowded/noisy).", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington", "Title": "\u201cWOW again\u201d", "Author": "gklongo", "ReviewID": "UR51466156", "Content": "This is now my fourth review of the FS at Maui. Every time we go we say we will never try another location but then we end up doing just that! This trip we spent the first five days at the FS resort in Kona. It was a wonderful property and we enjoyed our time there but it still doesn't compare to the atmosphere and experience in Maui! We stayed for five days in Maui and could have stayed forever! As all the reviews say the property is beautiful! We stay on the club floor which gives you access to a dedicated concierge staff, snacks and drinks throughout the day. It really adds to the experience. The rooms are perfect. Large and very clean. The bathroom is unlike any I have ever experienced!(Except the FS at Kona, which is also amazing and had an outside shower!) Since our last trip the adult only pool has opened and really makes the property perfect(when you are there without kids!) The view from the pool is amazing. Everyone we met had similar feelings about the property. One couple on their honeymoon even cancelled plans to travel to another island after coming to this hotel. Duos if our favorite restaurant when we are there but even a snack and drinks in the lobby lounge is great. Could keep writing and writing but it would all be the same.

Also had breakfast buffet twice at Duo and it contained so many different foods and they were all wonderful. I had booked a mountainside room and was happy to find out at check-in that we were upgraded to a partial oceanview room. That just was the icing on the cake! I highly recommend not to waste your time or money at other resorts on Maui since this one is by far the best !. Also, we ate meals at other places besides the hotel and quite frankly all of the food was not very good at all.

The staff is still very friendly. The valet service had declined slightly ($20 daily) but was still very good. Internet service was a whopping $50 for four days. The Adult pool was new since our last visit but it failed to impress. The pool is very narrow and just not a lot of fun although the view from the end is stunning. The FS continues to fall behind the other area resorts in pool quality. It is worth noting that the kinds pool is VERY nice. The biggest changes in the last few years were to the restaurants. Spago is still there but there is little left that exudes Wolfgang Puck. I won't be surprised if they change the name in the future. The service here was still very good but the menu is a bit passe (changes daily) for the price. If you have never ate here it is worth a visit. Try to score an out side table at 5:30 as the sun sets. On our last visit DUO was the worst meal we have ever had at a restaurant.....ever!. It was with some trepidation that we returned for dinner and we are very glad that we did. The prime bone in rib chop was divine although service is not on the same level as Spago. When asked a question about the beef our server was un-sure and did not bother to ask the Chef. Still a huge improvement from our last visit. We also ate at DUO for the B'fast buffet. $34 PP including juice and coffee. Food quality was very good although they lacked any exotic fruit or juice. We found this to be a good value. The lobby lounge has nightly entertainment and now offers sushi as well. The salon is currently working out of a room on the third floor as renovations are under way on the salon. One complaint I have about the FS is their stores. They are dismal at best. It is not even possible to buy a soda or ice cream unless you call room service. The Fairmont is about a ten minute walk and they have some great shops and a full deli with wine, beer, munchies etc. The beach at the FS Maui remains the high point. This time we booked a Garden view room. A few nights before we arrived we received an offer to up-grade to a Ocean View room for another $125 per night which we accepted. This turned out to be $200 per night under rack rate with the fifth night free! We were then up-graded to an ocean view prime with a very nice view. (Thank You! :) The rooms are getting slightly worn and were a tad less than spotless. No doubt there is less staff on property than years past with the lower occupancy rates. We declined an offer to up-grade to an ocean front suite for an additional $375 per night. These rooms are usually over 3k a night so that might be a good deal for some. Check in was fast and efficient although the champagne never arrived. Room cleaning and turn down times varied considerably from day to day. One thing that has not changed is that you can not view your bill in your room on the TV even thouygh the system has the ability. When you sign a room charge they do not give you a copy of the receipt. It seems the FS would rather you not think about your total until you leave. ;) Over all a very pleasant experience. Five stars? No but an honest 4.50-4.75 depending on the value you place on select services. There are also local artists each morning on the LL out side of Duo.

The mother of the groom had to go into the bathroom and curl her own hair with her own curling iron because we ran out of time. In almost 4 hours two stylists could only do 4 heads of hair and one little girl. They did not wash, cut, or color. They charged more than they quoted.

They have a docent-lead tour once a week but I had a conflict. Instead, I borrowed an iPod from the concierge and did the tour on my own. The iPod tour is wonderful - narrated by a local man, it also includes interviews with some of the artists. The hotel also brings in excellent local artists - about five each day on a weekly cycle - who display their work on the lower level. Internet fee is reasonable and the internet is fast. We decided not to rent a car - good choice! - made the stay more relaxing. The hotel shuttle will take you to local restaurants and the concierge has rental cars (easily) available.

The grounds are beautiful, the rooms are generous, the pools are well maintained, service is top-notch at all times. I'd like to offer some tips for those who are planning a stay. We found a lot of helpful information on Trip Advisor before our visit, but there were a few things I discovered during our visit that I wish I would have known in advance. 1. Between the (economy) car rental and parking fees @ the 4S we spent about $700 on transportation charges while in Maui. The 4S will transport you free of charge anywhere in Wailea. You can also rent cars by the day from the 4S for days when you want to leave Wailea, avoiding a charge on the day you don't use the car and the parking fee. 2. We were at the resort over Thanksgiving, so I can only speak for holiday weeks, but during high-season visits, expect that you need to be at the pool at 7AM to reserve prime seats. If you don't mind a seat with a less than ideal view, you don't need to worry about this. 3. Free coffee is out every morning in front of Duo 4. I think the breakfast at Duo was fantastic and a much better value than lunch at Ferraros. I found Ferraros to be the least impressive of the resorts dining options, at least in terms of food. (the view is amazing). In terms of dining in Wailea outside of the resort, you should check out Joe's and Matteo's just down the street from the hotel. We went to Nicks at the Fairmont and were less than impressed. Sansei Sushi in nearby Kehei was another nice meal for a fair price. Mama's Fishhouse, although not close, was AMAZING and very easy to find. In summary, if you can afford it, you will not be disappointed by the Four Seasons in Maui.

Originally I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planned on coming here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but my reservation at the Four Seasons Nevis had been canceled due to the ongoing delay in hurricane repairs being made at that property. I was worried that coming back here might be a letdown: Sometimes part of the excitement of visiting a high-end resort is discovering it for the first time, and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if a return would be somewhat boring and a quick descent into a, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153been-there-done-that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attitude. No need for the concern \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the past four years the resort has made significant upgrades at the same time that they have kept the overall place as great as I remembered it! We booked (and received) a Garden View room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no upgrade this time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we were in an excellently-situated double on the 3rd floor with a private lawn overlooking the porte cochere and out towards the ocean. We were close to the elevators and access to everything was great. The room was of the standard FS Maui variety: 600 sq. feet, with a large marble bathroom, great beds and tastefully furnished. No complaint about the room or the furnishings. There have been a few changes since I last visited: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a $20/day parking charge (used to be included in the rate); the Pacific Grill is now DUO \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a change for the better, in my opinion; the spa has been enlarged and enhanced; and, most notably, a second pool for adults only has been added. These last two elements were of the most interest to me personally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c beach/sun vacations for me are focused on spa and pool, so these upgrades were perfect. Also the expansion of the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s art collection is noteworthy and the tour (self-guided or with a docent) is highly recommended. The TA comments about the new infinity pool are correct: Come early or come late \u00e2\u20ac\u201c otherwise it will be near impossible to secure a spot. Overall it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a terrific (and sorely needed) addition to the resort, and people appeared to enjoy the new space immensely. There are actually two salt-water pools here, each complete with hot tubs and water-and-air \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beds.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There are a half-dozen private cabanas and a swim-up bar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the views from the infinity edge over the beach and ocean are remarkable. The music underwater is a nice touch (they play Hawaiian music, so nothing too chaotic or distracting; in any case you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear it unless you submerge your head fully under the water). We did reserve a private cabana ($300 plus tax) at the new pool on my actual birthday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I will say that it was nice in the respect that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yours for the entire day, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no need to hurry to get there before other early risers make the standard mad rush for chairs/casabelles. You could actually enjoy a leisurely breakfast at DUO and then head up to the infinity pool at your own pace. The friendly staff will already be expecting you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and they set you up for the duration in your cabana (a three-sided structure with chaise lounges, a sofa, refrigerator, ceiling fan, and flat screen television/wireless headphones). You do get preferential treatment when they distribute the poolside amenities (and even get a couple of cabana-only treats), but other than that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really no difference between getting a cabana and not getting one. If you like the idea of being able to commandeer the space and spread out, then by all means do it. The spa has been upgraded, expanded and enhanced. I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pre-booked any treatments prior to arriving, and they were running some specials promoted in the daily resort activity bulletin the turn-down folks leave in your room at night. The day I took advantage of this the offer was for a complimentary 25-minute Wailea water ritual with any standard treatment of 50 minutes or longer. Basically this was a private room with a bathtub, shower and steam room with ambient lighting and spa music playing for you to do your ablutions in prior to receiving other treatments. The room was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but at $125 I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have elected to get this if paying for it; that said, it was a nice prelude to a massage and if you can score this promotion I would recommend it. Spa prices are high here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so take advantage of any break you can get. One of the nicest things about the FS spa is that you can use the amenities at any time (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to resorts that charge an exorbitant fee to use the spa if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a treatment scheduled for that day). Additionally, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll gladly lend you a fresh FS T-shirt at any time to work out in or wear around the resort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great for those days that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at the beach and expect sand and water and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to muck up your resort wear. I used the spa to take a shower and steam in every afternoon following the pool or beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the tranquil environment hit the spot for winding down the day. The restaurants here are ok (well, the breakfast buffet at DUO is extraordinary, but not cheap at approximately $40 pp. if not on a room package that includes breakfast). We had dinner at Spago that I felt was mediocre at best, and the ocean- and poolside lunch at Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is pleasant but nothing to write home about. We ventured mostly to the Shops at Wailea for dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just up the hill and has a nice variety of venues from which to choose. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a car the resort staff will gladly give you a lift (no charge) in the resort SUV, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pick you up if you call them later for a return ride back. My favorite eatery here is the Tommy Bahama Cafe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great selection, excellent quality and nicely priced. I did the guided art tour after calling the concierge to request it. It turned out that I was the only guest doing it that day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cancel on me and still had their guide come on property to give me an hour-long tour of the contemporary Hawaiian art collection. Recommended if you are into art and have the time. A couple of other small changes \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they have gotten rid of the stocked mini bars in favor of empty ones that you can customize via the chit they provide for you to fill out, and in the rooms are nice canvas and leather beach totes that you can cart around with you on the property and then take home with you afterward for a fee. They sell them brand new and wrapped in the spa \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the nice fellow working there told me not to pay full tariff for it at the spa, but rather have housekeeping bring up one that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looks new\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and take that instead for a reduced fee. He called housekeeping for me right then and there and I got what I suspect was a never-been-used bag with a tag still on it for $15 less than I would have paid in the spa. Little things like that make the service at FS special. In sum, it was a great trip and a relaxing way to spend my birthday. If you are considering coming here and debating this property against others because of cost \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do yourself the favor and spend the extra money to come here. No, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not cheap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but nothing in Hawaii is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it may make the difference between an ok vacation and one that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll remember long after you return home.

My wife and I stayed here for 10 nights for our Honeymoon back in May and it was beautiful. I booked a partial-ocean-view room for 9 nights and had to move to a mountain-view room for the last night (due to booking issues). Overall both rooms were beautiful. Upon check-in we were asked if we wanted to pay for an upgrade (we declined since we didn't think it was worth it) but when we got to our room we had free Champaign and cookies waiting. In any case, the view was very partial ocean view but we weren't going to spend a lot of time in it anyway. We wanted to explore the resort and island. We looked at the restaurants on property and decided to try out Ferraro's. The seating was quick and came with a nice view and the food was good but pricey. We did room service one night for dinner and had a pasta dish. The preparation was nice, but the amount of food was small and again pricey. (We found little eateries in towns like Kihei & Lahaina that were nice and reasonably priced. Like - Cheeseburger In Paradise, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co, Moose McGillycuddy's Pub & Cafe, Fred's Mexican, WOKSTAR, Matteo's Pizzeria, and even Denny's. All reasonably priced and good food.) We also journeyed over to adjacent hotel Grand Wailea for dinner twice - to Bistro Molokini and the little eatery inside the hotel in the Lagoon wing -- but again not the greatest and affordable. In any case the Four Season resort was a great find: The Pros: nice clean room, nice grounds, friendly staff, open lobby, nice restaurants, game room, nice beach, free cabanas. The Cons: We were never told or had free slippers in our room until the last night, we weren't told about the $15 per night valet parking extra cost until the last day (and that wasn't including the tips we gave to the valets daily. On a side note the valet attendants were very helpful we were asked if we needed directions, water, umbrella, towels, etc... they were awesome!), price of the rooms, menu choices, pool area was pretty small and crowded. Would I stay here again; high possibility. It was very romantic and a nice memory for my wife and I for our first trip to Hawaii and our Honeymoon.

From check-in, we were warmly welcomed and our reservation was handled quickly while our bags were ushered up to our room. The room itself was very good - marble bath, spacious living area, comfortable bed, clean carpet. The sliding door to the balcony showed some signs of aging, but I'm really reaching for something negative. They also charge for wireless internet, but it's probably a good strategy to discourage use of a laptop at a place with such great activities. The people at the resort always took the time to answer our questions. Definitely a friendly group. The restaurants, though pricey were great - but the poolside and beach service is exceptional. My wife and I loved the activities (sign up for tennis and outrigger canoeing in advance). The snorkeling is good too - but the water can be a bit rough, so go early in the mornings when it's more calm. There are tons of fish and underwater life past the rocks. I used the gym on our last day and I regret not using it every day. The locker room had every amenity you'd really need - shaving needs, deodorant, and even foot spray. My wife claimed that her oceanside massage was the best she's had. General tips for Maui: -If you bring a GPS, make sure that it has maps for Hawaii. This worked out well for us in general. -Mama's Fish House. It has some of the freshest food around and the service is great. -Sushi Paradise is a good local, inexpensive sushi restaurant. We ate there, but I'd recommend taking it back to the resort. There was a wait on a random Tuesday night, so plan accordingly. -If you rent a convertible, I'd opt for the Mustang over the Sebring. The former has greater trunk space and a more fun ride. -Pick up an underwater camera/case before you arrive. -Snorkel Bob's is not worth it. You can get the gear from the hotel. -We went ziplining near the crater. It was ok having never done it before, but I wouldn't spend time doing it again if I had access to a resort like the Four Seasons. As a consultant, I've spent a considerable amount of time in hotels.

Once you've stayed at the Four Season Maui, you will be spoiled forever because nothing else on earth compares! Wailea is naturally beautiful and lush, a true tropical paradise but it's the resort that really makes you feel pampered and totally indulged. The natural surroundings are magical and the actual hotel and property are magical - very romantic. I cannot rave about Hawaii and the FS Maui enough. They've renovated in the last few years and everything looks updated. Here's a quick run down of the major features: Service - The rooms were impeccably clean and all staff are friendly and very accommodating. Everyone loves a good tip, but this is true in all resorts. We relied heavily on the concierge to coordinate activities and make reservations, etc, etc....the concierge is knowledgeable and very helpful. Facilities - The gym is small but there is a variety of equipment. Regular group classes (loved the spinning and yoga). Massages are pricey but I had such a wonderful deep tissue massage with Aubrey when I was last there that I had to book a second longer session before leaving. Restos - LOVED, LOVED, LOVED Spago. Order anything off the menu, you can't go wrong. My hubby loves calamari - the chef prepared something especially for him after he asked the server whether he could get a simple pan fried calamari dish. Duo has great steaks. We did try the Italian restaurant once for dinner but didn't like it so much - great for lunch. I highly recommend the Oka Noi smoothie if you like smoothies. I had one everyday while sunning by the pool. The Duo buffet breakfast is good if you don't want to go off the resort. Not great value, though, if you are not a big eater. However, there is a shopping plaza about a 15 min walk away where you can get an amazing greasy spoon kind of breakfast at Longhi's. (BTW, this plaza has every kind of shop you could want from designer store to hair salon.) You must eat at Mama's Fish House (about 15-20 mins past airport)....the food is unbelievable. It's not fancy but the food is so hearty. Pool - The resort is family friendly so expect kids to be running around. I understand that there is a new adult only pool. However, we were never bothered by the noise level - it just feels like you're surrounded by activity. Getting a chair or even cabana was never an issue for us in February. The cabanas are nice for privacy, but I prefer being in the sun to being in the shade. Excursions - The drive to/from Hana is long and winding. Your passenger should take a Gravol. It feels like you're driving through a rainforest. Whale watching was awesome because we had two whales swim under our boat and we got to see them up close. If not for the whales, not sure if it would've been as fun. In general, we spent most of our time in and around Wailea. We went on just a couple of excursions. It's very easy to spend the majority of your time on the resort simply relaxing. However, we would recommend renting a car. It's nice to have that freedom because only the shopping plaza is close by. Kihei is a great spot for finding an evening meal. Sansei has decent sushi and there's an Italian restaurant in the same plaza that is very good value. There's so much more one could say about FS Maui but the most important emphasis belongs on the feelings that will be inspired once you take it all in. The resort is truly magical and super romantic. We left wanting more each time after staying 10 days. The second trip was even better than the first and we can't wait for our third! If you're hesitating, don't - the surrounding resorts don't have the same ambiance.

After reading such mixed reviews here, I was a little apprehensive, but I would find it very difficult to criticise anything here. We stayed in the most basic mountainside room and it was just that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice view of the mountain in the distance, and the (covered) car park in the foreground, as explained on the website. The car park was well covered, and the noise from it was minimal when we were on the balcony, once the balcony doors were closed you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice it at all. The room itself was of a very good size, very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spacious, with the nice finishings one expects in a top end hotel. Toiletries were high quality, and replaced every day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they even included after sun cream. When we arrived, they had left gifts for the children in their room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stuffed toys, and their names spelled out in sponges in the bathroom and an underwater camera and frame for my teenager. They also left candies and cookies for the adults! Breakfast in the restaurant was the best we had in Maui \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lots of choice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all beautifully presented. Although not cheap, it was a similar price to other Maui hotels, and the best we had there. The first day we arrived we must have gone down to the pool at 2pm and I was very surprised that the pool attendant found us a cabana right by the pool. Perhaps we were lucky because I did see others arrive on other days, who were disappointed when nothing was immediately available. We generally went and reserved our cabana just before breakfast and they would set it all up for us. The pool staff arrived at 7am each morning, and you reserve your cabana with them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they will keep it if you are going for lunch, but said they would reassign it if you left for more than an hour. I did notice one day when I was down at 6.30 that all the cabanas overlooking the ocean had already gone, if you are happy to be by the pool it was still possible to get one at 8 or 9am. The pools themselves were lovely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not the Grand Wailea, but then no where near as crowded. The new infinity pool is spectacular \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the photos I have seen really do not do it justice. Much to my children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointment they are very strict about not letting children in any of the infinity pool area - definitely very peaceful and relaxing there! Plenty of sun beds, but also some luxurious cabanas with HD TVs etc . (extra fee, $300 I think). There was sunscreen for those who had forgotten theirs and little snacks and water brought round to your cabana during the day, at no extra charge. It was also possible to get a massage by the pool (paid extra). We spent most of our time at the general pool, and although we stayed during the peak season I was never unduly crowded, and although many children they were generally well behaved. We tried the outrigger canoe, from the beach, included in the price, it was fun, and we saw some turtles. We ate at both Ferraros and Spagos \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and were very impressed. Food was delicious, service excellent, view spectacular. We booked 24-48 hours in advance, both full every time we went, so I imagine you do need to book in advance. They were also very flexible with the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food, varying items on the menu to make them more child friendly. Both are excellent places from which to watch the sunset \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and as the sun sets there is a rush to take photos! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a car whilst we were staying there, but were very impressed with the staff at the front of the hotel. All very welcoming and professional. When we said we were going to the Shops at Wailea, they drove us done there, and told us to call when we wanted to come back. Whenever we left the front entrance we were offered bottles of water. Although our rooms were the most basic in the hotel, they were the most comfortable we stayed in whilst in Maui, and although the view was disappointing, it was what I had expected. The staff were generally excellent, in a very unobtrusive way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all in all making a very relaxing stay. Would we return? - We are already trying to plan a return trip!

Some tips: - For those who enjoy snorkeling (and there is some very good snorkeling along rocks to the south if not too wavey and visability is ok) bring or rent your own gear as even though the hotel provides for free they only lend it out if the seas are perfectly calm which is not all too often. - Although they do have many loungers throughout, this is a hotel where many people are up early (working out, time change) and hence take the best spots. By 7 AM many spots were already reserved. - Expect to potentially do a fair amount of walking from the main lobby to your room and then from your room to the pool.

Typical four seasons bathroom with a huge soaking tube, glass shower. double sinks. marble everywhere. The L'Occtaine bottles were huge- they replenish twice a day, so hide them and they leave more- so great. Had piped in music of your choice- we listened to Hawaiian music almost exclusively. Robes in room nice. Wet bar area with clear refrigerator- you can bring your own, or you can order packages for the mini bar. The bed was nice and sheets so nice. The TV large, AC and fan nice (especially after staying in Hana and No AC!). The living area was adequate. Had plantation shutters, so some light came in in the morning. The balcony was very nice- kind of an angle view of the ocean, but still nice. Could not hear the ocean. heard neighbors only once... They turn down the rooms with foot slippers, bed turned down and music playing. The restaurants were less impressive at the hotel- ate at Duo- was pretty much just like Ruths Chris, but not as good. The breakfast brunch was very good, but expensive. Made to order omlettes and waffles. At 6pm they had a guy go around blowing a shell and lighting all of the torches- very nice. Sunsets were gorgeous. the itialian restaurant has a better ocean and sunset view. The beach was wonderful. They will put out chairs and umbrellas for you. there was almost no one at the hotel when we were there and had absolutely no trouble getting chairs at the beach or pool. they come around with water and fruit and juice throughout the day. They have free snorkels and snorkeling along the rocks on the left have some great fish and we saw 5 sea turtles! They also have paddle boards and you can go on an outrigger canoe as well. There is a 2 mile paved walkway along the edge of the beach from one end of the resort row to the other- ran it twice and it was absolutley beautiful and neat to see the back of the other resorts. Run in the morning- already hot and humid. The pool was undergoing renovations from 2-5pm- did not use at all. The relaxation pool for adults only looked very peaceful and nice with great views. We couldn't find a pool or jacuzzi to use after 6pm- they appeared to close... Tube in the room worked fine. The shops were reasonable. Had a wonderful pedi/mani. Did not use the spa. There is an activity room with pool tables, Wii and PS2/3 and guitair hero avaialble with a large TV for sports. There are outdoor exercise equipment and a private room for training. We spent a lot of time away from the resort too- ate at the Waterfront- very good. Ate at the Pineapple grill- very nice, but long drive. Went on a triology trip to Lanai- the best snorkeling ever. It was a drive to each place, and going 40 pmh is hard to get used to even after a week. Also went surfing at Lihue (rented a board and brought our own rash guard- beginners) and did lots of shopping there. Also more upscale shopping at the grand wailea- did not go there Definately would come back in a heart beat and would stay only at the four seasons- it was the best by far!", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puerto Vallarta, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cStupendous!\u201d", "Author": "KiraMexico", "ReviewID": "UR45344608", "Content": "We went to celebrate our 25th wedding Anniversary and decided to split the 6 days at 2 resorts.

Positives: + Staff is super-friendly, from the welcome lei greeting to our departure. Their staff just looks happy to be there and ready to help, unlike some other hotels where the staff seems always stressed out and too busy. The 4S staff always seems to greet you first so that you don't have to look for them. When you have twin toddlers like we do, this is especially helpful. I remember getting out to the beach area with one toddler in one hand and a heavy beach bag in the other, and my wife was in the same predicament. What a relief to have two of the staff welcome us and ask us if they could help set up chairs for us on the beach! Same wonderful experience at the kiddie pool area! + Our children (2 1/2 year old twins at the time) were treated very well. The hotel staff went over the top to make sure they were comfortable. They provided us with fruit platters every day in our room (at no charge) instead of their regular snacks, because our boys have food allergies and can't have wheat. They provided us with a microwave. They had robes just for them and they both rec'd stuffed animals along with other toys. When we had drinks in the lobby lounge, they made sure the boys had crayons and paper. I can't remember all the things they did for our kids, but I do especially remember the staff spelling out our twin sons' names in sponge letters over the tub. + As it should be, most activities and other amenities at the hotel are included in the cost of your stay. I took a yoga class by the beach. It's nice to do yoga in the morning on the sand with the fresh air and waves just a few feet away. Their gym equipment is top notch. (The treadmills overlook the patio or you can watch TV. It's nice to look at something when you're running on a treadmill. The weight room is separate and tucked behind, but it has an adequate mix of free weights and machines).. The pool cabanas and beach lounge chairs are complimentary too! + Beach and pool areas are beautiful and well-maintained! Views of the ocean from the kiddie pool area is still amazing. + All the small details. Complimentary sliced pineapple and other fruit were passed out along with water throughout the day at the pool and beach areas. Our room always seemed to have been cleaned, even if we were only away for an hour or so. The staff always addressed our sons, in addition to us. The valets always asked us if we needed any directions or any additional items for our day trips. Negatives: - $$$$ (but it's worth it). - When you stay at other hotels after staying at the Four Seasons in Maui, you realize how incredible the Four Seasons Maui is and you can't go back to regular Maui hotels. This happened during our most recent trip to Maui (Sept 2009). We stayed at a very reputable, decent 4 star hotel in Kaanapali. But that's just it. It's a decent 4 star hotel. It's not the Four Seasons. Try the Four Seasons in Maui sometime. You'll notice the difference. We're already trying to plan a trip back to the Four Seasons (Maui) in Spring or Fall 2010. -------------------------- Btw, during our most recent trip to Maui (Sept 2009), we did dine at the Four Seasons twice with some friends who were staying there. The tab is pricey, but the experience is well worth it and views are just amazing from their restaurants! Our friends had a 2 year old and a 1 year old. We had twin 3 year olds. The staff was incredibly accommodating and VERY ATTENTIVE to our children, especially ours with the food allergies. They checked back regularly to make sure that the children were doing okay with the specially prepared food. Also, they didn't make us feel uncomfortable when our children made spills, as most children will do. Some restaurants fail miserably in accommodating small children, especially those with food allergies, but not the Four Seasons Maui.

These rooms are located at the back of the hotel overlooking a parking lot and the delivery entrance for the hotel. Yes, there was a sliver of ocean you could see, but you couldn't spend any time on the balcony to enjoy it with the number of deliveries. There was constant truck noise, including that annoying beeping sound when trucks back up. So as far as I can tell, they took regular rooms, where people would complain about being over the delivery entrance, and combined them to make a small suite and charge twice the normal rate.

We stayed the first 5 days in a beautiful luxury VRBO in the Maui upcountry where we had a wonderful stay. However we were extremely excited about staying at the FS for 3 days! The review titled \"A Crowded Splurge\" below really captures our sentiments about the resort. Don't get us wrong it is a very trendy beautiful resort with wonderful amenities, we were just not wowed! The decor was well kept, although did not reflect the rich Hawaiian culture that is so embedded throughout the island. The resort pools are beautiful, there are three of them and the beach area of course is beautiful. The new Serenity Pool is spectacular....although very crowded. The service at all the pools is spectacular and probably is the best thing about the resort. The luxury cabana's at the Serenity pool are premium price, unlike the complimentary ones by the general pools and beach terace area. In order to have a claim chairs by the Infinity you have to get up at 6am to rush down to the pool/beach and get your reservation in. We had read good reviews about the food in the Lobby Bar and was disappointed that our experience did not reflect the same. It was probably the worst food we had on our trip. We ate at Duo's another night and the food and service was very average. There was an extraordinary amount of children at the resort and they were not well behaved...they ran the halls and played hide and seek in the bar/lobby areas. I understand they have a wonderful children's program and I love children dearly, but when the purpose of the trip is a romantic getaway....it was a premium price for the opportunity to be forced to \"enjoy\" other's children. There are many fabulous accomodations on the Island of Maui, and although we had a nice time....we will not likely stay at the FS next year.

This hotel selection was the one I did the most research on and TripAdvisor really helped me. In the end, it came down to service and the Four Seasons really delivered. My wife and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary so I really wanted this trip and each hotel to be special. The Four Seasons attention to detail was fantastic. Everyone seemed to know about our anniversary. We received so much wine and champagne we knew we couldn't drink it all and began to worry about airline weight issues! A good problem to have. First, we were double upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean View. The room size was very nice and the bathroom huge. The hotel itself is shaped as a \"U\" so the view out the lanai consists of an ocean view as well as a view of the pool and gardens. Very nice. When we arrived we were welcomed to a lei greeting and personal escort to our room. Once again, the luggage arrived before we did (always a nice touch). I had planned to take this vacation/anniversary during the first week in September to cut down on the crowds. It did. While we weren't alone we didn't have to contend with any crush in terms of getting dinner reservations or pool lounges. As I mentioned we were escorted to our room which was typically Four Seasons spacious. The bathroom was fantastic. L'Occitane products everywhere. Shower was wonderful. We had activities planned for most of the 5 days we were on Maui and the concierge and staff could not have been better. They helped with my initial planning before I left home and then stayed engaged throughout the process even though I had made the activity reservations myself. We had a sunrise/bike tour set for 3am and the staff still made sure we had water, blankets and coffee even at that ungodly hour. All amenities are included when you stay at the Four Seasons (no separate resort fee) so the cabanas we used didn't cost us anything. Unlike another reviewer, I didn't see anything approaching any issues as to pool space. We went to the pool early, mid and even late afternoons and were pretty much able to get anything we wanted pool side. The pool staff is fantastic. They escort you to the pool chairs you'd like and slip on a nice pool chair cover in addition to towels, water, etc. I had read horror stories about other nearby Wailea hotels that made you get up at 6am just to get a pool chair (forget about location). I am happy to report that was not the case at the Four Seasons. Once again, the service was/is fantastic. Very easy to get spoiled. The pool staff was very attentive to our needs. We never had a problem getting food or drink. The free food they dispense was also very welcome on the warm/hot days we had. We stayed by the main pool and didn't see a need to visit the \"adults only\" pool. There just weren't that many kids during our stay. They also have a family and adults-only hot tub, which we did use, on opposite sides of the pool. Everything is very easy in this hotel. Just adds to your relaxation when you don't need to worry or get upset over anything. Our breakfasts were equally fantastic at Duos. What a buffet! As our breakfasts were comped I can't speak to the price/value. Personally I just don't eat enough to justify the charges most hotels make for their breakfast buffets. I can say there was huge food selection and we always got a wonderful table and received great service. I'll review Duos and Ferraro's were we ate dinner separately. However, both restaurants were great. Pricey but great. I used the valet service to park the car and the service again was fantastic. I had rented a Jeep for the \"Road to Hana\" trip and the valet staff made sure we had plenty of water and also helped me with the windows and roof of the car in terms of opening it up as a convertible or closing it up. The hotel itself is quite lovely. Very spacious. The gardens were very nice. I was able to make an appointment for a massage at the Spa in short order at the time I wanted. The Spa area itself is quite nice and very similar to other spas I've frequented. The massage I received was very relaxing and my only regret was that I didn't have more than one! As I've mentioned, the Four Seasons has a lot of very nice amenities one of which is a complementary scuba lesson. The lesson was great. The introduction is in the pool area and consisted of a free private lesson. The lesson went so well I took my first ocean dive! Just a fantastic experience. I would recommend this hotel without any qualifications. I really debated between a few of the other Wailea hotels but in the end you just can't beat the service.

This resort tops our list of all resorts & hotels we've been to together, period. Here are the areas where I'd rate it the highest possible score: 1. Quality of service: Every single person we encountered gave us the highest level of attention and service. I never had an empty drink, whether at one of the excellent restaurants or at the pool. Every staff member we came into contact with asked often if there was anything else they could do for us. There were many surprises along the way (a crumb cake delivered to our room 20 minutes after check-in, fresh ice delivered without request every single day during cocktail hour, a huge dessert plate delivered on our check-out day, a hand written thank you note from the restaurants the day after dining...). We also had a spa treatment and were greeted by enthusiastic, super-friendly masseuses. 2. Cleanliness and beauty of the property Inside and out, the perfection of the grounds is common at most Four Seasons (or all of them), but in this case, the natural beauty of the Hawaiian west coast, its sunsets and palm trees and over-the-top amazing climate are all accentuated by the perfectly manicured landscaping, impeccably clean rooms and general areas. Large, open spaces. Everything in the design of the place was well-thought-out and has a purpose. The interior layout of the lobby spaces is all open to the coast so that you can see the ocean from almost every area. 3. Excellence in cuisine and menus They have the classic Wolfgang Puck restaurant, Spago, on the grounds - a sister to the LA hot-spot. The food here was so good, we had to go back a second time (which is something we rarely do when in a new place). Try the tomato soup. It's amazing! We also dined at Ferraro's, an Italian spot that's all out-doors just over the ocean with an excellent view of the sunset from every table. The penne arrabiata and excellent wine list both stand out here. We had room service often, and it was excellent. They consistently aimed to give us the best table possible just because we asked for it. We often had 2 - 3 different servers or runners coming to our table often. The pool menu is pretty extensive on both meals and tropical drinks, and the service there was consistently great as well. The beach was very private since it was at the end of the beach before a lot of rocks, which kept people from other resorts from causing too much foot traffic as you enjoy the view. We could hear a fair amount of commotion down at the Grand Wailea due to its large percentage of families/kids, whereas the Four Seasons was much more of a couples resort by nature. Quiet, serene and professional. Above and beyond everything, you will notice at the Four Seasons the beauty and grandness of the property and the way it calls your eyes to the view of the other side of Maui across the water, the waves, the clouds, the neighboring island Lana'i, the sun....everything that is beautiful about Maui. We did a lot off the property to experience the island, but we often felt we could have spent 24 hours a day at the resort and still felt like we really had a relaxing vacation and truly experienced Maui.

While it was a perfectly nice resort and had the typical amenities you'd expect at a Four Seasons (personal attention at check-in, turn-down service, comfortable amenities), we weren't particulary impressed in comparison to the more culturally authentic, cozier, and less expensive options we had chosen throughout the rest of our wedding/honeymoon. Reasons we'd be reticent to return: The 3 pools and beach location are lovely, but extremely crowded, even the \"adults only\" serenity pool. One shouldn't have to get up at 6am to rush down to the pool/beach and stake a claim on chairs. There really should be at least one more pool (I know the serenity pool was just added, but they need another one). The spa is too small for a resort of this magnitude. Walking into the changing rooms is like an airport at rush hour, which defeats the whole point of \"relaxation\". Too many ladies jostling for space to preen. And the steam room is alarming loud and the constant entrance/exit of people empties the steam and hampers the effect. Maui has such a rich and unique cultural heritage and unfortunately the Four Seasons doesn't do much to capitalize on this asset. While there are some great art pieces scattered among the premises, the rest of the resort looks like every other Four Seasons: same white sheets, same marble bathrooms, same robes (though they at least have Yukata, probably to appease their Japanese clientele). Make sure to keep your window curtains open at all times to remember where you are. We stayed on the Club Floor and while it was nice to talk with the staff during snack times, we didn't see any other benefit of being up there.

The service is very attentive everywhere except at the restaurants, Duo and Spago, where the service was quite slow. It was especially nice how they have 3 different pool areas with lots of beach chairs and cabanas everywhere- one main \"fountain\" pool, a kids' pool with a nice waterfall area, and totally separate serenity pool area. The serenity pool is fantastic - you must be 21 to get into the pool area as there is a swim-up bar. It has an infinity edge overlooking a beautiful lawn and then down to the beach and ocean - perfect for watching the sunset. Also, if you lean your head back into the water, there is music playing into the water (you can only hear it underwater). But the best part: no kids! Very serene! Another thing we enjoyed was how various local artists came to showcase their work every morning. It was a great way to talk with the artists and bring home some high quality souvenirs without having to leave the resort. We found the resort a little bit \"clunky\"... as in it doesn't blend in with nature very well (from the massive fountain over the main pool to the overall architecture of the buildings). It is very indoor-outdoor and there are beautiful flowers everywhere, but it does not achieve a harmony with its natural surroundings. Also, the hotel recommends Maui Wave Riders in Kihei if you are interesting in surf lessons - but they were pretty terrible. Our instructor was more interesting in hanging out with the other surfers and riding waves himself than showing us what to do. Also, there were beginners all over the place and they would crash right into you. Not the best experience - and even a little scary (our instructor would literally push us into other surfers in trying to get us a wave). If you are vacationing here - stay here and enjoy the amenities (you're paying through the nose to be here, so enjoy it!)", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cAnother great encore performance!\u201d", "Author": "alohachick", "ReviewID": "UR38821505", "Content": "Every time we come here, we feel so taken care of and pampered. This time was no exception but they have exceeded our expectations! The last time we were here was during Spring Break this year and since my husband though the weather was a tad too cool during that time, he wanted to come back but this time with a twist. We started on the Big Island and we stayed on at the Four Seasons Hualalai. I also have written a review on that resort too. Anyway, this time we were coming in after Tropical Storm Felicia blew through and it was definitely a pretty packed resort where they were running in the 80-90 percent occupancy rate. All the staff members we talked to said they were very blessed to have a busy season this year. When we checked in, our room was not quite ready but after visiting the concierge desk to book our reservations and so forth, our room was ready. We were ushered to our room where we actually beat the welcome treats from the resort. As usual, the resort sent us a welcome refreshment plates of some great fruits for our daughter as well as Mom and Dad. The daughter also received stuffed animal from the resort which this year is a green gecko. For those of you with kids, they do provide kid-sized robes and their names spelled out in colorful sponges in the bathroom. As stated before, the youngest of guests are treated very well here and sometimes they become repeat guests later on in life. Watch out dads...your daughters will grow up to let you know they want to get married here! New services that I wanted to share and they are henna tattoos poolside at the Fountain pool and the fabulous new sushi offered in the lobby lounge. A sushi chef was sent to the Four Seasons in Tokyo to train for a month to learn the fine art of making delicious sushi. In addition, the staff has been trained about sake as well so for you sake connoisseurs, please do give the lobby lounge a try. Duo's has a new prix fixe $49 menu which is perfect for those of us with smaller appetites because usually their standard filet mignon starts at 7oz. For those of you who like the Moi fish, which was usually reserved for Hawaiian royalty, this is also another entree item on the prix fixe menu. You can also add half a hawaiian lobster or scallops to this menu for $10. Of course there is the surprise ending of the wonderful cotton candy that is flavored differently for each day of the week. It definitely will bring out the kid in the biggest of kids! Ah, the new Serenity adult pool. Very nice and a good getaway for the honeymooners and folks who just want to relax. Bravo on the pool addition! It is a very beautiful pool but when the trade winds pickup in the afternoon, there is a bit of wind up there too. For those of you with kids, their Kids for All Seasons program is great! There is a structured program everyday and the activities are different from day-to-day. One day there is a tide pool visit over at the Grand Wailea tide pool area, on another day there is a gecko hunting adventure, and so forth. If your you or anyone in your family has food allergies, please do let the staff know and they will take care to ensure that your foods has not been cross-contaminated with the items that you are allergic to. My daughter has a nut and shellfish allergy and here at Wailea as well as Hualalai, the waiter or waitress had told us that the kitchen is using a fresh batch of oil to fry her fries so there is no contamination and that it would take a bit longer to get her food ready. All the restaurants you eat at are pretty much alerted to the food allergies. Also during the evenings, there are scheduled kids programs about once or twice a week so you can sign your children up with Crab Hunting, Spy, or Pirate evening. The cost is $65 for this night evening program that includes dinner and it runs from 6 to 9pm so moms and dads and schedule a romantic dinner for two! The only main drag is the fact that one parent needs to get up at the crack of dawn to stake out the family cabana during the busy season. This is where you see the dads sitting down with their laptops on the cabana seats waiting for the pool attendant to start service at 7am. Then the families start coming out to the pool. Other than that, another fabulous stay and we are looking forward to returning here and at Hualalai.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon at Four Seasons\u201d", "Author": "aoneil1975", "ReviewID": "UR38473415", "Content": "We stayed at the Four Seasons Maui for part of our Honeymoon, and at the Grand Wailea using points for the remaining nights. The Four Seasons has exceptional facilities and expectional service to match. You will spend a great deal of money to stay here, but FS really does deliver. Our room was large with a separate sitting area, the bathroom was large and plush, and the lanai was big and had a nice view of the ocean. Everything about it was high end, as expected given the price. Service from front desk to concierge to housekeeping to pool attendants to waitstaff was first rate, consistently and without exception. There is a genuine enthusiasm for customer service. The staff shows a lot of initiative in addition to being polite and professional, absolutely first rate in every regard. I equate the staff and service to that of the greenbrier, operating on a different level and exclusive to only the highest end properties in the industry. The great thing about the FS Maui is, once you are there, you're not paying for a lot of add ons. Granted you are paying a great deal to stay there, but once you're in you are not being nickel and dimed (outside of internet access, which was $14 a day and inconsistent with so many other amenities that were free). Cabanas, umbrellas, etcetera were all free. The proportion of guests to cabanas and umbrellas was well conceived, so you we were always able to find a great cabana. If you want a choice spot overlooking the beach you will have to get up early (which is great, we loved getting up early and having complimentary coffee and socializing with other early risers, there is a wonderful sense of good cheer among guests), but all are plush. Poolside service is professional, non-invasive, and very gracious. Sunscreen, water, pineapple and watermelon, and water spritzes are all readily available and complimentary. FS just built an adults-only pool, its an infinity pool. Cabanas here are actually sheds and cost money but have big screen tvs and climate control, fridge, etcetera. If you don't use these, you have plenty of beach chairs/beds with plenty of umbrellas/overhangs provided if requested, at no charge. The pool is beautiful and has a swim up bar. Really a great place to relax. Lots of great stuff for kids we noticed, plush game room, kids buffet at lunch, great stuff. Grand wailea has a pool kids would prefer, but FS does do a lot of great things for kids. Restaurants are first rate but very expensive. Ferraro's is very close tot he beach and we recommend having dinner while watching the sunset. Workout facilities were high end and mostly outside overlooking the beach. The lobby bar was really great. There is a general store at shops at wailea, and a safeway @ 10 minutes drive, we recommend stocking up on essentials to reduce cost. We liked the grand wailea too, but did our island exploring while there, because cabanas and everything else costs additional money, and there is really no contest between the two resorts. The reviews about each are accurate from what we found on tripadvisor. It was free for us using hilton points, so we can't complain, and the service was very good. Facilities were nice, lots of walking though because it is a big resort. However, It does not cmpare to the FS, if you are going to spend the moeny to go to Hawaii and stay at one of these resorts, FS should be your choice.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cWOW, WOW, WOW!!!\u201d", "Author": "randyoneseattle", "ReviewID": "UR37677379", "Content": "I have stayed at some top notch resorts but this one was the topper!!!

Our white rental car was covered in mud after a downpour one day. We had the car parked by the valet and when we requested our car the next morning, it was washed and cleaned. I asked for a certain type of jam during breakfast and it was not part of the hotels choices so I happily had my second choice. The next breakfast, the same waitress brought me a jar of the jam that the hotel didn't carry and said she picked it up at a grocery store on her way home. I had some BBQ sauce spilled on my white Tommy Bahama shirt and hung it up by the bathtub so as not to spread the sauce on the other parts of the shirt. After returning from dinner, the housecleaner left a note and some Woolite with directions not to dry clean the shirt but rather soak it in cold water over night with the Woolite and it will look new in the morning. I did as directed and sure enough my shirt was spared. A server at the breakfast buffet overheard us saying that we preferred our bacon crisp and a bit over done and before we knew it, it was brought to our table side by the restaurant manager. We requested a secluded table for lunch but because the restaurant was so busy and we did not have a reservation, we could not be accommodated. To our surprise, when a table did open up on the patio away form the entrance, the host informed us and the staff moved everything to the table all in a pleasant manner. It was more work for them but they were genuinely happy to do it. I liked the chilled aloe vera gel at the poolside and mentioned it to the poolside servers. When an attendant returned with a chilled towel 15 minutes later, she had the information about the aloe gel written on a piece of paper for me. My partner and I had noticed that there was some construction going on on a secluded part of the hotel. When I inquired about the construction to who I thought was a groundskeeper, he informed me that he was the project manager for an new adult pool that was in construction and was to open in a couple of weeks. He then took me and my partner on a tour of the facilities as workers were busily hammering away. His brief 15 minute tour and description was such a pleasant effort as he was obviously busy. In general, every employee at this hotel seemed to want to go beyond what was expected and anticipated our needs. As I said before, this went beyond all of my expectations and I am a very very demanding traveler.", "Date": "August 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon was fabulous thanks to Four Seasons Maui\u201d", "Author": "citychicgal", "ReviewID": "UR37594735", "Content": "Just returned from 8 days in Maui at the Four Seasons Resort, nothing but great things to say! Yes, the price is jaw-dropping, but they are also doing stay 3 get the 4th night free specials, so that makes it worthwhile. Also, once you get there, no nickel and diming on the chairs, cabanas, poolside service. The only thing you pay for is food and drink service, as well as the uber-private cabanas up at the adult pool (that come with a flat screen and wi fi - 300 bucks a day). They aren't worth it - get up early, get a spot at the Sereneity (read: adult) Pool, and enjoy a free gorgeous view with the same level of service. We stayed in a Garden View room - 418 to be exact. The rooms on the 4th floor for Garden View are great, you have a little grass area that extends past your patio/lanai, and there is a nice hedge that blocks the view from the grounds into your room. We saw the partial ocean view, and for an extra 250 a night, the view is not worth it. Plus, everyone can see into your room from the courtyards at night unless you close the blinds. Use the extra 250 and splurge on a great dinner or drinks in the hotel. Yes, valet service is 20 dollars a day. No, I do not know why they charge for that when rooms start around 550 a night. The valets do a great job at making you feel welcome. They put water in your car, clean out trash/coffee cups, and offered us a cooler with ice for the Road to Hana trip. The best part came when we took a walk over to the Shops at Wailea, and called for a shuttle pick-up. Well, the shuttle wasn't going to come for another 20 minutes, so they sent a valet with the Four Season's Cadillac CTS to get us! We almost giggled ourselves silly to see the lovely valet get out and call our names. The little things FS does to make their customers feel like royalty really does work. Some tips: Get up early - around 7-8am, and go down and make a cabana reservation. They are pretty forgiving on the time frame. As long as you are back within an hour and a half, your chairs are reserved. You get 2 hours during 11-2pm. Yes the drinks are pricey (think 10 for a smoothie, 12 for a cocktail), but when else will you have your drink hand-delivered to you in a chair by a handsome FS pool attendant?) Breakfast at DUO is 35 a head, and we ate there 4 mornings and were never disappointed. If you are in Kihei for surf lessons or such, try Kihei Cafe for a great inexpensive option to the DUO FS breakfast. We liked the mixture, and it kept our budget in check. Ferraro's at the FS is great for lunch if you don't want to spend the $$ for dinner. The view can't be beat and the breeze in the mid-day is lovely. One of the best views in the house for your dollar is the lobby lounge. Starting at 5, they have a heavy appetizer menu and a limited dinner menu, with drinks and dessert. They have half priced full bottles of wine after 8pm. Live music is playing, and you can watch the sunset from really comfy chairs. We did this several nights and were never disappointed. The rooms were very spacious and we never felt cramped. I loved how you didn't immediately open the door into the bedroom, there is a little hallway with a minibar before you get to the room that made it feel more private. The bathrooms were great and always stocked with L'Occitane toiletries each night. Twice-daily housekeeping makes sure your things are always kept nice. We walked over to Grand Wailea next door, and while it is a beautiful hotel with an awesome spa, we were happy to be staying at FS. The Grand Wailea is just too loud and too many kids to be relaxing for honeymooners - go FS all the way! FS also has an outrigger canoe program (only 1 of 2 on the island) that is free to all guests. We learned how to canoe, took a trip out, and saw a lot of sea life - it was wonderful! Concierge service was lovely and always sent directions for our next day's travels the night before. They also did a wake up call with a 15 minute follow-up call just to make sure you were awake. : ) For those departing on an evening flight, they have an \"Aloha Suite\" that you can use to freshen up. It has male/female dressing areas and showers complete with all toiletries and robes. There is a lounge area and tv/computer access as well. It was much needed and appreciated! Go FS!

Four Seasons is not just about the spectacular property/rooms/views (and believe me they are spectacular!), it's about the service. From the moment the valet opened my car door upon arrival to the moment we left, I felt like a princess at my summer palace. All of the staff make a point to ask your name and use it whenever they see you. \"So Mr. Jones, can we find you some chairs by the pool? Would you prefer to be in the sun or in the shade? Would you like to face the beach or face the pool?\" Once you are seated, the offerings begin. Ice water? Sliced pineapple? Watermelon? Ice pop? Cucumber slices for your eyes? Chilled wet towel to refresh? I couldn't help giggling every time they came around! Twice daily housekeeping service, treats left in the room your first and last nights, large plush towels for beach/pool that don't have to be signed out/in like at other hotels, no additional fees for cabanas/beach umbrellas, top-quality toiletries, jugs of sunscreen everywhere (in 3 different strengths!), well-equipped game room. There is even a bookshelf by the pool stocked with the latest best-sellers for you to borrow. I could go on and on. As for meals, yes they are costly but well worth it. We ate at the Lobby Bar, and also had lunch and dinner at Ferraro's. All were outstanding. Negatives? Forget about seeing sights on Maui because you won't want to leave the resort! We never made it to Haleakala...oops. And I agree with the comment made in another review: the outdoor fitness facility is charming, but I found it too hot to enjoy my exercise time and sort of missed my air-conditioned YMCA. I do have one small word of caution though: We booked a room on the Club Floor in order to take advantage of the Club Lounge, all-day access to snacks/drinks (included in the cost of the room), and personalized concierge service. When we arrived, the price for our room had mysteriously increased by $300/night over what had been quoted and confirmed. We learned that there is an additional fee of $150 per child per day for the Club Floor, but this charge is not spelled out anywhere on Four Seasons' website or on the booking confirmation we received. Thanks to our travel agent and the superior service provided by ALL Four Seasons staff, this additional charge was removed from our bill without a fuss. In my opinion, it's only the most highly-skilled professionals who understand how to provide great service without being intrusive. Four Seasons employees have mastered this art.

We stayed at the Four Seasons from July 31 through August 5. Our family included three young kids, all between the ages of 5-10, and the resort caters to both couples and families. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by smiles, orchid and kukui lei, complimentary iced tea, cool oshiburi towels, and a toy basket in which each child could select a small toy of their choice. Toys included a mini \"nerf-like\" football, sticky squids, and the list goes on. We reserved the garden room, which was over 600sf. Our kids names were each spelled out on the beautiful marble tub with colorful sponges. In addition, the coffee table in the dining area included kiddie drinks (chocolate milk, capri sun) and other treats like rice krispies drizzled w/chocolate, dark chocolate turtles on a bed of graham cracker sand. Little blue bathroom tub toy whales accompanied the children's snacks and my kids were absolutely thrilled. For the adults, we had snacks that were served in a \"woven box and orchid\" and included dried mango and cookies. My kids, all boys, just loved their bathrobes sized especially for them. They placed a gecko stuffed animal for each of my boys on top of the bed, and again, my boys were impressed. It's this attention to detail that is just one of many factors that guests appreciate. The room decor was simple and tasteful and the bed/sheets/pillows were extremely comfortable. The large flat screen tv was nice, although, we didn't watch too much tv. They even provided us with a booklight for any late night reading. The oversized tub, large marble shower and dual vanities helped the family to get ready alot quicker than usual. Bathroom shampoos/soaps/conditioner/shower cream were premium quality--L'Occitane. We took advantage of the fitness center, \"martial arts boot camp session\", spa facilities, kids programme, wailea shuttle, and the list goes on. Spent most of our vacation hanging out poolside at the kids pool, am walks on the beach. We had buffet at DUO restaurant almost every morning and dined there one evening. We also tried out Ferraro's, the Lounge, and lots of orders for poolside lunches and cocktails. Again, food is expensive,and it is tasty (not outstanding) and convenient. I would say that the prices and quality of the food are reasonable for that area. Kids under 5 eat free at DUO and Ferraros (DUO is closed at lunch while Ferraros is closed at breakfast). I also had the foot/scalp massage at the spa and it was heavenly. I also enjoyed another foot/scalp massage poolside (cabana). Including tip, the two massages were about $500, which is pretty standard for a hotel of this caliber. The steam room in the spa facilities were complimentary and I enjoyed my \"mini-breaks\" there. Iced water flavored with mint or lemons also were provided for spa users in addition to use of lockers, robes, slippers, shavers. The complimentary cabanas are unheard of in Hawaii and it made our stay soo relaxing. Yes, it's true, the poolside attendants were very attentive to our needs, refilling water, frozen pops for the kids, watermelon slices, pineappples, mini banana muffins, cool scented oshiburo towels, saw them set up play pens for toddlers, clean sunglasses for some of the guests. We didn't opt for the evian spritz--though available..Just be careful around the kiddie pool area, it can get very slippery. It is also true that you need to arrive very early in the morning to get prime cabanas..I'm an early bird, so that wasn't any issue for me. Checked out the serenity pool (the pool requires your hotel key card to enter/exit and is for 21and over). The cabanas in that area are not complimentary and I think costs $300, and include a plasma tv and other luxe items... They do provide complimentary coffee, tea, hot chocolate and pastries very early in the am by the lobby area and complimentary newspapers (ny times fax, maui newspaper and honolulu advertiser) at the concierge and restaurants. Most of the hotel employees knew us by name, though not all. Worth noting that they try to memorize guests names. We did encounter a few celebrities during our stay, and the environment was low-key..no papparazi at the hotel (they hid at the beach) and hotel guests were very respectful of the celebrities' privacy. Again, when you take into account all of the complimentary amenities and exceptional service, this hotel is worth every penny.

For the honeymoon we wanted a once in a lifetime 5-star resort experience so we could bask in the lap of luxury. I'm fairly certain that no other hotel would have offered the kind service and beauty needed to compete with the Four Seasons. We were greeted upon arrival by smiles, leis, sweet green tea, prompt bell and valet service, and a breathtaking lobby. This hotel offers every amenity your imagination could concoct: chilled lavender scented towels, Evian mist, fresh fruit, and ice pops all served complimentary pool-side; complimentary champagne to celebrate our honeymoon and Belgian chocolates and a card delivered to our room for my husband's birthday. The staff at the concierge desk was knowledgeable and helped us design an itinerary to meet every fantasy we'd imagined on our first trip to Hawaii along with confirmations delivered to the room equipped with written directions from the hotel. When we drove the road to Hana, room service provided a cooler full of ice for our picnic at no charge and coordinated with the bell desk to set us up with towels and blankets for the beach. This hotel, unlike other places on the island that would have offered marginal savings with substantially inferior service, did not nickel and dime us for every little thing. The cabanas, for example, cost nothing--as opposed to the Hyatt where you'll pay upwards of $100--and they will hold them for up to an hour, longer during lunchtime, should you want to head out for a massage, a swim, back to the room, etc. The rooms were likewise phenomenal. Every other hotel I have ever stayed in has seemed to have a fascination with hideous drapes, but the furnishings at the Four Seasons were simple, airy, and delightfully beautiful. Our partial ocean room included an over-sized bathtub and large stand-up shower, a king-size bed with lots of pillows and fluffy white sheets, and gorgeous wooden furniture on the lanai with a lovely view of the sunset over the ocean; I supposed the palm tree or two that swayed along the vista is why it was a partial and not a full. I did yoga on the beach each morning, which was one of many complimentary offerings by the fitness center in addition to the outdoor cardio room and the weight room. They have a game room with computers, video games, pool tables, and a flat screen TV for families and rainy days, though you won't likely get one of those since the hotel is located on a desert section of the coast. I could go on and on here all day. If you want luxury, this place is unrivaled! My one and only complaint is that it's simply not affordable to eat or drink on the resort. We did eat wraps at Snorkels Cafe, a quick odds-and-ends type of place right by the beach. We also had dinner and Spago and Ferraro's once each. As a New Yorker and a foodie, I was not impressed in the least with Spago, particularly since it came with a $500 price tag and was far from transcendent, but that's a separate review. Luckily we discovered Roy's and other more casual places in Kihei-- a surfer town just down the street--that made it possible to keep some sort of a budget. It just started to get annoying to have to go out constantly to eat and drink because a sandwich at the pool-side restaurant cost $30 and a mojito was $12. We ended up buying beer and liquor in town and drinking our own drinks covertly while we sunbathed since ordering from the bar was unsustainable. Again, we're a couple of young newlyweds just starting our lives together, so if you're not working with a budget at all, I say go for it!

The hotel is reminiscent of a small palace with gorgeous plantings and artwork adorning the entire resort. The grounds, pools, beach and views are breathtaking and extremely well attended. Upon arrival we chose to upgrade our room to an executive suite with a prime ocean view. The cost was a bit steep, but worth the space and views. The Spa was a serene experience where I indulged in the best facial I have ever had. The serenity pool with the swim up bar is also a must do.

I was there for a medical conference being held at the Grand Wailea. After reading reviews about the Grand Wailea and the Four Seasons, we decided to stay here. That was the best decision we made. The Four Seasons is a much nicer resort. We have 2 small children - ages 3 and 6 yrs. I found the pools at the Grand Wailea a bit overwhelming to keep track of young children. Additionally, I saw many people staking out places by the pool at 6:45 am at the Grand Wailea, which was absolutely not the case at the Four Seasons. I agree with all the other reviews that this is a very family-friendly resort. Our children were treated so well that they didn't want to leave. We ate at all 3 restaurants and liked Spago the best. Every meal there was amazing. My husband and son LOVED the Uku. We have stayed at 5 star resorts all over the world and this resort was definitely the best one we've stayed at for a family with young children. Their service is amazing and they really attend to every detail. My only negative would be the cost of food and the fact that they charge you $10 per day per computer for internet access. The lack of free internet was really surprising to me and I was flat out shocked when they charged us double because we had 2 laptops in use. Regarding food.. my husband and I don't drink alcohol and our bills for dinner were always over $150 - even without the children. But after speaking with other people from my conference, it sounds like the food at the other resorts in Wailea are also very expensive.

From the time we checked in and were upgraded to a partial ocean view without having to ask, to enjoying the new adult only pool. The only small problem we had was on our first full day there after hanging out at the pool until 2pm, we came back to our room and they were just getting ready to clean it, a bit annoying. We hung out on our lanai while they cleaned the room. We called the front desk, and asked that our room be cleaned between 9-10am every morning, and turn down service between 8-9pm every night. We never had a problem after that. Back to the great stuff. Breakfast or dinner at Duo's was great, wonderful outside patio area, delicious food, pricey, but you are at the Four Seasons. We had dinner a few times at Ferraro's, we highly reccomend it. The food and service were always great, and you MUST have their Tiramisu, delightful, yummy. We even rented one of the cabanas at the Adult pool, ($300), and it was well worth it. Try to get one of the two in the back, better sun all day long. You were never longing for service whatever pool you were at. They fixed up a couple of lounge chairs for us, provided us with ice cold water through out the day, popsicles or outterpops, and even cold jello. Towards the end of the day someone would come by with aloe vera for you to put on your skin. They also had sun screen lotion stations free of charge. And sometimes came by with an Evian spritz to help cool you down. The rooms were wonderful, just like everyone said. The staff was outstanding, and called by name once they got to know you. Take a walk or shuttle to the Wailea shopping center, go to ABC or the General store, and stock up on munchies or beer and soda for your room frig, while there, enjoy a wonderful breakfast at Longhi's, or lunch/dinner at Tommy Bahama's. and then take the nice walk back to the hotel cutting through the Grand Wailea hotel. Or if your too tired, call the Four Seasons and they will pick you up. They even gave us a ride to Matteo's for pizza one night. Great little casual place, order at the counter, sit down, and pizza is delivered. Loud and lively, great food. We also hitched a ride from the Four Seasons to the Wailea Golf course to play the Emerald course, I highly reccomend playing that course, and if you play early, stop in the cliubhouse for a great lunch. We also booked a tour on Blue Hawaiian helicopter, our first time. It was great, we went over west Maui and Molikai, our pilot even detoured us over the Ritz Carlton Bay golf course, because we were playing the course the next day. We spent the rest of that day cruising to Paia, if you want a casual day shopping, go there, nice little shops, great fish tacos at the Fish Market, we heard Charlie's is also great. If you want a fancy expensive lunch or dinner with a fantastic view go to Moma's House just past Paia. Want to try something different, take the road upcountry, and go to the winery, yes a winery in Maui, if you can bring a lunch, and enjoy the grounds, very peaceful, and relaxing, the air is much cooler, and refreshing up there. The wine is ok, the pineapple wine tastes like a cold fruit sweet drink. Thy also have regular wine they make. For sushi we wetn to Sansei in Kihei, an easy taxi ride there, the hotel can make reservations and give you directions. The concierge staff at the Four Seasons was wonderful, they booked our trips, had tickets, directions delivered to our room, whatever we asked for, they made it happen, and most of the time, they just billed it to our room. We are now officially spoiled and will find it very hard to go to another resort. We hope this review helps anyone wavering on where to stay.

We pulled up to the front entrance after driving around Maui all day (8 hours in the car!) and did not get in the car again for 4 days! We just did not want to leave the hotel! We reserved a Garden view room and were upgraded to a Partial Ocean View room- the view was really just from the Lanai- I would not have wanted to pay the POV price. The room itself was really nice, with a huge bathroom. My strategy for the trip was \"nicest hotel, worst room\", and in the Four Seaons, the worst room is still really great! I am so glad we stayed here instead of the other hotels in Wailea- it really was just so luxurious, with tons of attention to detail. Here's what I loved the most: Beautiful pool and beach area, with the beach being so close to the pool, you didn't have to decide which one to swim in. The cabanas and chairs with umbrellas were \"free\", and while the prime ones get snatched up early in the AM, there were plenty of good seats to be had all day. And lots of people to come by to fill your water glass, offer fresh fruit, etc. The restaurants, while expensive, were beautiful with amazing food. We had lunch at Ferraro's every day, and the view was perfect. We had dinner at Duo one night (The $49 price fixe is a good deal) and Spagos another night (we splurged for the 9 course tasting menu!) The fitness center is outdoors- very cool! The lobby bar has a great view for sunsets- just really relaxing. The whole place just has a great feel. My only complaints: If you want to eat at the hotel, you have to spend a lot of money- there was a snack bar at the beach, but it wasn't that great. There's a great walk along the beach that leads to the shops at Wailea, so you can pick up snacks there. The main pool was nice, but the adult only serenity pool opened the day after we left....we checked it out and was awesome! Swim up bar, cool cabanas (I think they cost extra). We were sad to miss out! Only complaint about the room is that all the bathroom lights are on one swich with no dimmers, so it's either super bright or totally dark. All in all, it was the nicest hotel I've ever been to and I'd go back in a minute!

I thought it was very nice and was glad we stayed here over anywhere else on the island we visited. However, I think maybe I would have rather gone to a smaller resort on another island. I was surprised how many kids were there. They did just open the adult pool which helped, and was very nice. I do agree with others that it seemed to get very crowed early at the pools and beaches. We would get to the pools and beach around 9am and most of the prime cabannas or chairs were taken. With so many people at the beaches and now the adult pool, it felt as though the staff was spread a little thin. There were many positives. The rooms were very nice and the service was great. We only at Ferraro's on site which was good. Off site we had a light dinner at Tommy bahamas at Wailea shops which was surprisingly good. We ate at Mammas Fish House and Kiehe beach cafe for breakfast. We had a dinner at Murphys Pub which is at the Wailea Blue course which was a nicce change of pace. We also ate a lunch at the Pizza place accross from the Shops at Wailea. One activity we liked was a hike at a stop along the Hanna Highway that was about 45 minutes from the hotel. It had several waterfalls and you could go and swim. There were a lot of tourist there, but worth it to find the hidden pools. The front desk has a map of how to get there. In closing this is a big resort, almost 400 rooms. I have been to the FS in Costa Rica, Great Exuma, Jackson Hole, and Bali. These are more intimate resorts of around 150 rooms. I felt this was the best resort on the island(don't go to the Ritz-windy, isolated.) You will enjoy yourself. It was close to a lot of other places to go and see and eat.

He was totally taken back by the fact that when he turned back to the pool table the staff had already reracked it for him! That made quite an impression on him and on us.

Yes, the restaurant prices are very pricey and aside from ordering some drinks and snacks poolside and a dinner at Ferraro's we did not eat at the resort. We left for most meals, most notably breakfast. I would have a complaint that the breakfast prices are just too much. We traveled with a teen girl and boy and the girl doesn't even eat breakfast and my husband and I are fine with something light but our teenage son is an eating machine and just for him to go get breakfast at the restaurant would have been $34 for him and they did not offer a teen menu at Duo though they did have a children's menu for under 12.

We were pampered throughout our stay! We arrived late in the evening and were greeted by the valet staff with fresh flower leis for the girls and shell/nut leis for the boys. We were led inside by one person to check in while another unloaded our car. At check in, my kids were asked to choose a toy from a basket while we were informed that both our rooms had been upgraded, and would be connecting. Once in our rooms - wow! They were both so spacious, with nice lanais and beautiful bathrooms. As previously reported, our kids' names had been spelled out in sponge letters, bubble bath and bath toys had been laid by the tub and they had their own robes to lounge in! On top of that, they'd left a nice bottle of champagne and anniversary card for my parents, milk and cookies for my kids and some really yummy goodies for my husband and me. The ice buckets had been filled (and would continue to be filled every evening) and plenty of water bottles had been left in the fridges. I loved that there was no pre-stocked minibar, which saved us the hassle of trying to keep the kids out of the goodies! Plush robes for everyone, comfortable slippers if we were so inclined and even a tote bag to use while we were there. We spent the next day playing in the pool and at the beach in front of the hotel, and were very happy to see that getting a cabana was no problem. Poolside service was great - they even send someone around to clean your sunglasses! The kids loved the little treats they provided - fresh fruit, made from scratch jello, popsicles. I loved that there was also plenty of water brought around and that they had provided organic sunscreen in 3 different SPF factors, just in case you forgot to bring your own. Unfortunately, my mother had an accident that day - a couple of big waves smashed her into the sand while she was wave-jumping and she suffered some scrapes and bruises along with a very sore neck (where she landed). When we asked for some ice, they not only gave her the ice pack, but they sent someone from security to check on her and ultimately called an ambulance to take her to the ER to make sure she hadn't broken any bones, which she luckily didn't have. Needless to say, spending our first day in Hawaii in ER was not fun, but the security staff at FS were great. They called several times throughout our stay to check on her and ask if there was anything she needed. BTW, the doctors and nurses at Maui Memorial were great! The next day, Mom rested while the rest of us got up at 3 am to make the trek to Haleakala to watch the sun rise. They had hot drinks and pastries in the lobby! They had blankets for us to take on the trip! And the sunrise was glorious...the kids got a kick out of having to wear hats and mittens in Hawaii, and we got some great pictures. And when we went on a snorkel/cruise, the bell desk had all the towels we'd need and plenty of water bottles for our trip. All the employees were so friendly and helpful. They greeted us with warm smiles and took the time to talk with my children. They all helped to make this a truly relaxing vacation. We ate breakfast at the hotel one day, and lunch in Ferraro's - the food was very good. But with so many great restaurants to choose from, we usually ate off-property. We were very impressed with the quality of our meals on Maui. Definitely make a trip to Stella Blues Cafe for breakfast, Koiso for sushi and Sarento's on the Beach for a sunset dinner! The only objection we had during our stay was when they started fertilizing the plants around the resort - man, that was stinky! However, with the ocean breezes sailing through, it wasn't too unbearable. I guess they've got to do it sometime in order to keep the property looking so lush, and it certainly was better to be a privileged vacationer than the guys laying the stuff down!

This stay however was quite different. While we were thrilled to be upgraded to an oceanfront prime one bedroom suite (we had booked an oceanview), the excitement wore off quickly. I noticed tiny fast crawling ants on the floor of the water closet and all over the bathroom sink, and my stepdaughter saw ants crawling all over the lamp next to the sofa. My husband asked for a manager to call us in the morning. No one called, so he asked someone at the front desk to have a manager call. By the next day, no one had called, so he asked yet again for a manager to call. He also emailed one of the managers, who had given us her card when we checked in. (We never did receive a response from her). All the while, the ants were still there, and I had also noticed one in the shower on the ledge and some in the bedroom. Additionally, I saw ants crawling on my husband's toothbrush and toothpaste. The moment I first saw the ants I began packing my things away - what a pain that became. Finally my husband was able to speak to a manager in person. He promised to have housekeeping spray. It didn't seem to have any effect, so he called the manager again. His only offer to us was that I could receive a complimentary massage. Huh? Were we really staying at the Four Seasons??? As we checked out, we were asked about our stay. Even though it was too late, I mentioned about the ants, that the sofa bed was only made up 2 out of 5 nights (for my step-daughter), and that housekeeping never placed washcloths in the bathroom that my stepdaughter was using. There could be no mistake that it was being used for bathing, along with the fact that the presence of a shower demands a washcloth in addition to the bath towel and bath mat. I left quickly, as we had a flight to catch. No sooner had we reached the car, a young man called after us. My husband explained the entire situation and we were offered 15% off per night. I also received an email from yet another manager that we could receive a free night during our next stay. Are you kidding me? Where were these offers while we were still there?What about just getting rid of the ants? What about returning phone calls as soon as possible?

The good reviews fail to point out obvious flaws, and the bad reviews are a bit too harsh. The truth is somewhere in the middle.

Now I must be fair and acknowledge some of the negative things I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read and found to be true. - Although one can find a cabana with ease without waking up at the crack of dawn to reserve one, the prime ones overlooking the ocean always \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mysteriously\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd appeared to be reserved even really early in the morning. - An ocean view room does not necessarily mean that you will be able to actually see the ocean from your room. Your room may be located very far from the ocean. The room may not face the ocean directly. There may be trees occluding the view. This is for an ocean view not a partial ocean view. Those were pretty minor things and some people may stay here and never encounter those problems. All in all this place is definitely a resort to benchmark other resorts.

Amenities are also superior; from the grounds to the pool to the spa, everything was extremely well done and maintained. If there's any downside it's the price. My only recommendation here (unless you've just got gobs of money to spend) is to go with one of the lower end rooms (I think the Mountain View is the least expensive). The price difference between a mountain or garden view versus a partial or prime ocean view is substantial. Unless you're a fan of staying in your room on vacation for extended periods of time, the ocean view just isn't worth what you pay for it. You'll still receive the same great service and be able to enjoy all of the amenities no matter the room, so why not save a few $? Beyond the room cost, we realized at checkout that we were getting charged an additional $20/day for parking.

No one doubts that this is an amazing hotel, impeccable service, unbelievably well maintained and in a great spot on the beach. We were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a one bedroom ocean front suite. Our views were breathtaking. We ate at Spago, Ferraro's, Duo's, the bar/restaurant area by Spago (twice) and had poolside and room service. The food in every instance was amazing - we never left to eat anywhere else! We really enjoyed the bar/restaurant (I can't remember the name) on the same floor as Spago's. There was live music, hula dancers and great views of the sunset. You could order off of any menu at the resort from here and it was a more mellow experience. You have to try the fish and chips. I know it doesn't sound fancy but my god it is amazing! We used the Spa facilities and had a couples massage which was very relaxing. MAKE SURE you do the morning outrigger trip. It's free, the FS staff on board are beyond knowledgable about the sport and we saw at least 5 turtles. But I would like to note a few slightly different things about this place. Yes the resort is bliss, pure luxury and very relaxing but I felt that it lacked a Hawaiian feel to it. The FS Hualalai dripped in Hawaiian vibes and I missed that here. The rooms were beautiful but generic almost, no color or warmth or any reminders that you were on a tropical island. Also, I almost felt like I was in LA, not Hawaii, because every other guest was from the city and the resort again lacked a Hawaiian vibe. Being from Chicago, this put me off, I'm just not used to it. I love LA and really enjoy visiting that city, but I'm in Maui! Again, not a horrible game changer, but it was a bit of a culture shock after the mellow Big Island. And the resort space itself is quiet small, if the resort was at full capacity and I was fighting for space by the pool, I would not have enjoyed myself. At full capacity this place would be a nightmare. There is not a lot of room to move around and FS recognizes this apparently because they are building a new adult pool area to be opened at any moment.

We were thinking about staying at the Ritz Carlton or Fairmont Kea Lani and we saw both during our stay and were especially glad that we weren't staying at the Ritz (it's on the northwest part of the island which had lots of evergreen trees and didn't really look like you're in Hawaii and it wasn't on the beach at all). Obviously the service was great. The staff will bend over backwards for you. I mean, they are used to taking care of celebrities, so no job is too big! We just got really tired of having to shell out tips for everything- especially since you're forced to valet park and pay $20/day for it. If I was given the choice to valet park I would have no problem with tipping valet if they put water in our car and give us directions! I definitely recommend getting the bed and breakfast package (includes the full breakfast buffet for two and is $35 per day). If you don't have that package and decide to have the full buffet, the cost is $85 per day! You will not regret it- best breakfast ever! We arrived to find a bottle of champagne in our upgraded room! The bathroom was almost as big as the room itself! We did not eat dinner at any of the restaurants in the hotel. Instead, we went to Capische (very good italian and sooooo romantic) in Wailea, a place called I'o in Lahaina (upscale seafood), Cuatro in Kihei (upscale seafood with Asian and Latin fusion), and Cafe Olei in Kihei (had a sushi and raw bar). The only one we weren't totally wild about was Cafe Olei- not too memorable, but good if you want to eat at Sansei and the wait is too long. We also had the BEST mexican ever at a place called Cilantro in Lahaina. It's a very casual place and we were wowed- we went there twice we liked it so much. We went up to the crater/volcano to watch the sunrise- thumbs up! An intense, but once in a lifetime opportunity. We also snorkeled at Molokini crater and it was excellent- saw a gigantic eel! For sure check out Lahaina and have some shave ice as well. We hope to go back some day for a shorter stay (unfortunately, I don't think a 7 night stay will ever be able to happen again), but every penny was totally worth it!

I have stayed on other resorts on Maui, and this is THE place to stay if you are willing to spend a little extra. We were able to get a good deal with 5th night free. We also booked the lower room (mountain view) and were able to upgrade to a partial ocean. If you are going during a slow time, I wouldn't spend the extra money for a better view. There are very few rooms with exceptional straighton ocean views, and you get a better view pool side for sunsets. Rooms: Very large. Pristine condition. Beds are very very comfy. Bathrooms are huge, bigger than my bedroom at home, with every amenity you need. They came twice a day and refolded all of my clothes I had laying out. Lined up all my bath products. Really exceptional attention to detail. Service: Top notch. Our car (valet is $20/day) arrived right away whether we called ahead or not. These people hustled. Pool service was amazing. Set up our towel on our chair each day. And what I loved is that it's first come first serve. You can get any chair you want, with a cabana or without. No extra $$ for shade. And there were more than enough seats. And anyone who is gone more than 2 hours they pick up the stuff. The pool attentants came by with ice water every 15 minutes, pop cicyles at 2:30, aloe at 4, etc. It really never ended. And they remember your name from the beginning. I left my watch at that pool and they knew I was sitting there and called me later to tell me I left it. Pool/Beach: Property is raised from the ocean so you can't see the beach from the chairs, but I think it provided more breeze. You either sit poolside and face in, or a little aways from the pool facing the ocean. They are building a new adult-only pool which is very needed. Was supposed to be completed early April but they seem a good 5-6 months away from the look of it. The pools just aren't big enough for the size of the resort currently. The beach is fantastic with attendants there to help you get a chair or umbrella (no extra cost). Spa: My massage was great, but I was very upset there was a coed relaxation room. The robes are paper thin and the women sit clutching themselves while the men sit with their legs wide open with nothing on underneath. Not very relaxing. Plus you need to walk outside into the spa lobby in front of other people milling about to get to the relaxation room and your treatment. The layout of the spa is just designed correctly or efficiently. HOwever l liked that tip was not automatically included as some other spas do so you can give based on the service. Grounds/Property/Gym: Pristine. Beautiful fountains. They also have a game room with pool tables, etc. which is great to kill a few hours here and there. Also good for kids, however I couldn't find any. I think FS squirrels them away in FS camp or something. The gym has everything you need (no extra cost) with cardio completely in an open door area. There are free fitness classes each day too. Can't beat it! Restaurants: Had breakfast at Duo one day. Buffet was $80 for two people. They mistakenly charged us $160 upon checkout. Check your folio! I wouldn't say any breakfast is worth $40 per person but that's Hawaii. Lunch and Dinner at Ferraro's is well worth it. Meals are huge and the view is exceptional. I would recommend only doing Lunch or Breakfast. You really don't need both. We had very bad service one day at lunch, but the manager could tell and was all over us with apologizes. I think our waiter was new and not up to FS standards. If you need a cheap eating night, go to Matteo's pizza right near the resort. They have pasta and pizza very very cheap. You have to order at a counter but the bring the food to you. Two people ran $27 for dinner. Overall, I say spend at least a few days here.

At Hualalai, the property is so much more an intregal part of the Island experience. But never-the-less this is a lovely setting with a very wide, long beach with the Island of Lanai in the distance. And the beach is very swimable- relatively gentle waves, easy access, soft sand. The pool at the Four Seasons is a litle small- they are just finishing another. It does get a bit crowded but they are outstanding at finding chairs and have great chair policies...all free...what a novel thought! We had a welcoming check-in and were upgraded.

Any hotel can have problems, its how those problems are solved that makes a great hotel. We received two notes apologizing from Management and a box of chocolates. Nice job. We had a lovely stay. The food is outstanding at Ferraros- best setting. Another couple told us not to go to Spagos- not worth it so we didn't. We ate once at Duos- good but not as good as Ferraros. All terribly expensive but they are happy to split meals- a great way to enjoy appetizers, entrees and desserts without leaving the table too full to walk! Excellent wine- there's a perfect Rose for lunch- don't miss it. All in all, the Four Seasons experience is the most civilized anywhere. The staff manage to make you feel like they really want to help you and enjoy doing it- always friendly without ever being pretentious. Its just SO pampering and delicious! PS.

We tried brunch at the Fairmont and it was nothing compared to the Four Seasons...definitely not worth it. The property was gorgeous. Elegant and classy and not \"hawaiian\" cheesy at all. The rooms were clean and simple. Our room was a 1 bed suite with 2 flat screens and 2 dvd players, dining table (inside and one on the deck). The bathroom was HUGE and there were all L'Occitane products which was fantastic!

Everyone seemed genuinely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable--and really made a point to make one feel like a valued guest and not just a room number. I think it is very difficult to find a high-end hotel that is as family-friendly as it is luxe--but the Four Seasons has managed that balance beautifully. Our kids were two young for the children's programs at the Four Seasons, but they were treated so, so well--they got to pick out special toys upon check-in and when we first got to our room, there were welcome baskets with yummy snacks and pool toys--and their names spelled out in bath sponges on the edge of the tub. They ate free in each of the hotel's restaurants and got to enjoy the heated kids' pool and the concierge very efficiently arranged babysitting for us a couple of nights--the one we had was very competent and both of our kids really liked her. I really can't think of anything I didn't like here. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the somewhat long wait for room service--about 45 minutes--which was much longer than service in any of the restaurants. The hotel was upfront about how long it took, though. That's about it, though--otherwise, this is by far one of the nicest places I've ever stayed and I would recommend it enthusiastically and without reservation to a friend.

This was our first trip to Maui. I did extensive reviewing of hotels on TripAdvisor, and after reading all of the positive remarks, decided to book our stay here. This hotel is everything that has been stated in the previous remarks. From the minute you arrive, to the time you leave, you are pampered and made to feel welcome. The staff cannot do enough for you. When you read the Four Seasons core values/mission statement, you will understand why! Yes, it is expensive to stay here, but one has to keep \"cost\" in perspective, between the tangible and the intangible. I would recommend that you call the hotel personally to book your stay - we were able to negotiate the stay 4 nights/ 1 night free, plus the breakfast buffet at Duo, while staying on the club floor. This option was not available on line. Do not be afraid to negotiate, if the requests are fair and not outrageous, they appear to be most accomodating. The one downside to the stay was dinner at Ferraro's. It was most disappointing - pasta that was served cold and molded to the bowl it was served in, and somewhat tasteless besides. The waiter knew that we were not pleased, and as a gesture of good will, waived the bar tab. That was only one night though, the other nights we ventured out of the hotel for dinner. The buffet at Duo will keep you going the entire day - you will not need to eat lunch! My husband used the exercise equipment, and they have all sorts of classes throughout the morning. There is plenty to do if you so desire, you will not be bored. The location is perfect, along a nice walkway between several hotels and a high-end shopping center. I believe it is about a 3 mile circuit, so it's nice to walk it , without much effort. The location is also very convenient from the airport, pretty much a straight road and easy to navigate, especially at night. Although the Four Seasons is fairly large, the way it has been constructed does not give you that feeling, in comparison to the Grand Wailea next door, which reminds me of a mega resort in Vegas - very circus-like, and noisy.

Dinner at Spago featured local fish, superbly prepared and presented and served on a luxurious outdoor terrace. The breakfast buffet at Duo is the perfect way to start the day. Poolside and beach service runs from 10-6 each day, and it's easy to spend the whole day under a free cabana (first come, first serve) drinking wine and eating delicacies from Ferraro. The conference facilities almost make attending business meetings while on Maui half the fun. Banquet services are among the best I've ever had. There are free amenities everywhere you turn... scuba lesson at 1 p.m.? Free. Tai Chi class at 8 a.m.? Free. Outrigger canoe lesson at 9:45 a.m.? Free.

We were here with our preschooler and our infant and had a great time. The resort staff was professional and always there when we needed them. Our kids had a great time splashing in the kiddie pool (not as warm as we would have liked) and playing in the sand. The pack & play and free cabanas were a big plus - we didn't have to pay for anything and it was nice to be able to come & go as we pleased - we didn't feel like \"We paid $200 for a cabana; we need to stay here all day to get our money's worth.\" We were there for 8 days and our kids probably got snacks in our room on 4 or 5 of them. The fridge was great for storing water & milk. The bathroom was huge, with kid-friendly toiletries and an infant tub provided. The kids amenities in general were great - a crib w/actual crib sheets, diapers, stepstool for the bathroom, infant tub, etc. The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating - our preschooler fell asleep during an early dinner at Spago and I didn't have a blanket - staff brought out a tablecloth for me to use as a blanket till we got back to our room. The pool staff were wonderful with extra towels and treats - fresh cut fruit, popsicles, water, etc. I second the call to attend the manager's reception - they have maitais, water, and wine, but brought out milk for our kids. The hotel restaurants were tasty, but we only ate at Spago once and Duo (for dinner once and breakfast twice). The food was great, though expensive. We paid a lot of money for a steak at Duo - but it was excellent and the service was impeccable. We had gone to Cafe O'Lei in Kihei the night before for steak and left more than half of it - it was inedible, unseasoned, and tough. I'd rather pay $50 for a steak I'll eat than $25 for a steak I won't. The breakfast was great - and they gave us to-go containers for snacks for our kids (fresh fruit, a bagel). If you eat the breakfast, you won't need to eat until 6 or 7 at night. My spouse went over to the Grand Wailea every day and commented on how huge it was. I loved the scale of the Four Seasons.

From the moment you walk into the lobby, you know that you are in for something special. This architecture and design of this place is very classy but casual. They did a fabulous job of making you feel like you are at the best resort on the island without making it feel stuffy and pretentious. I loved the open airy feel of the lobby and lounge. Its a great spot for a drink to watch sunset and listen to live soft music. We paid for a garden view room and were upgraded to a partial ocean view one bedroom suite. The room was so nice, almost too nice because it makes you want to spend more time in your room and less time at the beach! The bathroom was huge and had an awesome makeup area for the ladies. The alarm clocks have an ipod docking station which was really nice. Oh, and in the bathroom there is a sound system with four or five types of music you can listen to. I put on the Hawaiian music every night while I got ready for dinner. Very nice touch. The rooms had two large plasma tvs, two closets, a dining room, a living room, a large bedroom, large bathroom, and two lanai's facing the ocean. The only thing I didn't like about this room was that it was on the outer perimeter of the hotel and in the morning around five thirty you could hear a faint beeping noise from the delivery trucks backing in the service area of the hotel. It wasn't extremely loud though and everything else about the hotel made it seem very unimportant. The pool was gorgeous!! The attendants at the pool are great. You walk up to the pool and scope out a spot to sit and they instantly come to greet you with towels in arm and find you a spot, set up your lounge chairs with the towels, and then the bring you ice water. There are stations with free suntan lotion in SPF 8,15, and 30. Throughout the day the attendants come by with fresh fruit, cucumbers for your eyes, popcicles, jello, muffins, etc. They wait on you hand and foot and bring you food and drinks if you want. Poolside lunch doesn't come cheap though. Expect to pay $12 for a mai tai and $30 for a burger and fries. I got the mixed sushi and shrimp platter each day which came with four pieces of sashimi ahi tuna, four pieces of a california roll, and four pieces of shrimp and it was $34. There are two large hottubs at the pool that are kept at the perfect temp. The pool was too cold to swim in, for me but I did see a few brave souls tough it out. There are three restaurants on site as well as a lounge area in the lobby where you can order food. We ate in all four locations. Ferraros was by far the best meal we ate. The setting was amazing. Spago was a disappointment. Duo is where we ate breakfast and it was nice, but also very expensive. Basically, don't come to this hotel unless you are comfortable with spending $1500 a day on room and food, at a minimum. The beach off the hotel is very nice. The best sand I've ever walked on! Some nice scuba and snorkel there as well. We also rented kayaks and saw some whales; there are tons just playing around in the water right off the resort. I believe the kayaks were free for the first hour and are $5 each hour after. The food and rooms at this place are expensive, but they do not nickel and dime you for stuff and there are a lot of great amenities that come with this place. You will have tons of L'Occitane products in your room, the snorkel and kayaks are free to use, you get free suntan lotion, free internet, free exercise facilities and classes, you get spoiled and pampered at the pool, and when we left, the valet packed water and towels in our car for our ride on the road to Hana. I said, \"But we arent coming back, so we wont' return the towels\" and he said to me \"you spend 10K on a trip here. we don't care about a few towels\". One of the things I liked the most about this place is how small the resort feels. We walked over to Grand Wailea next door and that place felt so big, almost like walking through a casino in vegas where you are totally lost and disoriented because its a maze and so big. Not to mention, their ground were run down and after a half hour of walking around there, I was like \"Get me out of this ghetto!\". The Four Seasons is so much nicer and feels a lot more intimate. If you are trying to decide between the two, go with Four Seasons. There is no comparison. Overall, there is so much to love about this place.

Of course, this might explain why the scores in Zagat are so high and why the hotel received its 5th star from Mobil, the only Hawaiian property to do so. But I am now fully aware of the mystique that pervades this place. Even though my wife and I regularly spend a month in Maui, it has long been a wish to spend a few nights here. This time we decided to spend the last three nights before flying back to the mainland. Neither my wife nor I had a birthday nor were we celebrating any special occasion. We just wanted to be here. We booked a partial view room and were given an ocean view room, with a peak of the ocean from the pillow. Because so much has already been said (and these reviews were really the factors that led me to book this place), I wish simply to point out some information that hasn't really been discussed. By all means, arrange your visit to fall on a Wednesday so that you can participate in the Manager's reception. Here you get to mingle not only with other guests but mainly with the staff. And the staff use this opportunity to find out for themselves how everything is operating. Brian, the food and beverage manager, introduced us--and the guests around us--to three chefs from the three main restaurants here (Duo, Spago, Ferraro's). Each chef brought out an appetizer for all to try. Another \"Brain\" does not usually get much recognition. He is the operator of the Business Center and can offer a wealth of information on cameras, computers, I guess anything! Check out the photos he's taken--they're for sale at realistic prices. He is the one we should have asked about battery chargers since the Concierge was unable to provide information. And by all means ask for the self-guided Art Tour booklet. Even though the Grand Wailea has a wealth of Western art, check out the collection here at the Four Seasons. Better yet, arrange for a tour on Friday. Many have written about how generous the hotel is. Did you know that a free whale-watch tour is available at Ma'alaea Harbor? You just have to contact the Concierge and arrange to be at the harbor before 2:00. Although several of us might raise our eyebrows at a $32 breakfast buffet, you will not need to eat until dinner. And please consider the Lobby Lovel Bar. Yes, it is a bar and there are bar and food menus, but one can order anything off of any menu from the restaurants at the hotel. What kind of place offers that kind of service?? And if the two of you share a salad and main course, the bill will be almost affordable. But then again, guests do not come here based on the affordability of the hotel. But when we checked out, I noticed that our original room rate quote had gone down $50 per night.

Anyway, when we returned to the Four Seasons, they had laid out a tray of fancy chocolates with a realistic white chocolate seashell, overflowing with brown sugar to similate sand. It accompanied a personally signed happy birthday card from the resort manager It truly put a fantastic touch to my birthday! Kudos to 4 seasons!", "Date": "January 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Merrick, New York", "Title": "\u201cCan I Live At The Four Seasons Maui?\u201d", "Author": "delena76", "ReviewID": "UR23950743", "Content": "I've read reviews about this hotel before and after my stay which was from January 23-26, 2009 and any one who has any complaints about this hotel is a complete nut. A co-worker convinced me to convince my SO to change hotels (he wanted to stay at the Ritz) because the Ritz was on the rainy side of Maui and also because they charged to stay in a cabana (4 Seasons cabanas are FREE). Although I haven't traveled as much as my SO and this is my first time in a 5 star hotel, my SO has traveled the world and he has stayed at top level accomodations and even he was impressed. Let me tell you about my stay and experiences from before we even arrived in Maui. They emailed before we left to find out when we were going to land. I told my co-worker that and she said they want to make sure everything is ready for you as soon as you get to the hotel. We rented a car and were immediately greeted by staff with leis when we pulled up. They took our luggage out of the car and the bellman waited for us while we checked in (took less than 5 minutes). We were greeted with warm friendly smiles and I felt as if they were so excited for us to be there. The staff didn't seem phony or pretentious at all. While we walked to check-in we were greeted by another staff member with a small cup of a delicious fruity drink/tea. I wish I could remember what it was but it was refreshing. My co-worker told us whenever she came they always upgraded her but I wanted to come right out and ask. At check-in they had ALREADY upgraded us! We booked a mountainside room which is the lowest they have at $500 a night and we were upgraded to an ocean-view room, right in the center of the u-shape with a straight view of the courtyard and ocean - it couldn't have been any better! Also, before we went upstairs our bellman gave us a 3 minute tour of the property. The room was HUGE. High ceilings, double sinks, separate shower and tub, separate toilet area. Two terry cloth robes were in the bathroom as well. At the desk there was a box of delicious desserts. The balcony was big with two lounge chairs, ottomans and a table. The pool was a great size. We were told the cabanas were hard to come by and that some people have the nerve to put their towels, etc. on the chair and then disappear. But we were told by a staff member who greeted us when we were walking towards the pool that after I believe 45 minutes if they don't come back the cabana is up for grabs. Instead of us having to walk around and search for one a staff member searched FOR US. She gave us a menu and we ordered drinks and lunch from Ferraro's (delicious by the way). During our stay in our cabana facing the ocean, they came by numerous times to make sure we were okay. I loved the fact that I didn't have to wait forever before someone came to check on us. Three times they came by with: a spritz of water to our faces to cool us off, watermelon and popsicles. I mean, can I get this treatment at home?!?! By the way - order the frozen mai tai served in a pineapple - it is to die for! One morning we took a trip to watch the sunrise at Haleakala and took the road to Hana and the concierge was very helpful with that. They gave us blankets (because it's freezing and windy up there) and they gave us towels in case we wanted to go to the beach. They also gave us two bottles of water. Food: as stated earlier for lunch in the cabana we had food from Ferraro's. Our first night we ate at Spago's and I remember I had pork with caramelized onions and it was absolutely delicious. Our last night we ate at Duo's and once again it was awesome. I had the crispy free range chicken and for the first time ever at any restaurant I finished the entire thing!! Yes everything in Hawaii is expensive and I'm not sure why but I wouldn't complain - it wasn't like it was unreasonable. Every waiter we had at the restaurants was very knowledgeable and friendly. And the drinks are on point! During this time the temperature is only about 65 degrees but each restaurant had heaters and they put one near me at Duo and I warmed up right way. FYI during the winter pack more than one pair of pants and more than one sweater/long sleeve shirt. Bring a jacket too. I also loved the fact that every day they had complimentary coffee, tea and hot chocolate with a breakfast muffin/pastry near check-in or in front of Duo. So I got to have my hot chocolate before I went up the mountain. We are a young couple (I'm 32 he's 37) and we did wish that there were more young people like us to hang with. During our stay there were people in their 50's and 60's here - but I would still come here again regardless. As far as location we were about 30 minutes from OGG airport and the center of town was about 25 minutes away (where Kmart/Wal-Mart are) and the shops at Wailea Village are just a quarter of a mile up the road. When you walk towards the beach from the 4 Seasons property there is this path that takes you to other properties. We walked one way but didn't walk the opposite direction and it's a great walk. Most people used this path to jog and speed walk. It makes for a great stroll and there are great views of the sun setting. After all of this if you decide not to stay here you are out of your mind. I'm sure we received the upgrade because it is off season and it isn't that crowded and that is a perfect reason to travel in the off season but the friendly staff and the little touches just makes it all worthwhile. I was so upset that we didn't get to stay longer, one because I wanted to see more of Maui and two because I knew we weren't going to get this treatment at our next destination in Honolulu. This is my first time staying at a 5 star hotel and my SO paid for this entire trip but now that he has spoiled me I am finding it hard to want to stay at anything less (I'm actually typing this from the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu which stinks by the way - see my review later next week!) and I wish there was a 4 Seasons on this island so I can stay there instead. I can see why the 4 Seasons has been voted by Tripadvisor members as the #1 hotel brand in the world and best for romance and luxury. DON'T STAY ANYWHERE ELSE!! If you would like more pictures of the property (I can only put up 10 I believe) feel free to send me a personal message and I will send you a link with more pictures!

I must preface my review by stating that my husband and I are frequent luxury travelers. I am a hard sell when it comes to hotels. We got upgraded to a partial ocean view. The actual room is beautiful and large. I would not pay for a partial ocean view. In order to see the ocean, you would need to stand in the corner of the lanai. You could not see it from the room. I wasn't crazy about how the hotel was laid out. It is very large and sprawling. If you want beachfront and ocean views this might not be the hotel for you. The hotel is set back on a cliff. So your view of the water is really obstructed even when you are laying by the pool. The beach was also disappointing. The sand isn't white and powdery. It is brown and grainy. The water was also too rough and cool to swim in, but that was probably because it was January. The buffet breakfast is pricey but definitely worth it. It was probably the best buffet breakfast I have had at a hotel. We ate dinner at Spago. It was good, not great. So the resort is far from bad, but it definitely did not meet or exceed my expectations. Perhaps, this is because I have become accustomed to a higher level of service with other hotel chains (CC Africa, Oberoi, etc.). The concierge was definitely subpar.

Many thanks to the Trip Advisor readers who were very informative in their repsonses to questions I had. As mentioned the resort is terrific. The pluses and minues: Minuses: 1) Very expensive, but as is everything in Wailea. 2) It can be somewhat crowded at the pool area but a new pool is being constructed and will open in May that will alleviate the problem. 3) Daily newspapers not delivered to your door. Just ask and they will deliver a wide selection of papers. Pluses: 1) Hands down the ONLY five star resort on the island. We contemplated staying at the Kea Lani and does not even come close. Kea Lani is definitely in the Marriott class. Grand Wailea to me looked like it was somewhat run down, dated. Trust me, the extra $$$ are worth it to stay at the Four Seasons. 2) Again hands down although expensive by far the best selection of restaurants at any resort on the island. 3) As many have mentioned the level of service leaves little to be desired. I would rather pay 15% more here than being disappointed at the other resorts. 4) Excellent workout area and game room for the kids. The other resorts don't compare. 5)The property I think has the best location on the beach. 6) The concierges were terrific. They had pre-printed maps to every restaurant, sighteeing location that we desired. They were really on top of everything. I don't think you find that at the other resorts. 7) Is suitable for all ages of kids, grownups to infants. During the holdiay season when we were there families have come for years and years. I can see why. Summary: Without a doubt they deserve their reputation.

I mean, the Marriott had free breakfast. But I put my inner cheapskate in a chokehold and booked 5 nights at the Four Seasons\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..and did not regret it at all. We figured we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be spending too much time sitting on the lanai admiring the view, so we booked a garden view room and got the fifth night free. The Four Seasons was the second stop on our honeymoon, and after Hana it was going to take a lot to impress me. The last thing I wanted was a crowded beach and a snooty staff. Fortunately, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find either in at the Four Seasons Wailea. Everything I heard and read was true. We were greeted at check in with cool towels and tasty orange blossom mint tea. The bellman gave us the nickel tour, offering some good suggestions. The room was, by far, the nicest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in. Large living area, HUGE bathroom and the garden view was very nice with a sliver of ocean thrown in. The entire resort was spotless. Our room was attended to twice a day and every single employee was friendly and helpful. We actually saw a guy cleaning the baseboards of the hallway outside our room. In the morning, we would grab complimentary coffee in the lobby and make our way to the beachwalk. The walk was nice and gave us easy access to the neighboring resorts, and as we walked through them we were glad we sprung for the 4S. Not that the others weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nice, but the 4S just attained another level of quality. This was reinforced one morning when stopped by the Marriott for breakfast. I wanted to see what we were passing up by not staying there. It was a small, simple buffet more suited for a holiday inn express. Not bad, but far from spectacular. Breakfast at Duo left it in the dust for a mere $5 more. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even a contest. We ate at all the restaurants at the 4S, with the standout being Ferraro. We made an early reservation and had ringside seats for sunset. Absolutely incredible. One evening we decided to forego a proper dinner to hang out in lounge for drinks and appetizers. Overlooking the couryard and pools, we saw a torchligher make his way through the property at sunset. A great experience all the way around. The restaurants were not cheap, but not completely out of line with prices we saw at nearby resorts. The beach was very nice and the pools were immaculate. The staff was very attentive without being a nuisance. As we relaxed on the beach or by the pool, they would come by with cold water, small snacks, sunscreen, etc. The property was far from crowded (we overheard that occupancy was very low, even for low season). Every afternoon, we raided the lobby early and often looking for the orange mint tea. There were gamerooms and internet access downstairs, alongside a sweet gym and shopping. Of course, you are in Hawaii, so who needs that stuff? Seemed like they had lots of activities for kids, but we never really saw many kids. The Shops at Wailea was a short walk away, but it lacks access to the beachwalk, so you have to get to it from the main drag. There are a few places to eat there. Cheeseburger in Paradise was good and hit the spot when we wanted big food. Although usually good, we skipped Tommy Bahama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and Ruth Chris because we have those nearby at home. While I preferred the casual relaxation of Hana, the Four Seasons was definitely my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favorite. We are not really Four Seasons typical customer, but it was our honeymoon and for a special occasion we decided to shoot the moon.

They come around the pool with fresh fruit, ice pops and cold towels. They don't say the word \"No\" a lot, which is the mark of a good hotel. You can get snorkeling equipment for free for an hour at Snorkels. We checked in, got our lei's and our orange mint tea and got upgraded to an Oceanview room which was nice. The bathroom was almost as big as the main room! Loved the L'Occitane toiletries, loved that you can put on music in the bathroom. We were also welcomed with a bottle of my favorite champagne (Veuve Cliquot) and some beautiful truffles. A great start to our trip. Our wedding was pretty low key, just as we wanted it, it was just my fiance and I and it went off without a hitch. Carin, our wedding planner, was amazing. We took photos all around the hotel adn on the beach. I got my hair and makeup done at the Orchid Salon, I cant remember my stylists name but she did a fantastic job. We had the Ultimate Romantic Dinner afterward which is ridiculously expensive on its own ($400...per person!) but I think, totally worth it. It was included in our wedding package so that steepness of the price was a bit masked but we sat down with the head chef of the entire hotel and just talked about our food likes and dislikes and he put together an amazing meal of 5 courses (plus amuse bouche and a bottle of champagne to start) paired with 5 equally amazing of wines to go with each of our courses. We had everything from oysters to hamachi, rib eye, kula greens, ostrich, ono, chocolate souffle and coconut sorbet. We sat nestled in a table ocean front with our own server and music and it was the most romantic dinner I've ever had. Truly a spectacular thing to sip champagne staring out at Wailea Beach. We dined at each of the restaurants in the resort once, they were all actually really good, I was surprised. My husband and I are total foodies and we're a bit hard on restaurants coming from New York and San Francisco respectively. Duo has great sides, the pasta and risotto at Ferraro's was yummy and Spago is just amazing! Try to get a table for two along the right rail overlooking the ocean. Some of the other off site restaurants we went to that people have raved about were just ok I thought like Sansei, I've had far better Japanese (but you cant beat the freshness!) and Capische?, which was Italian, super huge portions, but the food wasn't a 10, it was more like a 7. However, the atmosphere at Capische? was really nice. We sat in the garden and it felt like we were the only table there. If you book the restaurants via the Four Seasons concierge and it's a special occasion the restaurant will recognize it. Also, any restaurants in the Wailes area, like Capische? and Seawatch, the Four Seasons driver will take you to complimentary, which is nice because cabs in Hawaii are expensive. The fact that the hotel was as expensive as it was does create a bit of a damper, as newlyweds. Breakfast at Duo's is really great, a lovely buffet with anything you can ask for, but it's about $75 for breakfast, just for two,which doesnt work for 9 days. We got bagels, fruit, muffins and coffee at Snorkel's which is right on the path to the beach a few morning,which was nice. We also ate at Longhi's at the Shops at Wailea once for breakfast, which was good. We did take advantage of the beach yoga the first day since we were so jet lagged and up early, that was a great start to the trip, very relaxing, light, easy yoga. The Shops at Wailea are about an 8 or 10 minute walk from the hotel. There are also shuttles that go there but we walked, it's a nice walk if you go along the beach path and then through the Wailea Grand (which reminded me of Vegas, and is undergoing a MAJOR, unsightly reconstruction of their largest pool currently, as a side note.) The Shops have everything from high end shops like Louis Vuitton and Tiffany's to smaller surf shops and Hawaiian souvenir shops. Definitely try the Tommy Bahama Tropical Cafe and Cheeseburger in Paradise is a nice change if you are craving some American grub. We rented a jeep one day and drove to Kihei to go surfing then around the West Maui mountains, which is one of my favorite drives in the U.S., great ocean views, to Lahaina and Kaanapali. We did get a couples oceanside massage at the hotel and it was really great too, I would recommend that. The spa is pretty expensive but when else can you do a massage on Wailea beach with your brand new hubby? It did rain one full day and was cloudy a few other days but other than that the weather was great, low to mid 80's all week. As a last note, they are building a new Serenity Pool to open in May of 2009. We didn't even know it was happening (there's no noise or anything, at all, I saw a construction truck once)but it looks really great. It's 2 pools, adults only, one being an infinity pool and they are building cabanas with flat screen tv's in them.

My husband and I travel frequently and we usually switch between Four Seasons and Ritz. This trip finally set our foot down and Four Seasons stood out to be the winner. The resort in Maui is like a dream coming true, spacious guest room, great pool, outstanding service and delicious. What really helped us making up our minds was the personal service that the management extended, as in the title \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not a Burden, but truly Special\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. My husband has a very special diet. We are accustomed to calling the hotel ahead of time and let them know his allergies and preferences (my husband is fatally allergic to nuts). With no surprise, the hotel has all the records of his dietary requirements in their files. A usually 30 minutes reservation with other hotels only took 10 minutes with Four Seasons. We arrived at the hotel, the check-in was a breeze and the resort was beautiful as always. Coming from freezing NY, the pool, of course, was the first place we visited. We parked ourselves by the pool and decided to give the hotel a call to make sure our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153food\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd requirements were acknowledged before ordering our lunch. Our call was diverted to the food and beverage manager, Brian (forgot his last name, Asian guy from Singapore). 5 minutes after we put the phone down, he was there by our chairs and assured us all our requirements were addressed to all his kitchens and they are ready to serve us anywhere in the resort. His level of service was expected in Four Seasons, what impressed us most was his attitude, hospitality, sincerity and most of all, his willingness to accommodate us. In most hotels, our long list of dietary requirements easily turns us into a burden to the hotel, but let me assure you, he made us feel like royalty. Of course, the lunch turned out to be exceptional. Brian introduced us to one of the chefs from Duo restaurant. A local Hawaiian chef name Noel. Like Brian, his eagerness and friendliness was remarkable. He checked on us every now and then when we visited his restaurant. He inquired about where we planned to have our next meal and making sure our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153specials\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were in place even if we were not dining in Duo.

My husband and I are from service industry, we understand that genuine service can be trained, but very hard to maintain and time consuming. It has to come from top down and Four Seasons did it.

This time we decided to stay at the Four Seasons, and we loved it. This is the best service on Maui. That old saying you get what you pay for is true. At this stage of my life, I like excellent service, the type you don't have to keep asking for, it is provided before you ask. Yes, the price is high, but it is like buying a Lexus or Mercedes, you expect quality and the Four Seasons is that. And we don't take a trip like this every week. It was my birthday and it had been a long hard year at the office, and I decided we deserved a stress free trip. When you arrive both car doors are opened, and they have some one escort you to the front desk. I had left my adapter for my cell phone on another island prior to this. My nice hotel there could not do anything. While my partner was checking in for our rooms, I went to the concierge desk, and in less then 30 seconds, she came back with a box full of adapters, and the 3rd one worked, she tried it right at the big desk. Then I asked for the DVD list of free movies and selected a few for our room, and also looked at the CD list and got a few of those free for our cd player. When we arrived in our rooms, they were immaculate, and quite honestly almost as big as a suite at the next door hotel. I am picky about bathrooms and this one was pristine and huge. The size of a room at some other hotels. Seriously, you could have 4 people in that bathroom and not be crowded. Separate glass enclosed shower, huge bathtub, double sinks, separate closet for the toilet with phone and a long second counter with stool for makeup, etc. The room was overlooking the ocean, with chaise lounge, 2 comfy chairs, table, and drying rack for bathing suits. King size bed, flat screen tv, dvd, cd, and ipod radio and some other electronic gadgets, plus a sofa, coffee table, and desk, even a reading light OVER the bed, and two phones. Nice furniture and pictures and comfy bed, fell asleep in a heartbeat and I don't sleep well in some hotel beds. The service was obvious again, when we called down to have them make a reservation for Joes, a local restaurant where the meatloaf is famous. It is always packed and hard to find because they don't have parking right in front. Not only did they get us a reservation when I could not, but as we were leaving the hotel, we asked her to call them, because they have a golf cart that picks up in the tennis court parking lot, and we have waited a while in the dark for it on previous visits. 3 minutes later we were in the dark parking lot, and there was the golf cart and we had a great private table. Joes is not cheap but a great upscale casual place, with comfort food done well. I did not want fancy food, had it all week, wanted meatloaf and my partner had their pork chops. The game room and 2 gyms one looking outdoors and one inside in a/c at Four Seasons I love. Various books, games, and 2 free computer stations, plus coffee, tea, and water complimentary early in the morning, with many stations. Outside at the pool, even the cabanas are complimentary, as well as chairs and towels, and they put it on for you. And they are constantly coming around with ice water, free evian spritzers. They are NOT forcing you to buy a drink, and the first morning, I forgot my rubber hair band to put my hair in a pony tail, and our water guy ran to the spa, and got me one of theirs. They have complimentary water aerobics, as well as other classes in the morning. The beach chairs, towels, everything is very nice and clean, as well as the pools and the beach. My partner signed up for their introductory scuba, and had his learning session in the pool, then the instructor was honest enough to tell him the water was getting very wavy and cloudy, and could he come back the next morning to scuba. He did, and actually swam underwater with sea turtles and they took a video of this, which he bought and it was the highlight of his trip. The breakfast buffet, which we indulged in twice, was the nicest breakfast on the island, items first rate, and real squeezed orange juice, which I loved. They do not have the bird problem most hotels and restaurants there have, and if you leave your table, they put lids on your plate. When you go off anytime in your car, they give you two ice cold bottles of water, and they have that in the room fridge complimentary, unlike some hotels on that island, which charge you for the water bottles in your room. It is expensive, but I have decided, that even if we stay in the least expensive room there the next time, looking at the parking garage or shrubs, versus being at another hotel in a suite or junior suite for the same price, is worth it. And I am a very particular lady. My only gripe, is that they have NO adults only pool, but they are building one as I write this, and it should be open by May in a private area away from the main pool and the kids pool. Have you ever left anything at a hotel when you checked out and either they never find it or it takes a while to get it. I left one dresser drawer with some things it. Hours later, I realized this, we came back, they already had it noted on their computer, in a nice bag all folded, brought it to the concierge desk, and we were on our way. This was the best service at a resort, that I have had in a long time, and we travel a lot for business and stay in many nice hotels. Instead of feeling stuffy, this felt like a nice home.

Location: Right on the beach at Wailea, the hotel has unobstructed sea views from the rooms, along with clear and seemingly clean sea. It is also very close to a small upscale shopping centre, and local eateries, to which the hotel will happily chauffer you for no charge. Check In: We arrived at about 11AM and were on the club level. We had arranged a transfer from the airport (we'd flown in from Honoloulu) -we were met at the gate by the driver who helped us with luggage and drove us to the hotel, whilst pointing out landmarks en-route. We arrived at the hotel front door, and were welcomed by name and escorted straight to the club floor, without having to say a word. In the club lounge, we were passed over to the staff there (more on them later!) who sorted us out with a drink and proceeded to check us in. Our room was not ready, but within 30 minutes, it was. The Room: A sea facing room, rather large, with a work desk, king bed, and huge bathroom with seperate shower. There were some delicious, fresh confectionary items in a lovely box, and fresh flowers. The ice bucket was full of ice, and replenished twice daily. TV had a number of international channels. Our Lanai (balcony) had a table and chairs and was also spotlessly clean. The A/C was very efficient (quiet but effective!) The Food: All restaurants we ate in were first class, with excellent service and mouthwatering food -they really didn't miss a beat. The Club lounge had breakfast, afternoon tea, canapes and desserts in four presentations daily. This was also great. A note on service: every member of staff, without fail, went out of their way to make each and every guest's stay remarkable. The pool attendant would come to check on you (by name) every half an hour to bring some iced water or cold fruit/ice cream/sun cream/after sun/whatever you wanted, the club staff knew our names and were very friendly. At the same time, the service wasn't intrusive; the staff seemed to know when you wanted to read the paper quietly, or, conversely, if you needed something, they were there. I think that's what distinguishes this Four Seasons from other five star hotels -true service is all about anticipating needs and flexibility -all of the staff at the FS were true professionals and never failed to have a smile on their faces, but equally, it didn't feel forced or over formal -shorts/t-shirts were fine and you didn't feel uncomfortable being yourself. Resort: the resort facilities are good and you don't feel as if it is overcrowded. No, it's not an isolated retreat, but you can find tranquility within the resort (on the beach or by the pool).

Just tip a little and you'll be fine. Also, this was a more adult experience, as the Wailea had too many kids, because they have the pools with slides, etc. The rooms at the Four Seasons are huge (600 square feet plus), and everything is truly lovely, with a lot of fitness-center activities included in the overall price, too (including yoga on the beach). However, if you want reasonably priced food, the only place to get it on-site is at the little outdoor cafe by the beach that has pastries, soda, candy bars, etc., until 4 p.m. Also, if you split a meal at Ferrero's by the pool at lunch, the prices are okay...there's definitely enough food for 2. However, after 4...there are only 3 restaurants, and they're all very pricey. For reasonably priced meals, go to the Wailea Shops, which are about 3/4 of a mile down the street. You can walk, or the hotel will take you wherever you want to go within a mile or so, and they will also pick you up.

Ferraro's, the Italian restaurant, was disappointing - the food was really bland. The pool side menu is also very tasty. I often ordered from the kids menu as the adult portions are very large. Very Kid-Friendly Resort - If you have kids they will love the Four Seasons. This is great for some and those who love kids, but the management needs to do a better job of designating \"adult only\" areas and enforcing these boundaries - i.e. an adult pool and lounge. I think this would help balance the experience for both families and single guests or couples. Pool Area - The pool area is relatively small compared with the number of guests. People were literally camped out at 6:45 am to get a spot in prime real estate. Don't get me wrong the service was great and the staff would always be willing to set up a chair for you on the \"lawn\", but I think it is time to invest some extra cash and build an additional pool area so that all guests can enjoy the same level of attention and service.

Many, many different tropical fish, large and small, octopus, green turtles ... We did the expected tourist trips to HAna, etc but the most unexpected and best sightseeing was to be had by turning right out of the hotel, drive to the end of the road (about 4 miles) and you will find yourself in a natural reserve which is actually a lava field that flowed from Haleakala over 200 years ago down to the ocean. The drive through the lava field continues for two miles and is an absolutely amazing sight. Not advertised in any of the \"things to do in MAui\" but DO NOT MISS IT. I utilized the gym which is outdoors with a view of the ocean. The staff was very nice, also bringing towels and cold water as you exercised. WE used the game room several nights - a nice diversion with pool tables, ping pong, shuffleboard, video games etc. We ate at Spago which was very good but exceptionally expensive. Had lunch twice at Ferraros which was very good. Otherwise, the hotel restaurants were very expensive so we ate off property every other night. The local restaurants we visited in Kihei were all excellent (we good terrific local recommendations from the valets). Ate at Stella Blues which was terrific food and reasonably priced, Thailand Cuisine - also very good, Cafe O'Lei which was fantastic and Roys. The four seasons is an expensive, luxury vacation but if you can afford it, there is no other experience like it.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, California", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Resort!\u201d", "Author": "sfmags", "ReviewID": "UR20572194", "Content": "We just returned from an incredible stay at the 4S Maui. Nearly everything was perfect, and no detail went unnoticed. I can't add much to the details already provided by the other reviewers here -- the rooms and grounds are beautiful, service outstanding, etc. Here are a few things that I thought were just great that might not already be commented on in previous posts: 1. I love the attention to detail this hotel has. For example, they put good quality hair dryers in the rooms. They also water down the sand on the small hill leading to the beach, making it easier to walk up and down there. 2. They don't nickel and dime you for things like coffee and water. They also let me take a muffin from the buffet early in the morning while I was drinking my coffee in the lobby area, two hours before my husband and I would return for the buffet. I also love all the goodies they bring around at the pool and the smoothie samples at breakfast. 3. The spa is heavenly. Their treatments are to die for and if you take a look at the daily schedule, they often offer specials. Also, as nice as the bathrooms are in the room, my husband and I both liked showering and getting ready in the spa locker rooms to take advantage of all the great perks -- professional hair dryers, top quality hair and facial products and heated shaving cream (or so I'm told by my husband). 4. Take advantage of the free, varied and abundant exercise classes! I took spinning twice -- it was great. They also offer yoga, pilates, and new things like Urban rebounding (I'd never heard of it). Some of them do charge a nominal fee. I took a yoga class one evening and was the only student, which meant that I got 90 minutes of personal training! A only few downsides: -We had some trouble with the timing of housekeeping. We always left the room before 10am and twice when we returned at 3:00 the room hadn't been serviced. This was solved on future days by calling housekeeping before we left and asking them to service the room before 3:00. This also happened with our turndown service, which we didn't get on two nights during our 5 night stay. -One doesn't go to the Four Seasons to save money, but good god is it ever expensive, especially the dinner options. They really need a slightly lower priced grill restaurant (at dinner, not just at lunch) where you can buy a burger or grilled fish without paying $40+ per entree. To get around the outrageous charges for lunch, I sometimes ordered off the kids menu, but be warned, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specify \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like the carrots and celery sticks from the kids menu\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll give you an adult size portion (even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not on the menu) at adult prices. On a positive note, our dinners (we ate there twice) at Duo were terrific, if expensive, but worth it. Ferarros was not good, especially for the price. Lobby bar is a good dining option too (you can order off any of the hotel menus there).", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Worth, FL", "Title": "\u201cExpensive but worth it!\u201d", "Author": "Fivez", "ReviewID": "UR20512301", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights for our 10th anniversary and absolutely loved this hotel.

Upon arrival, our room was not yet ready (we came early), so they took our bags and directed us to the shopping (SCARY). After hitting the wonderful shopping just down the street (high end, Gucci, etc.), we came back to the hotel. We were greated with fresh flowers, cold scented towels, and the manager letting us know that we've been upgraded to a suite for our anniversary. The bellman came around with our bags, congratulated us on our anniversary and showed us to our room. In the AMAZING 2 room suite, with champagne and two big screen tvs we were blown away. In an effort to keep things short, the only thing we didn't like were some of the other guests. The staff is fantastic, attentive to your every need, the other guests however weren't nearly as friendly as you would hope for. Another thing was the fact that a lot of native Hawaiians don't work here, seemed like a lot of 30 year old Californians. It didn't seem nearly as \"Hawaiian\" as our first part of the trip. (see Kapalua) The Duo breakfast buffet is FANTASTIC, and my wife is still talking about the pineapple spritzer drink. The golf on site is great, but everything is a tad expensive and \"resorty\".

My wife and I travel pretty extensively to Europe and the Caribbean. We've stayed at large 4 or 5 star hotels, small boutique hotel and I must say that the Four Season's Maui combines the best elements of both. FS Maui was the second and last leg of our honeymoon. The fist half was adventure on Kauai and the intent was the second half would be pampering on Maui. I gotta tell you, I have never been so pampered in my life. As a matter of fact I was so pampered that I often felt guilty at the level of service and amount of attention we received. From the Evian misting at the pool to the great turn down service to the front desk greeting us by name we felt like we were in paradise.. Here's a more direct example of service. Our first night in Maui we went to Ruth Chris' steakhouse for diner down the street. As usual my eyes were bigger than my stomach and as a result I had 1/2 of my sirloin left which I had to take with me. The next day I woke at 11:00 and had a taste for my leftover steak. I called room service and asked them to heat it up for me. They came to the room, picked up the left over and when the brought back my leftovers I was stunned. Not only had they heated up the steak perfectly but they included some rolls and a bit of saut\u00c3\u00a9ed spinach as well, and off course the presentation was impeccable. I would highly recommend this hotel for any travelling purpose. Oh did I mention that this the first hotel I've stayed at that you can snorkel from the beach and see an incredible abundance of sea life. I've snorkeled of a boat in Jamaica and Puerto Rico and not seen as wide a range of fish.

We made the right choice! The rooms are nicely furnished ... large bathrooms, flat screen tv's, and a small frig. The hallways and lobby areas are clean and filled with beautiful artwork and lots of places to sit and enjoy the view of the ocean. Everything you would expect from a Four Seasons Resort. What we enjoyed most about this hotel were the complimentary services. There was an outstanding game room for the kids to use (I posted pictures) with pool, ping pong, video games, large TV, etc. (great to use at the end of day when you've had too much sun) They had a wonderful outdoor gym; Yoga on the beach, scuba lessons or water aerobics classes every day. You can use their snorkeling equipment (great early in the morning when the water is calm) and they offer a free canoe ride 3 times a day (if you give them your camera they take a great shot from the water). My boys are 17 and 19 and they also enjoyed playing tennis using the automatic ball machine. They have over 300 movies your kids can borrow and watch in the room at night. Little muffins, pineapple and other fresh fruits are served everyday by pool. There is no charge for use of the cabanas. When we left for day to take the kids for surfing lessons, they had towels and waters ready for us when we picked up the car. The concierge not only makes reservations, they send you a reminder letter with the date, time and directions. The staff is attentive but not over baring...many are very familiar with the area and have great recommendations on places to eat. Other than an occasional lunch by the pool, we ate out in the local restaurants (so I can't comment on the hotel food). The best local places were... 1) Kihea Cafe for Breakfast (inexpensive - banana pancakes, eggs, etc) 2) Alexander's fish also in Kihea (inexpensive - grilled or fried ono and mahi mahi with rice or fries) 3) Hali'male General Store (expensive) excellent blend of flavors ... we missed Opra by a day (she has a home nearby) 4) Mama's fish house (expensive) food is good not great, but the view is the best on the island ... take a camera (lunch is less expensive than dinner and it is a similar menu) 5) Matteos Pizza (inexpensive) - excellent pizza and pasta dishes (shuttle ride from hotel) 6) Cheeseburger in Paradise in Shops at Wailea (inexpensive) great burger place (there is a similar one in Lahaina). The Maui information TV channel (great source of information) is now available online at www.mauionline.com. The only negative we found was that the hotel could use an adult pool. They have a lovely salt water pool, but it gets a bit crowed in the afternoon. We found out that they have plans to build an adult pool in the future. They could also use a \"general store\" to buy light meals for the kids. Overall, we would definitely stay there again and I recommend the hotel highly.

We booked a Garden View room for two nights and had mentioned we were there for our four year wedding anniversary. We also mentioned that we had a travel business (jdubtravel.com) and were upgraded to an Executive Suite! It was GORGEOUS! The room was beautifully decorated...had a dining area, separate living room and balcony w/table and chairs for 4, separate bedroom with another balcony with two lounge chairs, and finally, a very large bathroom with 2 sinks, separate vanity area, separate toilet, large tub, with a separate glass shower. Not only was the room amazing, the service during our entire stay was impeccable. We were always greeted warmly at the pool with attendants waiting on us hand and foot. It was NOT difficult to get a cabana. The pool is on the simple side, but it did not matter. It was all about the vibe, view, and the fabulous service! We ate at both Spago and Duo, both which were delicious. If you like steak, then I highly recommend eating at Duo. It's worth the splurge. We tried the Kobe Beef appetizer at $42 and each bite was worth every penny; simply mouth watering! Before we booked our trip, my husband and I kept going back and forth between staying at the Grand Wailea and the Four Seasons. I read almost every Trip Advisor review and finally came to the conclusion that it's always best to go with the 5 star resort if that's what you are looking for. We ventured over to the Grand Wailea and had wonderful spa treatments. That's about the only thing we found appealing about the hotel. Yes, the pool looks amazing, especially if you have kids, but it was a complete zoo....and yes, the cabanas there are extra & not a lot of shade. (no extra charge for cabanas at the FS) If you are trying to make a decison between the two resorts, go with the Four Seasons, especially if you are looking to be pampered and treated like royalty. The GW looked a little gaudy and dated, in my opinion. One of the highlights of the FS is the game room. In this room they have pool tables, foos ball, ping pong, as well as Guitar Hero, Wi, and other various video games. We had so much fun going over to the video game room (all of which are free of charge for guests) and playing the various games.

We also had our pre-arranged spa, luau, surf lessons, dinner and sunset cruise reservation vouchers sent to our room the day before they occured.

One restaurant, Capische, was very romantic and each food course was outstanding. The menu was a little limited, but has something for most everyone. We will go back to Capische when we return to the Four Seasons. Even the food at the lobby bar was great. The lobby bar will also provide food from any of the 3 restaurants. Each time we left the resort, we were greated by name by almost every employee. They made sure that if we needed anything beyond what they provided, they would get it for us.

We could over hear the Concierge ask Capische to do somthing for a Four Seasons guest, but the restaurant said they had nothing.

This was our first experience with the Four Seaons. We loved our stay at the Ritz. For sheer beauty of the hotel and it's surroundings, you can't beat the Ritz. They had the advantage of building the hotel on large piece of land so they had room to put in a huge pool and the vistas from the hotel are breath taking. The Four Seasons, on the other hand, seems to have been shoe-horned into a small piece of land that was available after the Grand Wailea had stopped expanding. As a result (I believe) they have a tiny little pool. Almost disappointingly tiny. The hotel seems to have recognized this, they told us they were planning another pool but from the map they showed us, the new pool will be small too. That being said, the Four Seasons has the beach right in front of them. Unlike the Ritz, it's not a hike down to the beach. Choose your cabana right and you can take advantage of the beach and the pool all day long. From the pictures I saw of the beach on the Four Seaons web site, I thought I would be disappointed but I was not. It's a gorgeous beach. The Four Seasons is also located in Wailea where the weather tends to be milder than up in Kaplaua where the Ritz is located. There were days when you would get wind and rain at the Ritz and see sunshine a few miles down the road in Lahaina. For that reason alone, we decided to try the Four Seasons. The service at the Four Seasons is incredible. We were met at the front door with a lei and a bead necklace and guided to the front desk where there was no waiting. (We had to wait 15 minutes at the Ritz to check in). And the staff all seem to make an effort to remember your name and give friendly service. The beach and poolside service was what impressed us the most. I've never ever seen so many attendents working so hard to please you. The cabanas are free to use. At the beach, they set up a chair and an umbrella for you. The Ritz is slighly less expensive (relatively speaking). And it offers one of the most beautiful hotels I've ever seen. The Four Seasons has the advantage of being in Wailea, and the service is outstanding but you do pay for it.

It was an absolute pleasure to arrive at this beautiful property after the long journey from New York. The entire property is immaculate, and very well maintained. It looks as great as I left it in 1998. A testament to the FS Mgt., and their staff. We were met with the traditional lei greeting, and tropical juices in the gorgeous lobby. Valet and bellmen were right on point. (Overnight valet parking $18 a day). At the front desk we met Yarnell, a transplanted gem from the Bronx, NY. We were upgraded to a partial ocean view room. We stayed on the B&B plan which included the great buffet breakfast at $655 a night including all taxes and fees. (Note: If you book a few months in advance you could get this plan on the FS website for under $500 a night.) Our room (#436) was very nice, large flat screen tv etc., and had a great lanai overlooking the putting green, and croquet lawn. With the ocean in the distance, the room actually faced in the direction of the main entrance of the hotel, but was obscured by the beautiful tropical foilage (very quiet). The sunsets from the lanai were breathtaking. The only issue with the room for me was the long walk from the elevators, but after a couple of days in Maui who cares. Room service was quick and delicious (burger and cobb salad). Twice a day housekeeping was excellent. Alert!***One room amenity the FS missed is the ol' \"chocolate on the pillow\" at turn down. Call me old school and a chocolate addict, but I did miss not having my nightly chocolate fix. Come on FS Mgt. chocolate please! The bountiful buffet was great! Made to order eggs/omelets, pancakes, french toast, and all of the other breakfast staples. Service for breakfast at DUO was wonderful, quick and polite. There was a service charge included on the bill bringing it to almost $80 for 2, but covered in full with the B&B package. For those with kiddies, they even set up a kids buffet at the entrance of DUO so kids can share in the FS breakfast experience. The pool, aaaah the pool(s). Main pool centered with a beautiful fountain, spa included. Waterfall pool, and adjacent kiddie pool. They may not be the biggest, but were never crowded and were a great place to lounge and relax. The pool service is second to none! Bright and early the pool staff awaited your arrival. Here we met Kanoe, and Javier. These great guys met our every need with speed and a smile. We loved the mini-macadamia muffins. Note: There were some guests that pulled the very, very early \"put my towel and book\" in the best cabana scam, but this was held to a minimum by the policing of the staff. Trust me, you don't mess with Kanoe! Try and land the seats on the mini-cliff facing the ocean...awesome view! Food and drink at the pool was very good and service was fast. Some of my favorite pool fare were (veggy pizza, the burger and steak fries, and the chicken quesadilla). $7 dollar Heinekens, but Hey! your on vacation. For dinner we dined at DUO, and Ferraro's...missed Spago. At DUO we had the grilled catch of the day, and the filet mignon very delicious. At Ferraro's we had the fried shrimp and calamari (excellent), bruschetta and the signature lobster risotto, and the seafood pasta also very good. Service and ambiance at both restaurants were right on target. The FS gym (accessed through the spa entrance) was very well equipped, with the ellipticals and treadmills (w/tv's) outdoors which I enjoyed. The Spa was modern with Hawaiian flair, enjoy a glass of the ginger blast water. The Men's steam room was awesome! the hottest I ever experienced...time to sweat out the pool cocktails. We really enjoyed our massages, ask for Giselle she was absolutely wonderful. From Saimin (soup) to Macadamia (nuts), we truly enjoyed every aspect of our stay at the FS Wailea. I give the FS Maui 5 Hoku's (stars). The hotel property, and surrounding Wailea area is beautiful. Don't forget to check out the Shops at Wailea. There's a local ABC store for water, wine, sundries and souvenirs. Also, a Gap and Banana Republic to the high line shops Tiffany & Co, Louis Vuitton & Fendi theres something for everyone.

We felt pampered and relaxed and everything was so peaceful and perfect. This was absolutely the cure for our wedding and dealing with stress of it all. We needed to recover from our wedding and this was the perfect place to be with each other and to enjoy our first days as a married couple. We love adventure and really enjoyed renting a jeep and exploring the Up Country... We opted to purchase gourmet snacks at Safeway (and champagne) to keep in our room. We went to Tedeschi Vineyard...many churches and hidden beaches. We definately loved the CD recording to Hana and it led us to find places we never would to explore. We went on a hike and found a waterfall in a bamboo forest. Every day should be a day at the Four Seasons in Maui. This was absolute heaven. We noticed a few celebrities but it was nothing. We did not care or make a deal out of it. We felt like celebrities while there and were treated as such. We ended up with a special souvenier of a honeymoon baby. The Four Seasons was an amazing beginning to our marriage and the best place to start our life together.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, NC", "Title": "\u201cParadise Found!\u201d", "Author": "CarsonsMommy", "ReviewID": "UR16952467", "Content": "My husband and I spent the week of May 29 - June 5th at this gorgeous resort. I had read mixed reviews in the past, but found our experience to be beyond compare! We were greeted with leis, ice cold beverages and chilled lavendar scented towels. We did not receive an upgrade from our oceanview room, but were offered a $3,000/night oceanview suite for $500 extra. We decided to stay with our orignal room, which was quite lovely and roomy. We spent most of our on-property time at the pool, hanging out in our cabana - we usually came down around 11:30 or in the afternoon, and never had a problem getting one. Although I was told that at Christmas week, people sneak down at 4 am to snag one! The service was great - Evian spritzers, ice cold water, yummy beverages (try the Key Lime Colada and the Lava Flow) and delicious lunches. My favorite was the Margherita Pizza. They also bring you frozen icees and cold fruit - such as watermelon or pineapple. We enjoyed our lunch at Ferraros', and dinner as well. Our 1st night in Maui, we were exhausted, but had an oceanfront table for sunset, so we tried it - and loved it! I had forgotten my sunglasses, so the waitress brought me a platter with 4 pair to pick from - talk about service! We toasted the sunset with a glass of Prosecco. I like my Lobster Risotto (not the best I've ever had, but really good), but my husband said his sea bass was the best, freshest fish he had ever eaten. The view was so amazing, that we had to pry ourselves away after dinner, remembering that the Road to Hana would mean an early start! The morning of Hana, we had a delicious room service breakfast, and they packed us a picnic basket, complete with cloth napkins and silverware, which made for a wonderful picnic on Hamoa Beach. Other days we ate at Duo - the breakfast buffet was wonderful! $28 for continental, $32 for hot. The made to order shrimp omelette I had the 1st day there was delicious! We also ate at Spago's, which I loved. Service was great, even though we had pushed our reservation back due to a late return from Hana. I loved the heirloom tomato salad, and the Chinese Pepper Scallops. I had a drink called Lush that was yummy as well. My husband did not like his dinner as much as Ferraro's, but this type of high energy, see and be seen environment is more my style than his. Our best dinner at the resort was the Ultimate Dinner. Pricey, but worth every penny! You get to plan your own menu, filled with all of your favorite things, in a planning session with the chef. You get your own private waiter, secluded dining area overlooking the beach, a bottle of champagne, a different glass of wine paired with each of the 6 courses, and even a violinist! What a way to spend an anniversary! We also indulged in the couples massage in the oceanside hale- the Wailea one left us feeling as limp and relaxed as rag dolls! The gift shops were really nice. I found 2 really cute beach coverups, and even found out that a photo album with a turtle on it I got at the Shops at Wailea, was a few dollars cheaper at the resort. All in all, it was an unforgettable experience - by the end we were trying to figure out how long we could stay if we sold everything we owned.

From the bellhop boys to the the waiters/waitresses, to the help by the pool everyone was gracious, accomodating and provided absolute impeccable 5 star service! There wasn't one instance where we walked by an employee of the 4S and they didn't smile or say \"aloha\". Before we booked our room, we had reservations about which type of room to stay in. To have at least a little view of the ocean from our hotel room was our goal. We chose to stay in the partial ocean view room and never regretted it once. If you choose this route you will actually have a view of the ocean while lying in bed. Man! What a way to wake up by staring out at the most royal blue water I've ever seen! The room provides more than enough room for 2 people. The bathroom is huge with seperate deep soaking tub and marble shower. The room has a little refridgerator that we were able to put some snacks in. One last note on the room. The beds are the most comfortable we have ever slept in! We have been fans of Westin's Heavenly Bed but they don't touch the bed at the 4S in Maui. It was so awesome to wake up, go for a walk on the path on the beach, have breakfast at the buffet at Duos then go \"veg\" out by the pool or beach and be waited on hand and foot. They come by every half hour or so and offer you fresh delicious orange slices or pineapple as well as offer a cold towel and spritz if you'd like. What pampering! If you can afford it, there is no doubt that 4S will leave you completely satisfied. It is pricey, but worth every single penny. It is located in Wailea which is an upscale area in itself with beautiful golf courses, restaurants and shops all within 5 minutes by car.

We arrived on 5/7/08 and we stayed two nights. From the moment you arrive you are greeted by the valet, opening your door and helping you with your luggage. They greet you with orchid lei for the women and leaf lei for the men. We travelled with our two girls ages 1 and 2. They even greeted them by their names and gave them shell lei. At check in they had cool lavender scented towels to freshen up and they came out with a basket full of toys for the girls to pick from. When we arrived to the room they had baby proofed the room like I had requested and had snacks with tub toys for the girls and a bottle of Champagne for us for our anniversary. They also had Whale stuffed animals as souvanir gifts for the girls. The room was set up with a crib and extra diapers, swim diapers and toiletries. We had a mountain view room, which I'm glad we got because you hardly spend time in the room anyway. And the view of the mountains is nice. They do face the road and the AC units, but you can't hear anything with the doors closed. The room of course is huge and they have complimentary robes and slippers for your use while in the hotel. They also have a beach bag that you can use while there and if you want to purchase it you can as well. The bathroom is gorgeous. They had the girls names spelled out with sponge letters. They spelled one of the girls name wrong, which was not a big deal, the bell boy right away got on his walkie talkie and had someone send the right letters. They have a little refrigerator with water and it came in handy for the girls milk and juices. The pool, is everything you have read and seen, but since I spent most of my time in the childrens area I will speak about that. The children's pool area is nice with a toddler pool and two other pools with waterfalls and a small slide. They have cabanas free of charge of course and if you like they bring out a pack n play with the little ones to nap. We did have trouble finding a Cabana by the children's area since its smaller. They also have beach chairs but they are in the sun. The beach is beautiful and they have sand toys for the kids to play with. They set up your chairs with umbrella and we never felt pressured to tip even though we did. For our anniversary night we hired a nanny from The Nanny Connection. She was great! The Four Seasons recommend this nanny company as well an they use them for baby sitting services. I was a little hesitant but quickly became comforted when she came in with a bag full of new toys and the girls took right to her. They didn't even notice when we left. We also had her for a snorkel trip we took. She came to our condo after the four seasons. We ate at ferraros for lunch which was good but I have never spent almost $100 for lunch. We knew it was going to be pricey but we didn't want to leave because the girls were tired after a morning of fun in the sun! For our anniversary dinner we ate at Duo's. We loved it, the food was great and we loved the plate full of cotton candy that they give at the end. We asked if they could bag what was left for the girls and the waiter was nice to bring us a whole new bag. I wrote a lot about what they had for children because when I was researching I felt that the majority of people that gave reviews spoke negative about the children or stated that it was not a good hotel for children.

We arrived after spending time in Australia for our son's wedding and needed some relaxation after the long trip there. I wrote to them ahead of time and told them we were celebrating three occasions (our son's wedding, our anniversary, and my birthday). They upgraded us from a garden view room to an ocean view room. The room was specious with a large, opulent bathroom. The view was very nice and we enjoyed our balcony- even had room service breakfast one morning! The staff looked after you at all times. I did as suggested and tipped the cabana boy $20 each day. I was up and down there at 7 to get a cabana facing the ocean. Several people took cabanas but also held chairs in the sun which I felt was a little unfair when people had a hard time finding chairs later on in the day. I think it it was fully booked, it might be hard to do this. We had lunch twice in our cabana and drinks. They constantly bring water and check to see if you want anything. This is all done with a smile. I never had to look for anyone when we wanted something. Drinks are expensive there (from $12 to $18) but they are good! We ate breakfast at Duo's and the buffet was very good. It was $35 each but the food selection was large. Everything cooked was delicious. We also ate dinner there one night and it was our best meal there. We had drinks at Ferraro's several times as well as dinner once. It was very good (at about $200 with just one salad,2 entrees, and splitting a dessert with 2 drinks). I had the lobster risotto which was wonderful.

The service was the best we have had anywhere and the property is absolutely stunning. We were always able to get a cabana with an ocean view, and the service around the pool was outstanding. Fresh fruit, Evian \"spritzes,\" sunglass cleaning, etc. The concierge is extremely accommodating. Every time we called for the courtesy car to pick us up from local restaurants, it was waiting for us the moment we stepped outside. We highly recommend the breakfast buffet, which is huge and changes daily. Spago and Ferraros were both great. We did not try Duo only because we didn't feel like eating steak in Hawaii. It looks good, though, if you're craving red meat. If you like to run, there is a beautiful beach path right outside the hotel that wraps around the coastline. It's about 1.5 miles, so you can do a quick 3-mile run going down and back with beautiful views of the ocean. The workout room also has great cardio and free weight equipment, along with as much free gatorade and water as you want. I did the Wai Aulia (cocoon bed) at the spa and recommend it highly. It feels like you're floating in the ocean while you get your massage. I also recommend the free outrigger canoe activity and the (not-free) scuba dive experience. Both were outstanding, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. We saw four sea turtles during the outrigger canoe trip and all kinds of tropical fish during the scuba dive. I have no complaints at all about the service. The only minor annoyance was a corporate convention that the hotel was hosting. They did \"team-building\" exercises on the beach using a loud microphone that everyone could hear at the pool. We were surprised the Four Seasons let them do this, but it only lasted an hour or so. The only other thing to note is that there are a lot of kids, and a lot of parents that have no qualms about letting their children scream through meals and scream at the cabanas. Again, this was more the exception than the rule, and there's not much the hotel can do about this. But it can be frustrating.

I felt like royalty simply being there. The staff were very attentive and since we were staying in a Club room, we were given a 10 minute introduction by the manager at the beginning of our stay. Our room was nice, large in size with a huge bathroom and private balcony overlooking the ocean and lawn. At the pool, I felt a bit in awe at first because of the other people who (to me) seemed a bit like celebrities. There seemed to be quite a few ultra-wealthy people staying there (no wonder, as we paid over $1,000 for one night). However by the second morning I felt more comfortable in the surrounds. The pool was awesome, huge with a large waterfall in the middle. The whole view down the lawn through to the pool and then down to the beach was outstanding. There were numerous cabanas around the pool too, so finding a seat was not an issue. Just down from the pool was Wailea beach, which was beautiful. The water was very clear and aqua-coloured, with no waves which I liked as the south coast tends to be quite sheltered. One of the things which surprised me, and made the stay even nicer, was the hotel's attention to detail. There were different types of sunscreen available at different locations around the pool. There was plenty of good service and refreshments in the pool area. Even at the beginning when we were checking in, they gave us refreshing hand towels. The little things like this made the stay even more enjoyable. They had several restaurants, however we only went to Ferraro's, an Italian restaurant on the water which was absolutely beautiful. It was mostly outdoor, with a lot of candles so it was really romantic. The food and service was outstanding. I would go back to the Four Seasons in an instant. Everything about the hotel and the area was amazing. The only issue was the cost - if I could find a cheaper room, even if it was not \"ocean view\", it would still be worth it as using the hotel facilities would far outweigh being in the room.

This place has what I could only describe as 'grace'. It will pamper you and make you feel relaxed without being snobish, or expecting anything. They continued to amaze me with their hospitality, from the gifts for the children when we arrived and left, to the fact they went out of their way to buy my son special Almond milk as he has a sensitivity to cow's milk and every staff member seemed to know this at every restaurant. They were never intrusive but always seemed to be gracious. My husband and I were always amazed at how the hotel seemed to think of everything - even providing a small outdoor hanging rack to dry your bathing suits on your lanai. My son and daughter especially liked the Kids for all Seasons program and the gentleman in the games room who would be around every night and help my son with any of the games if he got stuck.

I don't normally do that but was just curious as it seemed so clean! The artwork and furniture in this hotel are truly beautiful but we never felt like our kids could break anything - maybe because of where it is placed or the type they chose but it didn't feel like a museum. They seem to love kids here and always knew our name - the pool staff were always there to help you. Just to give you an idea of how I felt about this hotel's care, I once brought my towels from the pool up to my room as we were still wet and although normally I would never even think of this, at this hotel I actually brought them back down to the pool as I felt they were always so kind to us that I wouldn't leave them for housekeeping. Strange maybe, but they were really amazing to us. The beach is great here also and of course they set you up with umbrellas and chairs there as well. They also have magazines, water, and the best sunscreen available to the guests to use at each pool stand - that was a wonderful treat as we'd often forget ours upstairs.

The food at all 3 restaurants was above average. It was good but for these prices it should be outstanding. Breakfast is $32 for the full buffet and $28 for Wailea buffet which is more of a continental fare. We ate at the buffet every morning and started to tire of it a little bit by the end of our trip. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty but would have liked to venture out to try something else. We loved ordering lunch by the pool. That was a real treat. My daughter and I made reservation for a hiking trip which is totally worth it. It was a three hour trip down a mountain and back up. If you go hiking make sure to bring insect repellent. Those mosquitoes are man eaters out there. We also had the concierge make reservations for a luau at the Marriott Wailea 2 properities down the beach. The food was good and we enjoyed the show but now that we experienced it once not sure we would do it again. The true test of the resort came when I sliced my foot open while on the beach. Security came down to help and realized that the cut was much more than could be handled by a band-aid. They whisked me over to the Grand Wailea next door where there was a Dr. on call. 12 shots and 13 stitches later I was all patched up. Luckily this was our last day and were leaving for the airport a couple of hours after this happened. Also, if you have to see the Dr. at Resort Medicine with will cost you cash or credit card. They don't except insurance and it was $545 out of pocket. But I was grateful that they were there. Since we had to check out of our room before our flight and I wasn't able to walk, the FS resort let us use the Aloha suite until we were ready to leave for the airport. Overall, we loved, loved, loved, the resort and had a wonderful time and would definitely return. The staff is top notch and so friendly. They work their rears off to make sure that everything is just perfect for you. I don't have any complaints. If you're not happy here, you wouldn't be happy anywhere. ;-)", "Date": "May 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, Fantastic Food and Service!\u201d", "Author": "rickh710", "ReviewID": "UR16036802", "Content": "I concur with all of the glowing reviews about Four Seasons at Wailea. The resort is classy and stylish, with beautiful, airy public spaces and large, comfortable guest rooms. The beauty of the place cannot even compare to the customer service, which is fantastic: the staff is constantly smiling and calling you by name. Just the service poolside, with cold towels, tropical drinks, offerings of fresh fruit and sunscreen is worth the room price. The \"Partial Ocean View\" room my partner and I shared was great - you can see from the attached photos that it was spacious and had a terrific view of the gardens and ocean beyond. Bed is super comfortable, the bathroom HUGE and the balcony large enough to lounge and enjoy a meal on. Air conditioning is super cold - add the ceiling fan and you can comfortably sleep on even the hottest Hawaiian evening. Only complaint about the room (and the whole resort) is that the carpet (which was recently replaced as part of an overhaul of all guest rooms) was filthy dirty, with spill stains throughout the room. Very un-Four Seasons. Food was great throughout the resort. Spago for dinner was well worth the money: terrific service, mouth-watering entrees and a super view of the beach and ocean. Ferraro's for lunch poolside was also very good, if pricey - the turkey club I had was piled high with freshly-roasted turkey, avocado and thick bacon. We had the breakfast buffet at Duo as part of our package - it's large and filled with a lot of good stuff, but probably not worth the pice of $35 per person. Spa experience was only average, in my opinion. I was not escorted to the locker area ad shown the facilities, and I think it's odd to ask guests to go to the locker rooms behind the check-in desk, then emerge with their robes on and cross in front of the check-in (where others are arriving) to then go into the treatment waiting room. I had the scrub, wrap and massage package, and the first two segments were enjoyable, but the \"Mele Wailea\" massage was perhaps the most odd and uncomfortable treatment I have ever experienced. The therapist seemed to be concerned mostly with pushing on my pressure points with all of his strength, to the point of it being unbearable. Took the recommendation of the concierge to eat at Capische, a restaurant located at the Diamond Resort a short distance from the Four Seasons. It was TERRIFIC - romantic setting, beautiful views and excellent food.

There's plenty of great, thorough reviews so I will hit the highlights from our week there: We had an ocean view room and I would recommend that for first timers - otherwise the various \"mountain side\" packages that they occasionally offer would be suitable for a return trip if the view isn't that important to you. Spago's is great. Having dined at Spago's in Palo Alto and in Southern Cal, we feel Spago at FS Maui is the best. We dined here twice and especially enjoyed the ahi tuna cones. We dined our first night at Ferraro's and then returned for lunch once. It is a nice, quiet atmosphere accented with tiki torches. We went to DUO once at the end of our trip, but wish we tried it earlier - in order to return. Spago is wonderful and was always full (yet no issue with service), while DUO was less crowded. DUO's food is great and the service impeccable. If you are looking for a light dinner, try appetizers and small plates in the lobby bar. We really enjoyed it and there was live music. The beach is great and the pool is similarly wonderful. We rented a convertible and made it to Hana, to the top of the volcano for sunset (excellent). The FS staff will pack you a blanket and other goodies if you mention to them in advance that you are heading up there. We were pleased to have the blanket as it gets quite cold up there. We also drove up through Lahaina; we spent 5 mins there and found that too much time! I recommend buying the book Maui Revealed as it has great tips. After Lahaina, we navigated up the northwest side of the island and enjoyed a very laid back casual day hiking into waterfalls, enjoying banana bread at a little street side stand and buying fresh fruit. On our return, the FS noticed us carrying in mango, papaya, pineapple, etc and they offered to prepare it for us whenever we would like. Another nice little extra. As we were there for a honeymoon, they sent delivered at least one special gift every day - usually 2 or more. Champagne, fruit, chocolates, etc. It was very nice. The room service here is outstanding.

We were on the club floor, which is in the south tower on the eighth (top) floor, in an ocean view prime room. We had views of the courtyard gardens, pool and ocean. It was the priciest room available at $1200.00 a night but we decided to splurge on this trip. The last time we were here, we simply purchased a garden view room and still had a good time. This hotel makes sure you feel comfortable no matter where you are. Because of an earlier visit to FS, we were aware that even our room category was set back a way from the beach. But we still saw the beach not just the ocean from our room and heard the waves crashing when we opened the lanai doors. But we were never disturbed by sounds out at the pool or even in neighboring rooms. In fact, our room seemed sound proof. Either that or the guests are extremely quiet. No kids running down the halls or people partying and not knowing when to keep it down. Just peace. And we really needed it. When we first arrived at the hotel, our room smelled really musty. Our neighbors next door complained of the same thing. We talked to the manager on duty and they arranged for us to stay in a lesser category room for the night while engineering cleaned off the mildew on the air vent and replaced the air filter. What a difference that made! The manager arranged for our dinner to be paid for that night to make up for our \"trouble\". The rest of our trip was without inconvenience. All of the rooms here are unbelieveably comfortable. They have different color schemes in either green, gold, blue or coral. The beds are pillow topped, the plasma t.v.'s have beautiful, clear pictures and the bathrooms are pure endulgence. There is a bench and a whole side of the bathroom where ladies, you can sit and leisurely primp. The sinks are so far apart, you'll never bump in to whoever you're sharing the room with. And the lanais are really large and well set up for two people to comfortably lounge or eat. The lounge level is what made this trip extraordinary for us. Not only will the concierge on duty make dinner and excursion reservations for you, they will do just about anything you ask of them, from summoning housekeeping, engineering, or a manager to your room to fixing you any drink you want (as long as it isn't blended) to drink there or to take to the pool or just your room. They provided unparalleled service and treated you like you were one of their best friends in the world. I've never experienced service like this. They serve a lovely breakfast which they call continental but includes a specialty item everyday, such as eggs benedict, pork hash, french toast and blueberry crumble, to name a few. They also serve hard boiled eggs in addition to the wonderful pastries, breads, bagels, fresh fruits, cereals and hot coffee and tea. In the afternoon, from 2:00 'til 5:00 p.m., they serve \"tea\". This includes delicious sandwiches, scones, desserts and of course, the tea of your choice. Then there are hors d'oeurves serve from 5:00 until 7:00 p.m., with items served such as short ribs, shrimp, crab, various appetizers such as bruschetta, hummus dip and flat bread, unique salads and always fresh veggies with ranch dressing on the side. Then at night, delicious desserts plus a sorbet or ice cream and again, whatever cocktail you may fancy. We almost never needed to eat or drink any where else on or off the property, with the exception of dinner. And even there, we paid for no wine, dessert or coffee. It was wonderful! The lobby has beautiful views and relaxing entertainment at night. It is always fun to sit there and enjoy a free show with a pupu or a drink. The spa treatments were so relaxing and the therapists very good. The spa itself is a bit small and has no hot tub or splash pool but it has a steam room and fully stocked amenities for your pre and post massage needs. My husband and I had two 2 hour massages, one on the beach and one inside. We liked them both ver much. The restaurants here seem to be controversial. We could see why when we noticed that ordering the right dish can make all the difference. At Spago, where the service was quite slow, the opakapaka was dry but the lamb chops were moist and delicious. At Ferraro's, the spaghetti and pizza were so so but the lobster risotto was very good. At Duo, we recommend the filet mignon with the bernaise sauce. It was out of this world delicious. The lobster there was a bit chewy, though. So, a little inconsistency but all in all, we thought the food was very good. By the way, room service was also perfect. The pool is beautiful but was quite cold when we were there. We overheard a few other people mentioning it as well. And it really difficult to find chairs near the pool. Three things that might help to know here. The first is that half, if not most of the chairs by the pool become shaded by 11:00 a.m. because of all the palm trees surrounding it. The second piece of info is that you can almost always find an unshaded chair on the lawn between the pool and the beach. The third is that you can snag a cabana between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m. because that is when a lot of people begin to leave. Just ask an attendant to scout one out for you and set it up. Despite the crowdedness, the experience there is still pampering. The attendants come around with cold spritzes, icy towels and fresh fruit on a stick and ice water. The work out facilities are top notch. The game area is also fun, even for us adults. But for me, the best exercise was taking a stroll along that walkway by the beach before sunset, peeking at other hotels we've once visited, admiring the ocean and the islands in the background and then returning to what we think is the best hotel in Maui.

I have stayed in all types of hotels and vacation rentals over that time from private beach houses, condos and resorts on both sides of the island including the Hyatt (which I still like) Sheraton, Kei Lani, Grand Wailea (horrible and last choice) and the Four Seasons. While this was not our first time visiting the Four Seasons I would have to say that based on experience this really is the best choice available and while not cheap at close to $1,000 a night you really do get what you pay for here. We booked a partial ocean view room on the club level. What I liked about this room, it faces the outside of the Resort towards Makena. The prime ocean view rooms on the club level face towards the pool area and the Grand Wailea (disneyland) next door and you also see the rooms across the courtyard. I'm at the pool all day or on the beach and see that view, so it was nice to face towards the Molikini crater to get a different look so I would say a booking tip here is not to pay for the prime ocean view rooms. Another nice option about the Four Seasons is you can fax a shopping list and have your in room frig. stocked with the items you want. This is not as important if your on the club level as they have food service four times a day and an open bar at all times, no cost and if you need anything you can just take it to your room, for example bottled water, chips, sandwiches and so on. The club level food service had a continental breakfast in the morning that varies every day with a combination of the usual items and a few new ones like french toast, egg fritata, eggs florentine as a few examples, mid day or afternoon tea as they call it was a mix of sandwiches, quiche, cheese, deserts and other finger foods. The happy hour also had a mix of the same items everyday and a few new hot and cold appetizers. The fourth service was around 8:30pm to ? which was all deserts and really, really good. With food service like this every day you don't need to go down for breakfast in the morning at $35 a person. Other items included on the club level are your own private staff to arrange day trips, rest resv's free use of the internet and business center on that level, use of binoculars to view any whales going by and many other perks. I would say that as with all resorts at this level budget and bring some $$$ for tips, they go a long way. The beach staff, pool staff were great. The cabanas by the pool fill up fast. People were going to the pool a laying stuff out early, I mean early 6am. They have a policy that at 7am when the staff shows up you check in with them and regardless if there are items already out they will be removed and the cabanas and chairs given out, this is important as people would put stuff on chairs leave and come back hours later. I found it best to show up at 7am hand the attendant $40 get a cabana and be taken care of all day. Now if you think that sounds expensive I will tell you my friends were staying at Disneyland (Grand Wailea) next door and if you want to reserve a cabana there for the day it will cost you over $350 They really do bring you cold evian, frozen fruit and drinks. They will also stop by and detail your sunglasses for you. The beach has toys available for the children, cold water and both the beach and pool areas have free suntan lotion so don't bother buying and hauling lotion around with you, another tip. The gym and cardio equipment were top quality and in great condition. The spa is really relaxing and the treatments were some of the best I have had. We had dinner at all three restaurants and were never let down by the service or food. At Duo they have mixologist and drink menu that is worth paying some attention to. Spago is great place for a meal and drink and another tip is to book Feraros for dinner at around 30 min before sunset. The restaurant is outdoors and overlooks the beach. In my opinion the three best restaurants on Maui are all located at the Four Seasons, Spago, Duo and Feraros. We were traveling with children and the perks were cribs, toys, diaper bin, changing supplies, strollers and many other items available at no charge. Other items to cover not about the Four Seasons. What ever you do, stay away from the Grand Wailea next door, this place has gone to rock bottom. The restaurants there are as bad as they get, the spa is really dirty, I walked out of it. You can take a short walk to the shops at Wailea where you will find the Tommy Bahama bar and restaurant. It use to have a great view until they built condos in front of it about three years ago as I'm told. The bar is fun, the food is just okay, but for an easy casual meal it's good. There is also a Ruth Chris steak house, however I find this strange, who wants to eat a heavy meal in hot weather. Another cheap eats if you want to leave the resort is Maui Tacos down the road in Kiehi. We also tried Joe's for the first time. The ribs are good but not really much to the place, it's close and kid friendly. I remember reading some reviews regarding the long road to place and needing to get a ride in the golf cart, this is the most absurd thing I have read. If you can't walk from the parking lot to restaurant and back, you have more important things to worried about, like your physical condition and possibly the need to get personal trainer, my 3 year walked there and back with not problem. If you like good wine and would like to buy a bottle at reasonable prices across the street from Joe's is Wailea wine. It's only a three minute drive from the resort. We always stop there for a few bottles to have around if we want to go down to the beach at sunset on our own or with our friends. The kids camp was great for our older children, lots of activities and a climbing wall. They also have a large game room with a couple of pool tables, ping pong, and a gaming room with several gaming systems. This was nice as our kids and their friends went there after dinner and the adults were able to have a relaxing after dinner drink. The Four Seasons brand has always been reliable. Other than the issue of digging for a cabana or pool side chair every day this place is first class. Even the group and very small convention people that come here are a cut above most that you would find at other resorts and blend well with the paying guest.", "Date": "April 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201c3rd trip to FS Maui and I continue to be impressed.\u201d", "Author": "winelover2", "ReviewID": "UR15000886", "Content": "Well we just returned from our 3rd trip at Four Seasons Maui. This place is so so wonderful. Each time we leave we are already disussing our next possible trip. This time we were with our first child who is 7 months. The staff is so helpful with kids, they set up things in your room as requested such as bottle warmer, high chair, diaper genie, crib, extra refirg. ect. They also had toys in the tub and our daughters name in colorful sponges. We booked a Garden View with 5th night free program which is what we received. Housekeeeping was great and since we left at different times each day I would call usually when leaving the room. I was very impressed that they remembered our preferences such as extra coffee, splenda and red wine glasses each day. These small things are so nice. This trip was different with our daughter however we really enjoyed it and look forward to returning. We only scheduled dinner 4 of the 7 nights. Twice at Spago, once at Ferrero and at Capishe at Diamond Resort. I am so glad we did not schedule more dinner reservations with our baby. The one night we dined at Spago with her it was challenging. She did not want to sit still and we did a lot of walking around with her. I also did not feel like this was fair to others dining. So we decided that was the last \"nice\" dinner with her. Other nights we had appetizers at the open air lobby bar and listened to music, we also picked up food from Cheeseburger in Paradise and dined at Longhis; both located in The Shops at Wailea. We did use The Nanny Connection for 1 day and 2 nights. I was slightly unseasy about this however we had met many of the nannys on our previous trips plus ready great reviews about them. It was really nice for us to be able to get away as adults for 3 hours which is their minimum. Spago was excellent, I think this is funny since we did not even try it our first trip because of mixed reviews, we discovered it our 2nd trip and love it. Ferreros is my favorite at sunset however this trip we had it planned for our last evening; unfortunately they closed it due to bad weather. Thankfully the concienrge had made back up reservations at Spago for us. Our favorite this trip was Capishe. We were so impressed with the service, food and view. They even called the nest day to check up. I was a bit unseasy beacuse we have tried other places at nearby resorts in the past and been dissapointed. We will try Capishe again it was a great experience. We spent most of our days out by the pool in a cabana since we now have a baby. Most days we were able to overlook the ocean and still be close to the pool. They set up pack-n-plays for kids if you request. The pool staff is so friendly, most of them remembered our name each day which is nice. We had luch out there each day and it was quite good and reasonable. We had a couples massage one afternoon which was great. I am always impressed with the spa services. The resort was quite full towards the end of our stay and it was harder to get a cabana so we went out around 8am and had one set up and then alternated until we both came out with our daughter around 9am. I was a little annoyed with people who would get a cabana at 7am and then show up at 10. The staff will only hold a cabana for 30 minutes unless it is between 11-2 and then it is 2 hours however most people were able to keep their cabanas even when gone for extended period of times. I just think this is rude. If you point it out they will remove their items and open the cabana but I did not want to be \"Cabana police\" Yes the resort is expensive however if you are looking for great service and a relaxing beautiful vacation this is it!!!!!!

It has all the great things you expect from a Four Seasons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most noticeably a gracious, caring staff (even during the Easter Break.)

Every dish at Spago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was terrific, service was attentive yet transparent and we ate our appetizers as the sun was setting. The other restaurants were also fine. BTW, if you get a chance leave the premises one evening and have dinner at Sansei in Kihei (a 15 minute drive) one of the most innovative Sushi restaurants on the islands. The rooms themselves were quite nice, but nothing extraordinary for this class of hotel. They were large, comfortable, with a nice bathroom and balcony, etc. One of the downsides is nothing they can change easily. The pool area is just too small to handle holiday crowds. The staff handles all poolside requests with panache, but you are packed cheek to jowl with your neighbors. Same with the sand beach below. This is a physically large hotel like the Four Seasons Hualalai on the Big Island. But on the Big Island that hotel had enough property to design the room layout so most of them face the ocean. Here in Maui, the property is much smaller, so the hotel is designed as a U-shape, with the majority of the rooms facing the courtyard with a small view of the ocean if you crane your neck. Hence the hotels biggest downside \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in your room you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at the other rooms across the courtyard. The good news of course is that if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Hawaii your not hanging out in the room much. So that would have been fine if they tell you what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting. However, having never stayed at this hotel I called by phone and asked reservations for an ocean view room. They said they had one and would I like an ocean view prime room. What a surprise in checking in to find out that a $1000/night \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view prime\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room is a room with a view of the courtyard with a small peek at the ocean if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re angled correctly or sitting on the balcony. (In fairness to the hotel the website describes the room view honestly, but the phone reservation people never mentioned it and I was nowhere near a web browser.) My suggestion to management is that this is a great hotel offering a great product - you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to market the hotel like the Marriott. There is nothing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ocean View Prime\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about these rooms. It tarnishes the brand and makes the Four Seasons seem like another over hyped Hawaii experience.

We do all the work here.\" That simple comment summed up the entire vacation for us. We were treated like royalty EVERY day, and by every single person who was on staff at the Four Seasons. Everyone was kind, warm, and went out of their way at all times possible to make sure that we were happy, comfortable, and relaxed. We enjoyed Duo for breakfast, Ferraro's for lunch, and Spago, which was by far the standout, for dinner. We ate at each restaurant several times, but Spago was still the best.

You always had views of the ocean, you always felt the breeze. Just fantastic. We really enjoyed the live music they have nightly in the lobby lounge. People have complained that drinks and food were expensive - well...you're at the Four Seasons. I'm not sure what people expected. The drinks and food were pricey, but delicious. Every evening my husband and I got to the lobby lounge at about 5 PM to get a good seat and would watch the sunset - what an awesome, awesome experience. We only had one issue while at the hotel, but it was promtply recitified, and in an over-the-top way. Every afternoon at about 3:30 PM, but husband and I would take a nap (we were getting up at 6:30 every morning to get prime seats with a great view of the ocean!), and our room was always made up, the bed always fresh. Two days in a row, our room was not taken care of. We called housekeeping, and after that it was a crazy thing... That night, someone came to our door with a HUGE plate of fresh fruit, breads, and a fondue pot filled with chocolate \"for our trouble\", which really wasn't any trouble at all! Then the housekeeping manager met us out by the pool the next morning and informed us that we could have a poolside massage of our choice free. We did take him up on that, and then had another one a few days later! And on the subject of massages, we indulged in a couples Lomi Lomi massage at the hotel's spa in one of the oceanfront hales. Words cannot even describe... We were there for the better part of a month, and it really started to feel like home! My husband and I still talk about it every single day and can't wait to return.

We were upgraded to a garden view from a mountain side upon check in (the hotel was not booked to capacity). Everything was perfect. The service, the spaciousness and cleanliness of the room and facility, water and complementary sun block stations everywhere, tasty drinks served poolside...I could go on and on! The weather held steady at about 82 degrees and cooled off nicely at night. We took the beach path to the right of the hotel and made our way down through some rocky terrain to where the ocean pushed through protruding rocks and made little pools near our feet. Just off these rocks is said to be some of the best snorkeling. Unfortunately, we didn't snorkel much but from this spot we saw little colorful fish being trapped in the pools, big black crabs running around and a turtle even popped it's head out of the water in front of us! We watched a mother and her baby whale(s) from here at dusk one night too. The outrigger excursion is a must. The FS offers it as a complimentary service; all you have to do is sign up with (I recommend at least 24 hours before you want to go). We saw whales surfacing in the relatively close distance and saw some even jumping totally out of the water! Lots of tail action. The instructor told us that earlier that morning a pod of whales swam right under the canoe! We weren't as lucky, but just being out there is calming and serene. I had a message at the spa and it was one of the best I had ever received! She gave me some pure aloe vera (not the green stuff!) for my sunburn to put on after I showered. Ahh. FS, we've been back two days and I miss you already! We did the road to Hana, which, I would recommend for people who don't get motion sickness, really like to be in the car with the people they are traveling with and love the outdoors. It's a long trip (took us about 7 hours round trip...only stopping three times), but you should do it once. I would not suggest going too far past Hana. Guide books will tell you that there is some cool stuff this way, but it's really at your own risk. You can't see or hear cars coming around the corner toward you and it's a two lane road big enough for 1 1/2 cars! I'm glad we did it, but next time we'll do more exploring around the west side (top) of Maui. And, we will definitely be doing this from our \"home base\" at the FS.

For the first three days we stayed at the Four Seasons Maui. This portion of our trip was for our 5th wedding anniversary and could not have been better. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty! It is very strange to have someone you have never even met call you by name but that is what happend after we first met the valet at the front entrance. From then on it was Aloha Mr. or Mrs. Anderson. Very cool!! I have always been a proponent of booking the worst (not really just the least expensive) room at the best hotel, because really, when you are in Maui how much time do you spend in the room anyway? Also, all the standard rooms here (non-suites) have the same layout and size the only thing you pay extra for is the view. With that being said, we got the mountainside room for about half of what you would pay for an ocean view. Once again, when I wanted to see the ocean I just went outside. Our mountainside actually had a golf course view which was great. The rooms are huge and the bathrooms are the biggest I have ever seen at a hotel, with a seperate tub and shower. There were plenty of cabanas at the pool available, however, as stated in many other reviews if you want one of the prime ones on the cliff overlooking the beach you need to get there early (7am or before) to camp out and wait for the attendants to set it up for you. After that, they will usually watch your stuff for you while you eat breakfast or lunch. The rules say that you can not leave for more than twenty minutes without losing your place (except for lunch when you are granted two hours) but, I never saw anyone lose their spot if they were gone longer. Besides, as I said before there was plenty of space to go around. We had our anniversary dinner at Ferraros. WOW!!! In my opinion, the view from dinner at sunset is the best on the island. The food was great as well. I am a meat and potatoes guy and the filet with gorgonzola was perfect. My wife had pasta with clams and it had so many clams she could not finish them all. Since it was our anniversary, they brought us a free desert to top off the evening. Another great aspect of the hotel is they don't nickel-and-dime you. There is no \"resort\" charge per night like at many other resorts. Yes, it is expensive, but once you get your room rate that is it nothing more. And well worth it!! Any time you needed a ride somewhere weather it be shopping or dinner they have a driver take you. So if you just stay in the Wailea area you don't even need a rental car. All in all, the Four Seasons Resort at Wailea, Maui is the best there is on the island.

First, the positives: the rooms are large, all with sitting area, sofa and large, luxurious bathroom with deep tub, separate shower and w/c. Good towels, toiletries and linens rounded out the quality of the room. There are four places to eat in the hotel, not including room and poolside service. All the food was good, but Spago (as expected) was a stand-out. IMHO, our meal at Spago was the only thing in the hotel that was worth the price - and I'm not a big foodie, frou frou guy. The wine list is just OK, with relatively few decent vintage bottles to be had. The waiter explained that they are rebuilding their cellar??? huh? The pools are great, with one big for adults and a smaller one with a small slide for the kiddies. They're not like the Grand Wailea or Hyatt (virtual theme parks), but they work just fine. You should get your butt out on the beach anyway, which is fantastic! The hotel is located on one of the best swimming beaches in Maui and is prime location for whale watching and sea kayaking. This area generally has the driest weather in Maui, according to locals. The Kids for All Seasons room is great for kids 5-9, was clean and safe. At $16 per hour plus tip, the Four Seasons Nanny Service was another great bargain. We got a very nice, qualified, 30-year-old woman who took great care of our toddler while we snuck away for a couple dinner dates. The staff at this Four Seasons was generally very good and went out of their way many times to make us happy. The not-so-goods: first, the prices. I know its the Seasons and people here don't need to look at prices but, really, $27 for a glass of mediocre Santa Barbara zin at the lobby bar? That's just insulting. All the food and beverage prices, as a matter of fact, were just plain grotesque. $48 for a medium-sized platter of broiled snapper and root veggies at the main hotel restaurant is not reasonable on any island at any hotel. Sorry. And I don't care if you call the snapper Hupu Hupu or Ono Bono or whatever - I know snapper and I know it jumps in your boat if you hold up a picture of a worm. The spa is small and lousy with a steam room like a closet and no tubs, sauna or whirlpools. This is a not a spa resort, disregard the adverts. The gym is also small and lousy. Rent a sea kayak, go for a run, or do the beach free beach yoga instead. The \"cheap rooms\" they advertise - $500/nt with Mountain View - are really overlooking the car park and an industrial chiller that sounds like a diesel semi outside your hotel bedroom. Forget about sitting on your balcony or leaving your window open for fresh tropical breezes. All rooms that I saw, save the highest priced suites (in the $thousands/nt) had only partial ocean views or worse. The hotel is refurb'd, but they didn't make the views any better. Summary: Its a beautiful hotel on a fantastic beach with the best weather in Maui. That said, this recently refurb'd Four Seasons is not worth the price. Save some money and stay at the nearby Marriott or Grand Wailea or, better yet, rent a condo at the Wailea Beach Villas where you'll get your own kitchen, an ocean view, but share the same beach as the Seasons.

We have stayed at condos in the area for many years and decided to splurge by ending our holiday with a few nights of luxury at the Four Seasons Wailea. From the moment you arrive at the front entrance, you are greeted with excellent service that this hotel is known for. Fresh flower leis for the ladies and green braided leis for the gentlemen were presented. We were escorted to the front desk and offered a refreshing glass of orange blossom iced tea as a refreshment. Upon checkin, in recognition of our 25th wedding anniversary, we were upgraded from a mountainside room to a garden room. When making our reservation directly through the hotel's website, I mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary and requested an upgrade, if available not really expecting it. Upon entering the room, which was beautifully decorated with a huge bathroom, there was a complimentary bottle of champagne on ice waiting for us and a card from the manager. Very classy! Our room was 408, which did overlook the lovely garden with the croquet lawn to the left and the front entrance to the right. However, our balcony also had an excellent view of the ocean through the palm trees. At the time of year we were there, the sun was setting in the middle of our ocean view. It was fabulous and totally unexpected. As a couple travelling alone, we liked this hotel for its small and exclusive atmosphere. There were still many familes with small children and there is a small kid friendly pool. Families with older children and teenagers might prefer staying at the Grand Wailea for the waterslide activies and larger pool. The service at poolside is impeccable. Comfortable lounge chairs are set up by pool attendants who are ready to bring water and take food or beverage orders. The food was expensive for 3 meals a day yet excellent quality and presentation. With a fridge in our room, which is filled with 2 complimentary bottles of water each day, I purchased some fruit, cereal and milk, so we had breakfast on our lanai each morning. Otherwise, the breakfast at Duo restaurant would cost you about $35 per person for the full buffet or you can order a la carte. A few cocktails and lunch by the pool cost about $100/day but we enjoyed this treat, as we relaxed in the sun. There are also cabanas and umbrellas available free of charge should you wish a shady spot. We had dinner at Spago on one night and at Ferraro's on our last night. The meals were excellent. Ferraro's has the best view of the sunset as it is located on the lower level with uninterrupted views of the beach and ocean. The day we checked out we put our bags in storage. There is a hospitality room where my husband showered and changed before our last dinner and sunset before heading to the airport. I had a spa appointment booked for 3 pm, so I brought along a change of clothes so I could shower and change after my treatment. I would highly recommend this to anyone if you have a late flight out. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel for its location, service and quality. It does have a high price tag attached for all the wonderful things you get for staying at a Four Seasons, but definitely worth it. When we go to Maui with our 3 kids, we usually rent a condo or add on a few days at the Grand Wailea.

Upon arrival we were greeted and given lei's made from leaves which I thought was very tasteful - not the typical orchids you see everywhere (which I still love!). Checkin was smooth and effortless. Started out in a \"Mountain side\" room (not Mountain \"View \"room which we learned upon arrival). The view was so disappointing that we asked to change rooms to the next level - \"Garden View\" which the mgmt. graciously accommodated us at no charge. The view from the Garden View room was of the ocean and W. Maui mountains. Even though we were at the back of the \"U\" the view was stunning. Unless you don't care about your room, don't book the Mountain \"Side\" room. The interior of the room was elegantly furnished - large flat screen TV, desk, sofa, chair, dresser, large closet with safe, wet bar, fridge and Tassimo coffee maker (incl. coffee, tea, hot choc disks which were replenished daily). A welcome box of cookies and confections greeted us - very delicious. The bathroom was almost the size of the main living area, all marble, separate soaking tub, shower, double vanity and toilet closet. Robes and toiletries (l'Occitaine) were top notch. A choice of in room audio channels. Turndown service every night included an orchid on the pillow, printout of the next days events as well as slippers placed bedside and hawaiian music playing. The pool areas (2) are very nice with lots of private cabanas. In addition, there are very private cabanas/alcoves on the hill over the beach. Get there early to secure one. Two jacuzzi's on either end of the pool. Service at the pool is excellent and I found the food better here than in some of the restaurants (more on that later). Staff are friendly and attentive. they circulate with ice pops, fruit pieces and water for your enjoyment. We spent our time on the sun lawn near the ocean stairs. Great place to watch for whales while you tan. \"Snorkles\" is a full service water sports \"concierge\" who will plan your trips and adventures (located near the beach). They also sell snacks, sunscreen, sunglasses etc. Beach attendants provide free lounges, snorkling equipment and boogie boards for guests. Gym is small but very well equiped with top notch equipment. Cardio area is separate but nice because it's semi-outside under the veranda near the Spa. Take advantage of the croquet lawn and play a few games - we had a blast. Can't speak to the Spa but I hear it's the best on the island. Also can't speak about the tennis courts as I didn't play. Restaurants: \"Duo\" is the resort's newest addition. Very similar to a Ruth Chris or Mortons. Steak and seafood with anything else a la carte. Good but nothing to write home about. \"Spago\" is of course Wolfgang Puck's signature restaurant. Service was good, food was good but not exceptional which I was expecting. Wine list is very good. \"Ferraro's\" is Italaian and average. The draw here is the view which is poolside and the place to be at sunset or for lunch. Explore Nick's next door at the Fairmont. Concierges are excellent abeit a bit too \"fake\" nice most of the time. Very thorough and good communication/knowledge. Use them - great resource. All in all, a great experience.

First impressions - absolutely stunning, they had everything down to a T. Lei and drinks welcome, led to front desk for check in where we had beautiful aromatherapy hand towels to freshen up with. I'd originally booked the Garden view room, but due to many correspondences with the hotel in preparation for my husband's suprise birthday, they gave ME the best suprise - they upgraded us to an Executive Suite (which worked out to be an extra $300USD per night if we had to pay for it)!! I also booked with their special promotion at the moment - book 5 nights and get the 6th night free - so i was stoked! We were led to our room by Eric our bellhop who gave us a grand tour of the hotel, and all the info you could want, plus showed us where everything was around the hotel and our room - really went above and beyond. Our suite was spacious and absolutely stunning (they just renovated a few months back), with its own dining, living room, bedroom, and ensuite which was bigger than the bedroom. See photos. We had welcome platters and a selection of mini pastries from management to wish my husband a happy birthday - very nice touch! You would have read all of the above so it may come as no suprise, but what my husband and I felt really put the Four Seasons ahead of the pack is their attentiveness to customer service. The staff is so well trained, and even though the hotel is owned by Micheal Dell, owner of Dell computers, (he personally stayed there and loved it so much he bought it a few years back), it is still run by Four Seasons with their signature excellent service. Little things like free poolside cabanas, complimentary orange blossom and mint juice stations set up around the hotel really adds that special touch. Everywhere we went, EVERYONE greeted us by our names, even down to our limo drivers and the guys at the pool and the beach (Darrett at Snorkels down at the beach deserves a special mention - he rocks with his great personality and service!) We just felt like the most special people whilst staying at the Four Seasons! Restaurants wise - we really liked Ferraros - please try their lobster risotto, it is their signature dish and it's the best we've had. Wasn't too keen on their Mai Tais, we preferred the Lava Flows for cocktails. Duo's was great, customer service there fantastic - but food probably could be better. My Fillet Mignon was great, but my husband's Porterhouse cut was way below standard - not sure if we're picky coming from great Australian beef, but his was rough, dry and tasteless. We didn't go bk to Duos, but Ferraro's, we dined there 3 times. Didn't try Spagos due to bad reviews i've read. Shops at Wailea def worth a visit - we had dinner at Longhi's and it really was very average - people told us we should have gone to Ruth's Chris' Steakhouse instead. One last thing - we experienced one bad experience whilst staying at the FS, and this was at the Spa there - my husband had a massage treatment done as part of his b'day present, and i went and waited for him to come out after my gym session. I was in the Spa front section for over 15 mins, and NO one single staff came out to ask if they could help me - and i was standing and browsing not more than 3 meters away from the front desk. I almost thought that the Spa was not owned by the FS, it was that bad. In particular, one staff, a local, spoke to us in a really condescending manner - so we were extremely suprised after all the superior service we've experienced.

We had been on an amazing hike through a bamboo forest when the rain started and we were a little self concious of our bedraggled state! Wailea, in contrast to Hana (which we loved), was warm and sunny and the valets at the 4S were as welcoming and helpful to us as they were to the more polished family with designer luggage that were also arriving. The 4S staff should be commended for their incredible attention to detail, initiative and responsiveness. On our first night, we asked the valets the best way to get to the nearby mall. Their response was that they would be happy to give us a ride. Within a minute, they had a luxury SUV and driver (complimentary) pulled up to take us there. Whenever we went to the beach or pool, staff were quick to set us up in a cabana with towels and cold water (also complimentary). They regularly came by with lovely pieces of fruit for us to enjoy. My daughter had had an allergic reaction to macadamia nuts earlier in our stay and the front desk registered that information into their data base. Whenever we ate on site, the restaurant staff always took the initiative to find out which one of our daughters was allergic and advised us on nut-free selections. The restaurants (particularly Ferraros), albeit very expensive, had such excellent service, food and ambience that we felt more that we were treating ourselves instead of being taken advantage of. Our girls appreciated the 'teen' and 'keiki' menus. They also enjoyed the games room and the special treats left for them upon our arrival. I liked being able to take in a Yoga class. While the hotel is pristine and well-maintained, we were somewhat surprised to find a little gecko in our room. Luckily, we thought it was pretty cute and didn't bother to complain. From a systems perspective, the 4S is exemplary in that they employ very positive and responsive staff who treat each guest as though it is their distinct pleasure to help them. It's obvious that the 4S caters to a very high end clientele; however, their service is not discriminatory and they make you feel as valued as any other guest. We had an incredibly relaxing last few days of our holidays and were so glad that we had made the decision to try the 4S. It was a definite highlight of our holiday. On an aside, we also highly recommend the Kai Kanani snorkel charter to Molokini (that leaves from the Maui Prince Hotel, also in Wailea). Instead of leaving from 7 am at the Maalea Harbour, this charter leaves at a leisurely 9 am, and includes an additional snorkel at \"Turtle Town\" and seasonal whale watching.

We hopped over to Maui from the big island and were transported into a completely different experience. We checked in early and were promptly greeted w/leis and escorted to the check in desk. Rooms were not available yet - and we didn't expect them to be - but they took our cell phone numbers and called us at 1:15 to let us know our room was ready. My husband waited for about 10 minutes for the bellman to bring up our bags. We were able to use the facilities until our room was ready so we hung out at the pool. The pool is very nice and clean. The poolside cabanas are first come first serve - and free!!! The pool attendants were on the ball and set us up right away. They were good about clearing out chaises that were left for a long time and not returned to. The pool attendants come by very often w/fresh ice water and fruit. The temperature of the water was perfect as was the hot tub temp. The room was beautiful. We had a king room w/a sofa and a table and 2 chairs The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was huge. There is a vanity, double sinks, a full soaking tub , separate shower, and separate toilet room. There were plenty of bath towels, facecloths, etc. The l'Occitane bath/hair products were of excellent quality. The bathroom was cleaned up and replenished every evening as well as every day. They have a hairdryer, q-tips and cotton squares as well. I really liked the light up makeup mirror. The resort is very pretty - Very upscale - marble floors and quiet elegance. There are plenty of areas to relax and enjoy the quiet. There are several stations of coffe/water/tea throughout the resort also. The valet attendants offer bottles of water every time you leave or return. I really appreciated that. They have a nice game room w/pool tables, foosball, pingpong, shuffleboard, 2 complimentary computers, tvs, and a 6 station x-box room. All complimentary. They offer several fitness classes - a couple of which have a $10 charge, but many of which are free. The workout room/weight room are more than adequate. They provide towels, water, gatorade, headphones, fresh fruit. Again, no charge for using the workout area. There is alos a business center next to the concierge w/free computer usage and copying which is helpful in printing out boarding passes. The concierge is very helpful as well. The restaurants are pricey. Dinner for 4 w/2 apps, 4 entrees, 4 salads,1 dessert, 5 drinks, tax & tip came to $500 at Ferraros. Breakfast buffet was $32/pp. Dinner at Duo and Spago will run you as much if not more than Ferraros. This is an awesome resort.

We stayed one week at the 4S (where we were married) and then finished our honeymoon visiting two other islands. The property and service was outstanding. We had a wonderful time at this property. I almost cried in our limo ride back to the airport. I really did not want to leave. The rooms are outstanding. We had an executive ocean view suite and I think it was the nicest room I've ever stayed in. It was huge. Killer views. Two flat screen tvs. Wonderful bathroom. The room provided us with more than enough space for all of our wedding related items and room to get ready the day of the wedding. Lots of space. We ate breakfast a number of times at the restaurant/buffet by the pool. The breakfast was expensive, but soooo good! We really enjoyed it. We had our wedding dinner in the private dining room at Spago's and it was awesome! My guests are still talking about it. The food was outstanding! We had a number of celebrity encounters. It is a bit of celebrity hang out, which is neat, but you get used to it pretty quick. We spent an afternoon at the 4S spa and it was great too. I highly recommend the ocean-side massages. Manicure/pedicures were very good too. All in all, a great spa! The valet guys were great. Very quick and helpful. I would simply phone down for my car and within 10 minutes my car would be waiting out front. My husband and I found it refreshing that they weren't waiting around expecting a tip. We always tipped, but sometimes I had to call them over for it. They didn't hang around with their hands out, that's for sure. We thought that was really classy. The service is the best I've ever experienced. They are all about the details. The day after the wedding, they we already calling me by my married name. I was so surprised. They really don't miss a thing! The wedding, by the way, was perfect. We had a perfect day and we are so happy we got married at the 4S Maui. I'll end this review, by saying that the 4S isn't cheap, but I believe that you get what you pay for. At the 4S you will pay alot, but get a lot in return.

The second week of our trip brought us to the Four Seasons in Maui and I have to say that I am so glad we stayed there. First of all, it is not a place to stay if you want to visit on a budget, plain and simple...just go there and enjoy! The service we found was exceptional along with everything else about the hotel. We were greeted at the front entrance by a hostess who presented our famiy with leis and she escorted us to check-in. The bellman then escorted us to our suite and made sure we were happy with everything before leaving. The suite itself was beautiful, clean and welcoming. We had fruit, water and dessert left on the table near the bar. The kids each recieved a picture frame, disposable underwater camera and snacks. The Lanais overlooked the quiet courtyard and beyond that we had an awesome view of the ocean. I also liked the fact that the mini fridge wasn't filled, so that you could easily put your own items in there. Overall, we were very happy with the room. Housekeeping kept the room very clean, the bathrooms were always staightened and fresh towels brought in at turn down each evening, so we never ran out of towels (and with two girls that really easy to do). Also, the fruit was always being refreshed and restocked so that you didn't end up with brown bananas and dry grapes, although my girls love fruit so it was quickly eatten for snack. The pool area is nice, although we spent most of our time on the beach. At the beach, you can get complimentary lounges set up for you. The girls loved the beach and had a wonderful time. You can get an all day pass for $30/pp on the beach for boogie boards, use of the bouncy waterslide and some other things. Just a note that they won't rent out items if the water is too rough, which is a bummer because the boogie boarding is the best at that time. They will hold the lounge chair for you for up to 30mins or 2hrs between 11-1pm for lunch break. We didn't have problems with chairs, but we did come after the New Year. They do pass out water and fruit. There is also a food shack right before the beach if you want drinks or sandwiches. They have several restaurants at the resort and all are very good with the exception of Ferraro's. I personally didn't care for it. The setting is nice because you're sitting outside, but I felt that the food was ok and so was the service. I think our waitress was on a coffee high or something. She talked so fast and moved around like Speed Racer that I couldn't relax and enjoy my food. So, maybe with a different server I would have had a different impression of the restaurant, although the food was just ok. DUO is a steak and seafood restaurant. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. They have nice steaks that we all enjoyed with the exception of our 15 year old, who doesn't like meat. We all had a good laugh when the pasta alfredo she ordered off the kids menu came and it was served in a child's Sponge Bob bowl. The main course is served like most steak houses, with side dishes ordered separately and served family style. The kids enjoyed the cotton candy that was served with the bill so no dessert was needed. The last restaurant is Spago. I will say that the price that you pay is partly because you're eatting at Spago. Appetisers start at $20 and a main course meal $40-75. That said, I had read negative reviews from other tripadvisor contributors and a friend of mine who went in October had said it wasn't worth a visit, so we didn't go there during the week. We did, however, end up eatting there our last night, partly because we were too lazy to drive somewhere for dinner and partly because we had eatten at Ruth Chris the night before so we didn't want to do steak again. I have to say it was really good! The tomato soup my family had they really enjoyed and the Ahi Tuna Poke that I got as my first course was really delicious. Our main course meals were equally enjoyable and even our picky 15 yr old enjoyed her meal. We were glad that we ate there anyways and that we didn't miss out on a really delicious meal. Another great place to go while the kids are in the gameroom or hanging out in the room is the lounge area. They have musical entertainment everynight and its a great place to get a coffee or cocktail at the end of the day. For other food choices there's Ruth Chris, Tommy Bahama Cafe and Cheeseburger at the shops at Wailea. There's also a touristy giftshop in the same shopping area that serves up deli sandwiches and has some grocery items. Also, in nearby Kihei there are restaurants and a grocery store. Theres a great Mexican restaurant called Freds. Just one warning, if you like good sushi, don't go to Sansei (recommended to us by the concierge). The hotel also has a salon and a spa. The spa was really nice and the Hawaiian Health Wrap I had was wonderful, ask for Kristine, my husband had ?Janice? and he didn't enjoy it as much. The facilities are good and the women's bathroom was stocked with all the personal items that you may need after a treatment. The concierge service is excellent (with the exception of the sushi recommendation). We booked all our reservations through them and also our excursions. My husband and daughters went snorkeling at Molokini crater and my eldest and husband went horseback riding at Haleakala volcano. They helped out with all our questions and needs. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay there. It really was the little extras like the goodbye gifts they gave our girls, that really made us feel pampered. We also loved eatting lunch on our lanai and the atmosphere was laid back and felt like the tropical paradise that we were expecting.", "Date": "January 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bend, OR", "Title": "\u201cVery nice\u201d", "Author": "yreme", "ReviewID": "UR12618365", "Content": "We were staying at the Fairmont next door when the storm hit knocking out power at both hotels.

I will say that despite the long flight (we flew from Washington, DC), Hawaii is one of the most relaxing places to visit. We have also been to the Big Island and both trips were wonderful. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do as much sightseeing this time as we truly just wanted to relax and enjoy the amazing weather. Below is my feedback: ** Location ** The location of the Four Seasons is superb. The other parts of the island are windier and the beach is actually better in Wailea (my wife use to live in Hawaii so this is coming from her). There is also a high-end shopping center right next door that had a Gucci, Dolce Gabbana, Fendi, etc. Great place to go to get out of the sun and do a little shopping. The restaurants at the hotel were excellent so not much need to leave, but there are other hotels nearby (Fairmont, etc.) if you wanted to eat elsewhere. As you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll notice, most of the high-end restaurants in Hawaii are located in hotels. ** Pool ** The pool was great. Most areas get sun all day. The only minor complaint is that the pool doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overlook the ocean when you layout. There is a grassy area that overlooks the ocean so we spent our time split between those two areas. They have work-outs you can do in the early morning in the pool (water aerobics of sorts), which is a nice way to kick start the day. If you tip the people down at the pool first thing in the morning, they will save your spot throughout the day if you wanted to step away for a run, eat lunch, etc. ** Gym ** I thought the gym was awful. It was locked away in a little room with no windows. Very small. They had treadmills outside, which was nice but why not run outside in that case? They did have a great running path along the beach which every runner/walker should definitely use. That made the gym issue a non-issue. ** Spa ** We got massages outside which I actually would not recommend. It is right by the kiddie pool and the walkway by the beach, so between the kids hollering and the people walking along the path, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that relaxing. And it was quite hot. It would be better to use the spa services indoor, which are great. ** Rooms ** We booked a partial ocean-front room but we ended up with a full ocean front room. The rooms are fairly standard by the bathrooms were quite large. The balconies were also a great size to have drinks at night or breakfast in the mornings. It really is amazing to look at the ocean every night and morning. It was very peaceful and relaxing. ** Beach ** The beach was wonderful. The waves were small so not great for someone who would want to do serious surfing or boogie boarding. They have outrigger canoe trips in the morning that I would highly recommend. We were there during the whale season and were told, that if lucky, you can see the whales up close in the morning (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t but we did see them when we were going for a run one of the mornings). The beach is shared with a few other hotels so you can walk along the beach and do a little people watching while you swim in the ocean. The water temperature was perfect. ** Food/Restaurants ** We left the hotel only once to eat out as we had all our meals there. Because you are not going to Maui for nightlife or people watching, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to do anything but be pampered and relax. Otherwise you will get bored \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 All in all, it was an amazing trip and a wonderful hotel.

The exemplification of this achievement was reached at The Four Seasons Resort, Wailea, Maui. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Location: Those who have been to Maui know that it is genuinely an island paradise. An island paradise with a kicker, the weather can be freakishly tempramental in some parts and astonishingly perfect in others. Wind, rain, overcast conditions curse some parts of the island, while remaining seemingly oblivious in others. Wailea is a small part South & Central of the Island that is protect by mountains and is inside a bay. Alas, the weather is beautiful and the garden surroundings are equally well manicured and exclusive. The Checkin: After renting a jeep at the airport through the hotel (which was flawless in execution) we drop into the grounds of the hotel after I got us lost in the mountains at 9.30 at night for a good two hours. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what it is, but whenever I rent a car in a foreign country, I take on the persona of Clarke Griswald. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just say that if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the stars in the clear sky and the fresh air, my Beverly D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Angelo would have been unimpressed, alas our first introduction to the serene Maui environment rescued me from my own geographic embarassment. When driving into the Four Seasons you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but be instantly struck by the careful attention to detail. The perfectly cleaned gleaming white walls of the exterior of the buildings, the meticulously manicured tropical gardens, the soft glowing lights positioned in and around the greenery and palm trees. All this creates a terrifically lush, warm, and magically exclusive setting. Bell staff were a mix of locals and mainlanders, all very friendly, who showed us pearly grins as they took the car and disappeared with the bags through the separate bell desk area. On approaching the lobby you get a feeling of relaxation and calm. Almost as if the sprawling white marble, fresh flower arrangements and eclectic furnishings which melt into the open air setting fail to intimidate, but rather subtley impress with elegance. Desk staff were very professional, drinks were soon in our hand and lays (while I think a little tacky, but hey, when in Hawaii go with the flow) were placed around our necks. Alas, at this point I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even remotely tempted to hang myself with the lay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c surprisingly for anyone who has read some of my previous reviews\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6! The Room: We stayed in an ocean front king room on one of the top floors. It was very well done. The rooms were modelled with a twist of caribean influence such as large plantation shutters, clean white lines throughout, large generous cane and solid timber furnishings. Again, somehow this hotel managed to create a sense of opulence without overdoing the grandure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very smart. A critique though, and this is a double edged sword. Choice is generally a difficult balancing act; I personally like to choose from a bar fridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contents and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the hotel against what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in there. The best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen so far HAS to be the Soho House in New York City, incredible variety and a wild imagination from the staff who put them together. In the case of the Four Seasons, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually stock their bar fridges or cabinets. You have to pre-order what you would like. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a big fan of this approach as first, it obligates me to a buy at a high price. Second, I like to pick and choose randomly. No big one, but the service was not for me in this case. Brand new, initialled bath robes were beautifully boxed and placed at the end of the large (and super comfortable bed with big fluffy duvet and ample pillows of various size and shape to ensure a good sleep). The balcony was at a slight angle from the beach, rather facing in towards the hotel. So it was more like a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeach slighly askew front room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 than a true beach front. Lighting, centrally controlled thought out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c offered soft, medium and bright settings and either one appealed to whichever mood you were in. Yes, you can tell, I am being very picky here, as these guys had me scratching for negativity rather unsuccessfully\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. Damn\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Bathroom: In a word, massive, and not at the expense of the room size either, both were huge. A very large bath tub (no spa jets) with an equally large shower (perfect for two if you get my drift\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). The in-room music system was a very cool touch by the engineers. Basically you use two knobs, one for volume and one for your selection of music (classic rock, classical, jazz, contemporary, native\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6whatever) and it plays a surprisingly good mix of music in surround sound. Marble and wood finishings were heavy and well constructed, no expense was spared here, it was obvious. Water pressure fabulous, controls easy to work, an abundance of fresh/fluffy towels and a critique: I would never have used L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Occitane products in the hotels. Those who are familiar with the brand may like them. I find them pungent, over-creamy and lacking charm. A surprising choice by management as I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been surprised to find a signature brand like Bulgari in there (my favourite bath products). The food: Here is where we enter the danger zone. The food at this place was, hand on my heart, was ridiculously good. Incredible freshness of ingredients, amazing variety, prices on the expensive side but worth it. Truly worth it. If you want to enjoy fresh fish, salads, favourites like crab cakes, pizza, sandwiches, wraps, fresh juices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all there and it tastes divine. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a single bad meal, bar one, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get to. I personally cannot stand buffet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, breakfast buffet here though was never crowded and offered almost endless choice of fresh food. Pastries are baked fresh onsite and taste amazing, fruits are all freshly prepared, breakfast chefs make wonderful creations of omelettes, wafflings and pancakes. A few critiques though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c food at such a consistently high level spoils guests, why take the level down by using concentrated juices for table service and why use tea bags rather than fresh teas? Again, I am striving for negativity and failing to find it, yes, I am aware, I now look petty. Now, the bad meal. Wolgang Puck has a restaurant within the hotel and I have to say I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a big fan of his cooking. Particularly since he sold out with a chain of airport pizza restaurants, I mean, how can you maintain a solid credibility as a five star chef with such a monstrosity? If I were him, I would also disregard my aforementioned critique as I count my millions to be sure, however when you see the food quality at a key restaurant in the hotel as bad as it was, it does make you think that he has sold his standards down the river. We ordered (as we usually do) five or six different starters or mains to get a good sense of the menu. While the restaurant had a great bar (particularly for cocktails), excellent staff, an indulgent wine list, the food was simply over done in terms of subtlety of taste, texture and flavors. Way too many rich sauces and dressings for my liking. The italian restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFerraros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was incredibly good, as was the poolside restaurant. Overall, plenty to talk about here and a positive experience. Concierge: Almost to the point where they were excessively helpful. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing, sure. But I always left padding down my pockets to see if one of them hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mugged me while the other was charming me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6! Alas, they were on the up & up and I was pleasantly surprised by their knowledge of not only the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstandard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spots for tourists to go, but fanstastic local restaurants (in other words they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blindly guide you to their own and partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants which I appreciated) and creative things to do. Example: we wanted to do an island hop. That was our statement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to do an island hop and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (we were specific to say the least). Within around 20 minutes they had flights booked, rental cars arranged, an itinerary with directions prepared together with picnic baskets (complimentary) full of fresh turkey wraps, bottled water, diet coke and fresh fruit, all in a chilled bag \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very stylish, very classy service. Hat tip to them. P.s. All of the golfers out there will be very happy with their knowledge of local courses, pro shops, and instructors/professionals. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to get you the best tee off times and a shuttle to the courses which is complimentary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in short, golfer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paradise. Conclusion: For $850 per night for such an amazing room, with a jeep included in the rate, this place deserves to be number one on my list of places to go. I will be back as often as I can, this place has me completely sold and I would not contemplate staying anywhere else. Again, anyone who has read my previous reviews will be thinking I am on a prozac, zoloft, zanex cocktail and who knows I might be, but it would be thanks to this hotel. Great job. They also have fantastic poolside service, it is well thought out, efficient and makes relaxing in the sun easy. Another important point, while there are some families staying here, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the sense that it is a total zoo full of rampaging litte ones and rebellious teenagers. The hotel was very smart in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsegregating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 many of the areas kids like to go and to eat.

Microscopic soft sand, nice water, reef to snorkle - Free rentals for snorkles, boogie boards, unbrellas. Free water brought to you by the beach and pool. - Amazing foot massages by the pool, nice spa - Duo restourant is great - very tasty - we went back 3 times. Pricey though. - If you let them know you have a special occasion, champaigne and treats would be left in your room. - Notify the hotel you are bringing a kid, and you will get a toy, cookies and the child's name spelled out with spongy letters in the bathtub. Also, kids get tiny bathrobes too - so great. -Bathroom needs it's own review - HUGE! All marble, comfy bathtub, separate shower, amazing shampoo, soap. Even radio! I want one like this at home! Minor issues: - Spagos restourant - don't waste your money, go to Duo's. - I called in advance letting the hotel staff know that we are arriving at 12 PM so if possible to have a room ready for us then, not at the usual 3 PM check in time. They made us wait until 3 PM even though on the phone they said 12 would be fine. I had a 5 year old with me who needed to nap after early wake up and flight, so that was not good. I am sure they had rooms open, so I don't undrestand why not give us that perk. - Requests for upgrades are mostly declined, don't believe what you read on getting those easy. Not only us but others were declined several times. - This hotel is pretty expensive. - Pool cabanas are free but always taken - get them early or you will be sitting under the hot sun. - We had to get out of the water several times due to shark warnings. - Last day there the waives were huge - they covered my standing up 6ft husband with my 5 year old sitting on his shoulders - that's pretty high for a waive. - Maui itself is a bit boring if you like nightlife/shopping/great food - not much to do there.

At over $500 a night, you expect a reasonably good view of the ocean. Not here. Our balcony mostly overlooked the other rooms with a slice of the ocean. The resort is in a horseshoe shape, so most of the rooms have views of the other balconies. The only way to get a 180 degree, uninterrupted view is to shell out more than $2K a night. Sounds appropriate considering most of their top customers are the Hollywood types escaping here for weekend trips. The room itself wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressive. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was a tad staid with the usual tropical tapestry and cane furniture. The bed was not the most comfy, the space was tight, and the balcony seemed more Mumbai than Maui. The bathroom was spacious (big enough to be its own room) and nicely done in marble and gold fixtures, but expected. I wish they had incorporated more Hawaiian elements \u00e2\u20ac\u201c little details go a long way to show that thought was put into bringing the essence of the surroundings into the room. The Post Ranch Inn and Inn of the Anasazi both are fine examples. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot: The breakfast buffet at Duo was the best food and the best deal amongst all the restaurants. The ocean front cabanas, with the fantastic bar menu and poolside services, were the best part of the hotel and where you should spend most of your time. The views are pristine-- manicured lawns, white beach, blue water, and mountains in the distant. The snorkeling is superior right at the beach. In fact, it was better than Mokolini crater. The equipment is free, a nice little perk. You can rent Kayaks inexpensively which is a great little adventure without having to drive somewhere. Overall the property is stunning very well maintained. The lobby bar overlooking the ocean and pool has a great view, is the best place to relax at anytime (much better than spending time in your crummy balcony). What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not: Mostly the food was OK, including Spago. The pool and grounds are manicured and beautiful, but very much resemble Beverly Hills or many of the high-end properties along the California coast. There isnt too much Hawaii here. In fact, Hana Hotel, is the only place in Maui that captures the essense of the island. Our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cleaned until 4:00pm and when Vur threw a fit, we only got a box of six truffles. Lots of brand flaunting and bling, the pool area is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scene\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the low-key, private, vacationer, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re better off going to a secluded spot by the beach or staying somewhere else.

We arrived on December 9th for the first leg of our honeymoon for 6 nights. There was champaign waiting for us in our room. We had an ocean view prime room (room 689-had a great view of the courtyard, pool, and ocean and was one of the rooms closer to the ocean because some are set far back). The bathroom was amzing-very spacious with music and great bath products. The bed was very comfortable and the large flat screen tv was heaven. The balacony was nice. My only complaint would be that the decor could have been more Hawaiian but it was still lovely. They have a fridge which is open for you to fill and there are shops a mile down the road that has a great general store to fill up on waters and sodas and even wine and such. There was a great beach tote in the closet for you to use during youur stay. We actually decided to keep ours ($60 charge) as a memento. Room service was great and efficient. Maid service was a little slow on the first two days but I called and asked them to come earlier and they did for the rest of the trip. Laundry service was efficient but very expensive. The pool was nice but we wish it was bigger or maybe that they had more. The best part of the hotel is the lounge areas overlooking the ocean. It is absolutely amazing-you do need to get up somewhat early but we were jetlagged and were down before 7:30am every morning and had great spots to choose from. These spots are so private too! The best part is the service during the day. People come around with evian spritz, eucalyptus scented cold towels, fruits, and waters. There is a great ocean side jogging path that makes you want to work out every day. The beach was small due to a storm that washed most of it away so we did not lay out on the beach at all. The food at the hotel was great too. Duo was delicious but Spago was the best dinner we had in Hawaii hands down. We were reluctant to go because nothing on the menu was jumping at at us but everything was delicious and well worth the price. We did not eat at Ferraro' becuase they had alot of their meals on the room service menum(lobster Risotto was great!). Sansei was a great dinner about 10 minutes or less from the hotel-it was the best dessert we had and excellent sushi! I have heard that the Waterfront is great too and also Mama's Fish House. We did the 3 hour snorkling cruise from the Maui Prince Hotel and that was great- really fun crew although the snorkling was just ok. Swimming with Sea Turtles made it worth it though! The Road to Hana is a must- we did not think we were going to do it but we are glad we did- it is beautiful and you get great pictures. (The valet was great- when we said we were going to Hana they provided us with driving directions, towels and water bottles.) We only did about 16 miles of it because we did not want to drive at night- this is a very very windy road and you need to drive carefully through it. Hope this helps. IF we go back to Hawaii we would most likely try out the Big Island Four Seasons becuase we heard it is the best but this would be our second choice. We loved Maui. We went to the Hyatt in Kauai after this and I will write a review for that too.

We visited the Four Seasons as a first \"flight\" vacation with our 11 month old baby. The Four Seasons (4S) was unbelievable to us. They treated our infant son with such care and concern. He received a baby lei, toys at the front desk upon check in, cookies, milk and a book during our stay in the room, and toys by the pool. They baby proofed the entire room and bathroom and tub. They provided a diaper genie in our room's bathroom and in the public bathroom by the pool. The crib had a basket of diapers and swim diapers in it. There were also swim diapers by the pool. The pool attendants also provided free sunblock SPF 8, 15 and 30. The bathroom had all the necessary baby toiletries as well as the sponges that spelled his name. The poolside attendant provided a pack and play (play pen) every day in our cabana. Everything was included and complimentary. The restaurant by the adult pool \"Ferraros\" gave him building blocks to play with while we had lunch. I actually vacationed and read two books with a busy crawling baby! I could have never done all of that at another hotel. Yes they charge a lot, but boy do they take care of you - it is well worth it. The pool side salads are delicious and are served from Ferraros. The only disappointment we had (which leads me to give the hotel a 4 1/2 rating if I could) was the breakfast buffet at Duos. It is absolutely horrible compared to for example the Hyatt at Kanapali or any 4 star hotel which was very very disaapointing. We actually even went to Duos for Sunday Brunch - no different than a Holiday Inn! The food was left out in very small quantities. The cheese looked old, hardly an artisan bread assortment, fruit was sub standard, and not many choices at all. Not worth $35 for sure. I was shocked. We were invited to the Manager's cocktail mid week and attended. They served free wine, mai tais and delicious appetizers. We spoke to the property managers who were more than cordial and wanted feedback whatever it may be. many guests were present. It lasted half an hour. They want to please their guests which is refreshing. We walked over to the Grand Wailea property - quite trashy and the people all had tattoos. It looked like Disneyland with people just sprawled all over the place. Glad we did not stay there! The common walkway goes in both directions so it is a good work out in the mornings or evenings. There were beautiful private cabanas in between the beach and the pool at the hotel that had private steps and were enclosed between bushes. They are very romantic if you want o grab a bite from a neighborhood market and have a picnic at sunset! There was a Safeway very close to the hotel (7 min drive) so we were able to get sandwiches from the deli, baby food, water, etc.......... This is the perfect hotel for a romantic getaway or a family vacation. The babies have their own pool so they do not disturb those honeymooners.

Another recommendation, when making reservations for any of their restaurants ask for a quiet table. For some reason the hotel seems like Disneyland Hawaii. Families, babies and kids outnumbered the couples. It was hard to have a nice quiet romantic dinner with babies crying at the table next to you and kids playing with toys at another one. My stay ended 12/15 so it wasn't like Christmas time. I do have a glowing recommendation for the complimentary outrigger experience. Sign up for it.

The Ritz was under construction (it is on the Platinum fine hotels list) so we decided to try the 4 seasons. we paid for an ocean view room and the first room that we were shown had a sliver of an ocean view and was over the noisy road into the hotel. The only other room that we were told was available and that we settled for (825) was at the end of the courtyard and had an angled view of the ocean. The concerige level of the hotel was empty and they would do no better. An ocean view at an ocean resort is why I pay $1000/night - i don't expect to have to sit in the corner of the balcony and crane my neck to see the water! Another issue was with the housekeeping staff. They dont do the best cleaning job and they forgot to deliver the paper to the room and also forgot to bring the extra pillows that we requested.

The Beach Boys look after you by setting up a lounge chair and umbrella if you want. They also come around every so often and offer ice water and fruit slices to help you enjoy the beach even more. I am not much of a Beach dweller, but this was very enjoyable. The Restaurants are great. We had the best meal of the trip at Spago. The Waitress steered me away from one item and suggested a different dish... which turned out to be exquisite. Mac Nut crusted Mong Chong stuffed with Crab and Lobster. It was prepared perfectly and looked brilliant. The taste was amazing, great service and a nice decore made for a perfect evening. Breakfast each morning was a nice buffet on the patio overlooking the pool.

The Four Seasons Maui exemplifies the service that defines the Four Seasons brand. Between the valet, bellhop, waiters, and pool service, the staff at the hotel was some of the best I've ever encountered in any top hotel I've visited around the world. We reserved an Ocean View Prime Room. If you come to this hotel, just get the most basic view. We paid up for an Ocean View Prime room and we had such a limited view that we basically had to crane our necks to see the ocean. It's simply not worth it. Given the limited amount of time you spend in the room, facing the parking lot for $200 less would have been worth it. The room itself though, is fantastic. The bedroom is very comfortable and tons of little details that someone that appreciates luxury hotels would notice - alarm clock that plays your ipod, dvd player that can play your digital camera pictures, huge flat screen tv, massive bathroom (bigger than some NYC apartments), L'Occitane products, excellent coffee/tea maker (like a Nespresso but forgot the name), comfortable robes, etc. When we drank wine in the room and called for wine glasses, they asked us if we were drinking red or white wine so they could supply proper glasses. How thoughtful! The gym is really big, although not as impressive as the Four Seasons Hanalei. The cardio is outdoors so you have a much more interesting view than watching yourself in a mirror. Of course, every cardio machine has it's own tv. There are a few daily yoga and pilates classes (no charge, I believe) and lots of activities including dance lessons and canoe rides. I didn't partake in this, but the list of daily activities did make me realize that I actually didn't ever have to leave the hotel if I didn't want to. The pool is impressive in pictures, but chaotic in reality. There were kids everywhere (although many spend time in kids camp and the game room as well). By breakfast time, the pool chairs were all taken. And note that with all the beautiful palm trees, half the chairs are shaded in the morning, so chair location becomes even more competitive. I found this frustrating, but not unlike any other experience I've had at a big hotel. I personally don't like feeling jammed up like sardines around a pool, but found the beach to be incredibly windy after the late morning, making for an uncomfortable experience laying out. However, the pool staff worked hard to get us chairs in an area we were happy with and repeatedly came by to refill our water glasses and see if we needed anything. Again, Four Seasons service at the top of its game. The restaurants were very good for hotel restaurants, but not comparable to simply good NYC restaurants. I found the food incredibly overpriced and was surprised that all the restaurants used the same bread supplier (this reminds me of all-inclusive hotels that share the same kitchen for 3 different restaurants). The wine lists were vast but incredibly overpriced ($256 for a bottle of Heitz Cellars Cabernet..retails around $45). I heard really good things about Spago. Maybe we went to late (7:30 or 8pm), but we were not impressed. It took about 30 minutes to take our order, another 30 minutes for the appetizer, and probably 30-45 minutes after the appetizer to get the entree. My mahi-mahi may have been good right out of the oven, but tasted a bit dry when it came to me. My husband felt the same about his $60 lamb. The Thanksgiving day buffet at Duo was actually excellent and well worth the fixed price. We spent a good 2-3 hours doing small courses of everything they had to offer and enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine recommended by the sommelier. The concierge was incredibly helpful in recommending restaurants and activities. All in, we had a really nice stay at the Four Seasons Maui. If you like large hotels with lots of activities and excellent service, this hotel is for you. If you're looking to go on your honeymoon and want some R&R, I would recommend Kauai and Big Island (or Lanai, but I've never been there) instead of Maui.

The service was not great. We ordered room service once that never arrived. We rented a car that was dirty when we picked it up.

I had booked a \"Full Ocean View\" room (the 2nd most expensive normal sized rooms) and upon arrival was informed I had been upgraded to a Suite. Upon entering the Suite, it had no view and was right next to the Hotel's utility area and a parking lot. It was ridiculously noisy and this problem is faced by almost all the rooms on the 'outside' of the hotel's northern wing. I asked reception to give me back my original room class, only to be told no such room was available. Hence the reason for my \"upgrade\" was clear. They then tried to upsell me an even more expensive room. I was not impressed and was finally given my original \"Full Ocean View room\" after several hours wait, only to find the \"full ocean view\" is a slant of blue through a tunnel of buildings and other impediments. Clearly not worth $700. Other brief comments: Positives: rooms were spacious and comfortable, restaraunts were good, generally well maintained and recently renovated.

My husband and I just returned last week after spending 11 nights at this resort. We chose this resort because the hotel choices are limited if you want to stay in south Maui (Wailea). We also felt it is our only option for a quiet resort without a lot of kids. Here are my positive and negative views on this resort. Negative \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Resort: None of their rooms have a great view of the ocean, unless you pay $2K plus per night for one of their ocean front suites. We paid almost $800 per night for an Ocean View Premium\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6$800 is the off-season special rate. From our room the ocean can only be viewed slightly at an angle. The grounds are not that nice for a resort of this caliber. Not enough tropical lush, too much of straight/clean lines for Hawaii. Lobby and surrounding areas inside the hotel does not have a Hawaiian feel, very little tropical flower arrangements and plants displayed. I feel the same as the previous reviewer - it feels more L.A. rather than Hawaii. Valet parking at $14 a day is outrageous. Other resorts offer the option to self -park or valet: this place forces you to valet and charges you for it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about the principle!! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost as extreme as airlines charging you for the use their dirty blankets. Food: We had dinner at DUO on the first night because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to drive after the long flight. It expensive for just okay food. There are so many wonderful restaurants around the area for dinner. If you love fresh sushi then \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSansei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Kihei is a must!! Reservation is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recommended, they are very busy. Another must is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6A+++! You will wonder why you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve wasted your money at DUO or Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. For lunch we did eat at Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s everyday. There are not a lot of options if you want to sit down for lunch and the convenience of not having to leave the resort. Lunch for the two of us each day averaged $75 including gratuity. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why all the fuss about their breakfast buffet, it is very standard. The croissants (butter and chocolate) are dry, not moist like any standard croissants you can get anywhere else. Maid Service: The first day we returned to our room about 4:00 p.m., the room had not been cleaned. I then called maid service and arranged for our room to be clean at 12:00 p.m. and turn down at 7:30 p.m. Yes, our room was cleaned when we usually returned at 4:00 p.m. However, almost everyday they would bang on our door before 7:30 p.m. for turn-down service, which got really annoying after we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve told them several times that we had arranged for 7:30 p.m. Also, a couple of times they gave us \u00e2\u20ac\u0153USED\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shampoo: how cheap and cheesy is that!!! Service: Most of the pool attendants are nice and helpful, but some make it obvious that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only helpful if tips are given. Tips are given only after good service has been rendered\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not before, come on people! The front desk check in/out girls (yes, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re nothing more than a receptionist) are snooty. I put up with this type of behavior at some of the lesser grade hotels\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but not at the Four Seasons! Positive - Beach is beautiful. The workout facility is nice because the machines are set in an open lanai, not in a confined room. Bathroom in the rooms are larger than most hotels. We also spend 11 nights last year on the Big Island at the Fairmount Hotel. The Fairmount is a much nicer place. The secluded beach they have is so spectacular. Rumor is that the St. Regis will be opening soon in Kauai, we will try it next time if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true.

I am hard pressed to think of negative things to say about the resort, but since the point of this site is to help other travelers make important decisions, I am going to try to list both the good and the \"bad.\" I will also try not to repeat a lot of the things that you already know about the Four Seasons Maui. First, some perspective: My wife and I are in our early 30s, late 20s, and we were here for our 1st anniversary. In the past year, we have stayed at the Peter Island resort in the Caribbean (which is in many ways still our favorite place) and the Four Seasons Hualalai. With that as a backdrop, here goes: ROOM: We had an Ocean View room. The hotel was at 100% occupancy while we were there -- a little bit odd for October, I would have thought, but maybe that was because there was a large wedding occurring at the hotel. The room had a nice view. Yes, it is an angled view and yes, it is a bit further from the ocean than some hotels, and no, I don't think it is worth paying a lot extra for. (Luckily, we had booked Garden View and got upgraded to Ocean, but it's really not that big of a deal). The room was beautiful, large, clean, elegant, and had no offensive odors. Our room was on the 6th floor and overlooked the crocquet lawn. As you may have read in other reviews, there is a dorm-sized refrigerator in the room, and you can either have the hotel stock it for you or buy things on your own. The bathroom is large and luxurious, and the overall feeling you get from the room makes you feel like the money you're spending is well worth it. Should you pay extra for the view? Only you can answer this question, but in general, I would say No. Here's why. If you don't care about the view, then why pay extra? And if you do care about the view, then there's a good chance that the views here will fall a little bit short of your expectations. I would probably avoid the mountainside rooms unless you're doing the mountainside package, but we'll book the Garden View next time and not think twice. The Club Level might be an option if you are staying on side 90% of the time, but we wouldn't have wanted to go back and forth from the Club Level to the pool, etc. POOL/BEACH: As you can tell from all the pictures you've probably seen, both the pool(s) and beach are stunning. Both are great places to relax, although they are very different. The pool is more of a \"scene,\" while the beach is less crowded and a bit more family oriented (but still great for couples). My #1 concern heading to the hotel was over the pool/beach chair situation, so let me address that. I was very pleasantly surprised by the availability of chairs. It is always easy to get a good spot on the beach. You may end up in the 2nd row of chairs/cabanas, but you'll still have a good spot. As far as the pool is concerned, here's how I would rate chair/cabana availability: 7am: Just about anything you want, including the most prime cabanas overlooking the ocean 8am: Maybe a few prime cabanas remain, the best chairs (without cabanas) all remain, and several very good pool cabanas remain. 9am: Most of the best cabanas are gone, still a few by the pool available, and still several prime chairs still available. 10am: Not much left other than scattered chairs. Coming from the East Coast, we never had a problem getting something in the 8-9am range, but I paid attention throughout the rest of the day because I had worried about it so much prior to the trip. Do I think they do a good job enforcing the 20 minute rule? No. Saw lots of people reserve spots and then head to breakfast for an hour...but at least when this was occurring there were still plenty of spots for everyone else. Seems like they enforce the policy a little more at the 10-11am range. Bottom line, if you want one of the best spots, then yeah, it's going to be a competition. If you'll be happy with a \"good\" to \"ok\" spot, you have nothing to worry about. The pool/beach service was nice, although slower and not as attentive as I would have thought. We enjoyed lots of water, pineapple, Evian spritzes, and cold towels, but it was often hard to place a food or drink order, and when you did, there was quite a wait. The hotel has an LA feel to it, especially around the pool. I'm not saying this is either a good thing or a bad thing, but it's there. One last thing. When you check in, you get a map of the property. On the map, it shows an area called \"Adult Pool Site.\" I had heard that they were going to put an adult pool in at some point, and it looks like they are, but I couldn't get anyone to tell me when. Pay attention to this b/c you might not want to be there during the construction, but it will be great when it's finished. FOOD: Food was no better than OK, which I think is pretty typical of Four Seasons. Our dinner at DUO was worth the money, but was not exceptional or overly special. Do not order the potato \"spuddies\" -- although they have a cute name, you can do without them. I was pleasantly surprised with Spago, after having heard mixed reviews. It was expensive, but very good, and I think they give hotel guests the best tables. Poolside food was OK. The selection was maybe a little bit more gourmet than we would have wanted, but that's partially my fault -- I could have ordered a burger and didn't. We didn't eat any other major meals onsite, instead opting for Mama's Fish House, Longhi's and Roy's. I recommend all 3 of those places, in that order. My wife and I really enjoyed the Lobby Bar, which has a great hostess named Melissa. Our favorite drink was called the \"Lush.\" I highly recommend either this or a lava flow. PRICES: Our dinners at DUO and Spago were about $250 each, including cocktails (2), appetizers (2), entrees (2) and one bottle of wine. Although it's hard to spend that on dinner where we live, I felt like it was decent value there. Cocktails run from $12-16, beers from $5-7, and lunch entrees from $18-25. KIDS: Everyone wants to know whether there were a lot of kids or was the hotel kid-friendly. First, every child I saw at the hotel was very well-behaved. I don't have kids yet, so I don't know anything about what kids want or need, but in my opinion, kids CAN be happy here BUT it is far from the best hotel to take kids to. The kids at the Grand Wailea seemed to be enjoying themselves a lot more than the ones at the Four Seasons, and why not -- there's tons more for kids to do at the Grand Wailea. So if you're planning this trip primarily for your kids, maybe look elsewhere. If you're planning it for yourselves first and foremost, kids will do OK, but would probably have more fun on the beach. My wife and I will return to this hotel some day, but I'm not sure it would be our choice if we have kids at the time. All in all, we loved the hotel. We didn't love the food, but it was more than adequate. I just wouldn't plan to eat all of my meals on site if I were you. The valet was always prompt with the car, and I would always call down in advance. The entire staff -- with zero exceptions -- was very welcoming and accommodating.

The food service was very attentive and present when we wanted to order and when we just wanted water. The beach was perfect! The guys who set up the chairs were very friendly. The sand was very soft and the snorkeling was good. We saw turtles, huge fish, eels (scary), and lots of other fish. I would highly recommend doing the outrigger - a truly unique experience. The only down side would be the spa. The massages that we both got seemed adequate at best. The layout of the spa was very confusing. The locker room attendant was non-existent and you had to walk back through the check-in area to get to the relaxation area. It would be better if you could go directly from the locker room to the relaxation room. The hotel - 3 stars. I fully admit that this review is my fault. I booked the mountainview package which included a car and breakfast. The room as really great - large, wonderfully decorated, elegant. The bathroom was huge and exactly what you expect from the Four Season. My major issue - the lanai. You really cannot use the mountainside lanais. The noise from the air conditioner and the road are not acceptable. The Four Seasons should warn people when they book the this category. If you put me on this balcony before this experience and told me to guess the hotel, the Four Seasons would be my last guess. The back of hotel is too close the road. The management of the hotel, especially Amy, really tried to make us happy. She should be commended on her service. Food mentions - the breakfast was amazing! I would not have ordered the buffet otherwise, but I'm really glad I had a chance to try all of it. Ferraro's was good. The setting and service was amazing! The food was good, but great, and overpriced. The fish was overcooked and the risotto was a bit starchy. Being from NYC, you expect great food for those prices. A special mention for the lobby bar - the food and service were better than expected. Overall, the Four Season is a great set of hotels. As I've read, Maui was the first resort of the chain.

Perhaps my expectations were too high after reading so many reviewers touting \"perfection\". We found the property to be very lovely with an excellent location! The valets and front desk staff were very pleasant. The rooms are well-appointed and the bathroom is spacious. The first night we opted for room service, which turned out okay for my husband. Unfortunately, I ended up with the worst seafood pasta dish of my life...no exaggeration. Keep in mind that I am not a whiner, and was too tired to call and complain. That evening, we let housekeeping know that we didn't need turn-down service, as we would be going to bed early after our long trip. Within an hour, someone was entering our room after we had just fallen asleep. We started the next day with a wonderful breakfast buffet and excellent poolside service. The beach here is the BEST I've experienced in the Hawaiian islands, and we've been to all of them. This is the main reason for my above average rating of the property. Our last day on Maui was spent sightseeing. Returning to the hotel, we wanted to relax by the water with some food and drinks, and watch the sun go down. After tipping a pool attendant to set up our chairs an hour before pool service ended, we asked to place an order. She gave us a menu and never came back. Overall, it was a nice weekend...I would still recommend this property. Our experience just shows that it's impossible to be perfect 100% of the time.

We had a partial ocean view room and it was perfect. We had a nice view of the croquet court and the ocean behind it. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was amazing - huge, great L'Occitaine products, music. The pool and beach areas were beautiful. Get up early to reserve a cabana with a nice view. We never had a problem getting one and one of the staff will set it all up for you, plus some lounge chairs in the sun. We ate at all of their restaurants and liked them all, especially Duo their new steak house. The drinks in the Lobby Lounge were very good as were the little snacks. Since breakfast a la cart is pretty expensive, it's worth getting the buffet. The only downside is the expense. We spent a small fortune on food, but there is a little beach snack shop where you can get a bagel or a muffin and some reasonably priced sandwiches for lunch. You can also head over to the Fairmount [in a complementary chauffered car], which has good restaurants but are pricey as well. But, if you are looking to live it up on your honeymoon and willing to spend the money, this is the place to do it. Some food aside, you will feel it's worth every penny. And the room cost covers everything other than food so you don't feel like you're being nickeled and dimed (beach chairs, cabanas, umbrellas are free).

From the valet people to the beach attendants, this one of the very few places I've been where I actually wanted to tip generously because they were actually earning it. The hotel is clean and up to date, I believe it was just renovated before our arrival. Stayed in a room that overlooked the driveway/putting green but still had an ocean view (no beach view though). Room had large plasma tv, DVD player (with memory card reader to look at photos), 3 phones, sitting area, mini-bar area, large bathroom with soaking tub and separate glass shower, big closet and large balcony. Only three complaints with the room... The cordless phone didn't work and the HD TV channels only half worked. The worst problem though, was the noise of people opening and closing their balcony shutters and doors above and below us. It sounds like a freight train was going by outside every time someone would move them. The pool area is very nice, with cabanas for all guests available. They have complimentary water, pineapple slices and various other nice stuff to keep you comfortable in the sun. The beach is very quiet here, most people retreat to the pool by the afternoon. Also, the beach chairs, umbrellas and canopies are set up for you by the attendant which was very nice. The drinks and food are as expensive as you would expect for a hotel at this level. Quality of food and drinks was excellent though. Ate at Ferraro's one night, and the food and service were excellent. Make your reservation well in advance if you want a good view of the ocean. Compared to Kaanapali, this part of Wailea felt very quiet and out of the way.

The Resort: This property will literally take your breath away when you view it for the first time. It is akin to a beach palace that I envision a monarch would own. The grounds are perfectly manicured, the decoration opulent, the structures flawless. The pools, spas, and water features are glorious. The Fitness Center and Spa is half inside and half outside in the luscious greenery and are well equipped. The rooms are expansive and have been updated with wireless internet and flat panel TVs. The L'Occitane toiletries are fantastic. Do not even for a second think the Fairmount or Grand Wailea (neighbors) are even close to this place. While they too are nice, this resort is leaps and bounds better. The Service: This was actually lacking, given the audacious pricing for our wedding and stay. The housecleaning service sometimes never came, came late, or did terrible jobs. We complained and the manager was not very accommodating. Given the enormous amount of money we were dropping on this trip, I would have expected much more. The service by the pool is another story. Here, they bring by all kinds of goodies. Including: free Evian Misters, free fresh fruit, free snacks, free otter pops, any food order you want, massages, beverages, etc. The Wedding: Our wedding was flawless. My wife and I did very little planning, 50 guests, and the ladies who run their wedding department do a splendid job. I seriously can not imagine a more perfect picturesque setting for a wedding. They moved us to the oceanfront lawn and it was spectacular. The food was delicious, the servers/bartenders were great, and the people they use for video and photo are incredible. Our DJ actually does Oprah's parties. If anyone is getting married here or thinking about it in the near future, pm me and I will gladly give you some more inside information. Finally, this place is a celeb hangout. While we were there, we saw, Claire Danes and her brit boyfriend, William Hurt, Meg Ryan, Luke Wilson, Matt Damon and his wife and their kid, and the president from the show 24. In sum, this is a magnificent place, that, if you can squeeze it, is worth the money. It will be a unforgettable place.

We could see the ocean in the distance and manicured grassy areas in the foreground. We loved lounging by the pool in a cabana getting delicious lunches and cool drinks delivered to us. We also dined at Spago one night and Ferraro's on several occassions, as well as in our room through room service. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and my husband still compares all other hotel breakfasts to the Four Seasons'. All restaurants and food were excellent. The service was wonderful. The valet always was available to give directions, provide water and towels, and inquire about our outings. The concierge also made reservations for us at Mama's Fish House and gave us directions to Haleakala and Lahaina for the luau. The spa was lovely. Our oceanside couples' massage was not possible due to construction noise (not horrible, but too noisy for a massage) and we got a couples' massage indoors instead. The couples' massage was complimentary since it had to be done indoors--- to our surprise when we went to provide our room number to settle the bill. The spa relaxation area, shop, and locker-room are all top notch and I have had a hard time finding any spas in the Washington, DC, area that compare. We were there during the October 06 earthquake. The emergency system wasn't so great as they only started to test the loudspeakers about 15 minutes after the earthquake, so we had to rely on calls to the probably swamped front desk for updates since our power was out. (This is in comparison to the Halekulani on Waikiki, where we recently stayed, where apparently at the threat of a fire, the fire alarm immediately sounded and a recorded message in both English and Japanese followed). The power was ourt only for a few hours after the earthquake but our outgoing flight was cancelled, so we enjoyed the Four Seasons for an extra two nights - not complimentary- but even the Four Seasons can't control earthquakes!

We had noted that the trip was for our 10th anniversary when we booked it and had a bottle of champagne and a card from the manager waiting for us upon arrival. Our renovated room exceeded all of our expectations. The plasma TV, DVD player, sound system in the bathroom, clock with a docking station for our ipod were all fantastic. So was the view out our windows of the garden. I had a massage and facial at the spa one morning while my husband did a free snorkeling lesson at the pool and then an additional excursion out in the ocean. The spa is defintiely worth a visit. The snorkeling excursion was great. For an extra charge, the guide provided a CD with pictures and video from the dive. We also enjoyed the complimentary introductory tennis lesson with the tennis pro, Collin. He did a great job helping us learn how to play. On the advice of several others, we stopped at Wal-Mart on the way in from the airport and picked up soft drinks, bottled waters, and food for breakfast and lunch. The refrigerator in our room was empty, so we had plenty of room to store the food. We did not eat all our meals in the room, but eating a few there certainly helped out. Next time, we would probably stop at the Safeway a little closer to the hotel to get a better food selection. The hotel staff really take care of everything for you from setting up your beach chairs to providing bottled waters and beach towels for trips off site.

The property recently completed a major renovation and has all the bells and whistles. State of the art everything, 50in plasma w/HD in the room, fitness room and spa facilities are simply amazing.

It feels exclusive, the food is good, and most of the staff is eager to please. For a number of reasons, however, my wife and I did not enjoy our stay here, and we will not return. Some of the problems that we had were not the Resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, like the size of the pool and the beach. And perhaps we became biased after we found feces (someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) on our room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toilet seat on our first night. But for the price we paid and the reputation that this Resort enjoys, we thought that too many problems were, in fact, the Resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault. First, the positives. The food was very good. We had breakfast at Duo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s once, and lunch at the restaurant by the pool two or three times. We would have eaten at Spago, but were unable to make a same-day reservation. Plan ahead if you want to eat there. We also attended a wedding at the resort, along with a reception at the Resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banquet facilities. Each time the food was excellently prepared and delicious. Perhaps the prices were on the expensive side, but certainly not outside the range of comparable restaurants that we visited on Maui and Kauai. Other positives? Our room (mountain view double) was very quiet and well furnished. NYT and WSJ newspapers were readily available for no charge. Outrigger program was great fun. And judging from the number of kids that were there (90% of whom were very well-behaved) and the number of kid-friendly activities the Resort advertises, the Resort could be a good choice for families. On to the negatives. Our visit got off to a bad start when, after a full day of flying from the East Coast, we check in, get to our room, and find feces on the toilet seat in our bathroom. Absolutely gross. Called Housekeeping, and the good news was that they did come within 10 minutes (although 10 mins feels like forever when you have to use the facilities!). The bad news was that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do a very good job, and my wife ended up cleaning the toilet again herself after they left. We also found the closet doors in the room to be dirty, and found several notes/items that the previous guests left behind when we were unpacking our things. We informed Housekeeping of our disappointment, and they promised to do a thorough cleaning the next day. Turned out to not be very thorough, as the doors were still dirty for the rest of our visit. The Resort sent us a small box of chocolates as an apology, but when poop is involved, I expect a more significant remedy. We also had a problem with the Resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concierge. We booked the Molokini snorkel trip that leaves out of the Maui Prince Hotel (great trip - highly recommended because you get there first in the a.m.). We asked the concierge the day before the trip to book us a taxi to bring us there, but the concierge told us that the Resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shuttle would be able to get us there with no problem. Great, we thought. However, we show up back at the concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk the next morning, and they tell us that the shuttle isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t running yet and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to call us a taxi. We almost missed the trip. It would have been nice if the concierge had offered to pay for the taxi trip (they said it would only be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a couple of dollars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the ride; ended up being $20 each way), but that never happened. Other minor problems were being brought the wrong drinks at the restaurant by the pool (but being told they were the right ones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bill proved us right, though), and I also thought that the two ladies at Snorkels (the beachside caf\u00c3\u00a9/gift shop) were condescending and prickly. Also, be aware that the property is quite small for the number of rooms it has. This means that when the Resort is full (as it was while we were there), it really feels full. Prime seats by the pool were gone by 8am, and if you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the beach by 10am you were sitting behind two rows of other people. Second, and I know this sounds silly, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really feel like I was in Hawaii at this Resort. Just looking at the rooms, the lobby, the restaurants, the cramped pool area and the cookie-cutter concrete buildings, this Resort could have easily been in Miami, Las Vegas (minus the beach, of course), or L.A. Very little sense of any sort of Hawaiian or other exotic culture. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning your honeymoon, PLEASE do me a favor and at least consider French Polynesia. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much more exotic, less crowded, more exclusive and more beautiful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a couple more hours travel time, and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re already considering the Four Seasons, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the same price range. Staying in an overwater bungalow is an unforgettable experience; you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t regret it. Back to the Four Seasons. The beach in front of the Resort was nice, but also had its share of issues. Being small, expect to be right on top of people on your right and left. Not very relaxing, especially when a family decides to play bocce right next to your chairs. The beach attendants wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let us move our chairs to get away from people (when we did they just moved them back when we went in the water), and by late morning there is nowhere left to go anyway. Also be aware that beaches are public property everywhere in Hawaii, and the beach in front of the resort is very popular with other tourists and locals. Public access to beaches is a wonderful thing, but part of me was annoyed when a big family plopped down right in front of us. Another problem with the beach (at least in summer) is that by 2:00 p.m. the winds start to blow pretty hard. Sand gets blown into your face and you are pretty much forced to retreat to the pool. Of course there are no seats left by the pool because everyone is doing the same thing, so you end up sitting in your room. If you have a mountain view (aka parking lot view) room as we did, it sucks. It was too hot (no breeze here) and too noisy from the giant air conditioning vents to sit on our small balcony, so we were stuck inside our room. Looking back, we should have either sprung for an oceanview room or rented a car and driven around in the afternoon. Not a lot to see close by, but it would have been better than sitting in our room every afternoon until dinner. Apologies for the length of this review, but I hope you find it helpful. Bottom line: if you get an oceanview room, if you like being part of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the scene\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind crowds, if you are looking for a relaxing time without having to experience much of any culture, if you get excited by turn-down service and people who call you by name, and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lucky, then you will probably enjoy this Resort. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re like us, though, I would recommend staying somewhere else. We visited the Grand Hyatt on Kauai during our trip, and they seemed to get it right. Much larger property, but beautiful facilities and beach, and much more traditional Hawaiian atmosphere. We also much preferred the Ritz Carlton on Grand Cayman for a relaxing beach holiday, if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for. And French Polynesia (check out Manihi) can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat for an ultra-romantic honeymoon destination. In any event, good luck!", "Date": "August 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFour Seasons , incredible as expected\u201d", "Author": "BrentD", "ReviewID": "UR8429734", "Content": "Where to start? As others mentioned, we were greeted immediatly by a hotel guest greeter, and whisked us off to the front desk, along with smiles, leis and lemon water. (taxi from OGG to hotel about $60). Once they asked your last name, you will be called this by everyone. Owning my own business, I can say remembering names is a great attribute, but to remember names on an ever changing rotation of guests......impressive. Our room was on the mountain side. It was very nice, marble bath, super ammenities as mini bar, coffee maker, safe, iron, dial up choice music, phones in bath, shower and seperate tub, on and on. The bed was so comfortable, along with 2 maid services daily. On this being our honeymoon, a bottle of champagne was waiting for us upon our entry. Nice touch! Also plasma and about 60 channels, along with an ipod station. The grounds were immaculate.Breath taking. Pool area has a huge pool with opposite jacuzzis,one for adults and kids.Also a kiddy area. There were a fair amount of children here, most well behaved. The children seemed to stay close to their parents, hence about 30 percent of pool patrons are kids from 1 to 15. There are about 40 cabanas surrounding the pool, with then about 100 lounge chairs with covers etc. If you want a cabana, I HIGHLY suggest getting to the pool area before 8 am. The pool staff will start to come out at 7, and at that time you can have your cabana made.They have a 20 minute rule, that is if you leave and are gone over 20 minutes(except between 11 and 2 for lunch), you run the risk of losing your spot. I never saw this enforced my whole 6 days. I usually was up by 6:30(due to my body time zone change), was at the pool cabanas by 7, reading a book, awaiting for a pool attendant. They will come by frequently with lemon water, Evian water sprays, cold towels, popsicles, and will get you anything you askthroughout the day. We opted for a bottle of champagne daily, and was there waiting for us by the 4th day. Service here is the best. Always smiling, talking to you, and overall feel that they were there for you. Great poolside food, drinks etc. If you wanted to sit all day, you could, as all can be brought to you. Wife had a poolside foot massage and loved it. There is a massage menu for pool side. Had dinner 1st at Spago. Had asked 2 weeks in advance for a table as close to the rail as possible for the sunset/honeymoon dinner, but was given a table on that level, but 30 feet from where I had requested. being jet lagged, and not to be bothersome, we ate, and still had a wonderful time. Food at Spago, Duo, or Ferraros will set you back an easy $200 plus nightly for 2. Martinis throughout the resort are about $17, and beers run $7. It is the Four Seasons, and didn't mind the price because the service matched the price. Was offered a ride to the shops down the road by the valet staff. There are your share of shops, such as in Rome, Venice, NY, like Gucci, Tiffanys, etc....saw no Prada. Had dinner at Tommy Bahamas. Great dinner, nice bar, dinner for 2 was around $160 including drinks. Average plate 30-40 dollars. At night we would watch the ocean, have a cigar and martini, then drift off to bed awaiting the next days adventures.Breakfast is a wonderful buffet. We ate there each day. Buffett runs $37.00 per person. We did snorkle 1 day. You can get the gear at \" Snorkels\" a beach store, 1 hour is free, every hour after is $5. Also, serve as a small deli shop. Drinks, sodas, turkey sandwiches, ect... Over all great time. Was there for 6 nights, ate out days and nights, and spent approx a thousand a day. $500 for the room ,and $500 for lunches, drinks and dinner. I feel it was a great value, and must say Ashley at the poolside cabanas was so nice. Leon, Kevin and Dave were always on the top of their game. Thanks. Would I stay there again? Without a doubt!!

Our room was modern, tastefully decorated and in a superb location within the resort. Everything we could possible need in our room was at hand. The first night we treated ourselves to in-room dining which was superb and well worth every cent. We had dinner at Duo's which was nice but we loved Ferraro's for lunch and dinner. We dined there often. The crab cakes were to die for! We also had a massage and scrub at the Spa which was heavenly. It was also sweet, although a complete 'its a small world' coincidence, that my husband's masseuse originated from a town about 20 mins from our home town in England. Yes, the Four Seasons is expensive but then so is every hotel along Wailea. I begrudged paying more for a room at the Fairmont that was far inferior to the one that we stayed in at the Four Seasons.

The bathroom was incredible! It was so huge, like a room in itself! And the room is very modernized with a big plasma tv and dvd player and an ipod speaker system! The view wasn't so great, but we didn't complain about it. I'm sure if we had we could have been moved... We paid for garden view, but really we had a view of the service path (constant hotel workers walking back and forth) and a chain link fence, covered in shrubbery... not really a \"garden view\". But we weren't really sitting out on the balcony anyway, so it didn't matter too much. We loved the turn down service too. Whenever we came back from the dinner the room was all ready for a cozy night! Parking is valet (no choice), but really reasonable! I was quite surprised actually - $14 a night for valet is great!! The concierge desk is amazing! Wow! Make sure to make use of them! They have driving directions on little pieces of paper, for every attraction/area in Maui, so ask for them when you head out! Plus if you're doing the road to Hana, ask them for their info. They put together this super package of the best places to stop and great details as to what's there, complete with photos. This together with the Road to Hana CD that we bought at the Shell Station, made for the best, most comprehensive guide for the road to Hana! I agree, get the bed and breakfast package when you book! It's a great value! We paid $30 a day more for the package. If we had just paid to eat the breakfast buffet it would have been $73 a day for the two of us! The breakfast buffet is amazing by the way! And they are super great with letting you take extras with you! We usually asked for a to-go cup to take come juice with us, and this was never a problem. I also usually grabbed an extra danish for later. On our Road to Hana day we asked for the whole breakfast to go as we were off for this drive and they quickly supplied us with 5 to-go containers, and to-go cups and even sent bottled water with us! This was super! The beach was great too! They set up chairs for you on the beach (no additional charge) and bring you cold water to drink! The snorkelling was super in front of the hotel - although you have to out a ways, to the reefs, and go in the morning before the waves pick up! In addition to many fish, we also saw a sea turtle sooooo close up!! It was amazing! But ask the concierge again too for some other great snorkelling places. They sent us to one bay that was absolutely amazing too - sooo many fish there, in shallow water, so you could get really close up!! The games room is super here too! Great for kids, and adults! We enjoyed nightly games of pool and table shuffle board! There are also two computer stations there where you can use the internet for free.

Maybe the hype and the five star rating made us expect more but we did not have a five star stay. First, let me say the room was very nice although our room overlooked the parking area and the air-conditioning unit for the entire hotel. This created a constant noise which could have been very disturbing from the patio. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us much. The bathroom was very large and the entire room was spotless as were all the grounds. The pool was also very nice and we never had a problem in getting a cabana, which are free (nice touch). The beach is very nice although, no fault of the hotel, we were unable to swim there until the last day of our trip due to jellyfish and rough currents. The valets are great and always ready to help with towels, bottles of water and directions. Additionally, the food is very good although VERY expensive. On the other hand, being early risers, we tend to get out of the hotel early and are back by 4-5 PM. On the first day our room was not cleaned by our return at 5 (after being out of the room all day). We spoke to the front desk and housekeeping who assured us that they would clean our room earlier the next day. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Our room was not cleaned by 5 the next day. Additionally, we had room service glasses at our door for 3 days. Finally, we had asked for tea service in the room instead of coffee service. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide this until we asked a second time. We meet with the assistant manager about our problem and they were corrected along with a free dinner. Also, he wrote us a personal note of apology and had the floor of the room sprinkled with flower petals and sent chocolates (very impressive and respectful). But we still had to ask to have our tea service refilled every day. These are little things but for these rates and with a five star rating they don't seem unreasonable. All-in-all a very nice hotel but not five star and if you expect perfection (at these prices you should) this is not it. We had read that the staff gets to know your name and addresses you that way.

To sum up, I would really recommend this hotel for honeymooners who would like to splash out!", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas, USA", "Title": "\u201cMixed Review\u201d", "Author": "kstraveler79", "ReviewID": "UR8057598", "Content": "My new husband and stayed at the Four Seasons for part of our honeymoon from June 17-June 27. We were looking forward to a wonderful experience, and we were somewhat disappointed. Here are my opinions, both good and bad... Positive: My husband and I loved the interior of the room. We stayed in an executive suite and the room was very luxurious. As other reviewers have mentioned, the bathrooms were huge and the rooms were very clean. The staff was exceptionally friendly, especially the valet staff and the room service staff. We enjoyed, and took advantage of, the beachfront cabanas most every day we were there. The extras like that water, towels, fruit, etc. were great after a hot day on Maui! I still cannot believe those cabanas were free. However, I advise getting there by 9:00 am or earlier to get a good spot. Negative: The biggest negative we had, which nearly ruined our vacation, was that we were placed in a suite directly above the resort's loading dock! Every morning, starting at 6:00 am, you could hear the large trucks rumbling up, the \"beep beep\" as they reversed, and cargo being offloaded...it was impossible to sleep after that point. Also, there seems to be absolutely no soundproofing to these rooms. Finally, it was a \"partial oceanview\" but you had to crane your neck to see a bit of the ocean. Now I know they get a lot of honeymooners, but why would you put them in a suite above a loading dock???? I complained several times, only to be told \"our hotel is full, we will call you if anything opens up\". They finally called us to let us know we could downgrade to a regular room. I explained we had pre-paid this vacation through a tour company. Finally, the woman at the front desk (who was very nice) went back to the GM (who wouldn't even come out to talk with us) and let us know he would give us a food and beverage credit for the stay. I did appreciate this, and that kept us from giving the hotel a one star. It just upsets me that I ended up being exhausted most of the time I was there. My only other complaint was the food. Don't get me wrong, the quality was wonderful, but there were only three main restaurants on property. I agree with another reviewer; it would have been nice to have a beach bar with hotdogs, or sandwiches, etc. They did have a menu you could order from, if you were sitting at the pool, but it was limited, and expensive. After we left the Four Seasons, we stayed for four nights at the Hyatt on Kauai. I have to say that was one of the most wonderful hotels we have ever stayed at. It was gorgeous. No, the rooms weren't as nice, but the variety of food (and food prices), the spectacular grounds, the number and size of pools, and the number of restaurants made us regret we stayed at the Four Seasons for so long. I know I am one of the only ones on this board to give the Four Seasons a mixed review, but this is my honest opinion!!", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cExceptional Service\u201d", "Author": "NoWareMan", "ReviewID": "UR8002746", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Four Seasons a few years ago so this review is a bit tardy. The Four Season on Maui is what one would expect out of a Four Seasons. Superb, friendly and helpful staff. Graciously appointed and clean rooms. The grounds were well maintained, and the on site restaurants were above average. We ate at DUO? every morning and the buffet was impressive...made to order omelets, pancakes, waffles, etc. I highly recommend Ferraro's for dinner, and at most for drinks, olives, and nuts at the bar. The private cabanas down towards the beach provided a real sense of privacy along with regular, but not too regular, service for drinks and food. If I had to list one drawback it would be the distance from the rooms to the beach. It's a decent walk, but when walking through the Four Seasons interior and grounds who cares? Oh yeah, all the Wailea golf courses are about a 5 minute drive away as well as the Wailea shops.

We had heard that the Four Seasons was kid friendly, but were nevertheless overwhelmed by just how much that was the case. In the end, perhaps more than anything, because the resort made our son feel so welcome, we could relax and truly enjoy our vacation as a family. Our son is 21 months old and too young to take advantage of the main \"Kids for All Seasons\" program (ages 5-12), but don't let that discourage you from bringing your toddlers. As we were escorted to our room, the housekeeping staff was already greeting our son by name before we'd even met them. The room was fully kid-proofed--including protective netting on the railing of our lanai--and also stocked with milk, cookies, and bath toys (including our son's name spelled out in colorful sponge letters on top of the tub). The Kids for All Seasons room has plenty of toys for toddlers, including a play kitchen, basic puzzles, a Little Tikes-like slide, and doodlers. You can check out the toys and books to your room if you'd like. For older kids, there's a rock climbing wall, air hockey, and a basketball hoop. There's also an incredible video game room in the general recreation area with at least eight large TVs dedicated to video game play. Moreover, all the restaurants, including Spago, have kids menus. And while you'll spend a great deal on food when eating at the resort (a piece of salmon from the room service menu costs $35, with side dishes an additional charge), the kids prices are very reasonable (for example, I think a generous serving of chicken fingers and fries cost $6). I'm not sure how the other rooms are arranged, but we stayed in a \"partial ocean view\" suite on the north side of the property. The suit had a good ocean view from the balcony, but not much of an ocean view from the room itself. We did not hear any room construction noise, but we did hear construction noise from beyond the property, where a large development of some kind is being built across the road. I assumed that a courtyard view room would have been quieter, but that may not be the case based on what I'm seeing from other reviews. That said, the noise we heard was not that distracting--just a little bit bothersome at times. The suite has two bathrooms. One off the bedroom, which is huge. And another off the marble entryway, which is also spacious, but has only a shower and no tub. The suite has doors to the bedroom so the bedroom can be closed off, but we still put our son's crib in the master bath (it fits easily) so we could have full access to the bedroom while he was sleeping. The crib does not seem to fit through the the smaller bathroom's doors, but you might want to check with housekeeping to see if it can be assembled inside the smaller bath so that you can have full access to the master bath. I'll leave the more adult-oriented details to other reviewers, but it is worth emphasizing just how exceptional the staff is. They could not be any more friendly or helpful, and all of them go out of their way to welcome your children. The hotel also provides quite an array of complimentary activities. There are several yoga classes, exercise classes, snorkeling, and outrigger canoeing. The outrigger canoe class is quite enjoyable and allows you to see some marine life as well.

My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon in October, which was during the construction period at the hotel. You would have never known there was any construction going on. Initially, we were given a room that was very far from the working elevator bank. The hotel provided us with a $50/day resort credit. The walk was very far and we asked for another room, which we were given the next morning. In fact, we were upgraded from partial ocean view to prime ocean view without making a request. Everything about this hotel is absolutely top notch. We ate on property for almost every meal (we did have dinner at Longhi's, which I highly recommend), or we had room service. The room service presentations were impeccable- your meal comes with flowers and a large basket of bread (no matter what you order) and your meal is presented to you wherever you would like. The service is attentive without being overbearing. I highly recommend Ferraro's for lunch- the soft pretzels they serve prior to the meal are delicious, and you cannot beat the setting. We also had dinner at Spago, Ferraro's and the Pacific Grill. Surprisingly, my favorite meal was at Pacific Grill, which looks like a fairly cheesy hotel restaurant, but the food and service were excellent. The breakfast buffet, however, leaves something to be desired. The food was cold and it was kind of dirty, though I suspect this is because we ate there towards the end of the breakfast rush. The staff at the hotel simply will not let you do anything for yourself. When you are at the pool, they bring you water and food (free of charge) constantly, if you go to the beach, they offer to set up all of your stuff for you. I also made a few trips to the impeccable spa. It was wonderful. I also highly recommend taking a day trip to Lanai with Trilogy. As far as people complaining about the prices of things- HELLO! IT IS THE FOUR SEASONS! Everything is going to be expensive. You have to pay a high price for this kind of service.

Here are our comments: Check In: Private check in was on the club level. Mention your name to the car folks and they instantly know you full name and escort you upstairs to the Concierge Club. Hostesses greeted us there and worked with us to get the right room (see below) and the club is gorgeous. Room: It exceeded all of our expectations. One should be aware that the non-suite rooms are further back on the U shaped floor than the suites which take all the front facing space. As well the concierge club is pretty far forward and takes up several rooms worth of space alone. We asked to see several rooms before deciding to go with the south side of the hotel (opposite the central courtyard) as the views of the ocean were much better. The room itself was large, bathroom enormous and the lanai was roomy (just a few rooms have a large lanai).The rooms have all been recently remodeled and are fabulous in every way with flat screen and very comfortable bedding. Room Service: Whatever we wanted whenever we wanted it was provided instantly and with a smile. Food was awesome and hot. Towels, Robes, Dry cleaning, Shoe shining were all handled with ease. Club Level: As mentioned our hostesses were fantastic. The food was provided at several intervals during the day. The food was amazing: highlights included: crab legs, sushi, rare roast beef sandwiches, crab cakes, shrimp, amazing cheese and fruit. Full bar at no cost, water in bottles, soda. Cocktail hour was awesome with the view from the club on the 8th floor. Desert and after dinner drinks (cognac, etc) were flowing. There was nothing the hostesses couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do. My son was always treated like a king and with great kindness. We had a party in our room at one point and they brought a steady supply of items to keep it going. Wow is all I can say about them. They rock. Hotel Property: A complete renovation has been completed and this hotel sparkles. Wow. Hotel Pool: What a scene this is! The first thing you should know about this hotel is the pool scene is intimate and outrageous. The first decision you need to make every morning is where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to sit. By the pool proper and join in social scene, or close by on bluff overlooking the sea or on a secluded in a hillside dugout with day beads. The reason you need to make this decision is all the good spots are gone by 8am. The good news is that if you live on the mainland you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re up early anyway. There are rules: You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave your seats for more than 20 min or loose them, except between 11am 2pm when you can leave for lunch. However this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really enforced strictly till later in the afternoon. The trick is to send someone down to get that seat at 730-ish to claim a spot, leave some stuff on your chair and then head to breakfast and watch your chair from DUO. After breakfast the rest of the crew comes down you then switch off and go work out. Its not all skin, we are talking a great combination of normal folks like me, killer hard bodies and their kids. The adults near the pool seem to groove into a giant cocktail party where everybody knows each other after a few days. All the while be waited hand and foot by an army of attendants who bring you drinks ($), food($), spray you with evian (free), ice cream(free), fruit sticks(free) and dry towels. This is the only pool with twice daily snack food buffet for free. We noticed several people had \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccabana nannies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as they are called to get the primo seats. Out pool experience was resplendent with star power \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rocker Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson paraded around with their kids. Apparently it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the norm here, so that made it extra fun and our stars couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have be nicer and more accessible. Hotel Beach: Beach boy service in small cove that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got very gentle waves. Kids can boogie board and snorkel. Very safe and very nice. Great path to walk on past other that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a must do. Game Room: Nice pool table, foosball and TV room where kids hang out adjacent to a massive array of Playstaions systems. My son was in heaven. The hotel was small enough and secure enough that we had no problem letting him bop from pool to the game room by himself. He soon met up with other kids his age and had a blast. In a bigger resort I would never be comfortable with this but here with the security and all it was no problem. Restaurants: FERRARO'S was our favorite the classic northern Italian restaurant was a dream. Oceanside seats must be requested. Just tell them you will wait at the bar until they free up. A guitarist and cello player provide amazing music that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amplified and discretely projected from hidden speakers in the shrubbery. Romantic with an R. Wine list isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t outrageous, especially the whites. Also this is great for lunch. Spago has the best view and the coolest interior and the food was goodbut not great. DUO is the lower level steak and seafood restaurant also good but not as special as its feels like 'the hotel deafult restaurant' because it is, as you eat breakfast there evry day. Gym and Spa: Bikes and joggers are outside under fans which is really nice. Inside is free weights and machines. Again a small area but enough equipment. Classes for yoga on the beach which my wife did that every day and loved. You get free access to the steam and showers which is great. The spa treatments were fabulous and the facility while small is very nice. If you want a mega spa go next door to the Grand Wailea. Kids Club: We used the Kids for All Seasons once during our stay. The days and hours were very limited.They did a nice job with the kids however. Things we would like to see: Kids club needs to be open more evenings during peak holidays and longer hours. There is no place to go at night but the lobby bar which is just ok. They need something open on Fri and Sat besides the lobby acts which frankly put me to sleep. We notcied a killer lounge area inside Spagos that could have DJ but it was unused. Many people expressed the same concerns to me. Where is the rock and roll at FSM? We guests can t all hang out in Tommy Lees room. Without any question the FSM is truly a Five Diamond. It is not a mega-resort with a theme pool but instead a luxurious exclusive boutique resort. Cost wise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very expensive but you get a lot for your money\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6just be prepared to spend double what you plan.

Mt wife's chicken dish was served cold. They took the item off our bill with no questions and provided us wit ha free desert..but still a surprise for Spago. The new steakhouse - DUO - was very good! The rib eye I had was out of this world, and the souffle after dinner was splendid. There was some construction going on some mornings that woke us up, we called down and it stopped.

We spent our last night on the island at The Grand Wailea next door just to see what that hotel resort was like. While the room cost was less - the resort wasn't nearly as clean as we would have liked. We were also very disappointed to learn that the equivalent cabana arrangement to the Four Seasons cost $200 a day at the Grand Wailea - the Four Seasons doesn't have this tacky unexpected add on. There were also far too many birds landing on chairs in the bar and dining area at the Grand Wailea.

The poolside and beachside service is impeccable...lay back and allow the offerings of water, fruit, etc. come to you.

Best resort on Maui if price is not an object. I'm convinced Wailea Beach is the best location on the island for a beach stay. Four Seasons and Grand Wailea share this excellent beach.

On the flip side the town of Kihei is just 5 minutes up the road when you want to escape the master planned atmosphere and wander around kitschy shops, funky restaruants or find a fast food place or grocery store. If you are a sun lover the pool areas/cabanas/beach facilities are amazing. Four Seasons service is outstanding. Rooms are large and all have balconies. The only tough decision is choosing a room category. Because of the design of the buildings, only a few very expensive suites on the ends of the two wings have direct beach views. Everything else is an angled view across the beautiful courtyard and pool areas with a glimpse of the ocean. Unless you are on floor 5 or higher you won't even see much ocean. In my opinion, only the ocean view prime category has a view worth paying for.

The hotel location, atmosphere, grounds, beach, rooms, and service are near-perfect. We are very picky, unashamed \"hotel snobs\" and we still loved this hotel. Don't worry at all about the ongoing renovations - they are being performed in a completely inobtrusive manner. You are NOT booking into a noisy, dirty construction zone! Wailea is definitely the best area to stay in Maui for an upscale resort experience, and the Four Seasons seems to be the best choice among the upscale Wailea resorts. Both the Grand Wailea and the Fairmont Kea Lani are much bigger and have some buildings a long way from the beach and restaurants. The Four Seasons and Grand Wailea share the best beach in the area. The only thing to be VERY careful about is your room category. We initially booked an \"Ocean View Deluxe\" room. Seems reasonable to expect a good ocean view, right? Sadly no - just a distant view of the ocean over the entrance driveway and trees - not even a glimpse of the actual beach. For anything like what you are expecting, the key word is \"prime\" - as in \"Ocean View Prime\". Even this doesn't mean a full front-on ocean view, but you should get to see the ocean and a bit of the beach over the nicely landscaped hotel courtyard. Don't even think about booking \"Garden View\" or \"Partial Ocean View\" - better to save your money and stay home. Don't expect that you'll get upgraded because you are on your honeymoon or wedding anniversary - almost everyone in the hotel is on their honeymoon or wedding anniversary. So they will congratulate you, give you a nice bottle of bubbly wine, and leave you in the room category that you booked. The rooms themselves are very large and very well appointed, with big comfortable beds and very large marble bathrooms. There is absolutely no reason for a couple to book a suite in this hotel. We upgraded to a suite to get a better ocean view and never made any use of the extra room.

On the breakfast plan, we paid $1290/night. It needs to be said up front that the Four Seasons Wailea is a large facility that is set well back from the beach. Our 6th floor 'ocean view prime' suite was probably 250 yards from the water, and even the 'oceanfront' rooms aren't much closer. That said, our view was spectacular, looking out across Maalaea bay to the west lobe of Maui. Our balcony was spacious, and we could watch whales cavorting in the bay most afternoons. Bring your binoculars! You may be aware that the 4S Wailea is currently renovating, and it appeared that 20-30% of the rooms were being upgraded while we were there. At no time was this any sort of problem or concern for us; the most obtrusive sign of the work was a very occasional, distant whine of a power tool. Probably as a result, the resort appeared very empty, and we never saw more than 50% occupancy of the poolside cabanas or the beach umbrellas. We watched the grounds staff work with warm amusement; they are clearly on 'Hawaii time\". We arrived late in the evening and were greeted by name by the staff (a practice that was to continue for our entire stay). Check-in was immediate, and we were upgraded to the next larger suite. We were both given a lei, and bell staff escorted us to our rooms, which contained a bottle of champagne in honor of our (belated) 42nd anniversary. The suite we'd reserved had been renovated, and the suite we were upgraded to had not, so we requested a move to the original suite after the first night and were accommodated without any discussion. The un-renovated suite was vast, but showed signs of wear (minor paint damage on furniture, minor wear on carpet, elderly TV sets, etc). I have to say that the un-renovated suite was NOT shabby, and we would have been content to stay there if the renovated suite we reserved had not been available. The 4S houskeeping standards are very high indeed, and remained so during our stay. The suite we ended up in was spacious, all new and comfortable to a fault. There were two (!) 42\" plasma HD TV sets, and more HD channels than we have on our home satellite service, as well as a DVD player, several DVDs in the room and a reasonable library of loaner DVDs available from the concierge. The room included a fruit plate which was refreshed or replaced every morning. Our bottles of water were replaced once per day, and a \"towel visit\" from housekeeping occurred each afternoon to tidy up and replace any towels we may have used. Turndown service was offered every night, and was a bit odd in that the maid invariably turned on the bedroom TV set and cranked the ceiling fan up to max, as well as turning down the linen. We quickly learned to leave the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door when we went to supper. Breakfasts were excellent, with many well-prepared choices on the buffet, including custom-made waffles, French toast and omlettes. We signed a check for $66.00 each morning, but were charged less than half that on our B&B plan. The breakfast restaurant was right on the edge of the beach with spectacular views. Donna, the breakfast hoistess, learned our name after our first visit and used it for the rest of our stay! We ate at Spagos restaurant one night, and felt the food was good, but not a great value. We ended up eating most of our dinners at reataurants in The Shops of Wailea, just up the road from 4S. Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and Tommy Bahamas were our favorites, although not notably less expensive than Spagos at the resort. I have to say at this point that the staff at 4S was beyond all expectations. Every staff person we met was warmly friendly, and most greeted us by name. We experienced several minor physical plant problems (A/C stuck on, toilets clogged and leaking), and in each instance they were dealt with within the hour. The bell staff always had our car within 5 minutes of request, always asked if we needed directions and always were the soul of warm courtesy. The concierge was always warmly helpful, providing us with maps, directions and advice for the trips we took. This was our first experience with Four Seasons. We aren't wealthy, and the fact that we were here at all reflected years of savings. Would we do it again? Was it a good value? So much was well beyond our expectations that I'd say we certainly would like to return. As to 'value', it's hard to imagine anything surpassing this experience, price notwithstanding!

I am happy to find myself flexible enough to truly enjoy both experiences! The Big Island is definitely more understated and laid back, but this hotel does have a quiet elegance about it that is special. I say this having gone for a spa appt at the Renaissance Hotel, which is another big, fancy hotel. But there is something about the 4S. . .something intangible that really makes a difference there.

The food presentations are delicious, and constant. Drinks are great. Whatever you want, they will get for you. The concierge staff is phenomenal--especially Margaret, who is simply delightful. I will say that staying at the hotel when 1/3 of the rooms are under renovation is kind of nice since there was NEVER a problem getting a seat at the pool, beach, etc. However, I did not have the same exceptional pool service that others wrote about on this site. I even asked if they had any fruit at the towel table and was told (a bit abruptly) that she had \"just finished and won't do another one until 1:30).\" Oh.

Very professional, and respectful. felt like VIP right away. Room requests for highest floor and quiet location was met. Most hotels do not guarantee requests will be met however the 4S gave us our room exactly as requested, no hassle at all. Parking. Parking is Valet only, I believe it is $12 US/day, not expensive. Service was quick as they do not seem short staffed, even during peak times. Very friendly staff and polite, addressed us as Mr. and Mrs.. the whole time. if you are staying at another resort they have short term parking avaliable for those who chose to dine at the 4S. The mountain view rooms are next to the short term parking so if you book one of these rooms it may be noisy. Room We were greeted with a welcome gift, we did not mention any special occasion so I assume this is routine. The had left us hawaiiin sweets/pastries. Really special welcome. we booked a Parital Ocean View room. I guess if you were lucky you got the POV that allowed you to see the sunset from your balcony.

The beach service was excellent, again the moment you step onto the beach you are quickly greeted by the staff who will set up a chair and umbrella for you. greeted again by Mr. and Ms. the entire time. given ice water, fresh fruit often... Beach can be windy at times. If you get a chance take the beach walk along the wailea coast. beautiful walk and you can see molikini from the beach.

Bottom line, loved the 4S all staff were respectable and professional. yes, it is a five star hotel but it lives up to its reputation.

The room had a very large bathroom with a soaking tub and seperate glass shower with marble tile. The room also had a large 50\" Plazma TV which really nice to have. The grounds of the property are beautiful, with tons of areas to relax throughout the property. Unlike some of the hotels in Wailea, I didn't seem to see tons of loud kids running around. Yes, there were some kids but they seemed to be under control by parents that were good parents....I'm sure everyone knows what I mean by saying this. Sorry, I don't have kids and don't want to relax with loud screaming kids running arround like some of the hotels. My only complaint was that the coffee in the hotel rooms isn't that good and that drinks were a little on the pricy side. My martini was $18.00 at the casual restaurant that overlooks the ocean.

Let's just say, within 1 hour of being there, we said we would have to come back. ok so maybe we were on a honeymoon high but it's approaching a year later and I still daydream about our Maui stay every other day... In all honesty, no hotel is perfect, and different people will always have different opinions and expriences even at the same hotel, but all I can say is that from our one experience (7 nights in May 06) this was the most incredible hotel EVer!! ok the place is GORGEOUS - just look at my photos - and the only thing casting a shadow on the facilities was the impeccable service! I've never had anyone wait on me hand and foot like at the Four Seasons. Honestly - I wasn't able to lift a finger. No one by the pool let anyone lay their own towel down or look around for more than 30 seconds before someone asked what you needed... and Evian sprays in the face, fresh cold fruit, FREEZIES (did you hear me? freezies!!), cold towels, smoothies, etc. all free by the pool as you soak in heavenly Hawaiian rays. Our original room was ok - corner - partial view of ocean...was fine but we wanted to see if we could score a full ocean view - so we simply asked nicely. And within an hour we were moved to a gorgeous ocean view room (see our view from photos) - didn't have to leave our terrace if we didn't want to. And DO order room service for breaky - OMG it was an amazing breakfast!! Esp while the sun came up... Great room service - fresh flowers, diligent replenshing, prompt response to any request... Coffee grinder and whole kona beans in room were cool... great coffee. Niiice bathroom. Clean facilities. Open concept workout area - refreshing. Pool was disappointingly small and shallow - not a lot of space. But who cares - go explore Maui!! We had SO much fun doing activities together - including renting snorkelling gear (so cheap - like $5 for couple days) and driving around finding our own spots. Driving into Lahaina for luau was fun too! Beachside highway...never enjoyed traffic so much! Conceirge and all staff are most helfpul and friendly.

It was wonderful to be greeted by the courteous staff, we placed leis on us and gave us cool towels at check in. By the time we were in our room, our bags were already there. Our 1st (renovated) room was sensational! It had a full unobstructed ocean view, a huge 50 inch flat screen plasma TV showing photos of the resort and playing relaxing Hawaiian music. The lanai was the perfect place to hang out while the baby was sleeping. They totally when all out for the baby also! The bathroom was decorated with colorful sponges spelling out her name, she was given bath toys, and there were separate baby toiletries, and diapers (including swim diapers!). The bathroom is amazing! The twice daily maid service is phenomenal. Pool service is amazing -- within minutes of arriving they set up chairs for us including a pack and play for the baby!

It's right on the beach and there's also a beautiful pool. The staff goes out of its way to make you feel pampered and relaxed. A few minutes after check-in a staff member knocked on the door and set up a beautiful box of cookies and snacks as a complimentary gift. Once you step foot on the beach you're directed to your own beach chairs (shaded with an umbrella). Every 30 minutes or so we were offered water and a cooling spritz. The only negative about the resort was that construction was underway while we were there. It was quite loud while we were hanging out on the beach. Our flight out of Maui wasn't until 5PM, so we had a few hours to kill. As an added bonus, the resort let us store our belongings after we checked out so that we could stay on the beach. They let us use the spa facilities to shower and change after leaving the beach. The spa was fabulous and we felt so relaxed. This is one of the nicest resorts I have ever stayed in.

If you get an unrenovated room, which we had, the television is seriously laughable. I know, who goes to Hawaii to watch tv, but for the down times you do want to watch it (my hubby is a football fanatic, so had to watch the games), we could barely see it due to poor reception and tiny size. Other than that, the rooms are nice. I found everything to be \"nice\", but not as \"amazing\", as other people have reviewed. For example, we arrived at 3:45, but our room was not ready, and we had to sit and wait 40 minutes for it. No biggie, but at the Four Seasons, I expect the room to be ready if I check in after check in time. And if its not, I expect to be given a drink while I wait, etc, which we were not. I mean, we are paying top prices for top service, right? Then we were just handed our keys and sent on our way, at other hotels of this caliber, a bell person would escort you to your room. When the bellman came, he brought our luggage, but didn't bring us ice, etc as is customary in a nice hotel such as this. Again, not a big deal as I am capable of getting my own ice (which I had to do every day), but I am used to a bit better service at the FS. The in room coffee is so so good! Grind the whole beans, we loved it. Poolside service is nice, the new manager of the poolside area (he is from Mexico, I can't remember his name off the top of my head) is fabulously nice, seek him out if you are there. Was there the first week of Dec. and the pools were COLD, really too cold to enjoy, the poolside staff kept insisting they wer heated, but no way, no one got in them because they were too cold. This was a big dissapointment. Jacuzzis were nice and heated though (and crowed because of the cold pools!) The ocean was warmer than the pools! The beach is beautiful, the snorkeling right in front of the hotel is AMAZING!! This is one amazing thing about this hotel that I will rave about, I had a great time snorkeling there every day, saw lots of sea turtles, etc. Fabulous. Hotel is in a nice location for walking to the shops at Wailea, where you can get a nice meal at several resturants.

On my most recent trip, I had an opportunity to experience both this property as well as the Four Seasons Hualalai, located on the big island of Hawaii. The Four Seasons Maui is located on Wailea, which has a reputation of being Maui's most desirable beach. The weather is almost always ideal, lacking the sometimes annoying trade winds found more commonly on other areas of the island. Immediately adjacent to the FS Maui is the Fairmont Kea Lani and the Grand Wailea Maui. In addition to numerous resorts, Wailea also features an amazing upscale outdoor shopping mall with high end stores and restaurants. If you are looking for peace and quiet, this might not be your place. We found that although service was excellent throughout, you are often sharing your resort experience with other guests. Pools were often crowded, as well as most common areas of the hotel. This was at a time that 1/4 of the rooms were out of service due to a rooms renovation. That being said, the common areas of the hotel were beautiful. From the moment you arrive, you are greeting in true Hawaiian spirit. The lobby area is tranquil and offers a stunning view of the water. We were given a room that had not been renovated. We were still however impressed by the overall feel and appearance of the room. Standards rooms are spacious, measuring approximately 600 sq. feet depending upon location. Each standard room features a marble bath with separate tub and glass enclosed shower. I would imagine that the hotel will be upgrading the bathrooms as a part of the renovation. Additionally, beds are typically Four Seasons, with extremely comfortable mattresses and Frette linens. Lanai's (outdoor patio's) are spacious and feature a candle, table & chairs. Our ocean view category room was private and captured beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean. Service throughout was impeccable, perhaps even beyond that of your typical Four Seasons. Even at a property with numerous guests, you feel that your satisfaction is always their top priority. The resort has several dining options on property. My personal suggestion is the outdoor Italian restaurant, Ferraro's, which offers a spectacular array of Italian offerings. You can dine under the stars while listening to the wave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crash. I would highly recommend a Breakfast package, as the hotel offers a wonderful morning Breakfast spread! If you're looking for a fine hotel experience, with plenty of activities, this might be your place. The Four Seasons Wailea does a wonderful job all around, with wonderful facilities and a stunning location. The pool may be somewhat of a \"scene\" but it's a wonderful property indeed.

We also spent some time in the pool and the jacuzzis. The fitness area is outside, which is nice, and each machine has its own screen.

Although we were only there three days, it made our trip entirely magical. I have stayed at both the Grand Wailea and Kea Lani and will never stay anywhere else but the Four Seasons, except when I have kids of my own I will venture over to the Grand for the pool. I did not tell my boyfriend that we were staying here as it was a birthday surprise. From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed. At check in my boyfriend was roaming around in shock and I made a passing comment to the front desk lady that it was a surprise to celebrate our birthdays. Later that afternoon when we returned to the room there was a lovely plate of chocolates and desserts with a note wishing us a happy birthday. The Four Seasons Touch! We stayed in a mountain side room and I am not that picky about views since we are not in there that much, but I am picky about the quality of the rooms, beds, pillows, ect. I had nothing to complain about whatsoever. Granted you can see the parking lot below, but they have done a nice job of trying to protect your privacy. I think this room is a bargain for what the property offers and I will certainly stay in the same category when I go back. Loved the bathroom and the sound system is such a great touch for the ladies especially. I definitely took my time having a bath and getting ready with sounds of the island playing. A glass of champagne really adds to the mood as well....and that was all possible since I arranged to have a mini fridge in the room to chill beverages. It is true that you do have to be up and out at the pool at about 6:45-7am if you want to get a beach cabana. I highly reccomend them since there are some that are secluded. You cant beat staring at the ocean all day! One guy told me that he goes every Christmas and is out at 3AM to claim the prime cabana and that it is wall to wall people. That sounds like something to avoid :) The gym is AMAZING! It made me even want to work out and I loved it. The cardio area is open air and overlooks the pool and ocean. Each machine has a TV. Fresh fruit, chilled water and gatorade. I miss that gym. Yoga on the beach was \"ehhh\" for me. Its very basic and I got very bored. I was jealous of all the people going to snorkel in the perfectly calm ocean wishing that the class would end. My boyfriend loved it though....so it may be your cup of tea. Pacific Grill breakfast is great. The mac nut pancakes are yummy and irresistible. I had the mac nut pancakes at The Gazebo and I liked these better. Granted the breakfast is pricy but you will be full all day. Ferraros was just okay in my opinion. The view is spectacular but I liked the lunch menu much more. The service was a bit slow too but I think our waiter was just slow in general. Spagos on the other hand....excellent food and wine menu and a great view too. I will end with saying that one of the reasons the Four Seasons is so wonderful is the STAFF. They really care about how you are doing and making sure you are taken care of. Our bellman, Chaz was one of those people. Chaz was also our \"driver\" in the complimentary car service to the Wailea Shops. He told us to have Tommy Bahamas (Fantastic Food!) call him when we were done, and there he was waiting for us. He also passed us in the hall when we were leaving and ended up walking us out and helping us load up just because he wanted to.......the best part is that when we returned home I had an email from Chaz making sure we made it home safely and that he enjoyed meeting us. Who does that??? The Four Seasons wonderful Staff does that. Not to say that is the norm, but these people love their job and it shows from the front desk staff, to house keeping, and the pool staff...everyone was wonderful! I know there are people out there reading these posts and teeter-totering between staying here or someplace else. STAY HERE!!!

I will preface this posting with the assurance that the four-star rating relates purely to a few unfortunate experiences and an opinion of one restaurant. You cannot go wrong by staying at this fabulous hotel. It is simply wonderful. We stayed at the Four Seasons for five nights in mid-October. Check-in was smooth and a genuine welcome awaited us. We were upgraded from a partial ocean-view room to a suite. (However, the suite was directly above the delivery area at the rear side of the hotel and we wakened to the racket of trucks backing up and beeping, people \"chatting\" etc.) If you can, try to request a room further to the front. Also, there is a huge condo complex being built behind the hotel and the noise from this is very loud at times. No way could we sit outside on the lanai. Another nice touch was the bottle of champagne that arrived an hour or so after check-in and a \"Congratulations on your anniversary\" card from the GM. The pool area is just amazing. Beautiful and large cabanas (no extra charge) and plenty of beds. When you arrive poolside, you are greeted by a staff member who helps you decide on your spot for the morning. The beds are cushioned (none of those plastic strap beds) and the attendant places a fitted velour towel on the bed and rolls a second towel for under your head. Iced water is constantly poured for you, Evian sprays, pineapple slices and popsicles are also delivered along with cold hand towels. It's heavenly. The keiki (children's) pool was under construction, so there were a few drill noises, but the Four Seasons handled this one by coming round with a tray loaded with earplugs. Too funny! There were few kids running around and those who were, were actually polite and well-behaved. Our room was spectacular, noise notwithstanding. The bathroom was a suite in itself, with double doors leading to the bathroom proper, a change area with hairdryer, lighted hand-mirror, etc., and a separate WC with door. L'Occitane produts were a nice touch. The bed and linens were superbly comfortable and there were four robes, two terry and two light cotton, which I practically lived in. Three jars full of coffee beans (macadamia, regular and decaf) are supplied with the coffee machine (situated in the bar area), with a grinder and some coffee-bags for those who didn't want to grind their own. Creamers were in the fridge. There were also two TVs that we never turned on (my orders!). So what were the problem areas? First, the restaurant that serves the breakfast buffet. We went there twice, hoping that the second time would be better than the first. It was worse. The food was nowhere near as well-prepared as the breakfasts and buffet at the Renaissance or the Hyatt in Ka'anapali. It was significantly inferior in our opinion. The second day, the server was very brusque. We were seated right next to a fence, on the other side of which was the keiki pool and several workmen hammering away. I asked if it would be possible to be moved. The server said, \"Well, you'll hear the noise wherever you sit,\" in a very unfriendly way. She did move us. I ordered a French Toast brioche which had been lightly whisked through the egg and was as dry as a bone inside. SInce I had to eat (I suffer from debilitating migraines and have to keep my blood sugar up), I finished it by the time she reappeared. When the server finally came over to ask how everything was, I mentioned, politely, that the brioche had not been as pleasant as I had hoped for. Her response was, \"Well, you finished it!\" This is NOT Four Seasons service or quality in my opinion. I have to contrast this dish with a similar dish at the Hyatt. The Hyatt's version was so very superior, with fresh blueberries, strawberries and pecans and whipped vanilla butter. I could honestly barely eat the breakfasts we had at the Four Seasons. They were dried out or greasy on both occasions. (Not the case at Ferraros or Spago, where the food was excellent.) The setting is very boring too. The breakfast buffet was average and just couldn't compete with the buffet at the Renaissance either in variety or quality. Next little issue: One evening, after pulling up to the front in our car, a valet ran over, opened my door, then spotted a limo (evidently of greater importance) draw up beside us. At this point, he let the door go and ran to open their door! Unfortunately for me, I had already extended one leg out of the door, which fell back onto it. I was very bruised afterwards. My husband called the fellow over and told him nicely what had happened and he was very apologetic. This is a minor thing but, as in the case of the server with attitude, it suggests to me that the staff are perhaps lacking in training. Final little issue: Before spending time at the Four Seasons, we stayed 9 nights in the Sheraton, Ka'anapali, and three nights in the wonderful Renaissance. Our rooms were made up during the morning, usually before 11:00 a.m. Twice at the Four Seasons, I had to call because they still hadn't been made up at 3:30 p.m. Once, we called THREE times as the room wasn't made up by 5:30. I think that is very poor. When we called for more creams, it took 45 minutes for them to arrive on two occasions and once, we had to call twice. More good stuff: The Quattro Stagione pizza is great! Try it for lunch at Ferraro's, overlooking the ocean. The restaurant opens for lunch at 11:30. The Bento Box is also wonderful. You HAVE to dine at Spago. I believe this restaurant is operated independently from the hotel. It's fabulous. If it's raining, don't plan on eating at Ferraro's in the evening. They phoned to cancel our reservation due to rain, leaving us with no reservation for our last night in Maui. Very disappointing. There are a number of lovely sitting areas in the hotel, bars, etc. overlooking the fountain. There is usually entertainment going on and it's very good. THE GYM ROCKS! Wow! I loved the cardio area and the weight room. We didn't go to the spa as this was a long trip and we didn't want a huge Visa bill afterwards. However, many guests told us it was wonderful. We loved seeing the beautiful arts and crafts displays and chatting to the artists every day! All-in-all, a delightful experience, aside from the bruises and below-par breakfasts! We can thoroughly recommend this hotel and will certainly visit again when the renovations are finished.", "Date": "October 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brookline, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAmazing honeymoon experience\u201d", "Author": "Brookline30something", "ReviewID": "UR6014887", "Content": "We spent five nights here on our honeymoon and were blown away by how fabulous our stay was.

Water, blankets for Haleakola, more cabanas at the pool than any other hotel, L'Occitrane products (soap,etc.) towels for our beach days were all extras that made a difference.

This made for a less crowded pool. We had no trouble getting the cabana of our choice. Although, if the hotel is crowded I can imagine things get a bit tight around the pool as it's a bit closed in. The Four Seasons isn't cheap, but they don't charge extra for things that cost more at a lot of hotels. The cabanas and kids club are no charge at the Four Seasons. I think the kids club is is something like $60 per day at Fairmount. I would really recommend that you consider booking one of the packages that include breakfast. The buffet is nice and on it's own is $28 per person, so it could add up quickly. Another note... The earthquake occurred during our stay. It was quite scary as we are from Illinois so not used to earthquakes. The power went out at the hotel for about two hours.

Loccitane amenties are really nice, along with cozy robes and slippers. (Only complaint: the hairdryer was tiny and pathetic - ladies bring your own or go use the ones in the spa).

I'd recommend both hotels and would return to them in a heartbeat! Pros: * Compared to the nearby resorts (Kea Lani, Grand Wailea, etc.), the Four Seasons has genuine elegance and style. Everything about the resort is top-notch, yet you don't feel like you're in a flashy, over the top amusement park. It's very classy. * I am sure we had the worst room in the hotel (way in the back and facing the covered parking lot) and we STILL felt like we were in paradise. The room was spacious and light, the bed was heaven, and the bathroom was the most exquisite bathroom we had ever seen! Beautiful marble, dual sinks and showers, a separate water closet, and music. I loved the L'Occitane soaps and shampoos, especially the \"after-sun balm\" to soothe a sunburn. * As with the Ritz, we found the service at the Four Seasons to be excellent. The staff were always friendly and attentive. The bar man let us take our cocktails down to the beach chairs, where we watched the stars and listened to the waves.

The Four Seasons is close to a lot of snorkeling spots that were great even though we had rainy weather. We didn't do a lot of sunbathing or lounging -- next time!

The week before we were on Oahu and the Big Island. We were upgraded from a partial ocean view to an inside room where we could see the pool, ocean and garden area. Never requested it, we just got the upgrade. We did not eat dinner at any of the restaurants but had lunch by the pool. We ate the buffet breakfast 2 days but it is not really worth the price. Buy a little snack breakfast elsewhere. They tell everyone that if their things are left unattended for more than 20 minutes they might be removed from the lounge chairs by the pool or beach but that is just not true. I saw many chairs unattended for hours and never saw anything removed unless someone complained which I saw happen just a couple times. If you want a cabana, get to the pool early and stake out your spot. If you just want a lounge chair by the pool you may get a canopy put over it and still be out of the sun when you want to. I would say anytime the resort is pretty full if you want a chair at all you need to be out at the pool by mid morning. We had some pooside massages that I can highly recommend. They allow children or teens to get poolside massages also. Our girls that are 12 and 15 both enjoyed them. My husband and I went to the spa and he enjoyed a massage and reflexology.

We have a three year old and my wife will not stay anywhere if the rooms are not spotless. I can't say enough great things about this hotel. The Grand Wailea is nice if your kids are a little older and can enjoy the pools/slides. The Grand is just too big for us and it takes a long time to get anywhere in that hotel. They seem to nickel and dime you for everything(gym,valet)The kea lani is nice if you have a need for a suite but the beach out front is in my opinion not as nice for swiming. The grounds at the four seasons are very nice. The pool is just big enough and never seems to be too crowded. We spend 90% of our time on the beach out front bodysurfing or chasing crabs so the pool is not a huge priority. The beachboys are great and are alway quick to help when you need water/towels/umbrella's/chairs. I've seen some complaints about \"rooms over the parking structures\". We always stay in a mountainside room and yes it is over the parking structure but we are never in the room so it doesn't bother us. The noise hasn't ever bothered us. The money we save staying in a mountainside room vs a partial oceanview are enough to cover our large bar tab after a eight night stay so it makes sense to me. I don't know who wouldn't check their room location when booking a room that is $400 a night and not ask what the room is like and what are the negative aspects of that room. Just my opinion... Did I say how clean the rooms are? The hotel is doing a extensive remodel and i'm sure the rooms are going to be even better. We have stayed at other resort properties on Maui before we stayed at the Four Seasons. The Hyatt, Kapalua, The Grand, they all are great hotels. But for the last five years the only place we will stay is the Four Seasons. I hope this helps and in my opinion there is not a better beach on any part of the island for the little ones so close to world class accomodations. One other thing, my son loves music and somehow ended up with a ukulele from one of the convience stores that he would not put down. The valet (and I kick myself for not remembering his name) every time we returned to the hotel would play songs to him from his ukulele. It was really unbelievable that the valet took the time and the effort to do this. The aloha spirit is alive and well at the four seasons. If you never have been to maui don't fall for the \"turtle town\" snorkeling trips. They are expensive and you can swim a very, very short distance out to the turtles right off the point to the south of the hotel. There is always quite a few of them out there. Pros- great service from Valet, bellman, beach boys, housekeeping, front desk. Beach pool rooms gym hotel general manager great snorkeling Cons- they need a bar like the \"library\" at the Hyatt in Kaui Expensive, but we knew that. Food is ok but not great, We don't go there for the food.

We stayed on the club level of the hotel (Room 822) from August 7-14 and it was honestly the best experience I have ever had at a hotel. We were in Maui to celebrate our 10th anniversary and my birthday and the staff really helped make it special. The minute we drove up to the valet area in front of the hotel, we were greeted by a valet and given lovely leis by a hostess who asked our last name. The hostess immediately knew our first names and that we were staying on the club floor. They told us to leave the luggage and it would be taken care of along with the car. The hostess then whisked us away to the 8th floor club lounge to hand us over to the wonderful concierge staff. The concierge seated us comfortably, gave us chilled towels to refresh ourselves and offered us drinks. I had a great Mai Tai and my husband tried a local beer. Very nice way to start our visit to Maui. We were checked in to our room as we sat in the lounge enjoying our beverages and some treats from the tea that they had in the lounge. The club lounge offers a nice continental breakfast (fruit, cereal, yogurt, pastries, boiled eggs, and cheese blintzes), tea (sandwiches, tea sweets, chips), appetizers (varied but my favorite were the chilled shrimp and crab claws) and desserts (also varied but I saw homemade ice cream, chocolate eclairs, chocolate mousse, creme puffs) as well as beverages all day long. We really enjoyed sitting at the club lanai and having a cocktail while looking at the ocean and pool. Very relaxing. The club concierge staff were incredible and really did everything they could to ensure you enjoyed yourself. They made all of our dinner and entertainment reservations for us. They arranged for picnic lunches and coolers when we needed it. Somehow we managed to have prime seating at every restaurant that had a view and we had reservations at the perfect times for seeing the sunset. They also arranged for the chef to come to us at our favorite lanai in the club lounge to meet for our Ultimate Romantic Dinner. One night I mentioned that I really wanted something chocolate for dessert and that we would be stopping back by after dinner. There happened to not be a chocolate dessert offering that evening, but when we stopped in, I had a special chocolate mousse waiting for me. Simply amazing service. Our room (822) had a lovely view of the ocean from the bed and the lanai. Upon arrival in our room there was champagne chilled and a nice note congratulating us on our anniversary. The radio had Hawaiian music playing in the background and the concierge opened the door to the lanai so we could hear the ocean right away. The room itself was nice and included a really comfy King bed, a desk, a sofa and table, and a nice-sized lanai. The bathroom was also very large with nice toiletries. There is a wet bar area with a coffee maker, coffee bean grinder, snacks, and beverages. Since we receive all the snacks and beverages we would like right down the hall, we never used these amenities. During our stay we ate at Ferraros for lunch and Spago for dinner. Ferraros for lunch was very nice, especially if you could get one of the terrace seats overlooking the ocean They have a wonderful lobster salad that I ordered each time we ate there. The also have great breadsticks that are like soft pretzels. Spago was great for dinner and we really enjoyed the sunset from the terrace at Spago, as well. We also did the Four Season's Ultimate Romantic Dinner on our last evening there and the chef from Pacific Grill prepared a wonderful 6-course meal based on our meeting. It was the most romantic thing we have ever done. They only do one dinner each evening and you are seated in a lovely private alcove overlooking the beach. Very nice. We sat at the beach one morning and I spent a few days at the pool area. I agree with other posters that the immediate pool area gets crowded. They do say there is a 20-minute time limit you can be away during the morning hours, but they allow you to be away from 11-2 for lunch. Many people take advantage of the leniency of the pool people. I think it is hard to tell who is in the pool or other areas and they don't want to upset people. I did witness them cleaning up some cabanas when it was clear no one was using them. I ended up finding some lovely spots in the pool area along the walking path that is above the beach. These areas offered secluded half-cabanas that few people seemed to notice. I could always get a spot there if I was down by 9:00 am. The pool service is outstanding. They set up your cabana area, bring ice water every 20 minutes or so, bring frsh fruit and popsicles in the afternoon and have the lovely Evian spritzes. Really a great way to relax. There never seemed to be a problem getting a chair at the beach at any time of the day. The exercise facilities were nice and we used them almost every day. I enjoyed the cardio area that was basically an open-air area. My husband used the weight room frequently and liked it as well. They offered water, towels, headsets and fruit in the work out areas. Also, my husband didn't bring sneakers to work out (which are required) so they gave him a pair of sneakers to use throughout our stay. Only at the Four Seasons. We really enjoyed our stay here and especially the club floor. I will never stay anywhere else when we return to Maui. I am already planning to bring our daughters with us on the next visit. The hotel is so wonderful about preparing rooms for children and making their visits special. They were preparing a club level room for a family of four and they let me see how they set it up since we want to bring our small children next time. Everything was childproofed - bumpers on all corners of tables, lanai had netting stretched around so small fingers and feet couldn't poke through, bath tub had the faucets protected and they spelled the kids names with sponges on the tub, kid-sized robes that were like the adult robes, diaper pail, diaper holder, pack-n play, etc. They also had these rubber duckies with snacks for the kids along with milk and cookies upon arrival. The club lounge also made sure to have kids cereal and snacks available as well as kid-favorite sandwiches and gummy bears at tea time. Very cute.

While I was sad to leave Ka'anapali and all the wonderful restaurants and things to do, all of my tears instantly evaporated the second we drove onto the premise. I have stayed in Wailea twice before at the Renaissance and Kea Lani, but the Four Seasons was far and away the most phenomenal hotel I have ever stayed in. We booked the \"Romance for All Seasons\" package, as we were getting married at a nearby beach on August 1st and wanted this to be the most amazing trip of our lives. We were NOT disappointed. The minute we drove up in our mustang convertible (which was part of the package, with free overnight valet included), someone came and put fresh, beautiful leis on both of us. They took our bags and lead us to the front desk, where we were instantly greeted with cold towels (which was just what the doctor ordered after a long ordeal at the rental car pick-up). As we checked in, they informed us that they were upgrading us from a partial ocean to a deluxe ocean view room. I was COMPLETELY shocked by this....I have read lots of reviews on here and know better than to expect an upgrade, especially since they were booked to capacity. I have no idea why this happened, unless it was a perk from booking such an expensive package. Or, it may have been because we were scheduled to be in a room with two double beds and we requested a king bed since this was where we would be spending our wedding night. In either case, we were both so excited that the check-in ladies could probably see us jumping up and down. Our bellman took us to the seventh floor (room 714, which was just perfect!) and gave us a tour of the room. There was a bottle of champagne and a nice note congratulating us on our wedding, as well as a jar of dried fruit and petite-fours that we instantly enjoyed on our balcony! The room was very clean and larger than I imagined. The bathroom was also pristine and functional with two sinks, a large vanity and mirror (great for doing hair and make-up!), a walk-in shower, and a jacuzzi tub. There was even a phone next to the toilet!! I almost wish I had used it just to say that I did! One drawback was that our particular room did not have a fridge. I would suggest requesting such a room in case you have leftovers, as we did. We ended up putting our leftovers in the mini-bar since that was refrigerated. There was a coffee grinder and whole beans which we used only once, as breakfast at the Pacific Grille was part of our package. This was a wonderful way to start the day.....they had everything you could imagine from made-to-order macadamia nut pancakes to fresh fruit to purple potatos and hash browns. The BEST item was cheese blintzes....they had these only once and I wept every subsequent day that they weren't on the spread. For kids they had a tot-sized buffet with Finding Nemo plates and powdered donuts...so cute! It was so nice having a large breakfast every morning, and all we had to do was sign the slip since the meal AND gratuity was included with the package. That was a $60 value every morning, and allowed us to snack through lunch most days. Plus, they gave us boxes on the morning we went to Hana so we could pack things up and didn't have to buy any lunch at all! They always referred to us by name, joking around about how our name changed after the wedding on Tuesday, and were eager to help in any way they could. One day my husband went to order a pancake and they covered his tray so the birds wouldn't get at it. Excellent, friendly service no matter who we met! Also included in our package was a couples massage at the spa, which we did our last full day (we chose lomi-lomi....mmmm!!!). The locker rooms were wonderful with a steam room (great for the sinuses!) and delicious ginger-flavored hot tea and lemon water. They had everything a girl could want, from make-up remover to a hair drier....even cold cucumbers for your eyes!! The massage itself was wonderful, though it went by SO quickly! These were obviously professionals with a lot of experience. Tip is NOT included with the massage in this package, so it was one of the few things we paid for the entire time we were there. That evening we had dinner at Ferraros, also a part of the package. In many ways, this was the biggest positive surprise of our trip. From the outside, this doesn't look like a very romantic place. It's right next to the pool! However, now we know why it won an award for \"most romantic restaurant!\" We had made reservations before we left for Hawaii, and asked for the best table at the best time to see the sunset. Upon arriving at the restaurant they noted that we had the best table in the house and took us to a beautiful spot that overlooked the ocean. I completely forgot the pool was even there! Our waiter was top notch....one of the best I've ever had, actually. When our wine came (which, incidentally, is included in the package up to $75!!), the cork was wet and instead of having us try it, he got another bottle on the spot. Later, when my husband asked for a good dessert wine recommendation, the waiter gave a suggestion and later came back to change his mind because he'd thought carefully about it and came up with a better pairing. Keep in mind this dinner and tip were already included in our package....he was just doing this because he's an excellent server! We told him up front that we wanted to enjoy the experience and had nowhere to be, so he took things slow and let us enjoy the evening. However, he always seemed to know EXACTLY when we were ready to order and gave us just enough time to enjoy everything. I would turn to say something to my husband and would turn around to find I had a new napkin or my glass had been filled. It was unbelievable! The food itself was unique and delicious. I had the lobster risotto which was probably my favorite meal of the trip....I was so sorry I couldn't finish it! We also had great soups, a complimentary calamari appetizer (sometimes calamari can be chewy but this was out-of-this-world!), and split a great dessert because were too full to have our own. At one point, someone sent the violinist who had been playing all evening over to our table to serenade us since we had just been married. It was little touches like that which made us feel that the restaurant was open for us alone. We even got to see the conch-shell ceremony, as he comes around and lights the torches right in the restaurant. As we were leaving we stopped and spoke with the manager, and it was obvious she takes a lot of pride in the restaurant and the service they provide. They didn't even have us sign anything upon leaving.....we probably racked up a $300 bill and were just able to walk out and enjoy our evening. It was an experience I will never forget! For our wedding dinner all 10 of us went to Spago for dinner. We had labored over this decision because we wanted it to be an incredibly special night, and it certainly was. That having been said, I think ANY place would've been special on our wedding night....we were so busy trying to enjoy every minute, every toast, and every bite that in many ways it was completely impossible to capture the moment. The service here was wonderful, and the decor was very cool....it had a much more formal, big-city feel than many of the open-air restaurants we ate at on the rest of the trip. Everyone agreed that the food was delicious, and we went all out from champagne to appetizers to dessert. The wine was specially chosen by my husband's parents and both the red and white were phenomenal!! All and all this was the perfect place to do such a dinner because the service is great, the food is top notch, and it was in our hotel so travelling was not an issue. Also as part of the package they do a bougainvillea trail with champagne and bath soaps in your room. We had them do this on our wedding night instead of our Ferraros night, and it was just beautiful! We left an extra tip for the maids because of this....I can only imagine cleaning up all those petals! Every night they did a turn-down service so we'd walk into the room and hear quiet Hawaiian music playing. We'd go on the balcony and watch the stars (the light pollution is SO much less there!) and realize that this is paradise! I will say, I had read about the pools being crowded and cabanas being hard to come by. This is definitely true. One morning we looked for a cabana around 7:30 and there were only a few left. You really need to get down there around 6:00-6:30 to get a good one. They do NOT enforce the 20-minute rule....lots of people claimed cabanas at 6:30 and never came back until 10:00. It was kind of weird around 8:30 when people were looking for cabanas and even though tons of them were empty, none of them were available. That having been said, there are lots of beach chairs available throughout the day and service is just as good at those. We had drinks and lunch in our cabana one day which wasn't cheap, but certainly was delicious AND fun. We even tried the mai-tai served from a pineapple. *sigh!* I had also read that guests can be very snobby and kids can be unruly at this hotel. We noticed no such thing. In fact, I'm a teacher and am super-sensitive to annoying children, and all the kids I saw were extremely polite and friendly. One little girl bumped into someone at the breakfast buffet and was so cute in apologizing over and over. One day we saw the kids on a scavenger hunt at the Kids for All Seasons program.....they were so well-mannered and sweet! As someone who was there for a honeymoon when they were at full capacity, I never thought the kids were in the way or annoying at all. Some of the adult guests were a little stand-offish, but most of the ones we encountered were friendly and glad to be on vacation just like us! I knew going in that the service would be impeccable, and I also knew most of the amenities and treatments we would receive. That having been said, it's a completely unique experience when it's actually happening to you.....I can't imagine a nicer stay! From the friendly valets who ask about your day to the breakfast staff greeting you with a smile at 6:00 AM, it really is a surreal world where everything is just perfect! There were many times that I felt we were honored guests, receiving special treatment that was for us alone. I have a feeling ALL of their guests feel this way because the hard work they do to make it seem as such. I would HIGHLY recommend booking a package as we did, if you can swing it. It was so nice being able to do things like get a massage and valet park the car without worrying about the bill that we were racking up. We barely got our credit card out the whole time we stayed there because everything was included....even monogrammed bathrobes that we're wearing all over the place! I also would recommend booking things, like dinners, massages, etc. in advance because we were able to get the best tables and times because we didn't wait too late. Finally, I would recommend bringing lots of kleenex because you will cry your eyes out when you have to leave. We sure did....what a way to start a marriage, I don't know how the rest of our married lives will compare to the first few days!!!", "Date": "August 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great service, only problem is the crowds\u201d", "Author": "joeinnyc", "ReviewID": "UR5594440", "Content": "My new wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon during the last week in July.

We had a garden view room that could have easily passed for a partial ocean view. Both the main room and the bathroom were very large and spacious.

While the selections didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change much from day to day, there was plenty to pick from including a lot of fresh fruit, pastries, made-to-order eggs/omelets/pancakes and everything else you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think to include with breakfast. Amenities: The gym was a mix of outdoor (cardio equipment) and indoor (weights). The view was great and there was plenty of water & towels. Each piece of cardio equipment had a TV which comes in handy if you get bored of the view of the pool/ocean. The only problem with having the equipment outdoors is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot/humid in the afternoons. We both had nice massages at the spa, which had nice locker rooms available to guests at no charge. The steam room was great although the gym was lacking a sauna or whirlpool. (As an aside, we both went over to the Grand Wailea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spa and were blown away with what I like to call their water park for adults. My massage wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as good but their water treatments more than made up for it, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen anything else like it.) The game room is actually two rooms; one for video games and one with two pool tables and some other stuff along with a big screen TV. It looked great for both kids and adults. Pools/Ocean: The pools were nice but nothing special. The ocean was great. My biggest complaint, which has been repeated on these reviews, is the competition for the chairs. They will tell you that they do not give towels until 7am, and that if you leave for 20 minutes you will lose your chair. What we found was that if you show up at 7am, you will find books, shoes, and whatever else (we saw a really long deflated float stretched across four chairs) on a lot of the cabanas and good pool chairs. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also find people who have been up for a while sitting in the other chairs (which is the right thing to do). If you leave your stuff in the early morning without sticking around, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re usually nice enough to put a towel on your chair, which kind of defeats the system of not holding chairs. While we did see some things removed, it usually didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen until the other chairs were all taken, so if you want a good view, an umbrella, or a cabana, get there early or be forward enough to remove someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leftover book from the chair you want (we were always early because of the jet lag but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have felt bad doing this). Also, the chairs are very close together, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much they can do about that given the space constraints. If they were smart, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get rid of the garden in the middle of the U-shaped building and replace it with a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquiet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pool, which would allow for a more spacious feel. Service: This was the best part. With a rare exception or two, all of our service was excellent and very professional. The pool service was frequent and very cheerful; the valet guys looked slightly overworked but were always happy to help with directions, and everyone else along the way was great. Clientele: Contrary to other reviews, every child that I saw was very well behaved, without exception. Some of the parents on the other hand were not. The pool area had some flavors of an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153L.A. scene\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care for, but I found that if you avoided those with plastic surgery-enhanced chests, you could also avoid most of the rude people.

This hotel is about as good as it gets.

That all the rooms have ocean views and that the marble bathroom is as big as a N.Y.C living room complete with a wall length vanity mirror, shelf and seat are extremely appealing. The common areas (restaurants, lobby, galleries) of the hotel are all open air, but not guerrishly so -- also very attractive. But, it is the service that really sets this Four Seasons apart from the other luxury hotels. Ask for a restaurant reservation? It's made promptly and then directions are slipped under your door in an addressed and sealed envelope. Call down for your car? It's there before you can walk down to the driveway. Leave your breakfast table to get more food? A waiter covers your plate to keep the flies away. They know what you need before you ask. The service is almost sublime. We came with an infant. I can't imagine a better hotel for families with young children. They gave us a special fridge for keeping the baby's milk cool; a microwave for sterilizing bottles; a diaper dispenser; a crib with bumper and stuffed animals; a baby's tub and a plastic hippo mouth over the tub faucet to keep the baby entertained while bathing. They baby-proofed the room from head to toe!! The room was safer than our house. And the bumpers matched the room so well that we could barely tell they were there. Oh, and every day they leave a door tag that says \"Baby asleep, come back ______.\" Stroller, sun shades and other accessories for travel with a baby are provided on request. I agree with the other posters about the hoardes of children that take up residence here in the summer. They take over the main pool in the afternoon, leaping off of rocks and swimming into people like drunk sea otters. But, except in the main pool itself, they aren't a bother at all. They don't intrude on the cabanas or swarm through the restaurants. The upper pool, in fact, is typically empty. And there's a hot tub that's exclusively for adults. Frankly, the most forceful human presence is the 40+ crowd -- bronzed, lotioned and on display, sometimes frighteningly so. The spa needs to improve a bit -- facilities are nice but the massages are too much oil and too little massage.

Before we selected the 4S, we did a LOT of research, including reading the postings on this site every day (thank you everyone for your wonderful, candid reviews!), and decided that this was the hotel that offered the best combination of luxury, comfort, service, and an atmosphere that is kid-friendly (for our 6 and 12 year old daughters), without the carnival atmosphere. We were not disappointed and would highly recommend this resort to anyone (and have recommended it to everyone since our return). The service was truly world class!! We booked a partial ocean room, but were pleasantly surprised to learn upon check-in that we were given a complimentary upgrade to a Prime Ocean View Room on the 7th floor (Room 765 to be exact). (p.s., I don't know what the art or science is of getting a complimentary room, and I certainly don't take any credit for how we got the room, but it probably has more to do with availability than anything else). The room was amazing with a stunning full view of the garden and the ocean. As you can see from the pictures, we were treated to gorgeous sunsets from the comfort of our lanai. The only hiccup was that the room was not ready until 4:00, but Mandy from the front desk more than made up for whatever inconvenience we may have experienced by providing us with a complimentary dinner at Ferraros (which we neither pined nor asked for). Our girls thoroughly enjoyed their time at the Kids For All Seasons program. They made new friends (whom they still keep in contact with), bonded with the counselors (special kudos to Stacy, Molly and Nikki), and loved all the activities. They learned how to hula dance, created leis, built sand castles, had water balloon tosses, searched for geckos, built a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153volcano\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the beach, had a pajama party, participated in an introductory kickboxing/yoga class, scrapbooked, and created arts and crafts. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever want to leave!! (TIP: make sure your kids sign up at least 48 hours in advance for the kids evening programs as those programs are sometimes cancelled if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have at least 8 kids signed up the day before). I read many reviews that were critical of the pool size. I have to partially agree that it would have been nice to have a larger pool, but I never found the pools to be overcrowded. We also never had a problem finding a cabana. The outrigger canoe was a lot of fun. We signed up for the 10 am trip and were able to see a number of sea turtles. The guides were great: informative, funny and lots of personality. We ate at many wonderful restaurants. We especially loved Mamma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Nick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Sansei (went twice) and Roy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at Kihei. The cheeseburgers at Tommy Bahamas are awesome (juicy and tasty) and, ironically, better than the ones at Cheeseburgers in Paradise. For excellent fish \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcn chips and fish tacos, go to Kihei and look for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fish and Chips\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd eatery next to the Starbucks. The Sweet Spot (also in the same area as the Starbucks) has the best shaved ice. Breakfast buffet at the resort was great, although I would probably not do the bed and breakfast deal again. Although the food was always delicious and I have no complaints regarding the food or the service, 10 days of buffet style breakfast is a bit much. Some days, I would have been happy with a small bowl of fruit and a cup of kona coffee. If you do go, definitely try their macadamia nut pancakes (yummy) and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to ask for \"to go\" containers (which we filled up with fruit and danishes and later enjoyed on our lanai).

What night and day difference! While the island of Maui definitely offers more for the tourist (Hana, Lahaina, Wilea , Kihei and other sites to see), the island is just completely overrun with tourists and everywhere we went we saw crowds---a big contrast to the Big Island experience we had. Anyone looking for a comparable experience to the Hualalai's quiet, peaceful relaxation will be in for a shock at the Maui Four Seasons. Our shock first came when we checked in and a woman in her 60's in a bikini and stilleto heels came trotting to the front desk with a young 30-something male quickly following behind her. Immediately we got visions of LA and Vegas (after this experience, I really believe that this is where THAT crowd goes if they go to Hawaii). Then we were showed around the property by our bell boy, who did a fantastic job giving us an overview of the grounds, the beach and even the swimming conditions in the ocean! The focal point of the entire resort is the swimming pool, and on this particular Thursday afternoon, it was a complete circus, with kids running around and loungers and bodies on every inch of grass, tile or beach you can find. I've never seen so many strollers in one property! Then we got into our room. Our room, while immaculate and nicely appointed as you would expect form a Four Seasons, was definitely dated. The bathroom, with floor to ceiling white marble and gold and brass fixtures reminded me of an early 90s Vegas hotel. The WC area also faintly smelled from years of use. Our \"lanai\" barely had an ocean view and was dark, small, and not inviting at all. The layout of the room, with its extra large bathroom, made the entire place seem significantly smaller than the airy and light-filled rooms at new Four Seasons properties. In fact, the layout of the entire hotel (probably because they have less property to work with at this location) gives a feeling less of a resort and more like an extra-large, upscale hotel. I suppose it is a little unfair to compare this property with Hualalai, which is world-class by every stretch of the imagination, but I suppose this is also why this particular property is closing in September for a multi-million dollar, multi-month renovation. They understand that by other FS standards, they are behind the times here at Maui. But it wasn't all negative. Service was bar none, as again, you would expect, particularly at the restaurants we ate in (Ferraros and Pacific Grill). We got the bed and breakfast package and by the 2nd morning we were on a first name basis with the staff at the Pacific Grill. The valets were also excellent and always timely with getting our Jeep ready for our daily or nightly outings, and even with restaurant recommendations (thanks Jeff!). I got an absolutely fabulous facial at the spa (recently renovated) and my husband very much enjoyed his massage. While getting a cabana in the morning was a circus too, we managed to get one on the \"sea walk\" (?) away from the craziness and actually enjoyed the service there too, and for most of the day, managed to forget the chaos behind us! The beach is fantastic (if you can ignore the crowds) and you can't beat all the fun things you can do in and around town and on the island that makes the entire trip worth it. Overall, typical great service, food and ameneties are to be enjoyed at this Four Seasons. If you can find relaxation amongst the crowds, it is still one of the best choices for luxury accommodations in Maui. But for the money, I would wait for the renovation to go back to this Four Seasons. Maybe try the Kea Lani next door? We had dinner at Nicks on our last night and food was fabulous.

Sounds like it will be even better and a nice gal in Reservations told me about a website they created www.fsrmaui.com that answers all the questions I had (without alot of the usual PR fluff). After looking through I am definitely staying at Four Seasons - wouldn't dream of anywhere else and know that my honeymoon will be super - great guy, great hotel, great lava flows at the FS Maui pool!! I've been to other hotels where they either never said a word about any work going on or tried to cover up and by the time you find out (usually when you arrive) it's too late. Kudos to Four Seasons Maui for being upfront and also having an AMAZING hotel and staff....I can't wait to return!!!", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beaverton, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cFour Seasons, Maui is a romantic vacation resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5448733", "Content": "My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Four Seasons Resort in Maui. It was wonderful because the staff made it so. The day we checked in we had 3 bellmen helping us get out of the car, walk us to check in and then escort us to our room. Along the way, a bellman explained where the pool, spa, garden areas and restaurants were. It seemed every time we left our room, someone came in to replace towels and leave orchard blossoms in the room. The first night there we came back to our room and dessert treats had been left to welcome us to our first night. There was a coffee pot and individual packages of Kona coffee for us. I liked the coffee so much I asked where I could buy the individual packs myself and the concierge said she'd simply have as many as I wanted delivered to my room! That's service! The day before we were to leave the resort, the managers had a special reception for a few of us and asked how they could have made our stay more pleasing. There was nothing to say because any request we made was more than fulfilled by a staff who puts guests comfort above everything else. The pool was simply lovely in front of the beach access and the restaurant meals were fabulous. In the evening there were very accomplished jazz musicians playing in the lounge. This is not a place I would take my kids, even though they provide a wonderful kids program and a kids pool, because it's such a relaxing pampering place for those of us who need a romantic, quiet, pampering vacation. I understand the hotel is in the process of updating the rooms but our Garden View room was clean, spacious and had a very large bathroom. We really enjoyed the Four Seasons and will stay there again.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingsburg, California", "Title": "\u201cThe service is amazing, but....\u201d", "Author": "jr0777", "ReviewID": "UR5447983", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here last month as part of a four night Maui getaway after spending some time at a family reunion on the Big Island. Our first two nights were at the Kapalua Villas (I have completed a separate review for that as well) and the last two nights were at the Four Seasons. We were greeted at the entrance by the valet staff very professionally and while we had arrived before the room was ready every person we dealt with was the picture of service and gracious professionalism. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful and the concierge staff was also good and assisted us with reservations at the on-site Italian restaurant, Ferraro's for our second night. We decided to go off-property for lunch and then returned when the room was to be ready. True to their word, the front desk staff called my cell phone while we were on the property to tell us that the room was ready. Multiple staff members inquired as to whether we were celebrating anything (each separately and at different times so it must be a universal thing to ask by the staff) and after we let them know we were belatedly celebrating an anniversary we were greeted in our room by a cold bottle of champagne on ice. We had a partial ocean view room that was actually angled toward the ocean from one of the side towers and not looking straight onto the water. It was a bit of an effort to get to see the water and you couldn't see it while sitting down on the furniture on the deck due to shrubs that blocked out the view. While standing, you could indeed see the ocean. We had dinner off-property in Kihei at Roy's the first night (great food) and the next day got up early to get a cabana down by the beach located in small groups surrounded by the bushes near the coastal walk (sidewalk that runs parallel to the beach along the front of all the resorts nearby). Basically just relaxed all day and had some lunch at the cabana and then went to the room later to get ready for dinner. Early morning and mid morning was very calm at the beach, good snorkeling water, but by noon the wind starts picking up and by the afternoon the furthest left hand portion of the beach in front of the Four Seasons was closed due to the wind and swell near the rocks on the side of the beach. While the conditions were something to pay attention to it seemed a little extreme to be closing that part of the beach and that you would really have to not be paying attention for that kind of water to be a danger to you. Of course, in the past people have probably not paid attention and that is why they did that but it serves to cut off about 25 to 30% of the beach area directly in front of the Four Seasons when they do that. I also noticed that they removed the umbrellas from the beach lounges and started to collect the lounges from the beach by mid afternoon in those conditions. I don't know if it is a rare occurence that they did this, but it's something to be aware of if you intend to spend your whole day on the beach when the seasonal winds are like they are now. We had dinner that night at Ferraro's and showed up early to get a good table close to the beach. We got to see the nightly torch lighting ceremony which starts in the lobby lounge with conch-shell blowing and some hula dancing and may be a good photo opportunity for you if you want to take pictures of that sort of thing. The food was very good and the wine suggestion was excellent by our server. Everything went well and we ended up leaving early the next day to see the summit of Haleakala before our afternoon interisland flight to the Big Island. PROS: 1. Service is amazing. The little details like addressing you formally by Mr. and Mrs. and your last name by every person on staff to each person asking you what you are celebrating to make sure they take care of you appropriately. 2. Attention to detail. Little things seem to be what separates the Four Seasons even when you are not talking about people and service. Small decorative orchid floats in the fountains to Sony DVD players in the rooms (with free 48 hour rental of DVDs available from the concierge) and Mitsubishi televisions are signs that just the normal Costco brands of equipment will not be appropriate for this hotel. 3. Ferraro's food. It was very good, but of course there was a price to be paid (just like everything else). PRO/CON: PRO: Game room. 2 pool tables, 1 shuffleboard table, 1 ping pong table, 1 foosball table, 1 large TV with some chairs and a video game room all by itself with 6 TVs make the game room a pretty impressive thing to witness. CON: We used the game room for a couple of ping pong games and shuffleboard once. The shuffleboard match was stopped when an 8 year old boy (in the game room with three brothers or friends I couldn't figure out which and his dad sitting in a chair nearby watching baseball) continued to come up and grab the shuffleboard disks off of the board as we were playing. After the third time we asked him not to do that -- and the Dad who saw what was going on did nothing to stop it -- we decided it wasn't worth further aggravation and quit the game. Beware that this is not the only example of children behaving badly and adults behaving worse that we witnessed, but some of that has already been addressed in other reviews and I can only say that I either saw myself or agree with 80 to 90% of what is in those reviews about some of the folks you will run into here. CONS: 1. I'm not sure what the occupancy rate was for the two nights we were there, but it seemed very crowded. We are not big pool people, which is good because the pool was also very crowded and it's a pretty small pool. If you went early to get your place in a cabana or on the beach you were fine. But if you waited too late your pickings would be very slim. Seats later in the evening in the lobby lounge were also hard to come by and it seemed like there were just so many kids around, but I may have been seeing the same ones again and again because the kids that I did see that were in the age range of 6 to about 15 were basically allowed to run wild there. If you like your privacy, I suggest scouting the property for some of the more secluded cabanas or chaise lounges down away from the pool (unless you WANT to be seen) and getting one of those early in the morning. There is a 20 minute rule about abandoning your cabana (which doesn't apply between 11 am and 2 pm so you can get lunch), but I never saw anyone evicted and some cabanas were definitely unoccupied -- but with things there -- longer than 20 minutes and outside of that 11am to 2 pm window. 2. Prices. I know I shouldn't be surprised at the Four Seasons, but it's shocking nonetheless. Of course, if you are staying here you either don't care how much it costs or hopefully you have planned ahead for the cost or you plan to spend your money off-property. 3. Operating Hours. While at our cabana one day I was surprised to learn that drink service didn't start until 10.30 am and lunch service didn't start until 11 am. That means if you want something to drink before 10.30 you need to walk and go get it yourself. Hopefully this doesn't take you more than 20 minutes if they are enforcing the don't-leave-your-cabana rule. And I'm perfectly capable of walking to get my own drinks, but once relaxed in my cabana with a nice book I don't mind paying a few more dollars for an orange juice at 9 am to be brought to me. It won't happen unless you go get it yourself. Same with food before 11 am. Heads up. Also, the lobby lounge doesn't open until 5 pm which leaves only one bar (Ferraro's) down by the pool to get a drink. So if you have spent your day at the pool or beach with some sun and good reading and you would like a drink before dinner your only option may be the bar at Ferraro's which was full the evening we went there, so we couldn't get a seat or a drink. It would seem to me that when one is paying what they are paying at a Four Seasons it would be possible to get an orange juice at 9 am brought to your poolside cabana and it would also be possible to get a glass of wine at 4.30 in the lobby lounge before you have to be at your 6 pm dinner reservation -- especially if the only other bar is full. To be honest while the service and attention to detail are some of the best I have ever seen in any type of setting anywhere, I doubt I would stay here again. This being my first stay at a Four Seasons -- but with experience staying at other high end hotel chains such as Shangri-La and St. Regis -- I expected a better visit. It's not really the fault of the staff at all, but more of the crowding and the guests for me. Other resorts in Hawaii seem to have more space (especially on the Kona side of the Big Island) and less of a crowded feel with good quality service and a cheaper price tag. Of course, if you want people to wait on you (when their operating hours are in effect) and money is no object and you like to be around other people like that then this is the place for you. Maui is a good island, hopefully you will enjoy your stay.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cCrowded, over-rated\u201d", "Author": "lyssak", "ReviewID": "UR5439476", "Content": "My husabnd and I stayed here for two nights after spending five days at the Four Seasons Resort at Hulaulai, (it was great! reviewed separately).

However, many things disappointed. Our room (ocean view, 6th floor) smelled so musty that we had to keep the door to the balcony open at all times. The pools were a complete joke. They are tiny, and it is very, very cramped around the pool area. It is not very relaxing to sit by a noisy, crowded pool, six inches away from complete strangers. Also, the hotel was really, really crowded and felt that way. The lobby was like Penn Station. The small beach area is shared with many other hotels and condos, so it too is very crowded. The first night we were there, there was a \"luau\" at the hotel next door. Imagine 500 people sitting at plastic folding tables with an open bar 100 feet away from where you are trying to watch the sunset on the beach. Also--I am sorry to have to say this, but the behavior of some of the guests really is not what one would expect at a hotel in this price range (loud, obnoxious partying late at night; groups of loud, beer-swilling guys at the bar).

After staying in the Hotel Hana-Maui for the previous two nights and then going to the Four Seasons pool prior to check-in, it was immediate that my wife and I wanted to return to Hana. For more info on Hotel Hana-Maui, please see my recent review. This review is intended to help people make a decision as to where to stay and rreceive the best value for their money. I, like many people, used previous reviews to make this hotel a choice of stay for us. I personally made the wrong choice. It really depends on what you want to do and what fits your lifestyle. My rating score of this hotel consists of the following and I reluctantly give this hotel 2 stars: THE GOOD: 5 Stars - exceptional service from the concierge desk, beach guys, and breakfast staff in the Pacific Grill restaurant. If you want to go anywhere or do anything, the concierge will happily let you know about the activity and provide you with details and directions. Probably the best service I have ever witnessed. Fantastic staff!!! THE OK/NOT IMPRESSED: 3 Stars - The bed was huge and comfortable (Cali King). The room was nice, not overly impressive; the bathroom was a good size. I am not really impressed by big bathrooms since I really only use the sink, toilet, and shower in most bathrooms. I'm not sure why people have gone ape nuts raving about the room and bathroom at this hotel. The rooms are on par with a Mariott or Westin. 3 Stars - Ear swabs, nice shampoo, etc. Not enough to make me go OOOH since we travel with that stuff anyway. 3 Stars - Too many kids, teens, 23 and under adults. Where do these kids work for a living? I want a job. THE BAD: 1 Star - Four Seasons management. We asked for a late check-out due to our flight not leaving until 6pm. Checkout is at Noon. We were told that we were not allowed to check out late because people were arriving for the room. For some reason, I think it's because we weren't spending any money at the hotel (because we were off doing things and visiting Maui). This wasn't surprising to learn of the rejection since they never acknowledged our honeymoon, our robes, or our request for an upgrade. However, upon a second request and telling the hotel that we checked in late without any incidence or worries, that the hotel should return the favor. The second request was granted but we shouldn't have had to ask again. THE UGLY: 0 Stars - The room that we paid a lot of money for was described as an ocean view. See the picture. You can get a partial glimpse of the ocean through the leaves when the wind just blows the right way. When we originally booked this room two months prior, we requested an upgrade because it was our honeymoon. No luck in the upgrade but the front desk person said she would take our name down and upgrade us to another room if it becomes available. She didn't type anything or write anything down so I assumed she had a tremendous memory. I then realized that there wouldn't be any calls for an upgrade. 0 Stars - When we originally booked, the lady from the main office told us that we would receive robes with our initials embroidered on them for our honeymoon. When we arrived and inquired about the robes, management said that they were not included in our package. This wasn't worth fighting for so we said OK, thanks. The truth is we wouldn't wear the robes anyway. In fact, I would have probably used them to wax my car. What did bother me though was that we received two follow-up calls asking us if we wanted to buy the robes for $125 each. Do I need to worry about a car dealership mentality at a resort hotel? 0 Stars - Internet access. $10/day or $9/day for a week. For us, it was $45. Perhaps this isn't a big deal to you, but a little excessive for me to check email 15 minutes a day. 0 Stars - $12 overnight parking. I didn't see any free parking lots available. Again, some people might not mind, but the course of a week, it came out to $105 to just park and check email (not including valet tips). 0 Stars - $5.73 domestic beer. With tip, $7+. Great deal. 0 Stars - The pool. Small and overcrowded. I'll get to the guests here in a sec. 0 Stars - The beach. Overcrowded, jellyfish warnings. This was the worst beach that we went to over our 16 day trek across three islands. We went to 9 other beaches and each one had their own personality. I don't know how this beach ranks up so high with reviewers but it's lacking something. There just isn't any WOW factor with this beach which could be said for the rest of the resort for that matter. 0 Stars - The Guests. Where do I start with this topic? The reviewer who said something about pompous was dead on correct. Cases in point: Exhibit A: Little girl (about 6) runs in front of her father to press the elevator button. No problem. Little girl steps in to elevator where another couple is standing and tries to press a button. Little girl then realizes that the button is already pushed and lit up. Little girl, in a serious tone, tells couple to never do that again. Father laughs. The couple then approaches us and we both agreed that her father will be the one to blame when she becomes a teenager. Exhibit B: Lady walks in to one of the shops and places crackers on the counter. Her credit card is declined. She has them placed on her room account. She's probably mopping floors now. Exhibit C: Who takes a 3 month old baby to Hawaii and lays them on the beach? First of all, did your baby/pregnancy get in the way of your vacation plans? I'm sorry, but if I have a 3 month old baby, a) my wife and I are probably not going to Hawaii or b) our in-laws will watch over our baby in case we had non-refundable plans that we made a year or so prior to delivery and had explored all options to get out of the plans. Exhibit D: The Soprano's Wannabe's. Have you ever met anyone from Jersey (not that all people from New Jersey are bad) and they were loud, rude, obnoxious, and they just keep talking and talking and talking? Meet the Soprano\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wannabe's coming to a Four Seasons near you. Not only did their ---- smell like roses, but they were grossly overweight. They need to be in a TrimSpa instead of a Four Seasons spa. Exhibit E: The pool area. This was the biggest joke that I have ever seen. Very comical. People who fly thousands of miles to Hawaii to sit on a chair next to a pool every day. It only took us 3 hours and a day at the beach and pool to figure this out. These people talk about getting fruit and service and blah, blah, blah. Pay me (cash only) and I will come over to your country club or community pool and throw some pineapple your way. Just the thought of people traveling to lie at a pool is mind boggling to me. No road to Hana, no day spent at the world famous Ka'anapali Beach or Whaler Village, no sunset from the west side of Maui, no fish taco's from Jawz, no snorkeling with the turtles at the turtle towns, no mingling with the locals, no magic show? --- is wrong with you people? One lady told me the beach at the FS was the best in Maui. LOL. Again, the reviewer who said that the guests were pompous hit it dead on. These people are lying on top of each other at the small pool and you can just about hear them screaming for attention \"look at me, see me, it's all about me, I am the only one, look at me\". Very sickening. This is not a place to relax. In fact, it's downright stressful. +++ Are you seeing a trend here? Hint: Taking responsibility for the priorities in your life. I am not filthy rich but I do make a very good living. I don't try to convey myself as someone who thinks they are important by yelling on a cell phone at the pool, wearing my collar up on my neck (which looks stupid BTW), or investing hundreds into the latest swimwear. If it were not for the arrogance (and ignorance) that spewed from most of these guests, my rating may have gone to 3 stars. Enough of the guests because these aren't my problems even though it does make me feel great being around these types of people! Given our recent experience at this hotel, we will never go back to the Four Seasons again. Instead, the next time we are in Maui, we will stay in the Ka'anapali Beach area. That is probably the best beach that I have ever been to. Its kid friendly, amenity friendly, activity friendly, shopping friendly, and diving friendly. The only negative there was the lack of parking.

Five of our nights were spent in Ka'anapali, but we splurged and spent the last three nights of our trip at the Four Seasons. This hotel really is wonderful. If I had any complaints, it would be that the pool is small and lacks any original features and the atmosphere is a little too \"see and be seen\" to ever allow for true relaxation. Yes, this place is expensive, but you are treated royally. The staff is very friendly and helpful without being overly formal, which I like. You feel welcomed and remembered more so than doted on. We had a mountainside room. Our room was quite large and our view adequate. Note that these rooms overlook the parking garage. The 4S has done a nice job of camouflaging that fact by adding really beautiful landscaping. Though the view isn't a far cry from what it would be in an oceanview, the mountainside rooms are very, very private. I've read complaints about the mountainside rooms having a view of a large construction project going on up the hill from the 4S. It's true, there is a very large project back there. We really had no view of this project (a tiny sliver) but I could see how some rooms would be impacted. This property had really great bathrooms with a nice separate tub - a necessity for me in any luxury hotel. The pool area was really nice and that's where we spent most of our time. The cabanas are free on a first come, first served basis. This gives East Coasters a distinct advantage as you're likely to arise at 6:00 am every morning due to the time change. We never had a problem getting a good place with shade. We never really used the beach as we couldn't seem to pull ourselves from the comfort of the pool. The lounge chairs are really more comfortable than most beds I've slept in. Pacific Grill restaurant was just okay and Ferraro's was decent for lunch. We had a nice seaside cabana massage - I highly recommend. My masseuse was just okay, but the experience was wonderful. The locker rooms, weird as it sounds, were wonderful. They had the best shower heads and toiletries. Overall, I didn't love Maui, but that wasn't the 4S's fault. Everything about this hotel was top-notch, but I never felt any \"hawaiian\" culture on Maui, period.

The staff I would say is probably the best thing about this hotel. They remember you by name and are there to cater to your every need. The hotel grounds are also very beautiful. Depending on what type of traveler you are-the things that bothered me may not bother you. When we travel our main goal is to relax and use the facility. Getting a seat at the pool/beach bluff that is worth anything MUST be done by 7am. I would be up and out waiting at 6:30 and by 7:30 all of the spots that had the view were taken, you cannot leave your spot for more than 20 minutes or your chairs may be re-issued. They will give you a 2 hour window between 11-2. You cannot reserve your chairs only wake up with the sun. We learned this the hard way by sitting staring at a hedge on our first day. I think the policy is a bit weak. The resort was very crowded and really felt crowded people everywhere, so if you are looking for privacy you will not find it hear the beach is small and gets crowded too. The room is so not anything to talk about, we had an \"ocean view\" room that you had to look out the side of the room to see, the main view from our room was the road that lead into the resort yes cars driving by all day long. The bathroom is huge and in my personal opinion should be smaller and give more attention to the room. Again some of the things that bothered me would probably not bother most, but overall the resort is nice it has some nice perks, check out the gym very nice, would we choose to stay there again? Probably not. We stayed at the Sheraton in Kaanapali last Sept. and I would go back there first. Maui overall is pretty busy now so if you are looking for a quiet layed back place maybe Kapalua would work.", "Date": "June 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, MI", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Four Seasons\u201d", "Author": "goumgal", "ReviewID": "UR5326113", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon in Maui where we stayed at the Four Seasons from 5/31-6/3. We stayed in a mountain view room (742) which was very spacious with its high ceilings and very large and private lanai. From our arrival, we were greeted by name and with beautiful leis. Since we arrived at noon, our room was not ready so they took our cell phone number and allowed us full access to the property and spa/locker rooms to freshen up. We also received a free bottle of champagne for celebrating our honeymoon with them. During our stay, we took part in a number of on-site amenities including the Outrigger Canoe trip (awesome! we saw 2 sea turtles from 6ft away), tennis, croquet, etc. We highly recommend the canoe trip which was run in a very educational and professional manner, plus it made for a great morning work-out, just make sure you reserve early. The tennis courts were in great condition (synthetic grass) and they provided ice water and cold towels as well as a remote controlled ball machine, which my husband LOVED. The concierge desk was always very helpful with reservations and they always provided directions with each reservation which was a great help. They also have DVDs to borrow for free at the desk which was a nice touch since we love to watch movies late at night before bed. When we reserved our surfing lessons, they were able to arrange for pre-payment that was directly booked to our room which was very convenient as well. The exercise facilities were great! They provided Gatorade, water, towels, everything you'd need. Each cardio machine also had its own TV/remote and they provide new headsets you can use. We often used the locker rooms in the spa to shower and dress for dinner because they had wonderful steam rooms as well as everything you would need to get ready including towels, robes, slippers, hair driers, curling irons, flat irons, various soaps, lotions, etc. They even had iced cucumber slices you can put over your eyes as you enjoy a steam! They also provide \"dental kits\" which my husband said were in the men's locker room (or by request at the desk) which had a toothbrush and toothpaste, if you forgot yours. We were very happily surprised to find the hotel not at all crowed eventhough it was full and they were also hosting a conference at the time of our stay. There was never any trouble getting a cabana at any time of day. Although some of the ones facing the ocean filled up earlier, there was always a number of them open at poolside. The game room was also fun. It has 2 pool tables, a shuffle board game, a big screen TV, fooseball, ping pong and a video game room. This is where we spent our last hour before we had to leave for the airport. We did have dinner at Ferraros on our first night. We had reservations for 6pm which was perfect to enjoy the sunset. The food was good and service was great. We ordered a salad, shared 2 entrees (they split them and put half of each per plate) and shared a dessert all for $120, not too bad. I'd recommend the chocolate cake dessert...it's amazing. We also had breakfast at the Pacific Grill which was an awesome spread. A neat trick is that they allow you to take food out of the restaurant. I saw several people with plates of food at their cabanas eating by the pool. Since we ate there on our last day, they gave us take out boxes and utensils so we could take some food with us to eat at the airport later :o) Don't eat here if you're scared of birds though, they are everywhere! The wait staff are constantly coming around with covers for unattended plates to keep them at bay. I also enjoyed a frozen mai tai at the poolside, served in a hollowed out pineapple! It was one of the most delicious drinks I've ever had (big enough for 2) and you can't beat sipping an icy drink from a pineapple while overlooking the beach from your cabana. I also ordered roomservice from the kids menu one night when I got super hungry. I got a good sized cheeseburger, double order of fries, and an ice cream sundae for $18...also not too shabby, plus it was on Finding Nemo plates! A couple of bad/unsatisfactory points: We signed up for the free scuba demo but no one showe up at the pool at the assigned time. Although we're not sure if this was their fault since we weren't sure if maybe we were supposed to meet somewhere else and didn't ask. Also, housekeeping was so so. They were not always very prompt at cleaning the rooms, which was disappointing. One day we actually had to call and ask them to clean our room since it was 5pm and still had not been cleaned. There was some street noise from our lanai when you had the door-wall open, but it was totally quiet with it closed. There was one pool attendant who was a bit short with my husband when we were out claiming our cabana before 7am, and gave us a lecture about how this was \"valuable realestate\" and they could take our stuff if left unattended for over 20 min (which never happened during our stay and we saw many people leaving their cabanas unattended). We were also told by the valet that they did not have \"self park\" at the hotel. From what I've read in other reviews, there is...so not sure what's the deal with that. All in all we had a wonderful time and highly recommend the Four Seasons. They do a great job creating an intimate feel in a decent sized resort. You feel really special when you're there and always pampered. Although pricy, we felt it was a great value considering the whole experience and the number of complementary services/amenities.", "Date": "June 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cYou'll want to stay forever!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5314373", "Content": "We stayed at the Four Seasons from May 8-20, and I've gotta admit, we didn't want to leave! Arrival at the main entrance went well. A word of warning. The car valet service can get very busy in the morning, about 8-9 a.m. as people leave for day trips, and again in the evening when guests leave/arrive for dinner. At these times, you should call for your car about 15-20 minutes before you want to leave. Tip the valet guys and girls $1-$4 when you leave each time. They pool their tips. The lobby is impressive, grand, and very open-air. We were greeted with orchid leis and cool hand towels. Check-in was quick and painless, and the bellman delivered our luggage very quickly (tip the bellmen about $2-$5/bag). Our first garden view room was 302. It was at the tip of the south wing, and had a small, semi-private lawn which overlooked the grounds and pool. We didn't use the lanai very much because we were always out exploring the island. The room was clean (didn't smell mouldy like some people have mentioned), and the bathroom was really nice, with soaker tub, separate shower, two sinks, 2 robes, music system, separate W/C with phone, and the standard toiletry items (Q-tips, make-up remover pads, facial tissue, shower cap, sewing kit, eyeglass cleaning cloth, hair dryer, make-up mirror). The closet has lots of hangers, programmable safe, iron, ironing board, 2 pairs of slippers, umbrella, flashlight. The t.v. doesn't have that many channels, but we weren't here to watch t.v. There's also a dvd player (movies available for free from the front desk, but we never used this service). The comp. in-room coffee has whole beans and a grinder, regular and decaf. Creamers are in the bar fridge. The jars of beans are pretty big, so I don't know how old the beans are at the bottom of the jar! Still, it was pretty good coffee to wake-up to! We had housekeeping leave us a mini-fridge and a toaster, as well as plates, bowls and cutlery (no charge for this), so we could eat our own breakfast and snacks. There's a couple of 24 hour grocery stores in Kihei (about 15 minutes by car), where we stocked-up, and yes, groceries are more expensive here (a carton of Tropicana Orange Juice was about $5.50). Gas for the car was about $3.66/gallon. We were getting married here, so we had flowers, champagne, chocolates, etc., in our room, and that was a really nice touch. Our Four Seasons Wedding Co-ordinator, Julie, did an awesome job organizing everything, and we had no worries at all. Email me if you need info about the wedding package. I highly recommend her if you want a hassle-free wedding! It's worth the price! We moved into an ocean view executive suite for 3 nights as part of our wedding package. It was a great room, on the top floor of the north wing. If you can afford it, stay in a suite! See the pictures attached. The staff moved everything for us while we were out, so we didn't have to do anything except pick-up the new room key. The maid service even kept the page of the magazine I was reading! Maid service is twice daily, no matter what room you're in. Leave a note each day with what you want done, and what time you want it done by, and it'll be done! Don't forget to tip the maid service $5.00/day, and you'll have great service. On our wedding day, we had to have the suite cleaned up early, so I called housekeeping and they came and cleaned it right away, no problems! Now that's great service! Spa/salon service. My wife had her trial make-up session and her wedding day make-up and hair done by the on-site spa/salon. She really liked the hair and make-up ladies, but she didn't think the lady who did her nails did that great of a job. She says it was expensive, but worth it. As part of the wedding package, we had a couples, ocean-side shiatsu massage. It was great, and I highly recommend it. The sound of the wind and the waves totally relaxed me (I fell asleep). Our wedding on the Four Season's lawn was great! Julie organized everything to perfection! A note for anyone getting married in Maui. It gets pretty windy in the afternoons when the trade winds pick-up. If you have long hair, you're going to need lots of extra-strength hair spray! The wind doesn't die down until after 6pm, when the sun starts to set. You may need to find an area that's not so windy for your ceremony and pictures! Our reception was at the Pacific Grill. Food was great, and service was great! It was the only hotel restaurant we ate at because hotel food is so expensive, and there were plenty of great places to eat in Kihei. Okay, enough of the wedding. There's free coffee/tea and muffins/baked goods available by the fountain near the front desk. The coffee & treats are there from about 3-5am for people going to Haleakala for sunrise, or if you're like me, for anyone waking-up early enough to go down and get them and bring them back up to your room! After about 5:30, the baked goods are gone, and the coffee moves down to the stairwell just outside the entrance to the Pacific Grill Restaurant (lower lobby level, south wing). Free stuff. Lots of free programs to do. Email them or check the website. The gym is small. One room with Cybex machines, dumbells up to 50 pounds, no barbells, free water and Gatorade, towels, and it's air conditioned. Changeroom is through the spa entrance. Changeroom is nice, with lockers, steam room, separate showers (a lot nicer than my gym!). Cardio equipment is open-air outside and consists of treadmills with tvs, ellipticals with tvs, bikes,etc. Again, free bottles of water, towels, and headphones. The cardio equipment is really busy in the mornings. If you can, work-out in the late afternoon or at night when it's not busy. Cardio equipment gets covered-up at 9p.m. I'm not sure if you're allowed to remove the covers to use them. Other useful info..The parking spaces are tight. If you can, rent a compact car. You can park a mid-size car, but you might have trouble opening the doors wide enough to get out. There's limited parking in the self park (the first garage as you come down the driveway), but it's free overnight. Valet parking overnight is $12.00. Valet parking for guests coming to the hotel for a visit, dinner, etc, is free as long as it's not overnight (and don't forget to tip them). The valet garage is a separate garage closer to the entrance, but you're not allowed to self-park in it. Go suntanning and swimming in the morning when the sun's not so strong, and the waves are smaller. Use sunscreen with a high spf for the first few days because that sun is really strong! Definitely go snorkelling at the south end of the beach to see some nice aquatic life, or better yet, get up to the north west coastline for even better snorkelling! Go explore the island in the afternoon when the sun and sand are almost too hot! Bring lots of water and snacks, because even though it's a small island, it takes a long time to drive around (especially during rush hour, or when there's been a accident that's closed the highway). Ask guest services for a cooler and some beach towels, or blankets for Haleakala. They're free and very handy. The Hana highway was nice. Our relatives took a mini-bus tour and absolutely loved it! We thought the drive around the northwest part of the island was a lot prettier. Nicer scenery, closer to the coastline, and a 1 lane road/goat path! You had to pull-over to let the other car go by, but you couldn't pull-over too much because there was a sheer cliff! And you had to honk your horn before you went around the corner just to make sure there wasn't another car coming from the other way! Definitely a good reason to rent a small car! Travel the northwest route counter-clockwise. That way you're always on the ocean side, and it's easier to pull off to take pictures. (I think this is the road the rental car companies don't want you to go on because you could die). If you want a cheap evening snack and you don't want to go out, then order room service from the kid's menu. Lots of comfort foods, good-size portion, 2 side dishes, and only about $5-6. But the pizza wasn't that great (but I'm comparing it to a great pizza shop back in my neighbourhood). Places to eat. In Kihei, try Hana Fuda for saimin. Da Kitchen Express for great, huge portion lunch and dinner (eat-in or take out). Stella Blues Cafe, Maui Tacos, Peggy Sue's for milkshakes. All pretty cheap. In Wailea, try Maui Onion at the Renissance Hotel Wailea, but I liked the onion rings and fries better at Chesseburgers, Mai Tais, & Rock n Roll at the Shops at Wailea (upscale shopping centre). In Makawao, try Makawao Sushi and Deli, or Komoda Store & Bakery (but get there early). In Wailuku, try Sam Sato's and Maui Bake Shop for great, cheap food. In Paia, try Cafe Mambo for great food! I know I've left a lot of places out! There's lots of great, small places to eat. Get away from the hotel and go enjoy some great local cooking! Hotel pool. We never hung out there. We much preferred the beach, where great guys like Darrett and V. would come by with water and fruit and just about anything you wanted. Chairs, towels, unbrellas are provided for free. Better yet was driving to other beaches around the island. A great beach just south of the hotel is Big Beach. Stay there until sunset, when the beach is almost deserted and the sun is a firey red/yellow/orange and the clouds are pinky/red. Big beach, big sky, and big ocean.

However, from the pictures, it DOES appear that the reviewer stayed on the 7th floor. So, I'll give the reviewer the benefit of the doubt (although the picture of the grating over the parking garage is misleading -- you have to be looking straight down to see that grating), and give my mountainside room experience with the caveat that we stayed on the 6th floor. My new wife and I stayed at the Four Seasons Wailea for our honeymoon from May 22nd - May 29th of 2006. From the lei greeting to the celebratory champagne in our room, we felt very welcome right away. Quite honestly, the mountain view room (we were in Room 642) exceeded my expectations. There's really no mountain view, as flowers, shrubbery, trees block most of the view. However, the lanai provided PLENTY of privacy, and I heard absolutely NO road noise from Wailea Alanui and NO construction noises from the construction on the other side of the road. NONE. Period. If an outstanding view is important to you, then pay for a better room. The interior of the room was just fine. The bed was wonderful, the carpet a little old (but still clean), and the bathroom was simply grand. Housekeeping was a little inconsistent. We went one whole day without housekeeping for some reason, and their timing was inconsistent on other days. However, they did an overall good job, and the daily ice service is a nice touch. The pool area isn't as small as I was expecting it to be. I don't know when the \"peak\" season is for this resort, but I could see that this wasn't it. It wasn't uncommon to see pool cabanas available at any time during the day. The pool service is very nice, and not nearly as overbearing as I was expecting it to be. The pool attendants were very respectful, very friendly, and very quick to respond. Wailea Beach is simply fantastic. The water was gentle, clean, and the beach was immaculate. I've never enjoyed swimming in the ocean so much. We enjoyed dinner at Ferraro's and Pacific Grill. Both are pricey, but everything in Maui is pricey. I was a little disappointed in the breakfast options at the resort -- it is either the $30/person breakfast buffet, or nothing. I can't eat $30 of breakfast food in an entire day, so my recommendation would be a five minute walk next door to the Grand Wailea's Cafe Kula for a $9.50 breakfast croissant w/eggs, bacon, cheese. It was enough to fill the two of us, and saved us $50/day.

The only negative is the walk from these to the elevators which isn't such a big deal in our opinion. The facilities were top notch (especially the gym), they have a great games room and the pool and beach is incredible. There's always somewhere to sit and the pool staff top off your water it felt like every 10 mins. They serve fresh fruit, cold towels and evian mists complimentary and have a great menu should you choose to order. The concierge staff were happy and professional and covered every detail. For example, we had reservations at Roy's one night and because of an accident on the highway, they called to tell us about it and to leave more time to get there or cancel. We really enjoyed all the restaurants, especially Ferraro. (It was under construction however they served crab legs to make up for it by the pool to apologize for the noise).

Furnishings/carpets in the rooms are a little worn, but I understand a renovation is underway so these problems will likely be remedied. Much of your experience will depend on the room type you get. The mountainside rooms are very disappointing - views of the parking garage, close proximity to Wailea Alanui Drive (which runs along the backside of the hotel) with near constant traffic noise, and the hillside condo construction project beyond the road (very noisy). If these urban sights and sounds don't bother you then the mountainside rooms are no problem, but don't expect a quiet, idyllic island retreat. The gardenview and oceanview rooms are far quieter, although significantly more expensive. (I gladly would have upgraded regardless of the extra cost, but the front desk manager said that the hotel was fully committed and no other rooms were available.) On the plus side the fitness room is great and well-equipped and the cardio area is beautiful (on a covered lanai overlooking the pool and ocean). The restaurants are quite pricey, but that's to be expected in Hawaii and certainly in any Four Seasons Hotel. The pool and beach areas are indeed on the small side and crowded, and there really are no other public places in the hotel to relax and unwind other than the lobby lounge across from the reception desk which is small but quite comfortable (although drinks in the lounge aren't available until after 5 pm). Wailea itself was a bit disappointing (although that's certainly not the fault of the hotel) in that it looks more like Palm Beach or Laguna than what I imagined Hawaii to be.

We were spoiled by the excellent pool at the Hyatt on Kauai, but this pool looked perfectly swimmable with dual raised jacuzzis on either side. The beach was perfectly situated for swimming, snorkeling (recommended highly in this area -- saw lots of turtles just offshore), anything! A tip-- don't skip the manager's greeting reception if invited -- free strong Mai Tais/appetizers and pleasant conversation with other guests and hotel staff! Just do it.

First, the Four Seasons Camp (free of cost) did not have as many children present as the hundreds aboard the Disney Cruise Line. Each child was given a lot of attention by counselors. My children liked the activities better at the resort and the fact that the counselors took them swimming and for walks outdoors. They also had a nanny for my three year old. Second, the resort itself went out of the way to make the room child friendly. For example, the Four seasons child proofed the entire room before we arrived (padding around furniture, netting on the patio, etc.). Although I have paid plenty of money for expensive Disney resorts, Disney has never done this for my kids. Also, my children loved the little details that the Four Seasons provided. A stack of cookies, bathtub ducks and other toys sat on their beds upon arrival. Also, they loved that the staff put their names up on the bathtubs in sponge letters. The resort itself is beautiful. We had a partial ocean view room that was just HUGE. It was much bigger than standard resort rooms (including Four Seasons Lanai), and the kids had plenty of space to play. The only downside to the resort is the size of the spa. It is very small, and the services overpriced. The staff is excellent at the Four Seasons. We felt really special.

I can only outline my own recent experience and leave it to your own opinions.. My wife and I arrived on Monday - March 27th, 2006. A long 13 hour journey from Washington DC. Aside from the terrible weather which had been forcasted for our entire trip there (10 days), we were also surprised by the hotel's \"family\" atmosphere The Following day - our first day there - we both walk down to the pool area and restaurant to celebrate our new marriage with a pinapple mai tai. After two of those, I venture out of the bar to try and find a open chair/seat available around the pool area. There are none and the entire resort pool area is surrounded by families with a symphony of crying toddlers and other children chasing each other and screaming around the grounds. Chaotic is an understatement and I can only liken the experience to spending time at any amusement park wave pool so my wife and I decide to walk down to the beach. We kindly ask the beach consierge for a towel - he says they're out of towels and are trying to track some more down from the pool. Needless to say, when you are spending nearly $700.00 a night, this is not really what you expect to hear. I go swimming in the ocean and come back to our cramped space on the beach (no towel)which is packed with families and children everywhere.

The rooms were nice but not spectacular. The bathromm was huge and was the best part of the room. The immenties were L'Occtaine and were terrific. The bed was comfortable but the furniture and carpeting were in need of renovation. We had a partial ocean view room. Although we were far from the beach the view was great. I could even see whales frolocking in the ocean from the lanai. We booked the romance package. This included carte blanche at Ferraros (which was delicious), oceanside massages, monogramed bathrobes, breakfast buffet daily, champagne and bougainvillea trail in our room and a mustang convertible. It was about $200 more for this package but well worth it. (breakfast buffet is $70.00 for 2 people alone and Ferraros bill was $300) Yes the Four Seasons is pricey. Expect to pay $11.00 plus for cocktails (our pool tab one day was $80.00 for 5 drinks). Dinner for two can easily reach $250.00 on the premises but this is Hawaii and if people wanted to save money they would be in Mexico and not Hawaii. There are ways to save money if you want too. Safeway and ABC stores were nearby. Make sure to request a refrigerator. The one in the room is stocked full with minibar products. Four Seasons will provide you with a empty refrigerator on request. Restaurants in Kihei and Lahania were drastically cheaper than in Wailea were the Four Seasons was. Some fun restaurants to try in Lahaina are Bubba Gumps and Cheeseburger in Paradise. The service at the Four Seasons was top notch. Lei greetings down to the last name. I got the fresh fruit, frozen washclothes and the evian spritzes passed out to me repeatedly at the pool and the beach. The beach attendants do hose off the sand so it doesn't burn your feet. Everyone does call you by your last name. The valet guys were the best and provided water bottles, coolers and towels for excurisons. They also know directions to every place in Maui. One day at the breakfast buffet one of the staff noticed my fiance wasn't with me. They immeadiately inquired as to how he was feeling. When I told them he was sick they wanted to call him a doctor and provided me with foil containers so that I could pack him up his breakfast. Service like that is impeccable. However one day they wouldn't give me a bloody mary at breakfast because I didn't have my ID. I am 28 and didn't feel I needed to bring my drivers license down to the pool area so be aware of things like that. Anyway that was minor. The pool is small but I was there over Spring Break and never had a problem getting a chair at the pool. The pool also did not feel overcrowded and the hotel was sold out! The staff is very accomodating and set you up with chairs and towels at the pool and the beach. I also never had a problem finding a chair on the beach either. I usually went down between 9-10 AM. The beach was nice. The sand was so soft and the water itself was clear but not the tourquoise color of the Carribean. I could see whales while sunbathing breaching the ocean and slapping their tail on the water. Some activities that I would recommend in Maui are the Pacific Whale Foundation whale watch (saw tons of whales), the Blue Hawaiian Helicopter Tour (expensive but worth it), the road to Hana (hint don't wear a sundress and heels like I did, I was covered in mud and laughed at for my attire), oceanside massage, luau (don't expect edible food though), and snorkel trip to Molonkini. We ate a Mamas Fish House, Ferraros, Cafe Sarentos, Pacific Grill, Bubba Gumps and Cheeseburger in Paradise. I never had a bad meal and the mai tai, mango eruption and lava flow are yummy. I wish I was drinking one right now. I was almost in tears when I had to leave this vacation and am hoping to move to Maui or Oahu in the near future. We also visited Oahu and stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Hotel was great as well. The Hawaiian culture is beautiful and relaxed. The natives and people very friendly. Hawaii is truly an ocean paradise. All in all I did extensive research for 6 months before booking the Four Seasons and was happy with the hotel. The only drawback was being a considerable drive form other areas of interest. Lahaina was 40 minutes, the airport 30 minutes, Mamas Fish House was 30 minutes, the harbor for the excursions was 20 minutes etc... I didn't mind driving in the convertible but when you are on vacation who wants to worry about drinking and driving. The Four Seasons is great if you don't mind driving and want to be away from it all. If you like action stay in the Kannapali resort area. That's where most of the resorts are located.

I am a single mom with a very picky eater (ten year old son). We ate at Ferraros, Pacific Grill and Spago. At all three places, we were able to get my seriously picky eater what he wanted to eat (even though it wasn't exactly what was on the menu). They go out of their way to get what you want - the word \"no\" is not part of the vocabulary here. Only \"mahalo\" and \"aloha.\" Very friendly staff. We had a partial ocean view room on the 7th floor (the top floor). It was so spacious. We had room service every morning for breakfast and were able to see the whales very close and clearly. My son was so excited the morning we left because we witnessed a whale slapping its tail. Too fun. The only drawback was the cost of room service and the fact that someone was smoking a cigar on one of the balconies. You should know that while the resort is non-smoking and it is agains the law to smoke in public areas on Maui, hotel guests are apparently allowed to smoke on their balconies. So we had to go in early from our breakfast a few mornings. So minor drawback - but minimal in comparison to everything else. There are small refrigerators in every room. Whaler's General store is located only a few blocks away (The Shops at Wailea on the bottow level). You can get some food items there. There is also a Safeway a few miles away so you don't have to spend so much on room service. The grounds are so beautiful and the open-air lobby is incredibly inviting. My son got a kick out of the native who came around each evening to light the tiki torches and blow the conch shell (traditional ceremony). We highly recommend the helicopter tour and the submarine trip by Atlantis. If you take kids along, Maui Ocean Center was well worth the 20 minute drive. If you or your kids are not used to snorkeling in the ocean, I highly suggest a lesson at the scuba shack before you just enter the ocean. I learned the hard way with my son and lost my snorkel mask. But the beach is beautiful. If you get to the beach or pool by 9 a.m. or so, you can get your choice of chairs and locations (the attendants are so good about setting up for you).

Rental car - getting a Jeep wrangler is a must, or a convertible. It is truly a pleasure being able to ride around with the top off and see the views. You will be glad you paid the extra $15 for the upgrade. The jeep worked good for us bc it was the two of us. If you have a lot of luggage, you may have a problem getting from the airport to the hotel. Overall, excellent trip! We definitely will go back. We just need to wait a few years so the memory of the long overnight plane ride back can get out of our memories... Also, Road to Hana was a very nice trip. Be sure to leave at sunrise or before to beat the traffic. The road is very windy and narrow, and scary if your husband drives like mine. It would not be much fun in traffic. We went early and there was almost no traffic. Coming back from Hana, there was a whole lot of people on their way up. We were so glad to go early. Just a very helpful tip. Negatives: 1. The elevators in the hotel were only up front. We often parked in the parking garage (not valet) in the back of the hotel. If you had a room in the back of the hotel, it is a long walk to the front to go up, then walk all the way back to your room. Now, this was not bad for us bc our room was right next to the elevator with the Ocean View Prime room. 2. If we were to go back, we likely would downgrade rooms. You still get the great, friendly service and still a nice view. And, you save a lot of money. May not have been worth the upgrade. However, elevator would be a pain. If you are going to pay this much for Ocean prime, go ahead and get the club level for a little more. We hear that is the thing to do, getting snacks, drinks, etc - and the top floor level. 3. Food truly is expensive. We got room service for just a burger and dessert, no drinks, and it cost us around $80.

We requested an ocean view, but we got a view of the Grand Wailea instead which was a bit disappointing, but when we complained the the front desk they were very accomodating. The pool, though small, was so wonderful to lay out in. The pool chairs (more like beds) were heavenly! The food was spectacular, we tried all the restaurants and loved them. Yes, it is expensive, but if you are going to the Four Seasons that's what you expect! If you are on a tight budget, this is not the place for you. However, if you want to feel extremely pampered, the four seasons is the place to stay. Things we loved in Maui - The road to Hana was spectacular regardless of the mixed reviews! We rented a jeep wrangler, bought a picnic basket at the Hana Bay Juice Company and the CD and had a wonderful day. We swam under waterfalls, saw beautiful secluded beaches and just fell in love with Maui. Also, downtown Lahaina was so awesome. The shopping, the restaurants and the drive there were so great!

Anticpating our needs and guiding us to wonderful restaurants and sight-seeing choices. Private club level check-in with champagne was painless and when Spagos had just booked a large group Katy had the hotel car take us to the nearby Capische. It was a truly memorable meal and a great way to start our stay in Maui. Restaurants- Ferraro's was our favorite. My wife's birthday had us on the ocean's edge with a violin seranade. All arranged by Katy, no doubt without my even having to ask. Server nearby asked some people about their kids and they hadn't been there for 10 years. These people truly enjoy their relationship with the guests. Spago was disappointing for us. Seemed that because this was the most expensive place it was where the super rich sent their little kids with the nanny. Spago is trying to be something that Maui doesn't need. Pacific grill is more friendly with atmosphere only 20 feet (literally) below Spago. One day we decided to search for the croquet field we could see from our balcony. We asked one of the employees which way to go. He immediately parked his trash cart, escorted us up one floor, all the way out to the court and showed us where the water and towels were in case the croquet got too sweaty. That is what you get for your money at the Four Seasons. They are famous for this and this hotel has it together. I don't know if we'll go club level next time.

Cold towels, and Evian spritzes by the pool all add to the exemplary service. The Cabanas are great and FREE (unlike the Fairmount, next door). The resort itself is located in a perfect spot on Waielea - very quiet compared to Kanapali (one overdeveloped giant golf course!), facing West at the end of the beach, so it's basically just hotel guests hanging out there. The sunsets are incredible! While we were there, we saw VERY few children at all. And, there IS a children's pool where the few kids there were hung out. Although, I'm sure in August and Kid \"break\" times all of Hawaii is a madhouse. I definitely recommend going in Sept. Much more quiet and not as humid. We had a deluxe Ocean View room and it was very well appointed with a terrific Lanai (where we ate breakfast a few mornings), and a fantastic bathroom with L'Occitain products. The view is \"partial\", because of the angle of the resort, but beautiful (don't worry), and I would see no reason to pay more for an Ocean front suite. I also think that the Garden Rooms are perfectly fine, too if you want to save a few bucks. You're really not in your room that much. I highly recommend the drive to Haleakala for sunrise. You have to leave really early - around 3am, but it's life changing! We had rented a Jeep (also a good idea) and had the top down when we arrived. When they pulled the Jeep up for us at valet that morning, the guy had put the top up for us because it's cold at the top of the mountain in the morning! Little touches! Also, the hotel gave us blankets which came in handy! definitely pack a fleece (which we did) if you are going to do this and you'll be fine. FYI, the Concierge told us it would be 2 1/2 hrs by car to the top. It's actually closer to 1 hr 45 mins, but we were glad we got there early to ensure a great spot for the sunrise.

And 12 bucks to launder a shirt?? And parking is not longer complimentary' it's 12 bucks per day. It seems this resort is inching its way toward other resorts in terms of charging you little fees. This all puts a bad taste in our mouths for the resort in general. We did feel very pampered while we were there.

The breakfast buffet that is included is well worth it. It was Fabulous! The Hostess's were great also. If they know you are going on an excursion they give you cartons to fill up and take with you for the road. The dinner at Ferraro's that was included was well worth it also. We had a bottle of wine, appetizers, salads, we both had Lobster Risotto, and desserts. We figured we would have spent $250.00 easily. And gratity was included.

Overall, I agree with the majority of the reviews I have been reading for months on this website that this is a first class, magnificent hotel with beautiful views, wonderful service and nice amenities. I am not going to reiterate all the things that have been said with regard to those aspects of the hotel. Nevertheless, I think the hotel has a flaw and I would caution any reader considering staying here to go at a time when the resort is less than 60% full \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is an overcrowded resort. We of course were expecting crowds when we made our reservation. We had gotten off of a lengthy wait list for two adjacent partial ocean view rooms and we knew that every single room in this hotel as well as in every other hotel in Maui would be completely booked at this time of year. We had also read the numerous reviews here that discussed the overcrowding in the pool area and the inadequate size of the pool. These comments were all about the pool, however, where we never spend much time. In any case, these observations are quite true. The pool looks more like the centerpiece of a system of decorative fountains than a pool, and there is barely enough room for a few people to swim in it, let alone the number of people using it throughout the day. Although there is another pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the upper waterfall pool -- I would say that a maximum of 7 people can swim in it comfortably at one time. I am told they are building another pool, but I honestly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where they would put it. It looks to me as if the hotel grounds are at saturation point. In any case, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where they would put all the lounge chairs. There were chairs placed on every conceivable stretch of grass and concrete. On the first day we were there, it looked as if the chairs went practically to the entrance to the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how people can possibly find this pleasant. Also, contrary to what I had been led to believe, the nicest cabanas around the central pool/ fountain are reserved, and they have suite names on them. It was the situation at the beach, however, that we were not prepared for. On our first morning of the trip we went down to the beach at about 9:30 a.m. I had of course read about the 5:30 a.m. nannies reserving chairs, but again, I thought this all applied to the pool, not the beach. The first thing I learned as we looked out at the beach is that the FS only has half of this not terribly large beach cove \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the other half is used by the Grand Wailea Resort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a mega resort with somewhere in the neighborhood of 750 rooms, all completely sold out at this time of year. And of course, this is a public beach as well. By mid-afternoon, there are always a few non-guests of the hotel that plant their beach towels in front of the numerous rows of chairs of hotel guests. By about noon, when you look out over the span of this beach, you see a sea of people and chairs. It looks more like Jones Beach or the beach at Coney Island on July 4th than a magnificent tropical beach on Maui. Wall to wall people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c everywhere. It is more than a bit frustrating, because without these hordes of people, this would be such a beautiful beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is in a lovely cove, where the skies are normally bright blue, the water is a deep blue, there are whales spouting offshore, and it overlooks a volcano in the distance. But any potential serenity of the setting is lost due to the daily mob scene (which only quiets down after about 4:30 p.m.). So, on that first day we were placed in the back row of chairs with a view of the shade cover of the chairs in the row in front of us. We literally could not see the ocean (also a safety hazard, since we could not see our children when they went in the water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this water is quite rough). When I expressed our disappointment to the beach attendant, he told me there had been a long line of people waiting for chairs when he got there at 5:30 a.m. I was not about to do this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to me, it is the antithesis of a vacation. Moreover, the whole concept of rows of chairs, all packed in like sardines, was new to me. I have been at luxury Caribbean resorts (at times when they were full to capacity), and I never encountered a situation where there is no space between your family and the next or where your view of the water is blocked by other chairs. Here, although everyone probably does get a chair, there is no privacy, serenity and quiet. And you have to walk through a maze of chairs to get from your own to the water. The weird thing about it was that in the morning, although the dozens of chairs are already \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taken,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there are no people sitting on them for hours. They are simply \u00e2\u20ac\u0153claimed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by towels and paperback books. Yet, when we got up from our chairs to eat breakfast on this first day, I was told by the beach attendant that one of us had to be back in 20 minutes to keep the chairs. I really did not appreciate having to wolf down my incredibly expensive breakfast and the feeling of stress that this created. Also, I recall that the hotel had told me that the policy is two hours, not 20 minutes. In any case, whatever the policy is, it is inconsistently applied. As I said, I saw numerous chairs that were claimed and vacant for hours and after the first day, we were able to take 45 minutes or so for breakfast, but a woman also told me that when her family was given beach chairs by the attendant, they went to have a meal, and when they came back, their things had been moved. So, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. The point is that the crowds and whatever game one has to play with the beach attendants create a certain level of stress that one should not have when one is paying thousands of dollars to stay at a luxury resort. After the shock of the first day, we became used to the scene and accepted that this was not going to be a magnificent beach situation. We started to get better seats the more I complained (or perhaps the better I tipped). There is definitely a game one has to play here with the beach attendants. I am not sure whether I was playing it right or not, but I have written all of this because I think this website is for truth in travel. If you are going to stay at the FS at a crowded time of year, this is what you can expect. Moreover, in spite of all the foregoing, I still think this is probably the best place to stay in Maui. We went all over the island and observed the same (if not worse) overcrowding in all the resort areas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly along Kaanapali Beach. Maui, a magnificently beautiful island, is just sadly ruined by overdevelopment. At least the Four Seasons has a beautiful and newer looking building than the rest of them. The hotels along Kaanapali have a dated look about them, and although the rooms in the FS could use some updating (which they are getting this year), there is no comparison \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even to the other resorts in Wailea, such as the Grand Wailea. The FS just has a classier look. (Although I will say that the hotel has a corporate and concrete look to it that is no longer in style. The newer hotels, such as the Four Seasons Hualalai in the Big Island have a more natural, earthy materials look to them). Also, it helped us a bit to think of it not as a beach resort, but as a beautiful base from which to see the island. We were not about to come 14 hours from the East Coast just to lie on a crowded beach, when the Caribbean is far closer and has prettier, less crowded, beaches that are better for swimming (there was always a red flag up at the beach in the FS, the water was quite rough, and it was so murky that there was no snorkeling the whole time we were there). But Maui has lots of places to drive to, great restaurants, fun shopping, and more in general to do around the island than the typical Caribbean island. Although I would not describe anything as a great \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it is still worth it to travel around the island just to see what it looks like. It is fun to walk around Lahaina for a few hours. In spite of the amount of driving involved, it is worth it to do the road to Hana at least once in your life. I would caution anyone doing the Road to Hana to be selective about the number of stops to make along the road. Pick the best 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3 (which come at the end of the drive), such as the 7 Sacred Pools. And start with the ones at the end, and work your way through them on the drive back. We brought Maui Revealed with us. Although it is a good and very detailed book, it makes it seem as if everything is worth stopping at. Not true, and by the time we got to the good stops, we were already tired, and it was getting late in the day and dark. Also, to do this drive, you really need to start at 7 a.m., and leave the whole day for it. One last issue I have with being at the FS during the December vacation is that the hotel and its guests exude an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attitude.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When you get in off the wait list, you are made to feel as if you have just won the Lotto jackpot. I think some of it is hype to tell the truth. Although many of the people there were repeat customers, we talked to quite a few people who were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first timers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And once you have stayed there during the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Festive week,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it is as if you have an ownership interest in it forever for the same room and the same week, without having to pay any equity. Quite a deal. And the repeaters do act as if they own the place. They come in huge numbers, as groups of friends or families, along with lots of teenage kids, and they all seem to know each other. I had conversations with one or two sets of them (impossible not to talk when you are squeezed in together on beach chairs for the day), and there is definitely a snootiness which is proportionate to the number of Christmas vacations spent there. Likewise, I think the concierges contribute to this hype. Although they are generally helpful, in two instances we were told it would be impossible to change the time of our dinner reservations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of which was in the hotel-- by even a half an hour. In both restaurants, however, we observed that both were relatively empty at the time we came and for at least the next hour and a half while we were there. All part of creating the mystique I guess. We ate in all of the major restaurants that we have been reading about on this site. Spago and Ferraros were both beautiful and the food was good. Nick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fishmarket was one of the better meals we had, and it is very romantic at night. My kids ate a wonderful strawberries flamb\u00c3\u00a9 dessert there. Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bar and Grill is a fun family place. We loved Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish House (a 40 minute drive from the hotel). It has the most Hawaiian feel and it has a stunning setting on the beach. Longhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is okay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not great, but I did not care for the location in a shopping mall or its view out over a parking lot. If you go there, it is probably better at night. Dinner at Humumumnumuapupua (or whatever it is called) in the Grand Wailea was awful. The food was horrible for all five of us and incredibly expensive. There was a dirty smell all over, and the dishes from the few tables where other people had eaten were never cleared away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they just sat there surrounding us. The fact that the restaurant was empty made it seem all the more grim, but I suppose it tells you something. One last point concerns one of the comments I have read repeatedly on this site with respect to the FS Wailea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nickel and dime you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge you for little things that other hotels are purported to charge you for (though I have never actually been in a resort that charged for classes or use of snorkel equipment). But FS has more insidious ways of charging you for a lot more than a nickel or a dime. The most egregious example being the premium which families have to pay for interconnecting rooms. If you are a family of five, here, as elsewhere, you must get two rooms. Unfortunately, nothing in a price category below ocean view interconnects, and two ocean view rooms will cost a family of five several hundred dollars more per night than two partial ocean view rooms. Hmmmmmm. We beat the system. We opted for adjacent partial ocean view rooms (which had perfectly nice views). Our kids are a little older, and we felt that the savings was worth a few trips next door through the hallway in our pajamas. Also, fortunately, the terraces did interconnect. But a family with younger kids may need an actual interior doorway to be open at all times, and therefore must spend hundreds extra in the course of a week long stay. Why would a hotel in this day and age ever be built this way? In spite of the negative tone of the foregoing, we did have a nice vacation at the FS Maui. My criticisms for the most part go more to what the hotel is like in the time of year we went than to the hotel itself. I would go back again, but only if it were at a time when the hotel was not very busy. As I said, I think that in spite of everything, it is the best hotel in Maui, and that Maui, in spite of its commercialism and overdevelopment, is still a place worth going to. The service is wonderful, and FS has a certain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feel good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd formula that works -- the little touches such as the personalized gifts for the kids and the staff who all know your name. You basically leave feeling good about the place in spite of its faults. And it is very beautiful, crowds or no crowds.", "Date": "February 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "2", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "centralcoast, california", "Title": "\u201cWould Go Back\u201d", "Author": "createsmiles", "ReviewID": "UR4451655", "Content": "Overall experience in this resort was Excellent in several categories, and Above Average in others, while Neutral in few. The lei and tealeaves were fresh and beautiful. The auto valets were exceptional and lovely the entire stay. Professional and excellent! These gentlemen always offered bottled water for our excursions and offered directions. Conversations were remembered from the day before, all in all, wonderful crew. Impressive, their job is to get the vehicle and open the doors. Experience with their check in procedures was not what I would expect when paying thousands a night for a very large suite. Check in for this level of client should not be at the front desk. It should be that you are immediately swept away to your room where credit cards and questions can be handled discreetly. The suite: This resort needs a major overhaul and is scheduled to receive one soon. Probably why the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t another $1,000 a night. Our experience with this room is the furniture set up is outdated; there is a hodge podge of designs. We expected this, and were not disappointed. The room was clean, with the exception of the bathroom tile. It was growing a mildew experiment on the grout that I could easily wipe away with a washcloth. Knowing it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stained, I waited to see if the staff would notice it the entire trip. Never happened, they were not washing the tile. The suite was well appointed with good q-tips, cotton, bathing suit wash, etc. Overall we were really happy we took this room. The Spa. Wow! I loved it. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll love how spacious the steam room is. The lockers are so clean and organized. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is outstanding. I had an awesome massage by a professional, and superior masseuse. Not something you ordinarily find in the same person. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk my ear off or advertise products. She made me want to move in to the spa. The ladies who run the front desk at the spa were friendly as well. How many of you have been to a spa with that happening? Go! Definitely spend the $$ on the spa, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disappointed. The Concierge. Hit and Miss. The thing is this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we aimed for local looking staff and it worked well. When we tried otherwise\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a certain concierge was maybe unaware of her tone? We let it go, thinking she was a bad apple, problem solved. Ask a valet who the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153local\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concierge is and maybe it will work out for you. There are those who have the spirit of aloha, and those who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Restaurants\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Arg. Spago\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 where? Skip Spago or really read that front door menu, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and regretted it. The menu did not go with the brand. We had great service at Spago. But, the food was over salted and not fresh. Personally, I was hoping for a cool version of a Spago Pizza with Hawaiian ingredients? What happened there? Also, what is up with the liquor sauces? Not everyone is big liquor fan. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all want white wine, brandy, yadda yadda on our fish. The fish I ended up ordering was not so fresh or perfect. But the worst part of our experience was the seating. The chairs are comfortable, but they are low modern cushy chairs with tables that are really high. My husband and I felt like asking for phone books. Personally, I would run to Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish House before going to Spago. Ferraros\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Italian? Okay, if you like Italian this would be a great place. I find Italian food so easy to prepare, I cook it at home a lot. And, where we currently live, there is nothing but Italian food. I prefer not to eat what I cook a lot, can get at home, or when not in the region. So, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat dinner there. We were in Hawaii, not Italy. So, I found this restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existence really strange when there is a great Italian spot down the road, on the ocean in Kihei. How many Italian Restaurants on Maui do you need? You would think Filipino, Japanese, etc. would be more appropriate representation of the culture in Hawaii besides Hawaiian food. We settled to eat lunch there, because the excellent Pacific restaurant was closed for lunch. The food was okay and there are a few items on the menu that are not Italian. An inexperienced young lady who looked like she might cry any minute gave the service. The Pacific Grill \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 What a nice surprise. Wow. We were shocked. The fish was so fresh and much better than the other two restaurants. The menu was simple and lovely. Our server was conversational, and polite. We had a great experience and would go back a few times the next trip. But, we hear they are making it Steak and Seafood after the renovation. Oh well, hopefully they will keep the chef. Room service\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 shocking We were quite happy with Room Service. Our experience with this was excellent. The service outstanding, the menu was delightful, and overall a great job. This can be a weak point for the Four Seasons, so we were thrilled. Breakfast Buffets? There is a real menu with really great fare as well. But, a buffet? I know, I know, everyone loves them. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I cannot get the image of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All you can eat $3.99 and Keno! \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctil 4am!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd out of my mind. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like standing in line for eggs. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t I just order them and have them brought by someone who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make me repeat my order 6 times with me sticking my head through the heat lamp? My experience was not so positive. But, my husband loved it, and so did other guests, so\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 what to say. If you want lunch on Sunday, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian or Breakfast until like 2pm or something. Maybe you should go off the resort or have them make a picnic basket. These were great, fyi. The Hotel Crowd This time of year (Feb) is filled with the under 5 crew. Kids were well behaved and most moms were pregnant with their second or third. Personally, I like under 5. But, you should know they are there, yelling happily on the beach, at their own pool, etc. If you are escaping kids, this resort may not be the best choice. There, of course, was a conference. I have to say I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a big snob. My experience with the conference crowd is never positive. Our experiences with these other guests: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really like we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the US, right?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Water!!!!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when asking the waitress for a water refill; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bob! Bob! You made it!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they yell across a quiet restaurant. Conference goers always seem to think they are still at the office where apparently they are allowed to yell. I mention this because it can be a little annoying if you are a honeymooner, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important experience that should be addressed by the management. It always feels like you are crashing a cocktail party. I know they bring in money. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take the under 5 crowd, over a conference goer anyday. Internet Service The irony? Michael Dell owns the hotel. We experienced slow internet, dropped internet, then slow internet. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just wrong. (Maui is fairly far along in the technology department.) It gave us a huge nightly belly laugh. Who owns the hotel?! AHHAahhahaa.. The shopping is excellent. The artists are outstanding. We had fun lingering and chatting. Lovely talented people. The Beach. Chairs need pads. Beach needs a potty and lunch service. Or, why not have little wrapped lunches waiting to purchase on your way down there or something? Who wants to sit at a restaurant in a wet bathing suit? Service is dependent on the person in front of you. We experienced it all. Absent present, passive aggressive, super nice, professional, loud \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd east coast guy that made us uncomfortable and leave the beach, you name it you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll meet it in the beach employees. You must tip, you must have $$ in hand to get anything, but we expect this and have no issues, they did work hard. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be offered free ice water, cold perfumy towels, watermelon, so it is nice down there. Beach Walk Is simply perfect. Loved it. Go early to avoid crowds. Pool, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hang at the pool considering the pacific is down the small hill. Wailea Our experience with Wailea was one of awe. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perfect, in the same vein as Beaver Creek, Colorado, or Irvine, California. Built and planned well by big developers who sketch perfect places. Wailea is landscaped to the nines. If you want a clean pretty place to walk, shop, golf, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This is it. On this part of the island, the weather is wonderful. It feels very safe. But, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fool yourself and leave anything in your car in sight, we were warned. Downsides? You must drive a bit to experience real Hawaii. This is new Maui. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Hawaii, Hawaii. Checkout I felt like all bets were off. Like we got the boot. I would go back. There is not doubt in my mind that The Four Seasons Maui is a wonderful place to go on vacation. There are always quirks to places, and it seems fairly easy to take these things in stride at this resort. My review may be a bit picky, but I find it better to be forewarned. That way expectations are not created and disappointments avoided. The service was truyly excellent. This resort makes it a point to really know your name, both of us were. Also, the service here is not just good, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great. There were a few bad apples along the way. I figure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal. The general feeling is conveyed that you are a guest who is valued, they enjoy their job, and life is good.

We booked a weekend stay at the Four Seasons to celebrate our anniversary which was a little late, because my husband just recently returned from a deployment. My husband and I don't normally stay at 5-star resorts, but after our stay, we'd highly recommend it to everyone. We were happy to have splurged on the Four Seasons Maui. First, the details are just impeccable. We were greeted with leis upon check-in and given a cold handtowel to refresh with while we were checking in. The interior of the hotel is absolutely beautiful- from the marble floors, to the authentic artwork on the walls, beautiful orchids and pineapple plants on end tables here and there, etc. We were upgraded to a deluxe ocean view and treated to chilled champagne which waited for us in our room- our room was perfect as we faced the ocean and overlooked the pool and Ferrero's. Again, the details are what gives the Four Seasons 5-stars. There are little orchids that are placed around your sink, on your towels, even in your frosty tropical drink if you choose to order one poolside. There are nice L'Occitane (they don't even have a store in the entire state) bath products for your use, so if you aren't picky about your shampoo or soap, you can save yourself the trouble of packing toiletries. They even give you L'Occitane \"after\" sun lotion and Woolite packet to rinse your swimsuit with. Besides the atypical iron and coffee machine you get in every other hotel, there are comfy robes and slippers, a flashlight, and umbrella which are in your closet for you to use, if needed. Instead of a coffee packet, they give you a jar of whole coffee beans and a coffee grinder so you can grind your beans when you feel like having coffee, before you use their coffee maker. I could go on and on.... Second, the other perks of the hotel- there are daily, complimentary activties, such as oceanside yoga, aerobics, scuba, etc. The open-air cardio area has equipment with individual LCD TV's- you just check in to get your towel, complimentary water bottle and headphones to complete your workout experience. There's a game room with pool table, half-dozen PlayStation consoles with a variety of games, a ping-pong table, shuffleboard, and even a foosball table. Concierge has a variety of movies which you can borrow if you want to have a movie night. The pool was a perfect size for us- if we wanted big and \"obnoxious\", we would have gone to the resort next door. Poolside service was impeccable- they refreshed our glasses of ice water constantly, offered us fruit and Evian spritzes. Unlike some of the other hotels, we didn't have to pay to sit under our poolside cabana. We ate at Ferraro's twice- once for dinner (5:30 reservation ideal if you want to get a table closest to the beach to see the sunset view) which was good, though a little overpriced; we had lunch on our last day, and I found the menu choices to be better then. Both times at Ferraro's, we were able to see whales in the ocean (we didn't need to book a tour on a whalewatching boat as it was at the Four Season's backyard!). If you can stomach the $11 charge for a pina colada (or my personal fave, the lava flow), definitely order one of those...you're in Maui after all. We loved our oceanside couples' massage- the interior of their Spa was one of the nicest I had ever been in, complete with fluffy towels, sauna/steam room, sophisticated lockers, etc. We didn't want to leave.

I did not hear the construction once. But our lanai faced some kind of steam producing, continuously running machine (laundry?). We did not once sit out on our lanai. If that was a major concern for me, I may have asked to switch rooms. We did not spend much time in the room other than to sleep and shower. As another reviewer has noted, none of the rooms is close enough to the beach to hear the ocean. Our room was fantastic. No musty smell. The bed and bedding were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was gorgeous and gigantic. The twice-daily housekeeping did a fantastic job and the room was very clean. Food The breakfast buffet was excellent. I recommend a package that includes the breakfast. The day we drove the road to Hana, we were given take-out containers to fill. We had dinner once at the hotel - in the Pacific Grill. We were not as enthusiastic about this experience. The food and service were both just ok. And for the price, we expected much more. Activities If you are staying at this hotel, PLEASE take advantage of the many activities. The activities were possibly my favorite thing about the hotel. All complementary. Sunrise yoga on the beach is offered daily. The instructor Lisa was excellent. Fitness classes in studio and aqua cardio in the pool also daily. The pool classes were fun and it was nice chatting with other friendly guests. Snorkeling right off the beach - free equipment for an hour daily. The complementary outrigger canoe trip was awesome! Pool and beach The pool and beach are gorgeous. Sitting by the pool relaxing was heavenly. Never an empty water glass. Evian spritzes, cool towels and otter pops. The chairs, cabanas, etc. - so comfy with the crossword from that day's NY Times fax. There were kids around but they never bothered us. Some smoking of cigars and cigarettes near the pool chairs was a bummer a few times. Service Aside from the dinner at the Pacific Grill, the service was fantastic. No need to repeat what other reviewers have already said. There is a lot to see and do in Maui. We hiked in Haleakala and visited Lahaina, as well as driving the road to Hana. Haleakala and the road to Hana were great experiences. But it was VERY difficult to do any of those things because it meant leaving the resort! I could easily spend a week without leaving the resort (except possibly for dinner). There is plenty to do (or not do) right there in the lap of luxury.", "Date": "December 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cSimply the best\u201d", "Author": "Nittany13", "ReviewID": "UR4236628", "Content": "No need to mince words or write a long review.

We are still here and checking out tomorrow, so this one is hot off the press. When we arrived and checked into our Garden View room, it was very cozy, but had a strong musty smell (as noted by other TripAdvisor reviews). We called the front desk and they were very nice in accomadating us. After viewing three rooms, one of which also smelled musty, we were upgraded to a Partial Ocean View room on the fifth floor which was great. Bathroom is huge. Bed is comfortable. Yes, the decor may be slightly dated, but not noticably so and still in good condition. The service was amazing all around. Everyone knew our name wherever we went. We were attended to on all levels throughout the hotel. Poolside and breakfast service especially. This is what you are paying for in a Four Seasons and this hotel does not disappoint. Maid service was slow as noted in other reviews. Everyone was friendly, however, some staff members seemed rehearsed in their kindness--as if they weren't really paying attention to your responses and just asking stock questions. Here are some don'ts: -Don't stay on the third floor--especially in a Garden View Room. The lanais do not offer privacy. Fourth floor or higher only. -Don't stay on the forth floor of the south tower--they are renovating many of the rooms in this wing and that is where the musty smell seems to be more prevelant. -Don't eat lunch in the Pacific Grill. Although good for breakfast, lunch seemed pre-fab and average. Ferraro's had better lunch. -Don't eat at Joe's Bar and Grill (off hotel grounds). The concierge recommended this restaurant to us. The food was disgusting and the service very slow. We were falling asleep, too bored to eat. -Don't get a fluffy, gimicky spa treatment--they are just that. Stick to the basics and you'll enjoy the beautiful spa. Do's: -Do get the breakfast package on your stay. Well worth the money, as all meals here are very expensive. Sidebar: I know from expensive meals. I've stayed at with the St. Regis, I've stayed with Peninsula and the prices here were still higher, with entree's starting at $40 no matter what the item. -Do ask for an upgrade if you're unhappy--you'll be surprised what you can get out of the right employee. Keep in mind that you are paying a pretty penny to stay at the 4S and you should get what you pay for. Don't tolerate anything sub-par. -Do eat at Spago. It was delicious. -Do whatever it takes to get to Mama's Fish House, which was the highlight of our dining experiences on Maui.

The first night we were there, my boyfriend proposed while walking on a path overlooking the water at sunset - it was breathtaking. We got back to the hotel, and after waiting in line for 10 minutes, asked the concierge if we could have some romantic candles and bubble bath for our room. I was told that they didn't have anything, and oh by the way congratulations on your engagement. My friends stayed at the Marriott and was sent chocolate strawberries. Not a big deal - but it is the little details that make a difference. Later, while watching the 4S promo on TV with all their activities, they showed a romantic evening in your room with candles and bubble bath; well someone doesn't have their story straight. When checking in we were upgraded to an ocean partial view, and it was a lovely room, however I was extremely surprised at how noisy it was. We left the door to the patio open, and our neighbors on the next porch stayed up talking until 1:00am. We closed the doors and the shutters, and could still hear them. We were again awoken by the infant below us at the 3am and 7am feeding times. As I was up early, I was able to sit at one of the best seats at the pool overlooking the ocean. Which almost made up for the lack of sleep. They have a nice touch of passing out popcicles in the afternoon, and after snorkling that would have hit the spot, but even after repeated requests - never saw one. We did however order some refreshing mojitos, which were delicious. Spagos was fantastic - one of the best meals during our 10 day stay in Maui. I had requested late checkout when I booked the room 6 months previously. They gave us until 2:00pm and then we were able to store our bags with the bellman, and continue to hang out at the ocean, and use the Spa's facilities. The couple next to us, who just booked their room a few weeks ago, were given the option to move to another room during the day and check out whenever they wanted to that evening... so although I don't think they were playing favorites, I think some of the employees will bend over backward for you, and some will not.

No hotels are super close to the ocean in maui like you have seen in florida etc. 2. we visited the ritz, fairmont, and grand wailea, and those places weren't even close to the quality of 4S, not even close. 3. the best 4 meals we have ever had were at spago-- one of the restaurants inside the hotel. we ate at ferraros (average), and the pacific grill (average), mama's fishouse (excellent), nicks at the fairmont (excellent), capiche (excellent with fantastic panoramic view--make reservations for sunset and request a table at either end of the patio). 4. I have read a few people complain about the service, but we had no problems whatsoever. Paying as much as we did for this vacation, i expected a lot, and received it. I truly feel, despite the expense, it was value. Yes, dinners and buffets are expensive, but the quality is unlike anything we have had. The freshness, service, and restaurants are some of the best in maui. Also, none of the other hotels we visited have anywhere close to the views that the restaurants in the 4s has. 5. If we had 1 complaint, it was on the outdatedness of the rooms. the beds were comfortable, the bathroom very big and modern, but the rest of the room was pretty outdated. i spoke with a manager about this and he said they are updating throughout all of 06. 6. the little things...from private tv's on each workout machine, to our housekeeper adding bookmarks in our books laid upside down, to the SIGNIFICANT amount of FREE activities included in our stay, we were more than pleased. 7. take advantage of all the free things the hotel offers...scuba lessons, tennis, workouts, yoga, snorkeling (the location directly in front of the hotel is where all people who pay for the excursions go), music in the lobby, newspapers, and many more. overall, we are going back for sure and were impressed with 4s.", "Date": "November 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Amazing!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4122821", "Content": "We just returned from our wedding/honeymoon and are already planning our anniversary at the Four Seasons!

Further more, we had noise from the car park, road and if that was not enough, from the construction site across the street (we were not informed of this construction when I made the reservation). So I had a chat with the manager who informed me that all the rooms in our price category had the same location and view - I guess she didn't get my point that what was advertised was not delivered! She also kept on mentioning how the resort had lots of extras included, and that they did not 'nickel and dime' like other resorts.

We typically stay at the higher end Marriotts (Marriott and JW Marriott) but decided to splurge for our honeymoon. The services they offer are vast, but very subtle, so you really need to be in the know in order to appreciate them. There were some things that we didn't find out until checkout when we overheard the desk clerk telling a new guest about some options and services that they never told us and I'm sure there are others we never knew about at all. My recommendation here is to talk to as many hotel staff as possible in the first day or two about what services are available because you'll hear different things from different people and then you'll be able to take advantage for the rest of your stay. We paid for an oceanview room, but I think they are a bit generous with their description - if you turn your head all the way to the side and look between all the trees and landscaping (which is beautiful) you see a small amount of water. The hotel is only 7 stories and we were on 5, so maybe the same room has more ocean in the view on a higher floor. Just keep this in mind. Also, all beaches in Maui are public, so the hotel can only go so far up to the beach, which makes it set back a bit and it means the public will be at your beach (this is at all hotels). The days we were there the beach was never crowded, but it's just something to think about if you've never been to Maui. The beach of the hotel, Wailea Beach, was gorgeous and had great snorkling right off the beach. We rented our snorkling gear from Snorkle Bob for the duration of our stay because even though the FS gives you free rentals for one hour per day, they won't rent on days the beach flag is red and if you want to go out when you want for as long as you want, go to Snorkle Bob's, get fitted for equipment that fits you, and keep it for your vacation. They even rent wet suit jackets, which I recommend if it's not summer and you're easily cold. By the way, even though the FS sells rash guard shirts which they claim helps keep you warm, it doesn't - it only protects from the sun. If you want a rash guard shirt, buy one at the Maui Dive Shop and save half ($25). Not surprisingly, everything at this hotel is rediculously expensive, though we went next door to the Grand Wailea for lunch and it was equally expensive. A drink is $12. An omelet is $22, oatmeal is $10.50, and the full buffet breakfast offered everyday is $27. And this is just breakfast. Note - if you get the buffet DO NOT leave your food on your table to grab something else - the birds will attack your plate and then you'll have to make a whole new plate. The staff do not tell you this - they try to get a cover on your plate before the birds get to it, but they are not always successful. We ended up only eating at the hotel occasionally and trying to save some money by driving into town 10 minutes away (Kihei) where there are a plethora of restaurants to choose from at reasonable prices. There are also a few internet cafes which offer free internet access on their laptops (we used the one next to Pizza Hut). For those quick e-mails with the family this is better than the $10 per day the hotel charges. Also, for those used to the Carribbean hotels, there are no floaties in the pools at any hotels in Maui - I guess it's a Carribbean thing. So if you're like me and enjoy just laying on a float in the pool, you'll need to buy one (Foodtown had them for $2.95) but be prepared to stand out. You'll also need to use the \"kiddie pool\" as no floats are allowed in the main pool. Overall, our stay was fantastic. We checked out the Grand Wailea one day and avoid it unless you are ok with noise, crowds, lots of kids and needing to wear several different colored wrist bracelets. The only other hotel I would have considered is the Fairmont, which we didn't go to because we heard they charge extra for things the FS includes - like cabanas, but it's worth looking into. My last piece of advice is to call the hotels directly to ask your questions - do not rely purely on websites or your travel agent - ours was slightly misinformed and a call to the hotel prior to booking would have cleared things up.", "Date": "November 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cExceeded our expectations!\u201d", "Author": "fitgal", "ReviewID": "UR4086816", "Content": "We initially were going to stay at the Ritz Carlton but based on the reviews we decided to go with the Four Seasons. We are really happy we did! We went to the Four Seasons in October and, from the moment we stepped out of the taxi, to the moment we left the resort, was one of the best vacations we ever had! The service was exceptional and the staff were really nice! I'll try to not duplicate other posts, so I'll focus on other aspects of our stay. There are a ton of free amenities available to those staying on the property. For you early birds, one can grab some free muffins and free coffee/tea daily between 5:30 and 6:30 near the lobby (coffee and tea are served until 10 AM or so). If for some reason they run out of muffins prior to 6:30, just ask the front desk to call someone to replenish them. We took advantage of the muffins daily as a snack prior to working out in the morning. Of course, we would have loved to see some fruit available as well. We took advantage of the free classes every day. Most of the classes are for the beginner; but some are intermediate (those are flagged with a star). We took spinning, urban rebounding, core on the ball, and a total body conditioning class using light weights. All classes were fun and enjoyable. However, the flooring in the aerobics room needed to be repaired in a couple of spots. In addition to the classes I mentioned, they also offer water aerobics, yoga, pilates, meditation, and tai chi. We also signed up for the outrigger canoe. What fun! Sign up for the 7 AM trip for the calmest water. There is a trade-off though. The turtles usually don't appear until the 8:30 trip. However, the water isn't as calm then, though. Be sure to sign up early as it fills up quickly. We, too, took advantage of the buffet breakfast. I want to point out that after you eat your fill you can request a \"to go\" container. We did this after seeing a couple of people with them. We filled up one with fresh fruit and the other with muffins (once we even made a sandwich with the bread and lunch meat provided for the plane! In fact, our server gave us some mini mustard and mayo for our sandwiches!). This to go container really came in handy for a nice lunch later in the day. This also was useful for the early morning when we made the drive up to the top of Haleakala. The morning before, we also asked for two empty cups that we filled the morning of our drive with coffee. For those of you making the drive to the top of Haleakala, be sure to tell the valet that you're making this trip. They will place blankets in your car to help keep you warm (they also will put bottled water in your car, too). We primarily ate on the premises but for the two days we rented a car (you can rent one daily from the resort) we ate off property. The town of Kihei right up the street has wonderful restaurants and shops. We ate at Sensei's for Sushi (we ate at the one in Kapalua the last time we were on the Island). They offer wonderful food and we highly recommend them. For breakfast, we ate at Kihei Caffe and wished we discovered them earlier.

Upon arrival we were informed that valet parking is no longer complimentary as of October 1st. They now charge $12 per day. This would not be that big of a deal except their parking lot offers unreasonably small parking spaces. There is literally a pole in every singe parking spot. Cars are jammed next to each other and against the pole. Some people didn't want to park next to the pole so they simply chose not to pull into the space, making it difficlt for others to navigate through the garage. I am from Chicago and am used to small parking spaces and parking garages, but this is the worst parking situation I have ever seen. The hotel is pretty and were were greeted with Leis and champaign upon our arrival. We had paid for a partial ocean view room and the room was nice. However, on the third night of our stay a couple checked in next to us with an infant. This child woke up screaming 2-3 times per night and was up crying by 6:00AM every morning. The first night we let it slide, but after the second night we decided that we did not enjoy being woken up by crying 2-3 times a night on our honeymoon. It sounded like this child was in our room. We talked to the hotel and they informed us that they did not have any other partial ocean view rooms available. They could only downgrade us to a moutain view (ie. parking lot) for the same price that we paid for the partial ocean view or we could pay an extra $80 a night for a full ocean view. This is simply unacceptable. We paid for a partial ocean view room and we were not about to have a view of the parking lot for what we had paid. They absoulutely refused to upgrade us for free (obviously there was availability if they were willing to charge us for it). After arguing with the hotel we endured the remainder of our trip with the screaming child. This is not the service we paid for or expected from the Four Seasons.

What I can say is that I had very, very high expectations and 4S truly exceeded them. While the resort/grounds/room were all fantastic and very luxurious, the service was what I will remember the most- every single employee I encountered was a joy. It was truly unlike anything I have experienced before. We walked thru the Kea Lani and Grand Wailea and thought both were no where near as impressive overall. I see other reviewers who stayed here at the same time I did complaining of not getting cabanas... we didn't even attempt to before 10am every morning and had absolutely no problem getting a good one. Maybe there are a couple of coveted spots that they are referring to... A couple of recommendations... 1) I would get at least a garden view room, as they are indeed doing condo construction across the street and it won't be finished anytime soon- and, those mountain view rooms look away from the resort/ocean so they don't feel as 'connected' to the hotel in my opinion. Even though October is supposed to be low season for Hawaii, this resort was filled all week and thusly we couldn't get an upgrade- so it's true that you cannot go expecting an upgrade (although I would guess the garden/partial ocean view rooms are the most popular so if you're booking a room above that your chances probably increase). 2) Make a trip to the convenience/grocery store early on for snacks/drinks... I was astounded that in the entire resort there were few choices for getting a cold soda: 1 vending machine in the game room ($2 for a 20 oz. bottle) or $4 a pop for 12 oz. cans in your room's mini fridge or the restaurants. Might seem trivial given the overall cost but it was annoying. Whaler's General Store is in the Shops at Wailea close by and makes a good option. 3) While there are several great snorkeling spots throughout the island, 2 of the best are close by. Right off the 4S (Wailea Beach) shore and to the left is excellent- great visibility, variety of fish and reef life (and a nice sea turtle nest a few hundred feet out in front of the condos next door, you'll see cattle boats bringing people here some mornings). Also 'The Aquarium' is about a 15 minute drive down the road, but it will take a solid 45 minutes to hike to the cove and the footing is all jagged lava so tennis/hiking shoes are a must, but it is really worth it. As with all Maui snorkeling go very early in the morning to avoid the winds, heat, crowds, high tide. While the visibility at Molokini is the best I've ever seen it was not worth the money when there is better snorkeling for free off the island shores. 4) Lots of great dining options in South Maui... I have eaten at many a fine dining restaurant on the mainland and thought Maui held its own very well. Sarento's was certainly one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant- the calamari and tiger shrimp are out of this world. Great wine list. I would also highly recommend Pacific Grill for dinner (Ferraro's does have a better view of the sunset but the menu and atmosphere at PG was nicer, and PG still has a great sunset view- try the Kobe steak), Ruth's Chris, and Capiche. All the restaurants in the Shops at Wailea no longer have a nice view due to condo construction but are still good breakfast or lunch options. In summary, sure, there are some things that could be improved here, but they are the smallest of things and few at that. People come here and expect all the details to be right and they shouldn't be disappointed. Staying here has certainly whetted my appetite for 'The Four Seasons experience' elsewhere, as this is apparently a well regarded 4S but apparently not even top 10 among the 4S lovers, and not even #1 in Hawaii for most.

The answering service for the hotel didn't even have the correct info, so we were a little miffed to arrive at the hotel 20 minutes later to discover they charge. We gave feedback to the front desk, but there was no attempt made to provide the service for free since it was not communicated correctly. To my delight, we were upgraded from a full ocean view to an ocean view prime. It was very nice. Amazing bathroom and Loccitane products for those of you who are familiar. The cabanas by the pool and on the beach were lovely. We got a big kick out of the game room and cut costs by getting maui tacos for lunch and eating them on our balcony. The food, spa, and drinks are OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive, but as long as you know that going into it and can let it go, it's no big deal.

Some of this is picky but when you are staying at the hotels of this caliber, there should be standards they should meet. We went to Maui for our honeymoon and stayed for 1 night at Kapalua Bay Hotel, 2 nights at the Ritz-Carlton in Kapalua and 4 nights at the Four Seasons in Wailea. In hindsight, we should have stayed longer at the Ritz-Carlton. We stayed at the Four Seasons in their Mountain-view room. The good aspects: 1) The pool and the views were beautiful. The beach was gorgeous, the water calm and the walkway to the other beaches is extremely convenient. 2) The amnenities were great. Comfortable bed, nice bathrooms and beautiful facilities. 3) The doormen and concierge staff were great and extremely helpful. 4) We were welcomed with Champagne and goodies delivered to our room in celebration of our honeymoon. The bad: 1) We had the mountain-view room and enjoyed the noises of the streets and a view of the roof of the garage on the lanai. I understand we were not paying for the most expensive room, but it wasn't cheap either. In addition, our toilet was running the first night and was supposedly fixed the next day. To our dismay, our toilet overflowed the following day and did not stop until the entire bathroom floor was flooded and spilled into the hallway. Who wants to deal with this on their honeymoon?? The staff were kind enough to move us to a ground floor room that day (partial ocean view) but did not have the hypoallergenic bedding we requested. We had to call maid service and wait for another half hour for this. The manager did recognize our frustration and sent a note of apology and a box of chocolates. That did very little to diminish our disappointment since we had to spend time packing our stuff up so they could move our things to another room, watch our floor flood in the bathroom and wait for proper bedding. Things do happen, we understand. However, we expected more from managament recognizing this inconvenience. When you have things to do on your honeymoon, the last thing you want to do is spend the time in your room packing your things up again to be moved. 2) The breakfast buffet in the hotel was not very good. After eating other breakfast buffets at the other hotels, we were disappointed at the quality and selection of food plus the fruit flys and birds flying around didn't add much to the ambiance. 3) The staff were nice, pleasant but it never seemed sincere. The service was great at the Ritz and Kapalua Bay Hotel and always seemed sincere. I expected the same at the Four Seasons. 4) The pool always felt crowded, even when it was not full. The cabanas are very close to each other and you feel like you are on top of other people. If you are looking for seclusion, quiet and a beautiful area, the Ritz-Carlton in Kapalua is the better choice. It did rain and it was windy but it was not crowded at the pools or in the hotel. The beaches weren't as nice as the beaches in Wailea and the restaurant selections were not as plentiful, but the quality of the hotels and service in Kapalua won us over. If you are looking more for convenience of location and great beaches then stay at the Four Seasons.

The staff were excellent and anyone we asked for assistance was extremely helpful. We tried all of the restaurants. Ferraro's is the best for lunch or dinner. Seats by the ocean are first come, first serve but well worth showing up for at 11:30. We had drinks one night later in the lobby bar. The entertainment was pleasant but the service on drinks was very slow. Waited 15 mins to be served even though we asked twice. Spagos was very disappointing. It is highly overrated and I recommend you do not go there. The service was average and after we sat in the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail and I watched all the plates coming from the kitchen by bare handed servers, it was clear the plates were not hot. When ordering dinner, I specifically requested my plate be \"smoking hot\" and was advised it would be no problem. Appetizer of lobster risotto was served luke warm on a stone cold plate. Dinner came on the same, so I sent it back. Should not have had to. A restaurant of this calibre should never serve hot food on cold plates. To their credit they gave us our desserts complimentary but overall we were very dissatisfied with the whole experience. If you want an excellent dinner, go to Capische.

Previously we have stayed at the Grand Wailea and the Kea Lani, after leaving the Kaanapali area when we felt it became too crowded with hotels and tourists. Unfortunately, the same thing is happening in Wailea. We chose the golf/mountain view after having an oceanview room on the Big Island, realizing we would not have that same experience. However, the hotel should make guests aware, that if you choose those rooms you will be: (1) Very close to the main road in Wailea and will hear cars zooming past your balcony (2) Adjacent to the parking garage with it's noise (3) Directly in view of a huge construction project just across the road. Heavy earth moving equipment woke us up most mornings by 7:00 AM. This is not the quiet Hawaiian experience we have come to appreciate on our visits to the islands. We did not sit on our balcony at all because of the noise. The mountain view was OK, but after the townhouses are built, that will change as well. The pool area is VERY small, and quite shaded. The beach was also crowded and you needed to be there before 10:00 AM to get an umbrella. The beach attendants did their best to put shade canopies on lounge chairs and accomodate us, however. It is a nice swimming and snorkeling beach. It seems, however, like a large resort on a small tract of land between two larger, more expansive hotels. The townhouse project (175 units) across the street will only add to the congestion in this area. The Shoppes at Wailea is a nice addition to this area and we enjoyed Ruth's Chris and Cheeseburger, Mai-Tais and Rock n Roll. This was our first, and probably our last stay at this Four Seasons. We will choose to stay at the Kea Lani on our next visit, or the more quiet area of the Ritz Carlton.

They rarely say no to anything. The poolside service is very, very good. 3)Pool: I agree that, for the price tag, a larger pool may be in order. However, the overall pool experience is top notch and provides a respectfully social atmosphere that only rarely deteriorates into a sardine-like event.

The Four Seasons Resort sits right on Wailea beach which was voted the best beach in America. The beach attendant treats you like you were a king or queen. They bring you water and slice of fresh pineapple. The Four Seasons has the best part of Wailea beach. We went Snorkeling every morning after breakfast to the left near the rocks and saw tons of fish. The mornings are the best time to snorkel because the water is calmer. The trade winds tend to start blowing in the afternoon which make for rougher waters. The water temp. was 83 degrees right in Wailea. I asked and the hottest it gets is 84. It was pefect. The conceirge service in Four Seasons were great and assisted us with all our outtings but they forgot to inform us the fee that they do charge if they book an event for you. I would recommend booking your own event unless you don't mind paying the extra fee of 6 bucks and change. We highly recommend the couples massage at the Spa it was worth every penny. We are already making plans to visit the Four Seasons Resort in Maui next year.

The entire hotel is spotless, the grounds are perfect and there is an incredible view from every public space. The pool area is beautiful and the views of the ocean are fantastic (the hotel is set up a bit higher from the beach). They have tons of umbrellas and free cabanas and they set you up on the beach too. Everything about this hotel just works well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elegant and the service is professional.

There were some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beautiful people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but the place is not overly pretentious or stuffy. We were in very casual clothes (cotton dress/skirts/shorts with flip flops) most of the time and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel out of place anywhere in the resort. Rooms: Huge beds and the biggest hotel bathroom I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve every seen. The housekeeping was very good and the room was in great condition. Nice, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the d\u00c3\u00a9cor was all that outstanding. Beach & Pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fantastic!

We went for a lower end, mountain view room and were disappointed. The view was of a parking lot and the room was slightly dark. If you want to save some money, check out offers at the Ritz Kapalua - we also spent 2 nights there and loved it. If you go for the FS, spend the extra money for the real thing! - Overall, best service we have ever experienced. The valet attendants are particularly good - they think of everything (e.g. beach towels and water for the road trip!). Other comments: - We were disappointed in Wailea itself. It feels like a country club / Florida setting - everything perfectly manicured with very little \"culture\". The beaches are fine but there are nicer places on earth. In Hawaii, we preferred Kapalua Maui and Kauai. - We would NOT recommend the road to Hana unless you have 1 week or more in Maui.

I used this site so much during my planning I figured it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the least I can do to write about our experience and to offer our perspective. We spent our first 6 nights on Lanai at the Manele Bay Hotel, followed by 5 nights at the Four Seasons on Maui. My \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in planning our trip was to spend the first part of the honeymoon at a more secluded spot (ie, Lanai) and then move to a more active/developed area (ie, Maui). We loved the Manale Bay hotel - unfortunately our stay at the Four Seasons on Maui was not as wonderful. It almost doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel right for us to write this review, because we are not negative people at all and are hardly discriminating travelers. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re relatively young, 27 & 25, and are not picky at all, but do have some expectations at the price-point of the Four Seasons. Now don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is a Four Seasons from top to bottom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the facility is beautiful and immaculate, the food is superb, the service is the best on any island, and the pool service is outstanding. The problem is, this resort is just a little too big for its own good. I think it has around 400 rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at capacity, you can feel it bulging at the seams, especially around the pool. I can see how if the place was maybe half-full, then it would be wonderful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full, be prepared to get a little close with your neighbors. People get to the pool starting around 7am to get the best spots. Anytime after 11 and you could be in trouble. We arrived at 1pm and had to wait a bit for our room to be ready. Went to the pool to just sit and relax and wait but were told there were no chairs available. Definitely a disappointment. Aside from the Four Seasons, I was a bit disappointed in how the whole island of Maui is developed in general. Wailea is basically a planned resort development, as are most of the places on Maui. They are all very nice and clean \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just a bit generic. It sort of felt a bit like Florida \u00e2\u20ac\u201c except with better weather and clearer water. The Four Seasons shares Wailea with several other large hotels, the Fairmont Kea Lani, the Grand Wailea (aka Wally World) and a Marriott Renaissance. It shares the beach with all but the Kea Lani. There is a shopping district in the middle, with several high end stores (ie, Louis Vetton, Tiffany, etc) and some restaurants. I can see how some people would enjoy this type of amenity while on vacation, but being from a big city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I go on vacation to get away from stuff like that! Also, the Four Seasons is definitely a kid-friendly place. I would guess that over half of the guests there were with children. The Four Seasons does a good job in programming activities for them, it seems. My wife and I weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really bothered by all the kids \u00e2\u20ac\u201c except at the morning breakfast buffet. The food area is a bit too small and just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t big enough for roaming hungry adults and children running around, trying to reach everything. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain about the prices, because that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the way things are at the Four Seasons. I actually thought the food was pretty reasonable. We had lunch twice at Ferrarro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which was excellent, and the best service we had anywhere. They definitely get you with the drinks though - $13 mojitos \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ouch! Glad they made them strong! I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the prices and was expecting that, but when a cocktail gets in to that mid-teens pricing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I start to count how much money is left in the wallet!!! We would have eaten at Spago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just to see all the hype \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a reservation at a decent time (which was a bit disappointing). Spago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a destination in and of itself, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fighting for reservations with the 400+ guests at the Four Seasons, and also the thousands of people staying in Wailea! I really hate to be so negative \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because at the end of the day my wife and I had a decent time. We enjoyed the spa (which is top notch), snorkeling at the ocean, and the workout facilities (although since everyone is a health-nut who stays at the Four Seasons, be prepared to share that too!). During most days we got off the resort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c took the road to Hana one day (you have to do it), also did some shopping in Lahaina \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is a typical tourist trap, but does have some character. Everyone we talked to told us to eat at Cheeseburger in Paradise in Lahaina \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so we did \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but must admit the burger wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything special. We played the Blue Course at Wailea and had a great time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very forgiving course, and beautiful. The Four Seasons has some kind of deal with them, and we had a great discount on greens fees. There is a great Irish restaurant in the clubhouse called Murphy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c typical Irish pub with nightly entertainment and a lot of character. At first the thought of drinking a Guiness in Hawaii stuck me a bit odd, but after that first sip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was great. Best view from any Irish bar in the world I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing. While I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been, I think the Four Seasons on the big island would have been a better bet for the second leg of our Honeymoon.

We always opted for a cabana above the beach and got up early to claim one of the more \"private\" ones. (If you sleep in and/or shop first, the prime cabanas start opening-up around 3 pm). Or you can sit down at the beach which is beautiful and less crowded; get up in the morning for perfectly calm and crystal clear water to go snorkeling.

We used to stay at the Grand Wailea when our older kids were young, but my 8 yr old loved the FS; the kid's program is great plus she made friends around the pool (somehow FS manages to make honeymooners and families happy!). For the person who complained about lack of \"Hawaiian\" culture, my reply is that the weather, the water, the views, and the food (Ferraro's and Spago's were great) are what FS Maui is all about. Book a luau and take a drive around the island to get a culture fix. Yes, the FS is pricey but remember there is no resort fee, valet parking is complimentary, the kid's program is complimentary, beach equipment/snorkel gear is complimentary, the Spa is out of this world, and the service thru-out the resort is abosolutely top notch! I don't think the word \"no\" exists in the vocabulary here. We've already made our reservations for next year! Other off-site notes: good food at Pacific O in Lahaina and Sansei Sushi in Kihei, Nick's Fishmarket was a disappointment. If you've seen one too many luaus but still want a show, try \"Ulalena\" in Lahaina...it's like a Hawaiian Cirque du Soleil. Snorkeling is wonderful at the FS beach but if you want a boat trip to snorkel at Molokini, I recommend the Kai Kanani which departs from the Maui Prince. It's a nice small boat with a great crew.

Four Seasons Wailea is the perfect location. We not only stayed at the FS, we held an intimate wedding there in July. Everything was absolutely phenomenal. FS vs. Other Wailea Resorts: We were having a hard time deciding between FS and the other resort in Wailea and Kapalua. In a nutshell, this is what we were told and, we confirmed it after visiting the different hotels. Kapalua is very beautiful, peaceful, and private. They have some very nice hotels there (Ritz, Kapalua Bay); however, the weather is often wet up in that part of the island. At Wailea, we were torn between the FS and the Fairmont Kea Lani. We selected the FS for the intimacy and the service they provide, especially for weddings. We were not dissappointed. The Kea Lani is a more impressive looking hotel (the grounds, the lobby, the room size, the pool). But the FS is more intimate and provides the personal touch. The Grand Wailea is good if you want a lively party like atmosphere or if you have kids. But it's a bit busy for us honeymooners. Avoid the Renaissance Wailea. It's okay if you can get a great deal but it's not what I would call a five or even four star establishment. We stayed there for 2 nights after we checked out of the FS and regretted it. The Four Seasons Wailea: The grounds are beautiful but the lobby and entrance is a bit tame compared to some of the other Wailea resorts. The rooms are equally comfortable and well decorated, but the \"ocean view\" is only partial. Not too many rooms directly face the ocean. We had an Ocean View room on the Club Level and our room has a view of the ocean from the side. It directly looks into the Courtyard but you can see the ocean on the left side. It's a gorgeous room but just wanted to set the expecation that it's not oceanfront even though we paid $800+ a night. But what we liked about the FS is how they treat you. The service is not pretentious, not intrusive. Just very polite, friendly, and efficient. They provide you pretty much whatever you need and want, even though it's not on the menu or not a typical request. And the concierge staff is absolutely amazing. The beds are very comfortable, furniture very modern, and the bathroom was amazing both in size and decor. Great toilettries too. The best part is, everything is included in your stay (e.g. the cabanas, nice cushioned beach and pool chaise, snorkel rentals). The Spa and Restaurants: We dined at Spago and Ferraro's. We liked Ferraro's more than Spago. The ambiance is nicer (outdoors under a canopy of stars with tikki torches all around you and Don and Vance playing romantic music as you dine well prepared and efficiently served food), and we thought the food was better. What we had at Spago that we thought was amazing is the poke. That was to die for. My wife who does not even like sushi loved the poke. We had a couple massage at the Spa and used their facilities a couple of times. We thought is was only okay. We did the oceanside bungalow massage and kinda wished we did the indoor one instead. It was a bit noisy outside.", "Date": "August 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "msiqbalmd", "ReviewID": "UR3808111", "Content": "Wife & I just returned after spending five wonderful nights at Four Seasons in Maui. The words just can't describe what a fabulous place it is. The grounds are beautiful and meticulously manicured. The beach is beautiful and not too crowded. The Fountain pool and waterfall pool, both are superb. Rooms have every possible amenity you could think of and many you couldn't even think of...shoe horns, umbrella, \"itsy-bitsy book light\", free shoe shine service, DVD player, etc, etc. The food at Spago's is out of this world. Very pricey, of course, and the portions are pretty small, but probably the best food I have ever tasted. Food quality at the other two restaurants is just average to good. Four Seasons does not nickle & dime you. Parking is free, as are the beach umbrellas, chaise lounges, poolside cabanas, avian spritzers at the poolside, ice water drinks, chilled fruits, etc. But the best part of this resort is impeccable service. You are treated like a royalty. The staff goes out of their way to please you. I could give you dozens of examples but then it would sound like a paid commercial. How about the Bellman who, after loading up our car as we were leaving the resort, ran in and brought us two chilled bottles of Avian for our trip to the airport! We had a minor problem. On our last evening, all of the three restaurants were completely booked and room service was so overwhelmed that it took them almost 90 minutes to bring our dinner. Of course, I complained. The room service manager called & \"profusely\" apologized and waived the charge for the dinner. The next morning, at the check out, the cashier apologized too. As soon as we got back home, someone from Four Seasons management called our house to again apologize and ask if there was anything else they could do for us!

Beachside service with complimentary cabanas is also available and quickly turned into our favorite place to lounge. There is also excellent snorkeling off the Four Seasons beach. The spa and steam room facilities are to die for, with an oceanside \"lomi lomi\" massage the ultimate in relaxation and luxury. The food and drink, as others point out, is pricey, but it is also quite good.

Indeed, the Four Seasons inhabits its own separate world. This was my second trip to Maui. Last year I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua. I thought I would never find a better resort. Well, lucky me...I did! This is, without a doubt, the classiest resort of the island. When you walk in, you can actually feel the jet-lag dripping off your limbs. The Four Seasons Maui has done everything right! They have anticipated the smallest details. The grounds are immaculate...dead leaves do not have a chance. And the grass is greener than the grass in \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\" One day, we enjoyed lounging the day away in the casbah-like tents and really enjoyed the Evian water spritzes and chilled towels. When we were ready for lunch, a delicious lobster sandwich was delivered to our cabana. Oh, yes, we have arrived! Another spritz, please? Some more water? And could you bring back some more of those yummy pineapple slices when you get a chance. Josh, our poolside server, gushed with friendliness and seemed genuinely eager to please us. And all of this at no additional charge! (Other resorts charge $50 or more per day for cabanas.) Our ocean view room was very large (about 650 square feet including the lanai). And the butterscotch bathroom was fit for a king! Lots of marble, a soaking tub, separate shower, double vanity...ahhh...Calgon take me away! Housekeeping would make an operating room nurse proud. Dirt is simply not tolerated! If the housekeepers do not come at the time you like, simply give them a call and they will gladly accomodate you. Wailea beach, in my opinion, is one of the best on the island. It's an absolute dream! We enjoyed a morning snorkel expedition each morning of our stay (it gets windy most afternoons, and the choppy water reduces visibility). Oh, did I mention that you get the snorkel equipment for free for an hour each day? Let me summarize by saying that if money is no object, then this is the place to stay. The $650 per night rate may sound high for a regular ocean-view hotel room, but I hope I have explained why this is not just any hotel. It's the number one resort on Maui! And they do not nickel and dime you to death! Believe me...it's worth every penny. Can you really put a price on enjoying a Mai Tai from your lanai while watching the golden sun set over the Pacific? (Well, actually yes. Twelve dollars for the drink; the sunset is free, though.) My partner and I enjoyed every single minute of our stay at this modern version of a Hawaiian palace by the sea. I'm sorry one of the other gay reviewers of this hotel did not feel comfortable. We certainly did! We even met other gay couples in the restaurants and by the pool. Hawaii is a very laid-back gay-friendly place, and all people, regardless of skin color or sexual orientation, are treated equally...as long as your Platinum Visa is not maxed out!

We highly recommend this resort to anyone,and can't imagine staying anywhere else in Maui from this point on. We were a group of 4 adults and 2 toddlers, ages 2 1/2 and 3 1/2. THE ROOMS: We stayed in partial ocean view adjoining rooms on the 4th floor (435 & 436), which happened to be the bottom floor of the wing we were staying in. Because we were on the bottom floor we had an exceptionally large patio off of the backs of our rooms that had 2 chaise lounges and a table and 2 chairs. These patios are much larger than those on all of the rooms above. The kids really enjoyed the exta outdoor space, we even ate some of our meals there . Because we were traveling with toddlers we arrived to find the furniture fitted with bumpers, a hippo cover on the bath spout, the children's names spelled out in colorful bath sponges, a really cute toddler bed for my daughter, a crib and a crate with all of the essentials (diapers, swim diapers, powder, lotion, & baby wash) needed for my son. There were also 2 Four Seasons logo stuffed owls on the bed with crayons and coloring books, and several rubber duckies and fresh baked cookies, milk and candy waiting on the coffee table for the kids to enjoy when we arrived. They didn't forget about the adults either, there was a nice selection of cookies on the dining table for us too! We really had a nice view from the room, palm trees, the blue sky and the ocean. The rooms are around 600 sq feet, inside you'll find a king bed with a nightstand at each side one with a cd player/radio/alarmclock, large armoire with television and DVD player, sofa with pull out sleeper, coffee table, dining table and 2 charis. There is a small area with fully stocked mini bar, fresh coffe beans and grinder, coffee pot, and all of the bar essentials. We asked that the mini bar be emptied for our stay(this was actually suggested to us by the reservations agent after we booked), that way we were able to keep juice and water on hand for the kids, there isn't a store on site that sells beverages, it's room service or the closest store at the Shops at Wailea, with kids the 30 minute wait for room service doesn't always work! The closet is huge and contains several hangers, a safe, and an iron & ironing board (starch is also in there!). The bathroom is very large, it has double sinks, a seperate tub and shower and a seperate commode area with a frosted glass door. The air conditioning cooled the room perfectly, it automatically shuts off when you open your sliding doors. THE POOLS & BEACH: There are 2 pool areas at the Four Seasons, the Fountain Pool - i'd say this is more of the adult area although we did see a few children there most days. This is a large rectangular pool with jaccuzis on each end and a large fountain in the center. The second pool is the Waterfall pool - this is also called the \"children's pool\". This is where you'll find most of the children and their parents. This is actually 2 pools connected by a small waterslide and rock waterfall. There is a shallow area for toddlers with buckets and watering cans to play with. The remainder of the pool is around 3 1/2 feet deep. The pool above with the large waterfall is from 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 feet deep. We were at the pool varying times each day and we were always able to get a poolside cabana. The beach is beautiful and clean! The sand does get extremely hot so keep the shoes on the kids! We were able to get umbrellas at the beach if we made it there by 11am, after that they were usually taken. We just hit the beach early each day to ensure we'd have shade for the kids. The attendants at the pool and beach were extremely helpful and friendly. They passed out iced water constantly and fresh pineapple and strawberries on occasion. My daughter's favorite thing was the Otter Pops they handed out at the kids pool, she looked forward to that daily! FOOD: We ate at Spago for my brother in law's birthday on Sunday night. Entrees are in the $30+ range, apptizers $12+, drinks $9+ desserts $15. I can honestly say this was the worst meal we had the entire week. The menu is very limited, we were told that it changes daily, guess we picked a bad day. My fish(Onaga ?) was dry and the sauce was supposed to be a spicy thai, but tasted like barbacue sauce. We also tried the Mahi Mahi, which was just OK. I will say that the crab cake was fantastic, but tiny. We all tried the Pinapple Upside Down Cake for dessert and wished we hadn't, the sauce tasted burnt, and the cake was overly soaked in some liquer that tasted awful! I really can't recommend this restaurant, I wouldn't go back. There are too many other great places to eat in maui (Humuhumu - FANTASTIC!, Nick's Fishmarket - Really good too!, Mama's - Perfect). We tried Pacific Grill on our last night in Maui and the food was very good. Prices here are comparable to Spago (actually everywhere we went prices were in that range). We tried several of the appetizers, fish dishes and the filet & lobster too, everything was tasty. We didn't order dessert because I surprised my husband with a birthday cake (the pastry dept. at the 4Seasons will make whatever you'd like, just call and order in advance) it was excellent as well! Our waitress brought it to the table with the candles lit as the evening's entertainment sang \"Happy Birthday\"! It's was really nice! We had room service several times, the food is expensive but really high quality, it's worth it when traveling with kids! The room service menu is available 24 hours a day (due to the time difference between Maui & LA my son was eating pancakes at 3am the first morning!) and includes an excellent children's menu with lots of choices. Children's meals are $5-$8, very reasonable! Adult entrees $17-$40. 18% gratuity and $4 delivery charge is added to your bill. There is a nice cemented beach walk that stretches between the Kea Lani, 4 Seasons, and Grand Wailea, take the 15 minute walk over to either of the other resorts for some really great food - Humuhumu (Best meal we had), Nick's Fish Market (Best service, great food), Cafe Ciao, etc. You may get a little wind blown so if you're worried about your hair, take the car! We made reservations for our meals for 6pm and always saw the sunset as we were eating our dessert! We also tried Tommy Bahama's and Cheeseburger's and Mai Tais in the Shops at Wailea, Tommy Bahama's was excellent, great entertainment at night too! The cheeseburger's at Cheeseburger's and Mai Tais were just ok, I probably wouldn't go back for lunch, but we tried their breakfast and it was excellent!We also stopped at Mama's Fish House for lunch on our first day, the food was just OK, way overpriced for lunch, but the views were spectacular as were the drinks! Service was excellent too. KIDS CLUB & BABYSITTING: For those of you thinking of coming to the resort with kids, this is the place for you! Kids club is available 7 days a week from 9am - 5pm, children over 5yo can attend alone, under 5 must be accompanied by a parent or other responsible adult, the kids club is complimentary to all guests. You can get a schedule of the weeks activities when you check in, they do crafts, make snow cones, learn the hula, make leis, play frisbee, build volcanos on the beach, etc. They will keep your kids entertained all day long. I took my kids on 3 seperate occasions for a few different activities, the staff is excellent! They really interact well with the kids making sure that no one is left out, they are kind and caring. They also do evening kids parties which include dinner the cost is $65 for those who'd like to have a nice adult dinner in the evening. The kids can stay all day or just drop in for specific activities, it's all up to you. The Four Seasons also offers babysitting service through the Nanny Connection. The cost is $14 per hour for the first child and $2 and hour for each additional child. There is a 3 hour minimum. We used the Nanny service on 3 night from 5p-9pm so that we could celebrate the husband's birthday's. I was very impressed with the service, my kids loved Nanny Kathryn! It was nice to dine in the evening without tired children beside you, it was even nicer to come back to the room and find the children asleep in their beds in their Pjs! I highly recommend the Kids For All Seasons kids club and the Nanny Connection for babysitting services, these service helped each member of our family truly enjoy our vacation! The resort also offers strollers, highchairs, and other items for use during your stay, use of most of these items is complimentary, although we were told that if we would like to keep the stroller for our entire stay they would refer us to a company that rented out children's items, so check on availabilty and charges before you arrive. We borrowed a double stroller for a long walk one day and it was very nice! There are also children's DVDs that can be borrowed from the concierge, beach toys are available at the beach and at the kids pool, and there is a game room with video games, pool tables, and TV for the whole family to enjoy together. BOTTOM LINE: Once you stay here you're spolied for life! You'll be planning your next trip back before you're back home, I guarantee it! The staff is amazing, the resort grounds are absolutely beautiful, the pool, the beach, everything is perfect! We checked out the Kea Lani and the Grand Wailea while we were there too. The Kea Lani was so noisy and over crowded, lots of kids running everywhere, worse than the Grand Wailea. The Grand Wailea, had a beautiful lobby, and Humuhumu was great but it was overcrowded and the rooms that we saw were small. There is still construction going on right next to the Grand also, it doesn't look like it will be finished anytime soon!

Both resturants are excellent and I would come and eat at Fararos the next time I come to but don't stay at this very expensive hotel.

I have been to Maui a few times before and stayed at the Grand Wailea both times. I was anxious to see how different the Four Seasons would be compared to the other top 2 hotels on Maui. I was absolutely shocked by the difference. The Four Seasons is so far above the Grand Wailea and Kea Lani. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really in a class by itself. We booked an Ocean View Room with the breakfast package. When we arrived, we were escorted to our room and I was little disappointed. The view from the room was not that great so I called down and spoke to a manager who said they would change our rooms the following day. The next day we were moved to an outstanding Ocean View Room, #747 to be exact. If you are considering an ocean view room, I would highly recommend requesting a room in the interior of the hotel, the views are much better. We were so happy that we booked the breakfast package with our room. It added $35 more per night but it was well worth it. Our buffet breakfast would have come out to $65 per day with tip. So we saved a few hundred dollars by booking this package. The service, the grounds of the hotel, and setting is just amazing. The beach is one of the best on Maui, very big and the water is relatively calm. You can snorkel right in front of the property and there are huge turtles and many interesting fish to see. The Four Seasons also does not nickel and dime you for certain things that the other neighboring properties do. Free cabanas at the pool and beach, water and popsicles passed around, Evian mist sprayed on you by the pool, free snorkeling gear, free scuba lessons. The Four Seasons is much smaller than the neighboring hotels which make the hotel seem much more intimate. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a 10 minute walk from the pool to your room like the Grand Wailea or Kea Lani. The food at the Four Seasons is incredible, very expensive, but incredible. Plan to spend a minimum of $300/day on food and drinks for 2 people....$17 turkey sandwiches at lunch, $30+ plates for dinner and very expensive drinks. The Four Seasons also provides a free sedan service within Waliea which we used many times. We walked over to the Grand Wailea to have dinner one night and we immediately wanted to come back to the Four Seasons the moment we arrived. In fact, we ordered our food and then decided a few minutes later to leave and then ate at Ferraro's at the Four Seasons. There were screaming kids everywhere, it smelled and the service was horrible. I really don't think there is a better hotel on Maui or maybe Hawaii. The only other hotel I would consider staying at now would be the Four Seasons on the Big Island. We heard from many Wailea Four Seasons employees that the their hotel on the Big Island is incredible.

After walking through them and seeing how the service was, the thing that always comes up was \"I'm glad we stayed at the Four Seasons\" This hotel is expensive, and we had to save for quite a while to stay here. Was it worth the money?! Absolutely. We have decided that when we return to Maui for another vacation, we are staying at the FS or not at all.

The service was impeccable, and everyone is ready to give you a smile, and ask how your activities went that day. Everytime they brought our car around, we would tell them where we were going, and they would give us tips on how to get there, what to do, etc. It honestly seemed as if they really cared about us having a good time, not just because it's their job. Some other reviews mention house keeping coming late in the afternoon. We saw some of that, but the first day they asked us when we would like the room to be cleaned each day, and we said 9 AM would be great. One day we were running a bit late, and at 9:15 they called and asked if they needed to come back later, or when we would like them to come. Not a huge thing, but for them to be that attentive was great. That's how everything is there. The other guests are generally laid back and nice. We were afraid that staying at the FS might mean being amongst a bunch of snobs. There was a fair amount of plastic body parts in/around the pool, but we expected that considering.

POOL & BEACH Each day the poolside & beach-side staff were very attentive as they set up our cabanas/beach umbrella and beach chairs with thick clean towel covers and beach towels.

The pool service was awesome. Ice water refills constantly. They passed around fruit and cold washcloths along with Evian spritzes for those guests that wanted it.

The poolside service was usually above and beyond; however, we did notice that certain attendants were much more attentive than others. We highly recommend Sandy; she was phenomenal and very personable. The poolside food was very good; the best we have ever had at a large resort. The rooms were spacious and clean. Yes, on some days, the service was in the late afternoon, but that didn't bother us because we were enjoying the outdoors. The spa services were pricey, but they were also worth the money. As for a previous review mentioning a lack of people of color; that wasn't the case during our stay. The only downside to our trip was my husband slipping on muddy grass that was located between the tiled steps on the path between the pool and beach. We saw several guests slipping in that area. My husband was wheelchair bound the rest of the trip and is now looking at knee surgery. Also, a honeymooner slipped right after my husband and tore ligaments in her ankle. So, watch your step in that area. The breakfast buffet was great, but if you want to save some money and don't want a ton of food, then get a to-go container to bring back to the pool area or your room. We ate at Spago's and Ferraro's. Spagos was fabulous. The fish at Ferraro's was overcooked, but the sunset was incredible. I recommend that you go to the Shops at Wailea and try Tommy Bahama's and Ruth Chris Steakhouse. Also, we ate at Kincha at the Grand Wailea. The sushi was great and so was the Kobe beef.

The restaurants (while pricey) have definitely been upgraded and the service was very good -- the bell staff was friendly and efficient, housekeeping was impeccable, the pool and beach attendants were attentive and helpful, and it's a great environment for the kids. Unfortunately, the resort suffers from the inevitable comparisons to its \"sister\" resort, the Four Seasons Hualalai, on the Big Island. The facilities on Maui are not quite as graceful or sprawling, the atmosphere is a bit less relaxed, the level of service probably not quite as high, and the amenities are not as impressive. Among other things, there is really just one main pool at the Maui resport (plus a smaller one for kids), compared to the assortment of pools at Hualalai (four by my count, not including the snorkel pond). As a result, the Maui resort feels more crowded. Moreover, the health club facilities are dwarfed by those at Hualalai. Nonetheless, the wonderful beach at Wailea partially makes up for those gaps, as does the price differential (while hardly cheap, the Maui resort is definitely less expensive than Hualalai).

They even made a reservation for us at Ferraros that night. I didn't really care for the food there, its overpriced and lacks taste, but the service is good and the view is awesome.

The beach in front of the hotel is great for snorkeling but go early in the morning, it gets very windy around noon. We spent a lot of time sitting around by the pool and ordering lunch and drinks. When you arrive to the pool area or the beach you need to go and have one of the employees set up a cabana or chairs for you. They don't charge for this and most other hotels do. They even hold the seats for you if you leave for a little while. The lunch by the pool is great, you can even order from the kids menu in adult portions for a decent price. The room service at the hotel is great. We tried both breakfast and dinner, the chocolate cake is really good as are the scrambled eggs. The rooms are cleaned in the morning and there is turndown service at night, sometimes they would dim the lights and leave some soft Hawaiian music playing for when we returned. They also leave orchids everywhere. The bathroom toiletries are great, they have L'occitaine soaps, shampoo, moisturizer, and even after burn lotion. The restaurants in the hotel are all great (Spago was a bit to eclectic for us). Although, our favorite was Humahumanukanukaapua'a at the Grand Wailea. Call ahead of time, as they are always full. The food is great and the restaurant sits atop a huge saltwater pond stocked with fish. You can also walk to the Shops at Wailea which has restaurants and many shops. We got some nice Hawaiian shirts at the ABC store there that we saw at another store for double the price.

Because this website really helped me choose this hotel, I thought I would give a little back and tell you all everything I can about this wonderful place. HOTEL- Upon arrival, we were greeted with leis and hospitality. I feel some reviews exaggerated a little on how the staff ----- up to you there. Don't get me wrong, service everywhere at the Four Seasons was amazing, but not everyone remembered your name and kissed your butt. The lobby is beautiful and open air. Plan on everything in Hawaii being open air (lobbies, restaurants, even exercise rooms). The lush gardens outside are so well kept. WEATHER- This was a surprise to me. I heard how dry Wailea is, but that's not necessarily true. The employees at the hotel put it like this: They can guarantee the morning will be beautiful, but they can't make any promises for the afternoon. It rained a lot for a few afternoons. Luckily we got up early every morning (6am) and were on the beach by 8am. No problem getting tan from 8am-noon (and it was hot). Normally the clouds rolled in around lunch time. ROOM- Spectacurily clean. Bathroom was HUGE! I was more comfortable in that bathroom than mine at home. Plus it was spotless (and I really checked it out). The bed was so comfortable that you can actually buy the pillows and the mattress to have at home. We had an Ocean View Prime. I misunderstood the website and I thought these rooms were at the very ends of the U-shaped hotel (closest to the ocean and beach). However, they are not on the ends, they are near the ends of the hotel. This was a little disappointing. We could see the ocean, but not like you would think for an Ocean view prime. I considered it a partial ocean view seeing as you had to turn your head on the balcony to see the ocean. You might want to save your money on the view and just get a partial ocean view room. HOUSEKEEPING- Great job, the only thing that made me a little upset was that for the first few days they weren't cleaning the rooms until 3 or 4 pm. Now for a couple who gets up at 6am, leaves by 7am for breakfast, spends the whole day outside and gets lunch, we expected our room to be clean so we could get ready or relax for a bit. When we returned at 4pm and housekeeping was bothering us to clean our room, I was irritated to say the least. Also, there were a few afternoons (around 3pm) that we took a nap, and we put the \"do not disturb\" sign on...so what do they do? They call us!!! Be aware of this. This happeed twice and it was ridiculous. We had 2 phone calls within an hour asking us when they could clean our room. It seems to me that if there is a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door, calling would be inappropriate. BEACH/POOL/OCEAN- Beach is beautiful, but not nearly as big as I thought (try the Jersey shore sometime). There are a lot of people there, but it never felt \"crowded\". Ocean was warm, but not really clear. There is great snorkeling by the rocks at the end of the beach (from the Four Seasons, walk out of the hotel onto the beach and look left). You have to go out a ways, but there are hundreds of fishies and coral there. Surf was bad the last few days which you couldn't snorkel. Low tide is in the morning so the best time for snorkeling is 7am-10am. The views of the other islands and the West Maui Mountains from the beach are breathtaking. Best part of the trip. Pool is beautiful. There always seemed to be room to get pool chairs no matter what time you arrived, although the earlier the better. We saw Tori Spelling there everyday by the pool. They serve awesome drinks and lunch poolside if you want. Yes they hand out fruit kebobs and cold towels. Your ice water will always stay filled. Pool is a little smaller than it should be for the amount of guests that are there. When it gets really hot, the pool gets really crowded! BREAKFAST BUFFET/PACIFIC GRILL- Awesome! Breakfast was so good. Another highlight of the trip. Such a variety, I can't comprehend how people can complain! You have to get waffles with macadamia nuts and coconut syrup! My favorite! SPAGO- We loved it. Make sure you get a table with a view that's to the RIGHT of the columns (you'll understand when you get there). Every two tables there is a huge column that blocks the view for the table next to it. Service is unbelievable here! NICK'S FISHMARKET- Surprisingly, we were a little disappointed at this place. Food wasn't bad, but it was the least favorite of our meals for the whole trip. I thought they were \"oceanside\", but they are \"poolside\". When you stay at the Four Seasons, you start to appreciate how wonderful all of their views are, and Nick's is at the Fairmont Kea Lani, which doesn't have nearly the views as FS. FERRARO'S- OUR FAVORITE! We had the BEST table. The view of the sunset was amazing. Food was unbelievable (I had Hawaiian lobster). *To dine while the sun is setting, make reservations for 6:30pm. The sun sets in Hawaii about 7:25pm this time of year. Humuhumunukunukuapua'a- In the Grand Wailea next door. Really charming atmosphere (you are over a huge fishpond). I had the Humu mixed plate, and it was sooooo good. Saw Gary Sinese dining with his family (from CSI and Forrest Gump). If you get the drink called Pele's Revenge, be prepared to drink out of a coconut the size of your head! MAUI ONION- Best onion rings in the world. Made with Maui Onions. Salads are delicious too. Located in the Renaissance in Wailea. You have to go here for lunch (we went 3 times!). They are open from 11:30am-6pm. OLD LAHAINA LUA'U- Great time! The pork was alright, but the steak and chicken was delicious. The dancing was really neat. If you get traditional style seating, you will have the best view of the stage, but you may get uncomfortable and cramped. Great atmosphere. Bring your camera! Lahaina itself is a bustling town with tons of shops. In fact, there are som many art dealers, ABC stores, and jewelry stores that you think you are walking in circles. Really cool town, spend an afternoon there and have dinner. HANA ROAD- Too long to explain here...read my review under the Hana Road topic for Maui Attractions, titled \"Read this for an HONEST review\" or something like that. It is a very curvy road. EXTREMELY curvy. And slow moving. And yes people drive like maniacs. But it was beautiful. However, if you get car sick, this is your hell. I hope everyone has a great time. This was the best place on earth! We know no other resort could even compare with the Four Seasons. Grand Wailea I've heard is not a good place for your honeymoon. The FS is much more romantic and private.

The wedding reception was just fine. If you have an event there, I would unequivally recommend the luau. The setting is gorgeous, the food was superb and the entertainment top-notch.

We have been to many many resorts on nearly every island. We have rarely stayed at the same place twice. I think that might change now. We just came back after 12 days. Rather than tell you how great everything was from head to tow, Ill compare this to other places we know of, and atleast tell you why we decided to stay here. FS vs Kea Lani: Kea Lani you must reserve your cabana (and you have to reserve a specific cabana), and it costs $75 per day. That was an instant turn off. We have a two year old, and we like to have a cabana for everything. Keeps him out of the sun. The pools there are nicer than the FS--FS has a rather small pool, but very nice...but to be honest, the pools at Kea Lani are much bigger, and nicer. Kea Lani has suites...nice!! They also have a nice beach. They however do not have the service that FS has---twice a day treats brought to you at poolside---fruits and/or ice cream. FS will not go an hour without brining you water. Of all the resorts I have ever been to, I have never seen more attentive service than at the FS. If you want suites...this is it. You wont find a better price anywhere for a suite. The atmosphere is similar to the FS, but like I said, you wont get the service. If the service here was similar to the FS, and the cabanas were free, and you didnt have to reserve a specific cabana...this would where we would go. But $75 per day for 12-14 days for a cabana adds up. FS vs Grand Wilea: Simple reasons here....too hectic, too loud, and a cabana here will cost you $150/day!!!!!!!!!! If you have kids that love to play in the water, and you dont mind the noise...this is for you. Grand Wilea does have a large area assigned for adults only, next to a pool for adults.....but they allow NO children there...not even a two year old...so that was it for us. GW also makes you wear goofy wrist bands....way goofy. It shares the beach with the FS, and the beach is perfect. No rocks, crystal clear...can get a bit choppy, but nothing really that big at all. Bottom line...we didnt stay here due to the cabana expense, the noise and all the kids playing. We wanted a bit more quiet. But, dont get me wrong...this resort is very very very nice. You would not be dissapointed. FS vs FS at big island: The resort on the big isl just is in class of its own, however, we did not like it due to the beach...really not all that nice at all for swimming. FS vs kapalani resorts...simply put in our opinion, FS is a class above those resorts (we have stayed at most resorts there FS vs mariott wilea...no comparison...FS is just in another class. The mariott does not really compare to any of the three major wilea resorts. FS just does not nikel and dime you---and while you may be saying to yoursleves as you read this review that its not such a big thing to be nickeled and dimed...wait till you get there. $$$--We know very well how much $$$ everything is. And I am not complaining, but I want people to know---we ate at the restaurants at the FS usually...we dont drink, and we dont get appetizers.....but we each get a dessert usually.....not once was our dinner bill under $100. Hamburger is $20. Virgin drinks are $9. Just to give you an idea. We loved this place so much, we are going to repeat in 2006. We have stayed at over 15 resorts all over hawaii....this we find is the best balance of them all. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to contact.

We could not have been happier. This is an excellent, top-notch hotel. My review will focus on some of the negative reviews I have read on this site. FIRST, most if not all, of the negative reviews could have been experienced at any hotel. PRICE: it is expensive, but so are all of the 5 star hotels here. Yes, food and drinks are expensive, so you should plan accordingly. POOL: We never had a problem getting a covered cabana. We arrived at the pool at different times each day - sometimes at the busiest part of the day - and always got a cabana. The pool serivce was incredible. You will always have a cover for your chair and a towel. Ice water non stop. Lunch service was very fast and the food was excellent. Iced towels, free fruit and popsicles. We never had any trouble with kids running around. If the fountain is off it is because the wind picks up and the spray from the fountain gets on the guests, so they turn it off. A few local kids got in the pool and were asked to leave as soon as the staff noticed them. THE BEACH: One of Maui's best. You can get snorkel gear for free for one hour each day - plenty. They have covered seating on the beach always available. THE ROOM: We had a mountain view room that had an excellent view of the ocean. The bathrooms are huge and the room was very nice. Maid service sometimes was later in the day, but who cares? Are you there to enjoy your vacation or to complain? If you need anything, it is there very quickly. If you absolutely need your room, they'll leave and come back. STAFF: Very, very friendly. They will make dinner reservations, book trips, give you driving directions, tips on where to go or eat - all quickly and friendly. The valet service was outstanding and give great directions. THE FOOD: excellent. Yes, it's expensive. If you are on a budget, go somewhere else. We ate twice at Ferarro's. The food is great and the view cant be beat. If you want a beautiful hotel, great pool, great food and service, on one of Maui's best beaches - you CANNOT go wrong here.", "Date": "June 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Over There", "Title": "\u201cUpgrade, if you can for the best time of your life...\u201d", "Author": "frankfooter", "ReviewID": "UR3547452", "Content": "My wife and I recently spent one of the best vacations of our lives at the Four Seasons in Maui. This was our (many years belated) honeymoon, and I guess the backdrop of Maui, along with perfect weather, would be major contributing factors. However, our stay at this particular Four Seasons only enhanced our stay on the island. Have stayed on Kauai and it is beautiful, but much more on Maui to do and see. So much more. After a grueling 25+-hour trip from the East coast (a nightmare of delays and missed connections), we were treated to a very special week at this hotel. By keeping in touch with the hotel to let them know we were going to be a day late, they bent over backwards (as opposed to our airline) to make sure this trip was truly special. The hotel upgraded us from a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprime ocean-view\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suite to an exceptional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcocean-front\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suite with a double lanai. We later came to find out this room was valued at 2-1/2 times our original suite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate. I assume that their payoff will be in our profound recommendation of this hotel not only on this web-site, but also by word of mouth to our friends and family. If you can afford the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcocean front\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (not prime ocean view) rooms/suites, then your view will be better than staying near the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcback\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the hotel. From the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcocean front\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 area, you overlook the restaurants, the entire pool area and more of the beachfront. Although it is a little noisier in this area (mostly from the fountains, and of course the ocean), you get a real sense of staying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcon the beach.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 In this suite, we also received fresh fruit every day. In general, if you choose to stay and eat at this resort, it will be expensive. For this amount of money, one expects perfection. We were very fortunate that we experienced a week mostly full of perfection. However, I can understand some of the previous reviewers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 negative comments to be mentioned later. Nevertheless, it is our opinion that most of the negative experiences could be avoided by treating the staff with (monetary) respect. By our simply tipping the pool area staff and housekeeping staff, our simple requests were honored, and for the remainder of the week we found a mutual respect of expectations and services. The pool: We are late risers, and were never disappointed in the available selection of pool and/or cabana seats. Our recommendation is to start at the beach early, and move up to the pool later in the day. People seem to depart the pool about an hour or so after lunch. The ocean is calm in the morning with very little wind, the sand is not yet burning on your feet, and the beach staff is just as attentive as the pool staff. You can get a nice umbrella seat, and the morning snorkel (one hour free is about all you need to see the sea turtles, eels, variety of fish, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) is easier than in the afternoon when the seas get rough. Keep in mind that a (monetary) tip for the attendants will remind them for the next days to follow, that you are a serious vacationer. Yes, I know your already paying dearly for this vacation, but these are the people that you need the most, and showing them respect will only get you the same in return. Since you are paying hundreds, if not thousands for a night in the hotel, along with hundreds for breakfast, lunch and dinner; what is twenty bucks to remind your attendant that you appreciate their efforts. Our only complaint is that there are a few inconsiderate people both at the pool and on the beach, who choose to ignore the notices to keep their cell phone use to a minimum. The last thing I want to hear in paradise is someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems on a cell call. Since we had a full view of the pool area, it was somewhat humorous to note that these were the same people who were battling at 7:00 am every morning to grab the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seats. Note again that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seats are available anytime throughout the day. The cool towels and continuous filling of ice water made the days exceptional. Although, we did not see as much of the frozen fruit or Evian spritz's as mentioned in previous reviews. Housekeeping: Again, these are the staff members from whom you need and want quality attention. After some minimal monetary influence after our first night, our staff seemed to understand exactly when to clean the room (mid-morning) and when to provide our turndown (dinnertime) service for the remainder of the week. A recommendation is to inform housekeeping early in your trip to provide extra towels every day. P.S.: you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to bring shampoo, conditioners, lotions, after sun lotions, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6as the hotel provides generous L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Octaine products. Restaurants: Best meal of the day is definitely breakfast. The made to order pancake/egg/omelet dishes, the fresh fruit, fresh squeezed juices and fresh bakery goods are the exception at this resort. Pricey, but outstanding. Our dinner at Pacific Grill was easily beaten out by Spago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upstairs, again both pricey. Never made it to Ferraro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, because, after a couple of days, we found out that 40 minutes away in Lahaina, you could get the same wonderful meals for one-quarter the price. Of course, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the resort, but we spent many evenings driving with the top down, back and forth with wondrous views of the islands. The shopping for various souvenirs and keepsakes was also much better in Lahaina. Rooms: We can imagine some of the negatives about the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpartial ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rooms. If you are staying near the rear of the hotel, you only get a limited view of the ocean, but the gardens appear to make up for the loss. Keep in mind that this is Hawaii, and that the hotels are normally set further back from the shore than those found on the East Coast, and in the Gulf of Mexico. Just make sure you speak with the hotel to get a mutual understanding before your arrival. It has been my experience to have a discussion with the hotel staff (not reservation staff) before any stay at any hotel of consequence. Bell Desk: If you have a rental car, do be sure to call down to get your car before your leaving the room. It may take up to 10 minutes to get your car otherwise. Always ask for water and/or towels if you are out for the day or evening. They are free and pleantiful. Try the picnic baskets provided by Room Service, but only get one meal for two people if you are taking a trip around the island. Too much food if you order two full meals. Summary: It is expensive, period. Make sure there is not a massive convention at the hotel during your stay. The day of our departure, we saw a huge convention arriving and could understand how the hotel could become overcrowded (although we were told they were 95% capacity during our stay). Nevertheless, that could be due to the congregation of too many people in one area at one time. Unfortunately, we never hit the spa, because we ended up driving around the island 4 of 7 days. The remaining time was spent just relaxing and enjoying the views and the beauty of the island. In addition, if you decide to stay at either of the neighboring resorts, we spoke with some people who said they would much rather have stayed at Four Seasons. Mostly because they said, it appeared as though the property was not so overwhelming in size or total number of people. They also said they were nickel and dime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d to death on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcresort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fees. Moreover, it is all practically the same beach, but quieter. By the way, never a problem with children running and screaming. Quite the contrary - and we don't have kids. Would not recommend if you are young and single, scoping out other singles. It's definately a 'couples' or family atmosphere, married or not. We don't have any real complaints about the place.

From the cold towel offered to you at check-in you know you have arrived at a place that will treat you extraordinarily. Upon check-in we were also told that we had been upgraded from our originally booked garden view room to a partial ocean view executive suite. What a great surprise that was! Even though we never really used the extra room, it was exceptional. The bathroom is HUGE and the private lanai is fabulous for relaxing and watching the sunset. Only negative was housekeeping. They kept wanting to turn down our room at 5:30 even though we were always in our room at that time and asked them to come back after 7:00. This with the fact that they usually didn't end up cleaning our room in the first place until around 3:00 most days. The pool area is great. It's not huge, but you never feel crowded. We didn't find that securing a cabana was exceptionally difficult either. If you get to the pool by 9:00 am, you should have no problem getting a good one. Covered seating is almost always available regardless of time we found as well. One word of caution at the pool. Drink prices were high ($10 for a pin colada) as well as food ($18 for a burger). Best to go elsewhere for lunch. Restaurants are both good (didn't try the other one, Seaside or something like that). I would avoid Ferraro's though. Absolutely stellar setting, but woefully overpriced. THey didn't have a single wine that was available by the glass for under $13. Entrees were in the $38-$40 range. Plus, while good, the food was great in our opinion. Spago was better. Definitely ask for an outside table. Prices were more reasonable (at least for Maui standards) and food was better. We had two excellent meals there. Other place we had dinner where Nicks Fishmarket (EXCELLENT food, and great service plus a pretty good open air setting) at the neighboring Kea Lani Resort and Mama's which we weren't overly impressed with and probably isn't worth the drive. We also went to the Maui Price Luau, which I wouldn't recommend as it's pretty generic. The one negative I would have on the Four Seasons is their concierge service. I would highly recommend booking any excursions and dinner reservations on your own as the concierge doesn't add any value. They aren't particularly well connected and aren't able to get prime dinner times at popular restaurants better than you would be able to. Plus you will have to pay full retail for any excursions in comparison to buying them at any of the excursion shops located in the towns. Also I would highly recommend the Maui Revealed guidebook.

Pack pants/long sleeves if you plan to do this!). Additionally, we thoroughly we enjoyed the cabanas. (Unlike some reviewers, we were out by 9 am & never had any difficulty getting the seats we wanted & the resort was completely booked.) The chilled towels & fruit were highly refreshing (though they could have been more forth coming with both as it was QUITE hot) & they did keep our glasses filled with ice water. The room was nice (the large bathroom was the best part), but not extraordinary (expected much nicer linens). In our experience, the hotel's cleaning staff was its weakest element. Many days our room was not cleaned until 4 pm. (Although, ironically, they showed up at 10:30 on the day we were checking out - we were in the process of finishing our packing & did not understand why they did not wait until our check out.) When we pulled down an extra blanket stored in the closet to use, it was very obviously soiled. They immediately sent another one after we called, but then failed to remove the soiled one until the next day. Daily I would have to call to request extra towels/washcloths (primarily because we were trying to get ready & they still had not cleaned our room). Regardless, after a day or 2 of this, note should have been made to leave extra towels in our room. Also, twice they failed to put away the ironing board after it had been used. While these things may seem quite picky, these tiny details are what you are paying for to stay at this caliber of resort. Details are their specialty. The food was good (not outstanding) & quite high ($18 for a cheeseburger - although it did come with both fries & onion rings & $4 for a coke). On the night of our 10th anniversary, we chose to eat at Spago. Again, good but not extraordinary (although I DID thoroughly enjoy the appetizer with the sesame cones). We were highly disappointed that we were not given a table with a view (we notified them that it was our 10 year at the time of making our reservations). When I expressed this, they apologized, but said that those were already taken.

Service was tremendous, almost to a fault. Of course, I will echo previous reviews of this resort by stating it is indeed pricey, especially the food and alcoholic beverages. Even so, it was worth every dollar. On two occasions, I checked out the Fairmont (next to the Four Seasons) as well as the Grand Wailea, Marriott and Renaissance also in Wailea. The Four Seasons is somewhat smaller than its neighbors (Fairmont/Grand Wailea), but I think this lends to its appeal and exclusivity. My fiancee and I stayed on the Club Floor (8th Floor) which costs more because one has unlimited access to food and beverages (including alcohol). It opens at 6:00 a.m., and closes in the late evening. In the long-run, this turned out to be a smart and convenient way to to conserve one or possibly two nights of dining out.

This hotel is just too big to work. Perhaps the fact that we were given the worst Ocean View room I have ever encountered and the location among other Mega-resorts on a dry and unappealing, except for the beach, area of Maui colored my opinions. Our Ocean View, Club Level room was at the back of the inner-side of the U-shaped building. All we could see was a sliver of beach between the wall of our lanai and the rooms on the other side of the resort. They really push the envelope calling it a Ocean View. When I walked in I thought a mistake had been made. The Club Level Room was large but rather corporate and plain. It lacked any kind of plants or floral arrangement. There was no bedisde phone, no shaving mirror, and no magazines in the room. The service was very uneven. Room service did not address us by name on the phone, and the cart was left in front of our door all night and into the next day, despite our call. There were no towels at the pool, and the fountain was not operational; kids ran wild. I requested a big robe in the spa as a cover-up as we had to walk through the public areas of the resort for beachside massage. It never arrived and I had to walk through the Resturant in my bathing suit and too-small robe. The spa attendant offered me a big apology when I returned. I would have preferred proper service. The staff was much more concerned with rushing us to our massage than customer comfort. The architecture of this Monster among Monsters is 80's corporate. It looks like the headquarters of a Silicon Valley chip maker. On the plus side the Club Room food was superb and the L'Occitane amenities were great. Nevertheless, this was by far the most expensive and least appealing lodging of our trip. The place is really just too big and crowded-- noisy, unmannered families and drunks on their Honeymoon--to provide the usual Four Seasons experinece.

I could not decide which hotel to stay at so we split our time between the two. What sets all four seasons hotels apart is the polish and level of service that no other hotel chain can come provide. There were many more positive attributes of this hotel than negative ones. But, to me there were 3 negatives about this resort so that is why I deducted one star. First, the pool area is much smaller than the Fairmont and there aren't as many good seats available when the hotel is occupied to capacity. Plus, the pool itself gets crowded. Second, the resort shares its beach area with the Grand Wailea whereas the Fairmont has a more private secluded beach area so it gets noisy. Third, the walls are really thin so you can hear the guests next to you. During our stay we heard the family next door to us and then later a couple being intimate. It was uncomfortable to say the least. With that being said, there are so many other positives about this hotel that I would stay here again. Our check in was fast and the front desk staff was so professional and helpful. Our room was very nice with a lovely marble bathroom and the rate was $20 cheaper than the Fairmont. Every wednesday is managers reception day at 5 or 6 PM so the hotel offers complimentary mai tais, wine, and snacks with a chance to meet the senior staff members of the hotel (ie: marketing director, manager, etc.). What I really liked about this Four Seasons is that it does not nickel and dime you like the Fairmont. Things like, late checkout (until 2-3PM if room is available), cabanas, DVDs, parking, latest magazines, video games, and bottled water are all free. Pool side service is exceptional, do not refuse an evian spritz! Spago and Ferraros have great menus and if you are counting carbs then there are plenty of options for you. Plus, if there is something on the menu that you would like but it is not available, simply request it with no additional charges. For example, I asked for whole wheat pasta at the Fairmont and was told I would have to give the hotel 48 hour notice and would be charged extra. Four seasons had it readily available with no extra charge. That is is just one example of the level of service at this hotel. The spa is very nice and appropriately priced. I am an avid spa goer with high standards so this spa met my needs quite nicely. I recommend the stress reliever massage and ultimate foot treatment with Doug. Spago is great but I personally enjoyed Ferraro's more because of the amazing sunset view! There are many more complimentary activities at this hotel. We had free scuba and tennis lessons. There are also water aerobics, yoga, spinning, and pilates classes offered. Overall, this hotel offers so many small classy touches that make up for any structural challenges (pool and beach areas) in comparison with other comparable properties like the Fairmont next door. I will most likely stay here again.", "Date": "May 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Keller, TX", "Title": "\u201cStop looking for a place to stay -- THIS is the BOMB BABY!\u201d", "Author": "ADriggs", "ReviewID": "UR3484059", "Content": "This was HANDS down THE most luxurious resort I have EVER experienced.

They also had the bathtub set up with alphabet sponges that spelled out his name and a soft hippo faucet cover on the bath tub. He felt like this vacation was all about him! The pool... the pool attendants are the most attentive, friendly servers. They help you choose locations based on where the sun is and where you wanted to be in relation... if you wanted shade, etc. The pool itself was pristine... the waterfall was fun. My son had a great time. The breakfast buffet was a FEAST! Everything was fresh and tasted as if it were made just the way I liked it. Absolutely divine.

I have since discovered this web site and want to retroactively write a review. This hotel is as good as it gets...PERIOD! We have been lucky enough to have stayed in many of the finest hotels in the world and this one probably takes the cake. Both stays were perfect and I would go back everyday, any day in a heart beat. Where to start? Both times we stayed on THE CLUB FLOOR and if you can afford it you should too. The service was absolutely second to none, by the time we left we felt as if the club concierges were family. They learn your name from the get go and only address you by name afterwards. They have wonderful reccommendations and always follow up to see how your experience was. The club floor (and hotel for that matter) is peaceful, serene and lovely. The restaurants too were exceptional with our favorite being Ferraro's. You will not find a better dining view ANYWHERE if you go at sunset with the tiki torches lit. Absolutely breathtaking. Perhaps the portions were small but the food was delicious and I talked my husband into going there for lunch AND dinner on more than one occasion. Yes it is all expensive but what do you expect? Spago was also fabulous with it's sexy decor and interestingly shaped booths that seem to all face the beautiful view. Food was also excellent. The spa is absolutely peaceful and wonderful as were the couples massages given in grass thatched huts above the beach. There is no greater relaxtion than listening to the ocean crashing onto the beach as you are being massaged. HEAVEN ON EARTH! Yes the spa is on the small side but the treatments and facilities are very nice. The only reason to go to the much talked about Graind Wailea Spa is for the Hydrotherapy circuit which was very interesting and like nothing I have seen before. The spa treatments themselves however were better at the Four Seasons than the Grand Wailea. Overall this hotel is really where it is all at. The rooms are comfortable and very nice and do not make you feel like you are in a traditional hotel room. Rather you feel as if you are in a condo or in the guest room of someone's home. The bathrooms are big and gorgeous and the maid service is great. I obviously cannot say enough great things about this property. The only (and I mean only) negative I can think of is that the treadmills are open air which is nice in the early morning but VERY hot in the afternoon.

I had done extensive research before booking our travel plans for our April honeymoon, and after 10 days of ultimate paradise, we are thrilled with our decision. The Four Seasons is luxurious- there is simply nothing that falls by the wayside, the resort cut no corners when designing this space. The service is impeccable- everyone knew your name and never ceased to ask if you needed anything. And the atmosphere is upscale and intimate- at times you felt like you were on your own private island. They definitely made you feel like special guests. We selected a Partial Oceanview room which offered beautiful views of both the gardens and the pacific ocean. The room was sparkling clean, with double doors leading to a huge bathroom that featured double sink, glass stall shower, large soaking tub, and a private room with a toilet. We had a private lanai with two chaise lounges, and a dining table and chairs. It was so peaceful and relaxing-we never heard a sound, other than chirping birds or the waves hitting the beach. Even though the resort was full during the 10 days of our stay, I think there were only 2 occasions that we even saw another guest in our hallway. The environment at the beach and pool was just as we wanted- serene and quiet. All guests seemed to keep their conversations to a hush, while respecting the romantic intimacy and peaceful beauty of the resort. (The Four Seasons even posted polite notices that cell phone use was discouraged in restaurants and/or dining areas.) Shaded cabanas were provided to you every day, at no charge, and you would be escorted daily by the Four Seasons staff who provided fresh towels and soft chair covers. While you relaxed, the staff would also bring you cold towels, fresh fruit, ice water, and refrehing Evian spritzes-also at no charge. (Other resorts charged as much as $55 per day for the cabanas.) We ate breakfast daily at the Pacific Grill, which was a lavish buffet with a made-to-order omelette/waffle/pancake station, as well as a delectable array of tropical fruits, breads, pastries and more. The chocolate croissants are to die for. We did try the breakfast buffet at the Grand Wailea (next door) and it didn't even compare. And, their restaurant was noisy filled with screaming kids, loud voices and clanking dishes. The Pacific Grill also offered a romantic, tropical atmosphere for dinner. We ate there on our last night and the food and service were both outstanding. The resort had two other restaurants, Wolfgang Puck's \"Spago\" and Ferraro's, but despite great reviews from other guests, we did not have a chance to visit either of them. The Four Seasons concierge was unbelievably helpful. They took care of all our dinner reservations, as well as some local activities, and even typed up itineraries for our convenience. Every restaurant recommendation was perfect, we had no complaints. They also offered easy to understand driving directions to ANYWHERE on the island, and the valet provided bottled water and/or towels (if you were headed out for an island excursion!) If you are looking for a high-class honeymoon where you need not worry about anything but romantic relaxation with your spouse, this is your destination. I travel a great deal in my profession, and I've stayed at many resorts that consider themselves \"five-star\". Very few compare to the Four Seasons, take my word for it. At the Four Seasons Wailea there is no loud music, no volleyball in the pool, and no beachside bingo. Instead you'll find only the calm peace of getting away from it all, in an environment where service and beauty go hand in hand.

So many great things to say. The hotel is beautiful, the pool area and beach are fantastic, if a bit crowded. The food and restaurants are amazing, and the Four Seasons always gives a great service experience. For instance, one day, after returning from the beach, I noticed that on the made-up bed, one of the pillowcases had a small stain. No big deal. I called Housekeeping, reported it, and within 15 minutes someone came by to change the pillowcase. We left the property for dinner and when we returned to our room, there was a voice mail from the asst. mgr. of housekeeping. I called back and she profusely apologized and asked if we were inconvenienced. I said \"no harm, no foul\". When I looked in the washroom, she had left a handwriiten note of apology along with a basket of bath salts and body lotions. This is the Four Seasons! It should be said that it's not cheap, that they did make a small mistake with my golf reservation, and that we found the pool area a little on the busy side. It's also a real \"hotel\", not a resort like their property on the Big Island. But my wife loved their spa, and it's hard to imagine a better hotel experience.

We found it absolutely terrific in almost every aspect. We would happily stay there again. There is a reason that it is almost always booked. 1. Accommodations. The Four Seasons is expensive. It is not significantly higher priced than its neighbors in Wailea, but it is not for those looking for a bargain. We booked a Garden View room, and well, it was a room with a view of a grassy area. It was not a view of the street, but of a somewhat plain grassy area. As a result, we did not spend much time on the lanai. The room itself was terrific. It was large, and the bathroom was enormous, with a separate deep tub and separate shower. The two double beds were somewhat small, but overall the room was great. We had two small kids with us, and we never felt cramped. 2. Service. The service is precisely what you read about: Outstanding. The staff was friendly and responsive. The concierges provided good advice. The valets were efficient. The beach staff friendly and helpful. They even played baseball with our son on the last day. The food and beverage staff attentive. Service is a hallmark of Four Seasons, and it is easy to see why. 3. The Extras. The Four Seasons does not nickel and dime you. The rooms are expensive. But cabanas are free, the pool is large enough (we never felt crowded), and the umbrella and beach tents are free. Sand toys are free. The Kids Camp is free and our kids (5 and 8) loved it. You can drop into the Kids Camp and need not make an appointment. Snorkeling equipment is free for an hour. Ice water is delivered to you at the beach. Bottled water is given to you when you leave for an expedition. We went on a picnic and were provided with an ice chest, waters, and a blanket. We asked for and received, within twenty minutes, a refrigerator for our room. All complementary. There is no resort free. You can use the spa locker room which is excellent. We even got a late check out. 4. The Food. The food was great, but very expensive. This was apparently endemic to Hawaii in general and Maui in particular. Entrees at restaurants are $35 to $40 each, and it can add up. Conclusion. This was a spectacular hotel. The beach, though small, is great and swimable. The service is great. The facilities are great. Everything was wonderful. If you are not interested in a wild \"scene\", and seek a more understated and yet elegant hotel, the Four Seasons is for you.

While the Grand Wailea is nice, and we had zero complaints with the Kea Lani, no hotel on the island can even try and compare with the Four Seasons. From the moment you walk onto the property and step out of your car, you realize what paradise truly is. This is the only hotel in the world where the bellhop is someone you would consider your friend. Everything at this place is designed with perfection in mind: from the amazing restaurants, to the beautiful beach, amazing spa, to the famous view from the top of the steps, booking any other hotel would just be mistake. To further elaborate on how amazing the hotel is, the one year that I did not make it to the Four Seasons, my parents took myself and my siblings to Atlantis in the Bahamas, and while it was nice and fun, it was pale in comparison. Most other people on this message board have mentioned all that is wonderful abut this place, the beautiful rooms, the great ocean views, the AMAZING bathrooms, the complimentary scuba lessons, the great kids program, the impeccable service, the spritzing and fresh fruit. I can mention that one of my favorite times of the day was when the pool staff would bring fruit popsicles around for everyone (~2ish i believe). The shopping and golf cannot even been compared to anything else on the island. While Makena and Wailea are both great courses, I feel the staff at Makena is more personable and I enjoy that course more (probably because it is not as trafficked). To the people that say the Grand Wailea is better for families with kids, they are wrong. They claim that there are kids in the pool, but they are bored - but if they paid any attention they would notice that the kids that are bored in the pool are the same kids that walk over from the Grand Wailea (you can tell it is them from their horrid looking wrist bands) because they are bored there. The kids for all seasons program is amazing, as well as the recently renovated game room - featuring video games, ping pong, pool, table shuffleboard, big screen tv, and plenty of board games and DVDs that work fine in the DVD player in your room. Also, the people that say the Four Seasons is not good for younger people, they must not realize that there are always plenty of honeymooners there, and I really don't see how anyone could choose any other hotel besides the four seasons. I know that I have always enjoyed the Four Seasons, and I hope that other people can experience the same joy as I have.

Pool-side spa services were also available for a fee- the foot massage was well worth it- you don't even need to move- they set up at your chair. The pool is smaller, but clean and not crowded even in peak season. Ferraro's was an exceptional meal where you can watch the sunset and dine seaside. Spago lives up to its name; it was wonderful. Take a walk along with the concrete side walk that follows the ocean for 3 miles, round trip. It's well worth it. Compared to the Grand Wailea, the FS goes above and beyond in all areas. When we return to Maui, we'll stay at FS and visit GW and Kea Lani for a meal or two. Wailea is the only way to go, in my opinion. Shopping and golf is the best on the island. The restaurants are top-notch. Expensive, yes...but what do you expect? Sea Watch at the Wailea Gold golf course has an unparalleled view at sunset and the food was incredible. Sarento's on the Beach, which is run by the same company that owns Nick's Fishmarket, is also a great seaside dining experience with excellent seafood dishes. Both of these restaurants take you off the properties and still have great service and cuisine. Longhi's at the Shops at Wailea was also good food, however the view left a bit to be desired. The Grand Wailea restaurants that we recommend are Humuhumu and Kincha. Before leaving, I booked dinner reservations at a few restaurants for 7:00pm. After arriving, I changed most of the reservations to 6:00 so that we could watch the sunset. Most of the restaurants in Wailea have sunset views and it's worth it to take advantage even though you're dining earlier. With the time change, particularly if you're on the East Coast or CST, you'll be happy you chose to dine early.", "Date": "March 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cLots of Chedder but Worth every Penny\u201d", "Author": "hogburn", "ReviewID": "UR3250085", "Content": "The was the BEST Hotel I have ever stayed at.

We were a bit non-plussed with the \"garden view\" (street/parking lot) from our suite, but the suite itself made up for it. Service is great here. I can't think of any time when I had even the slightest issue with service, and my expectations were very high to begin with. This hotel is fairly high up there in terms of cost. One thing I think you should know, though, is that this hotel doesn't nickel-and-dime you like some. There are a lot of things that are complimentary/included in what they offer that other hotels would charge for. You'll pay for drinks like you would at most places, but this hotel isn't going to add a bunch of extra charges for parking, access to the fitness facility, etc. I've read in other reviews that folks my age felt out of place. I can see why. I worried about what I wore to breakfast. Most of the guests were 20+ years older than us (reflected hilariously in Led Zeppelin played by classical violin and guitar in their Italian restaurant). I'm not saying this is a point that the Four Seasons needs to address: I'm just pointing this out for younger readers--This won't keep me from staying there again. We ate at all three restaurants while there. It definitely wasn't cheap. One thing you need to know about Maui: You're not going to find too many (if any) $20 dinners here. Our average was about $200. The best of the three restaurants was Ferraro's (Italian). If you book an early reservation there, you can see the sunset. Note: This is not a same-day reservation type of place. Book in advance. Spago was ok. They're very proud of their food (like most upscale Maui restaurants). I'd suggest getting dinner at their bar and peoplewatching--great bartenders! Pacific Grill was also fine. Their breakfast certainly is impressive...and expensive. If you are interested in diving, I'd recommend checking their dive shop out. The guys there are very nice, and are very competent at what they do. A quick lesson is complimentary, and I'd recommend taking the $99 dive afterwards. I think we'd both go back, though. Service is great, and this is a great facility.

We had been to Oahu and Kauai a few years before and had a wonderful time. We spent 7 days in Kauai at the Hyatt and loved it. In Maui we had heard and read that the Four Seasons was the place to stay in Maui. The hotel was full during the beginning of our stay, but we were able to get a room for the 5 final nights. We checked into the Four Seasons at around 11am. The hotel, grounds are very beautiful. They were very accommodating from the minute they greeted us at the valet. We changed and sat by the pool. As you have read the pool/beach staff are extremely accommodating. Showing you to your chair, setting it up for you, getting you complimentary water etc. etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This is not a family resort. If you have kids take them next door to the Grand Wailea. There were kids playing in the pool and you could see they were very bored. These kids were kicking around a soda can and the FS staff would run after them to pick up the mess these kids were making. This hotel is very stuffy. I felt obligated to get dressed up to walk to the beach. There were quite a few very rude guests that would get upset at the smallest things. We had enough and decided to check out and go next door to the Grand Wailea. Upon check in (at the Grand Wailea) they upgraded us to a full ocean full (at the least expensive room rate, $309) This is a very beautiful resort. This resort is made for families and young adults while still being very upscale The pool is the best in Maui. It is unreal. They have a separate pool that is for adults only. Very similar to the Four Seasons. No kids allowed. This gives you the best of both worlds. You have a nice private pool with a wait staff. Now the staff isn't as attentive as they are at the Four Seasons, but we went to breakfast in beach attire and didn't feel uncomfortable. I guess it really depends what you are looking for.

It is nice to be able to just run out and jump into the ocean like you can at the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea. The spa at the Four Seasons is very nice. But, so is the Hyatt's.

After staying in the Four Seasons nothing compared to it. For the rest of our honeymoon we yearned to be back at the Four Seasons. It was heaven on earth. Everyone is treated like royalty, no matter what category room you booked. All of the staff is exeptionally nice and eager to please. You get frozen fruit, cold towels and Evian spritzes as you lounge by the pool and the pool waiters are constantly filling your glass with ice water, so you don't even have to spend money on drinks while hanging at the pool if your on a tight budget. The room rates are a little pricey but the Four Seasons offers great packages like the one we booked, the Mountain Side package which has a car and breakfast daily included (plus we got upgraded). the buffet breakfast is $25 per person, so if you tally up the car rate and free breakfast from the room rate, your paying the same amount for the room that you would pay at a lesser class hotel. Most other hotels in Maui have extra charges also like $15/day resort fee, parking fee, kids activities charge. At the Four Seasons this is all included, even valet parking is free.

As we turned in for bed that night, we found the sheets and blankets were damp so we called the Front Desk to complain. They offered to move us to another room and when we went to view this room before moving all of our belongings, it was equally as damp. We were told that we were on a tropical island and it was humid and all of the rooms would feel the same. We had just arrived from Oahu where we stayed at the Halekulani, which was amazing, and did not have this problem. I have never had this problem on any of my vacations, let alone my honeymoon. The second day, we bought candles to try to lessen the smell of must in the room. We also tried turning the air conditioning off and leaving the doors to the patios open because it was more comfortable in the hallways and outside then it was in our room. Before we went to sleep that night, my husband used the hair dryer to dry our pillowcases! After our second horrible night of sleep, we called the Front Desk again and asked for a manager to come to our room. He agreed that the smell of must was overwhelming and moved us to another suite that was damp, but did not have the smell of the original room. He also was able to get us a dehumidifier from Housekeeping. We closed the doors to the bedroom and left the dehumidifier on all day for the rest of our stay at the Four Seasons. It was only after we emptied gallons of water numerous times a day out of the dehumidifier that we were able to get a decent nights rest.

Of course, there are other factors to consider depending on your personality.

Nightlife: If you want to see shows in Lahaina, you need to be type of person who does not mind driving far on highway in evening.

We had debated between this hotel, the Fairmont, and the Grand Wailea but decided on the Four Seasons because they had a promotion on executive suites. Our son goes to sleep at 7pm and also takes 2 naps a day so we wanted him to be able to sleep in the bedroom while we watched TV or talked in the living area. The suites at the Grand Wailea were about $400 more per night. The Fairmont has all suites but after reading some reviews about older rooms, dirty dishes and bugs decided not to go there. I saw a lot of reviews pertaining to honeymooners or couples but I didn't see many regarding people traveling with babies or toddlers (maybe we are the only ones who are crazy enough to do it!) Anyway it was great for our family, I already told my husband I want to go back every year! When we arrived, they had everything ready for our son, from his own lei at check-in, to a microwave, refrigerator (I had them empty the mini-bar), high chair, disposable bibs, diapers, wipes, swim diapers, cookies and milk, toiletries, crib with baby quilt, stuffed iguana, \"JAKE\" spelled out with sponges on the bathtub, and DVD's (Spongebob and Little Mermaid, much to my husband's excitement). Upon reading the list of other things available I requested a baby bathtub and a portable changing table as well! EVERYTHING was complimentary- I guess if you want to save room you don't even need to bring diapers, they will give you as many as you want in whatever size you need! Also, they had baby-proofed the room with outlet covers, netting on the balcony railing, and padding on the tables and nightstands. All the restaurants, including room service, have good children's menus. In the mornings we always had the breakfast buffet which was great, and shared with him. After the first day when I asked for oatmeal (complimentary) they would bring him a bowl every morning without being asked. They have kids dishes, silverware, and cups so you don't even have to bring your own. We went to Spago for dinner and they made him a complimentary cheese pizza because he was fussing and squirming, brought it out within 5 minutes so he didn't have to wait. After he was done eating the wait staff would even bring out damp washclothes so we could clean him up. They have a toddler pool which is small but nice, connected to another pool with a small water slide and waterfall. We spent most of our time at the beach, which is beautiful, great service, umbrellas, ice water, etc. Our son loved to run around and play, they have sand toys you can use. Oh, also, next time we won't bring our stroller, they have beautiful, clean strollers you can borrow, everything from umbrellas to joggers- we took our umbrella which is not so comfy so ended up borrowing a bigger one to take walks every morning- there is a lovely paved beach walk that goes along the water by all the hotels. We also went to the Maui Ocean Center which has a nice Aquarium. Anyway, I had heard this hotel was more for couples but I would highly recommend it for families as well, the incredible service makes travelling with babies so much easier.

The positives: We paid for an ocean front prime view room and were upgraded to a suite...much more room. We didn't need it but it was oh so nice!! Hint: The FS will upgrade honeymooners if rooms are available but they will probably only upgrade you a level or two. We stayed in early December, two weeks before busy season. The room & amenities were amazing. We were looking for superior service and were not disappointed! The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Everything was top notch! Our favorites staffers were the valets....they busted their bums for us. They were always pleasant and helpful. We never went anywhere without a bottle of water, extra towels, directions and a wish for a pleasant day. They even washed our car...without asking...after our trip to Hana!! The pool is small but we spent most of the time on the beach. It was beautiful!! The beach attendants are awesome and deserving of tips so please extend them. Cabanas at the pool seemed to fill up and we did see people stake their claim early and head to breakfast. We also saw some folks reserve a cabana, in the shade, and additional chairs in the sun. Given the size of the pool, I thought this a bit rude, especially when people were looking for poolside chairs in the afternoon. (The winds pick up on the beach after lunch so the pool becomes more desirable.) The restaurants are the best! We ate at Spago's twice and had amazing meals and service both times. We like to eat early so we always had a wonderful table and never had to wait. We suggest early reservations...before 7 and then walk off dinner on the beach walk!! Ferraro's was also awesome. Our romantic dinner was just beautiful. In both restaurants, we found the staff and food excellent. We didn't eat at Capise...up the road...but the concierge recommended it for our next visit..yes...we will be back! Please try it and let us know how it is... The breakfast buffet at the Pacific Grill was always yummy. The negatives: We were actually delayed a day in our arrival due to airline mishaps. Gratefully, our travel agent secured an extra day but told us we would have to move rooms. We were fine with that since we didn't have to pay for the extra night. When we checked in, they upgraded us and advised us that we would not have to move for the extra night. We were very pleased they went out of their way to offset the frustration of traveling 36 hours from Philadelphia!! Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell the assistance manager and we received a message the evening before our departure telling us to be packed up in order to move rooms. Long story short, we stayed in our beautiful suite the last night but weren't too pleased that it took three discussions with the assistance manager. They made an error when we checked in and expected us to move nonetheless. This level of resort, they shouldn't make us feel bad for their mistake. I believe the comment was...\"It was our mistake and I'm going to discuss this error with the employee who made it. We will just have to move the couple scheduled your room to another.\" We didn't need to hear that. Other island pointers: Maui Revealed IS the best guide book. We found it amazingly helpful. There are several great beaches in Wailea just down the road from the resort. We went exploring one day and found them all. The snorkeling is really awesome down by the Maui Prince. We thought the Lahina Luau was overrated and not worth the money. The road to Hana was awesome...the Mustang was fine for the one way trip around. Hope the review helps.

Awesome check-in for Club dwellers - No front desk. You're escorted directly up to the Club Lounge for express check-in with free drinks, warm towels and fresh his/her leis. 2. Unlimited drinks and snacks throughout the day. Forget about room service... a quick stroll to the lounge and you can get whatever you need (in bulk, even). 3. A surprise for my wife was kept a surprise by the staff...no one messed it up! 4. Great consierge service -- for a price, they offer picnic baskets and with a simple call, your car is always ready. 5. The room was a pretty good size. Huge bathroom with bathtub and seperate shower. Ultra soft bed (we both slept great). Romantic lanai. Great turn-down service! Smelled clean and looked immaculate! 6. The dinner at Ferraro's, at sunset, with the live string band was really romantic. Great Service and ambiance (wave lightly crashing in the background and amazing hawaiian sunset). 7. The grounds are well kept; beautiful pool setup. 8. My wife loved the spa services (Scrub, Rub and Facial). We definately got our money's worth! The Bad: 1. The little bar fridge wasn't working -- but they redeemed themselves by giving us a whole new fridge! 2. The bathtub was too small. They say \"deep-soaking tub\", but it only fits one comfortably. With the amount of room in this area, they should have installed spa-style baths. 3. Thank god Spago's has great food, because the service just hurt! We had reservations, which we showed up 15 minutes early for and ended up waiting for at least 45 minutes. Then our waiter made us feel rushed and indecisive. 4. The \"beach\" property they have wasn't very serene. It was kind of cramped and the waves were a bit too big to play in. Plus the employees in this section didn't seem inclined to talk to you. You had to make an effort to get anything. This portion of the resort left a lot to be desired. Overall: Well worth the money.

We have traveled around most of the world and we both agreed that the staff at the resort was the most friendly and polite we have ever come across. Our room was an Oceanview prime that had a good view and a great bathroom. The hotel is laid back a little from the ocean so you could never get a direct beach front room if thats what your looking for. We visted the spa and received a beachfront couples messsage which was excellent. We rented a Harley and rode around the Island, went to Kaanapali did not like it. Older hotels, older homes and apartments even the beach was not the same as Wailea. Went up to the Ritz nice hotel for golf but to far from the beach. Went on a helicopter ride of the Island highly recommend it, you get to see the volcano, hana, and the rain forest with out that long hard drive we have done both don't do the drive. Wailea is by far the best part of the Island great beaches, down the street there is big beach and little beach there is a great inlet for snorkling just by little beach which is all just right of the hotel. The lava fields are just down a little further from little beach something which must be seen. The town of Lahania is also neet avoid the traffic between 4pm.& 6pm. you will think your back at home. For dinning out we went to Nicks was not great, the restaurant at the Grand Wailea average, Ritz had a great restaurant 45min.to get there. Even mamma fish house was not what we expected. Our choice was Spago great food and wine list, Ferraros which I found excellent even though other reviews by others were not as good and Seawatch Restaurant on top of golf course to right of resort.

However the room was spacious and the bathroom was wonderful. We are planing to copy it for our on bathroom. We had a garden room next to our grown children's room so we were able to go from room to room from the lanai's which was very nice. we were also able to go to the pool area from our lanai. It was my daughters birthday and the chef created the most beautiful and realistic shells out of white and dark choclate. Now for the down side that upset us to the point that we will NEVER return. #1. The two restaurants that are owned by four seasons are outside, which you would think would be calm and peaceful looking at the ocean right? Not even close. It was overpriced (expected) average food. But the massive amount of flies and birds at our table made me feel extremly uncomfortable about the safety of my food. flies kept landing on my food and I kept waiting for bird poo to land in something. We were forced to eat in our room the rest of our trip. Oh but we did find an Outback steakhouse down the road. # 2. Don't even bother using the do not disturb signs on your door. they come in anyway. twice when we were out by the pool and went out the lanai door ( where we could see if anyone tried to go in from there) they came in and cleaned and locked us out! Once they came in while i was in the shower. Then after I complained for the 3rd time about it and was told it was their policy to come in anyway. they started banging on the door and calling. usually at very inopportune times. #4. My daughter rented boogie boards and when we were getting ready to check out, I went down to turn them in, Everyone directed me to a different area. one person (the pool consierge) was so busy chatting on the phone, she directed me to the beach in front of the grand wailee. Mind you these were heavy boards and I am a small woman. 30 minutes later I go back to the consierge and when she realized i was ready to call manager she said she would personally take me. I was exhausted and she didn't even offer to help carry one of the boards. Stay at the Sheraton in kaanapali. We have stayed there twice and both time were incredible. Great Hospitality.

Our room view faced the garage and not much mountain view but were upgraded to a partial ocean view after 2 nights. The Wailea area is almost always sunny so you pay for location but I noticed most other decent condos and hotels were around $200 anyway so it is best to pay more for this hotel. We ate in other areas such as Kihei and Lahaina. These were much cheaper and had ocean views as well. The hotel restaurants were very pricey. We also used the free snorkel gear each day but also rented sets for $20 for the week in Kihei so we would have them when exploring the island. The hotel offers free outrigger canoe lesson and trip and it was a blast. Rob and Gary were a lot of fun and we learned a great deal. We also did intro scuba clinic and ocean reef dive offered from the hotel. This was a great way to start and the instructor Clark was really amazing. He made me comfortable and was extremely knowledgeable. The valet was super as well with bottled water and fresh towels for any trips we took and always asked if we needed any directions etc. We mentioned on the way out of breakfast that we were heading to Hana for the day and the staff immediately brought us containers to take anything fromt he breakfast buffet, includ juice cups and tins for fruit. They said you will starve and there are not many places to stop for food. You can take out food complimentary from the buffet. This is a good tip for a snack later or bring an ice tea to the beach.

After reading countless positive reviews of the hotel on Trip Advisor and in top travel magazines, we had extremely high expectations of this resort. Overall, the experience did not disappoint. The service at the Four Seasons is unparalleled by any other hotel chain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were greeted at the hotel entrance with leis (our first in Hawaii) and then escorted to our room by a friendly bellhop (coincidentally from our hometown of Boston), who gave us a quick tour of the hotel on the way to our room. We were upgraded from a Mountain View to Garden View room without even asking, leaving us to wonder what would have happened if we had pushed for an Ocean View. The hotel has a great open air feeling, as almost everything is outside \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the bar to the restaurants and even the fitness center. Our room was vintage Four Seasons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least 400 square feet with a comfortable king size bed and a bathroom the size of most hotel rooms in New York City (complete with double sinks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which we swear we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to replicate in our next home). Curtis (the bartender) told us that one of the few worldwide standards for the Four Seasons Hotels is double bathroom sinks. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Garden View\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was a bit disappointing, as we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any privacy on our lanai, and it overlooked a fountain that was under construction (with people working on it at odd hours of the day). We were treated to a chilled bottle of champagne in our room, which we wasted no time enjoying. The pool at the hotel is exactly how it appears in the pictures. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fun to swim under the central fountain when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turned on, and the views of the ocean are amazing. Our first night, we enjoyed a cocktail at the pool and watched the sun set over the ocean (with the Maui mountains in the distance) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an experience we highly recommend. We spent at least three of our six days relaxing by the pool, and the lounge chairs in private nooks facing the ocean are definitely the place to be. The chairs come complete with pull-up covers in case the hot Hawaii sun becomes too strong (and it is strong in August). The only distraction was all the people talking loudly on their cell phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c usually recapping their weddings in great detail. While the staff couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been nicer, the guests were a lot less friendly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not that it mattered much to us. People at the hotel tend to go to bed early \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the restaurants even close by 9 most nights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the pool and hot tubs are open for all-night enjoyment. The breakfast buffet was pricey and very mediocre compared to other Four Seasons we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve visited. There was no special brunch on Sunday, and the food reminded us of something you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d find at a Disneyworld resort (except with amazing fresh fruit juices). Breakfast next door at the Grand Wailea was much healthier and cheaper! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat dinner at any of the restaurants, but we did splurge for the Ultimate Romantic Dinner. The price was astronomical, but our customized five-course dinner overlooking the ocean more than made up for it. We also ate at Nick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fishmarket at the Fairmont Hotel next door. After hearing rave reviews of Nick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, we have to admit that we were extremely disappointed. The tuna was way over-salted and served with greasy french fries no less! We also had a terrible bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. And top it all off, we were attacked by a dying bird on the (dark) walk back to the Four Seasons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so much for a romantic moonlight stroll. If you want a truly amazing dining experience on Maui, make the 45-minute drive to the Banyan Tree at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua. The lemongrass soup is truly one-of-a-kind. Overall, the Four Seasons Maui was a true oasis. However, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say as much about the surrounding community of Wailea, which felt more like a master plan suburban development than a charming Hawaiian village.

We celebrated our 10th anniversary there for 5 nights (9/17-9/22), followed by a 5 night stay at the Hyatt Regency at Kauai. Hyatt was nice and very \"hawaiian\" in feel, but it was not even close to the Four Seasons in terms of luxury, cleanliness and service. Any time we asked for anything, the staff gave us what we needed and then closed with the phrase, \"Is there ANYTHING else I can do for you?\"...no exaggeration...EVERY single time. The Four Sesason's earth-toned, open-air lobby is absolutely incredible and truly makes you feel like all your worries are being lifted away as you step into it.

Our guest room was impeccably clean with an extremely comfortable bed, a large lanai and one of the most well-designed bathrooms I've ever seen (not a detail was spared). We had a partial ocean-view 6th floor room that had a decent view of the ocean but was part of the outer wing (overlooking the main driveway into the reception/entrance), so did not have the view of the pool/fountains and experienced some noise from the passing cars. This noise was eliminated by keeping the lanai door closed, but if you're one to enjoy sleeping with the just the screen door, you might get annoyed. I think that a partial ocean view or a garden view in the middle section (overlooking pool/fountains area) would have been prettier and quieter. It's true that the pool and pool area are somewhat smaller than at the other resorts, but it didn't feel crowded at all and we always got shaded chairs. Though maybe mid-to-late September is relatively low season. I could see it getting a little crowded over the summer when kids are out of school.

Overall we had a wonderful time and would stay there again. One thing to keep in mind if you are looking for a \"romantic getaway\", etc. In genreal Maui is just as much a family vacation spot as it is a honeymoon/couples spot. Hotel Service: From check-in to check-out all staff was pleasant and helpful. Things to note: valet will provide bottled water (if asked), towels if headed to another beach, blankets if headed to Haleakala for sunrise. If you are wondering if you should rent a car or not ask questions about their car service, there was some complimentry service. At one point our room key was not working, security was at our room within 5 minutes. This occured because we had exteneded our stay by one night and needed to get new keys issued, which we were not informed of (the only speck on the service record) Rooms: We stayed in the \"cheap room\" and would again. To us the view isn't important for the amount of time we were in the room. If you are paying 345 your not going to have a view of the ocean, it will be over the garage, tennis courts, road, mountain, golf course. Try to request a room on the upper floor to minimize noise from garage. We were on the 7th floor and we did have some noise, but nothing unbearable. I did however notice that some sounds do travel a bit in the rooms...like the TVs. Bathrooms were marble/huge. No problems with maid service came twice a day. Always had fresh towels. There were wonderful cookies waiting for us in the room when we arrived. Spa: We visited the spa twice and had a great experience. Would recommand having at least a massage. We made our reservations a month in advance for our treatments. Not sure if this is a must but we wanted certain things on certain days so thought it was a good idea. There were people actually coming over from the Grand Wailea. Grounds: During our visit they started some renovations around the fountain in the courtyard which included scraping up the concrete, etc. They tried to make this as discrete as possible, but if you were sitting by the pool the noise from this construction was not pleasant. Renovations have to happen, you just hope it's not during your visit. We spent almost all of our time on the beach so it did not bother us. The grounds were clean and well landscaped. Pools: There are two pools the smaller (the one with the waterfall) is cut into 2 sections with the lower section considered \"the kid pool\". The main pool has 2 large jacuzzis, one is adults only. I never saw more than 10 people in the pool at one time so despite their size you can enjoy the pool. The hotel was at capacity while we were there and we never had a problem getting a seat. Yes people start getting \"prime\" areas at 7am, but there are some rules. You can not \"save\" a cabanna. If you leave yor cabanna for more than 20 minutes (unless between 11-2 to have lunch) you lose it. So gone are the stories of somone dropping a book at 7am and not actually showing up till 11 AM. We never had a problem getting covered chairs on the beach. If we got there after 10 we may be sitting behind someone which prevented a direct view of the ocean. The pools are in the center of the resort and if you are in the pool as dinner starts you may feel a bid like your on display. Wailea Beach and all beaches south of Lahania (never ventured north of Lahania)...due to severe winter storms the depth of these beaches is much less than you might expect. When we arrived on the first day we expected much more sand based on pictures in books and from friends who visited prior to this past winter. We found this to be true on many beaches along the west coast of Maui. Our first restaurant was Pacific Grill. This was the best food and service at a Four Seasons restaurant. Would eat here again. Waiter was outstandings as was the fish sampler! (1 drink, 1 app, 2 dinners, 2 desserts, tip, $150) The Pacific Grill is the only place open for breakfast. Buffet is $25 also has an ala carte menu. Best buffet I've ever had, worth to try it once. Steep to go every morning. We ventured into Kihei some mornings. Ferroros is the only place for lunch. Will run you about 50 bucks for two people. We also went to Ferroros for dinner. Has been named by some as the \"most romantic\" place for sunset/dinner. Okay there is a great view of the sunset (if your in the front), but since this is a family friendly resort and sunset is about 6:30, you guessed it ...the average family also eats at 6:30 so your romantic dinner will most likely include tired children. The food here was just average for what you expect for this hotel and the price. The service was also a bit off, but this may be because we had such a great waiter at the Pacific Grill. I would not return here or recommond it to a friend...SKIP THIS ONE.(2 drinks, 2 apps, 2 dinners, 1 dessert, tip, $135) FYI..Your best bet is to eat dinner around 8PM if you want a \"romantic\" evening. It seemed that most of the families were done with dinner by then. Spago...due to the name we expected nothing but the best here. We had a 6PM reservation and were brought to our table which was in the front of the restaurant but located at the corner (L shaped up front) so our table was sort of in the corner of the L we could see the sunset fine, but quickly realized our table was sort of floating out there and the tables at th top of the L were set up for a party of about 25 that showed up just as the sun was setting. We should have spoke up as soon as we sat, but we didn't realize that we were on top of the party till they arrived. We would have caused a scene had we asked to move at this point (we were eating apps). We should have never been seated in such an area, we just made the best of the situation. When your on vacation the last thing you want is stress and problems. Anyway the apps were tasty as was my meal, surf and turf. My husband had the same and we had our meat cooked the same, but his was over done...this is Spago we just expected more. And of course once the party arrived our service suffered too. Dessert was excellent!! (4 drinks, 2 apps, 2 dinners, 2 desserts, tip, $235). Overall we expected a bit more, probably not do it again, but would get dessert there!! Warm chocolate cake was out of this world!!! I did point out and stressed some of the negatives, but that is how you make the next vacation better. Price info may also help some that are trying to budget. Hope it helps someone. We would stay at this hotel again as the service was bar-none. We would just explore some of the other restaurants in at the other resorts. They were the reason I did not go with 5 stars. Other notes: Snorkal Equip free for first hour (water was too turbulant while we were there to comment on how good or bad it can be) 5 buks additional hour /12 day. They have an Outtrigger Canoe hour trip 3 times a day (mornings) on certain days but limited space. May want to ask about and book before you arrive if interested. They are building new condos in Front of the Shops at Wailea. Therefore there are no views from the restaurants on the bottom floor (Longhi's, Cheeseburger). If you are thinking about staying at the Grand Wailea or Marriot. You definetly do not want to stay on the north side of the Grand Wailea or the south side of the Marriot. We ate lunch at Tommy Bahamas one day and it was very noisy. And there is currently a huge yellow crane ruining your view.

We had planned this trip months ago and had debated staying at the Four Seasons, the Fairmont Kea Lani or the Grand Wailea. We were all so glad we chose the Four Seasons. The resort is truly lovely, the staff gracious and the included amenities are terrific. We made good use of the pools (never had trouble getting shaded chairs), the beach (on calmer days, we used the complimentary snorkel gear and took out boogie boards and rafts when the surf was up), played croquet on the course outside our room, used the workout equipment and the terrific locker rooms, and enjoyed the game room with the kids. We also loved the beach walk in the morning that runs along all of the Wailea resorts. I pampered myself at the spa and we had terrific meals at Spago and overlooking the beach at sunset at Ferraros. We had the bed & breakfast package and started each day off with a great buffet breakfast at the Pacific Grill. On the one morning the kids wanted to sleep in, the hostess graciously handed me a ton of covered containers to fill with breakfast and take up to the room. The resort is certainly expensive, but considering that many of the amenities are included, it didn't seem to be any worse than the two neighboring resorts. Plus it is so much prettier than the other two resorts - the pools overlook the ocean and the rooms are large, spotless and just plain luxurious. Our only dissappointment was in the tennis. The two courts on the premises are an odd surface and up on the 6th floor roof. It gets very hot up there and it didn't seem to get much use. My husband did get in some free time with the ball machine every day so he was satisfied. Don't even bother with the Tennis Center at Wailea. The staff is rude and the pricing is ridiculous. A couple of other tips - take Dramamine before driving the Road to Hana - it's brutal. Also, if you have a car and run through laundry as quickly as we do, drive up to Kihei and use the Lipoa Laundry Center - you can drop your laundry and pick it up the next day. They charge $1.25/pound to do it for you. Much better than paying $5.00/t-shirt at the resort!

The ocean view was worth the extra expense for us just to be able to wake up in the morning and relax on our lanai, by ourselves, and enjoy the ocean. The room was spectacular, and so were the resaurants at the FS. Spago was the best in our opinion. We ate there the first night, and every other meal that we had while in Maui paled in comparison....until we went again our last night (the prime beef, if on the menu, is phenomenal. It is the most expensive item, but is worth every penny...ask your server to describe it and you won't be able to say no). At Ferraro's the food is good, but in our experience could not compare with that at Spago. Nevertheless, the atmosphere at Ferraro's was better, with true ocean front dining and live violin music every night. Also, if you feel like a dip in the pool or ajoining hot tubs at night, you will usually find them completely empty and be able to enjoy star filled nights in a beautiful setting with the violin music nearby (very relaxing and romantic). The resort did at times feel more packed than at others, but we never felt that it was crowded. The staff was always attentive, and we rarely waited more than just a few minutes for any request or order to be filled.

We chalked it up to the extremely hot August weather that week and long hours this employee must have been putting in. The food was very good in each restaurant, but especially so in Spago's. The property itself is certainly up to standards and well kept, but my wife and I couldnt help get the felling that the layout and design of some areas were dated and beginning to show their age. If you don't plan on leaving the property during your stay you'll be very happy at the hotel itself, if you plan to go into town (Kihea) you might be dissapointed. For years we had always vacationed on the other side of the island (Kaanaapali) where the is a lot more to do outside of the hotels compared to the Kihea area. The downside to Kaanaapali is that the resorts aren't the same caliber of the Four Seasons. The hotel baby-proofed our room beautifully and offered a nanny service as well. Cleanliness of our room and the property overall was never an issue, although I do have a disgust for tropical bugs, namely cockroaches and unfortunatly we were visited by 2 during our week long stay. Luckilly they were not the giant ones that usually roam tropical islands. The fitness center had various cardiovascular and weight training machines along with dumbells up to 50 lbs.

My husband and I got married on June 24th at the Four Seasons Wailea and I can't say enough about the experience or the hotel. Amazing. Since we were having our wedding there, we were automatically upgraded from a garden view room to a junior suite. We never even asked. I hear they do this (upgrade rooms) for people on their anniversary as well. The junior suite was a fabulous place for me to get ready on my wedding day. There was a spacious living room equipped with a well stocked bar, sink, dining table, Bose stereo and large television set. The bathroom had it's own satilite stereo system. Not a dinky radio, but a nice stereo system. L'Occitane bath products were stocked in the bathroom. The bathtub was equipped with a large nice loofa sponge, sea salts and a \"bath tea bag\" stuffed with lavendar and other herbs. Mine actually exploded in my tub which was interesting..but still nice. Due to the wedding, we received different presents every day during our stay such as exotic chocolates (the presentation was so beautiful we didn't want to eat it..but we did!), hand written notes by the staff congratulating us, champagne...fresh flowers...I felt like a princess..it was wonderful. On our wedding night, we received a gift of beautiful bubble bath, candles and a flower trail of orchids. The customer service is spectacular. Every staff member from the valet person to housekeeping is always trying to anticipate your needs and consistently provided service with a genuine smile. I wanted to hug everyone when it was time to go! We did not meet one rude staff member the whole time we were there. The pool is a wonderful environment..yes there were kids, but if you don't like kids I would not suggest traveling to Maui. They were everywhere. If you are coming on your honeymoon and do not want kids around, I would suggest finding a private home or condo..something perhaps on Kauai. I noticed it was a little more quiet there and not as many kiddos. Although the cabanas filled up quickly, I never had a problem finding a family that was leaving...I could snag one easily and enjoy! The pool furniture cushions were actually comfortable and plush. The waves were kicking while we were there, so I did not have a chance to snorkel. However, I can imagine on a calmer day, there is a great rocky area to the left of the beach which I bet is great for snorkeling. Every time we went to the beach, a staff member would set up our chair, put the towels down, add the sun shade thing if we wanted..before we would ever have to ask! The hotel is beautiful, but what makes the Four Seasons so special is 1) the customer service and staff and 2)the fact that they don't nickel and dime you once you are there. For example, at all the other resorts, we had to pay a daily rate of $15 for parking. No charge at the FS and valet is also complimentary. No charges for beach chairs, towels, etc. I did not find that the drinks were much more expensive than the other places, although I am sure that depends on where you stay and also WHERE you eat/drink on the Four Seasons property. I read that a few people have commented in the past about \"cell phones\" and the \"snobby people\" who visit the Four Seasons. I am a laid back, middle class girl from Austin, Texas and I did not feel uncomfortable at all. I assure you, I don't dress up around the beach. (I live in Austin so I rarely dress up at all)..Honestly, I looked quite hideous every time I went to the pool. Every family i met at the Four Seasons was nice and friendly. Yes, there are a lot of kids, but once again, they were everywhere in Hawaii! There were probably a million kids and babies on my flight from LA to Maui. I was prepared though and it did not bother me in the least. I was actually impressed by all the \"young\" travellers and how well behaved most of them were (a compliment to all you parents out there!) Also, I was one of the \"cell phone people\" but I am not a snobby cell phone person! I simply had to talk on my phone alot to plan my wedding details! We had guests who always had questions and wanted to know where we were, so unless I stayed trapped in my room i had to use my cell phone. Anyway, my point is that yes, i think it is rude to use your cell phone out in public all the time like that, but sometimes there are situations that are out of your control. I did not mean to offend anyone while I was using it. Of course I know, there are the people who go overboard. Anyway, I highly recommend the Four Seasons and will return in the future. Although it is much pricier than I would normally pay for a hotel, it is worth every penny to me. By the way, if you can go by Ferraros and have dinner/drinks or appetizers, I hope Don Lax (violin) and Vance (acoustic guitar) are playing. They played at my wedding and were incredible. Ask them to play \"Ave Maria\" or Con Te Partiro\"..it will make you cry! My husband and I danced (first dance) to the Beatles' \"Here There and Everywhere.\" Beautiful! If that, along with a tropical drink, good food and an amazing sunset doesn't make you feel romantic, I don't know what will (ha ha) One more thing: after the Four Seasons, we honeymooned at the Princeville in Kauai. It was a beautiful hotel but I think the Four Seasons has ruined us forever. We kept comparing everything to the Four Seasons and the Princeville just can't hold a candle. The Princeville is a nice hotel, but the Four Seasons is an experience that you really can't put a price tag on.

Our experiences at the Four Seasons have been wonderful and we have found the hotel to be simply superb. When my wife and I have been to Maui we have not gone during Christmas or Spring Break so we have not had to deal with a hotel at full capacity with young families. That being said, if you go at this time of the year you should expect to (i) have difficulities getting chairs at the pool and (ii) see a lot of young kids and families. Obviously all of the hotels in Hawaii are going to be busy during those periods of time and will have similar constraints. In fact, no warm weather destination will not struggle with those problems during those two seasons. If you have a problem with crowded hotels and the accompanying issues, you should not go during the busiest seasons during the year. People bring their young children to the Four Seasons because they can afford to and also because the hotel accommodates young families wonderfully. What other hotel has child care services all day, for free. As for the obnoxious baboons with their cell phones at the pool, you really can't blame the hotel for that (that just seems to be the way our society is going). Regarding the inability to purchase inexpensive water and other items, the Four Seasons is a high end expensive hotel. Guess what, they have a business plan of making money. People should not expect to stay at the Four Seasons in Maui and be able to purchase inexpensive sundry items at the hotel. That is simply not the nature of this type of property. The Wailea shops next door provide ample opportunity for those who don't wish to pay premium prices for such items. Personally, we stock up on those items early as I have a similar distate for paying a premium for bottled beverages. As for the bottled water, during our stays bottled water was plentiful (whether at the exercise room or at the valet) and we never encountered staff expressing any concern to provide any amemnity that we requested (water, toiletries or otherwise). While certain criticisms are legitimate (ie. failure to identify credits on bills) a number of these are reflective of unrealistic expectations.

Amid honeymooners and families, I was concerned about being self-concious being a single female traveler! The bellman who escorted me to my room gave me several restaurant suggestions at both the resort, the Kea Lani and the local areas, where I can enjoy a meal as a single traveler, rather than ordering room service. Having spent a few childhood years in Oahu, I also inquired about where I can find \"butterfish\" and \"malasadas\" and he told me he'd get back to me with recommendations. Next day, he spots me in the lobby and personally listed the 'local' hangouts along with directions. The places I tried hit the spot for me. The service throughout the hotel was beyond excellent and everyone greeted me by name by my second day. I do agree with the honeymooners from Toronto (\"Kihei: Four Seasons Resort Maui: \"Paradise? Depends on what you are looking for...\" ), that it can be pretty crowded --getting up early to secure a poolside place isn't really 'lounging'. For this reason, its best to make the most of the Spa. The Thai massage was INCREDIBLE and the Cocoon and bath package, along with a cranial-sacral massage was very relaxing. My masseusse, who took care of me during the Cocoon and bath treatments, packed bath salts for me to bring back home, since she didn't use it all during my treatment. The spa rooms were very well appointed and elegant -- much nicer than the bling bling Grand Wailea (looks like Vegas in Hawaii!). Also, a 5 minute drive south of the resort are two beaches much more beautiful and wider than the hotel beachfront. One is called \"Big Beach\" and another is unmarked, just go through the two orange posts. The unmarked beach is black sand and my friends spent a day there snorkeling and saw many sea turtles (another local recommendation). Also, one point that the Toronto reviewer made about the leis is misguided. The leis made of leaves are not from 'orchid vines' but from ti leaves.

The hotel is beautiful, the service is incredible, and the location is breathtaking.", "Date": "January 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHigh priced pampering on the Club Level\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1543208", "Content": "My husband and I consulted this site often before chosing the Four Seasons as our vacation destination and our expectations were high. We booked the Club Level for which we paid approx. $800 a night after taxes. We did have a ocean view room on the top floor, which also included the sound of cars coming and going over the valet area. We were greeted at our arrival and escorted to the club level for check-in. We found the concierge service attentive and experienced...booked all our activities and dinner reservations through them. At the club lounge, we had available continental breatfast, afternoon tea and cocktails, evening desserts. Went downstairs to the breakfast buffet one day for a change...two buffets and a latte cost $70 after tip. There was an honor bar in our club room...$3.50 for a Coke, and $8.50 for a bottled water! We could walk over to the lounge and ask for beverages without cost, so this seemed inappropriate. We had no problem with beach seating during our stay...a turkey sandwich on the beach is $15. On our second day we received a message to call the front desk...our credit card did not have available funds when they charged the entire stay...our intent was to pay cash using a debit card upon departure, so this was an embarressment to us...if we has known the policy, we would have provided this debit card to secure the room. The Four Seasons signature massage was truly special while my husband enjoyed golfing the gold course. Our best dinner was at the Kea Lani...Nick's Fish Market. The best excursion was the Sky Trek to Hana...a comfortable and informative ride up to Hana, with a helicopter return. We also enjoyed the Warren and Annabelle show up in Lahaina. A rental car is a definate must. We think the world is too big to visit the same place twice, but we will not hesitate to chose Four Seasons Hotels as we have done in the past. Our most spectacular hotel and service commendations still go to Pebble Beach...that and the high prices are why we chose above average for the rating.

My husband and I stayed there for 5 nights in early December for our honeymoon. As soon as we arrived they adorned us with leis and we were escorted to the reception desk. Check-in was a breeze and they upgraded our partial ocean view to a full ocean view. The bellman took us on a tour of the hotel, offered to snap pictures, and escorted us to our room. He gave us a tour of the room, which was beautiful, and explained everything to us. In the room there was a bottle of champagne and some Hawaiian cookies. Nice touch! From there we spent the next 5 days in paradise at an absolutely beautiful hotel with perfect service. The Four Seasons defines what a 5-star hotel should be. All guests are treated as equals (no reserving the cabanas at the pool- first come first serve) and as adults. There were no silly signs everywhere telling you what you could or could not do, there were no silly rules. Every time I thought that I wanted something, it was there. The staff is excellent and does a great job of making you feel special during your entire visit. As soon as you arrive at the pool, they will assemble a chair for you wherever you want (pool, beach, overlooking the ocean, etc). When you come back from a jog, the bellman will greet you at the door\u00c3\u201a not to harass you about if you\u00c3\u201a re staying there or what room you\u00c3\u201a re in, but to hand you a bottle of water and a cold towel. The restaurants are all wonderful, but expensive (but you should really expect that if you\u00c3\u201a re staying at a 5-star resort.) They have an adults-only hot tub which is something EVERY hotel should have. The beach is beautiful and the two pools are just enough (not huge or amazing like the Grand Wailea, but elegant and just what you need). Overall, I\u00c3\u201a d say that if you can afford it, don\u00c3\u201a t think twice about staying at the Four Seasons. It was definitely worth the money and you will never think twice about your decision.", "Date": "December 23, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g609129-d87397-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Resort_Maui_at_Wailea-Wailea_Maui_Hawaii.html", "Price": "$504 - $1,401*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3900 Wailea Alanui</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Wailea</span>, Maui, <span property=\"v:region\">HI</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">96753</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "87397", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c5/4c/c54c6e83a920702fa564d184ddbb3cee5large.jpg"}}

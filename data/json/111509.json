As a matter of fact, I will hold the memories fresh in my mind and look forward to our next visit. I will not \"try\" another hotel, there's no reason to. Everything is within walking distance. We walked to Oak Street Beach, walked to the 900 Shops, had an amazing dinner on Rush Street and had a breathtaking view of Lake Michigan.

It was the Friday of the snow storm so our journey had been slow. I had booked through Air Canada for a Deluxe Lakeview - two double beds but was shown to a standard room with one bed - that really disappoints me - the booking is clear - why do they not get it right first time? we got the right room eventually. We popped across the snowy road to Gibsons for a bite to eat and as many reviewers say, this is a great place for great steaks and there are many other eating establishments nearby. Next morning we could see our room properly and with the floor to ceiling windows on two sides (corner room) on the 18th floor the views were great - we do like views from our bedrooms wherever we are. Room was generally good - a little dated in places, the bathroom a good size and a nice separate glass shower cubicle with a good showerhead. Beds comfortable and a decent work desk - the TV was an old bulky CRT type and really ought to be replaced with a modern flat screen and similarly the dated CD player with an ipod connection. I do feel that internat connection shud be free - why can I go to Starbucks and spend a few dollars on a coffee and get free internet but spend hundreds on a room over four nights and have to pay for WiFi? The Whiskey Bar and Grill is OK but I would have thought an additional more sophisticated eatery appropriate for this establishment - perhaps the problem is all the alternatives nearby. At least the internet connection was free in the bar.

The location couldn't be better on beautiful East Bellevue Place and Rush Ave next to the BEST of the best of restaurants, shops, and bars on Rush Avenue. Guest rooms are large with comfortable beds although the linens were ridiculously thin and the sheets (not fitted) kept coming undone which was frustrating. The bathroom was large with excellent bath amenities (\"Gilchrist & Soames), 2 terry robes, a powerful shower and huge soaking tub which came in handy after a day of Christmas shopping. There was even a drawer where we could store our make up and toiletries. We tried the restaurant downstairs for breakfast (a deviation from our normal trip across the street to the Original Pancake House!) and I had Eggs Benedict which was good (not great) and reasonably priced. The SP has a lovely lounge downstairs called The Whiskey where you can sit, drink, (watch TV on one of the many large screens) or watch the people pass by the lounge from the large windows on Rush Avenue side. I think this Whiskey is a branch of the once famous LA-based \"Whiskey-A-Go Go\". Kind and efficient front desk lady, (forgot her name--sorry!) the only one there and always working, also helped us find the U Alabama Alumni bar (\"The Houndstooth\") where we watched the UA v Auburn game--a raucous party indeed! A big thanks to her for that!! My only reservations about this hotel: 1) there were way too many doormen and not enough front desk staff. Every time I came downstairs to inquire about something, either the desk was vacant, or the poor young lady working was swamped while the doormen mulled around with nothing to do. The same lady worked the entire time (4 days) we were there--I hope she gets paid appropriately! 2) I had previously informed the SP that we had a third person who was coming in the day AFTER we arrived. However the SP charged us an extra person charge [$40] for the first day although the person hadn't even arrived!!! When I complained about this nothing was done nor offered. 3) no ice machines--must call room service and 4) no coffee/coffee maker in rooms (although excellent coffee in lobby during morning hours). So, location perfect, bar excellent, happy and friendly doormen, good morning coffee in the lobby but obviously not Four Seasons or Ritz level. The employees were nice enough but the X Factor traditionally exhibited by 4-5 **** hotels was definitely missing.

It is not a posh 5-star hotel with turn down service, fresh flowers and chocolates in your room. But its value, location and service compete pretty well with those. One last word of advice: taking the L from O'Hare is the cheapest and one of the quickest ways to get here, but don't do this if you are heavily loaded.

The desk staff, as well as the concierge, parking valet, etc. were not helpful at all and, in some cases, were downright rude.

I was really excited to be able to stay in this hotel with my husband and was looking forward to spending time at the Whiskey Bar and Grill on site but this did not occur. Upon our arrival we were told, \"we have a slight situation\". Due to the Chicago Bulls basketball team winning a game on Thursday night (and not playing again until Sunday) the team was contracted to stay at this hotel. Our stay was to be from Friday to Sunday but were kicked out due to the ball team getting the first accommodations. I really wished the hotel would have told me that this was a possibility when I called about the reservations (they had to have known in advance that this was possibly going to happen). Anyway, the hotel and driver re-accomodated at another hotel and paid for our hotel stay which was nice but not really that easy of a story. They sent us to \"White Hall\" which is supposedly a 4 star hotel. NOT! The paint was peeling off the walls and the decor was from the 80's. Nothing about this was pleasing. We checked in, seen the room, and were disgusted. We went back to Sutton Place to inform them that those accommodations would not work. They then accommodated us at the Talbot.

It is in a perfect area surrounded by many restaurants and shops for those who have time to shop. When the weather is warm enough it's close enough to enjoy the lake if you're looking for a nice stroll or need to get a little workout in. Overall location and conveniences the hotel offers are pretty paramount. My recent stay was good. Not great, but good. Nothing so bad happened that I wouldn't stay at this property again but there are a few glitches that make you go ummmm. Remember, I stay here mainly for the location and partly for everything else. Upon check in, I felt like I was kind of bothering the front desk people. There was a tinge of attitude like I should be thankful for staying at the property. Not unfriendly, just not feeling like these people would go above and beyond for you. Fine. Whatever. It's not like I rely on them for much any way. The rooms: The rooms themselves are nice and fairly spacious. The decor in the bed-room is decent and up to date but the bathroom. That's a whole other story. For the times I have spent at this property, I say the same thing to myself. This bathroom is in dire need of an update. Literally I don't think its changed since 1984 when the hotel was probably built. Horrible dated tiles. Horrible dated fixtures. Things work but the bathroom is laughable. It would be a good candidate for a makeover show. With all the competition out there for hotel dollars in the area you would think they would make an effort to update. Now it's just sounding funny. My last complaint is also a service complaint. I went down for breakfast at a normal breakfast hour and waited FOREVER to be seated. There wasn't anyone running the place. I had to look around for someone to help me as did another hotel employee. It looked like no one in the place was being helped. And once someone did, they didn't have any sort of apologetic attitude. I guess it was only this one person running everything and wouldn't be surprised if he was also preparing the food in the back. Again, a hotel of this caliber should not have these kind of service problems. Oh and I forgot from my previous stays how weak the wireless is. You literally have to find the one spot in the room where it works flawlessly. I travel all over the country and stay at many different properties. This kind of falls in between what's on the high end and what's on the lower end of my spectrum. Not the worst place but I might try another property in the area.

Impressive. My friends and I stayed on the 22nd floor with a view of downtown Chicago that took our breath away. We kept our curtains open during the entire 24 hour stay. In the evening when all the buildings were lit, we marveled at the view from our room. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and accommodating.

Then on New Year's the bartender at The Whiskey, which is attached to the hotel, told us we could come back that night and hang out at the bar. There is nice area with leather couches that she said would be open.

This was in stark contrast to the quality of the room cleaning on Friday; and a disappointing way to return to our room later Saturday evening.

The concierge seemed confused when we asked to leave our luggage at the hotel while we went to lunch, and no one seemed to be available to hail a cab for us. Otherwise, the rooms were generally clean and comfortable. Our room was large with a nice television (although a flat screen, it was not in HD) and floor-to-ceiling windows.

Turned out to be a great first Hotel on our journey. Front-desk staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed in a corner room (1014) with views of Lake Michigan. Could see The Hancock and The Drake Hotel from our room. Wonderful sunrises each morning! Two walls of windows really made a difference in the feeling of spaciousness and light in the room. VERY NICE! Room was spacious and comfortable and very, very clean. Bathroom was comfortable and well-planned. Climate control in room was quiet and efficient. We loved the corner the hotel was located on. It felt intimate and safe with a light energy since several restaurants are there and everyone was eating outdoors-cafe style late into the evening every night. Even a little gelatto place in a park-like setting caddy-corner across the street. Twinkling lights at night---a wonderful scene. We felt connected to downtown Chicago and yet, somehow a little bit removed and more intimate..This location is just at the beginning of The Gold Coast--the up-scale neighborhood to the north. So, this is a good looking area and it feels safe. We fell in love with Carmines Italian restaurant. The quality of the food was excellent but the price tag moderate. Service-- warm, friendly and attentive. Since we were planning to eat out every meal for a month-we were mindful of the expense. We avoided near-by and well-known Mortens and Gibsons because of the cost. So, Carmines was a nice surprise for us. A large menu with variety. The package deal I arranged through Perfect Escapes included breakfast at the Hotel. Turned out not to be as advertised-not a full breakfast buffet. But, we were satisfied with the quality of a small plate of very fresh and fresh-cut fruit, with fresh squeezed-YES! FRESH SQUEEZED orange juice , tea or coffee and a bagel, muffin or toast. On our last day we \"splurged\" and ate a real big wonderful breakfast at The Pancake House across from the Hotel. GREAT! Line-up early it's packed always. Now we know why. Needless to say, just the next block begins outrageously beautiful designer shopping opportunities. LADIES bring a few grand and plan to buy your new clothes here and along the Magnificent Mile. Window shopping as we skipped down the MILE to reach other destinations was fun. The Sutton Place Hotel is perfectly located for those of us who prefer to walk a few miles each day..it's located at the \"top\" end of about an actual mile to the River where you must take a CAF architectural river cruise...visit the Cultural Center for a surprisingly beautiful building...take the stairs to the top floor to see the largest Tiffany Glass dome in the world and lovely mosaic tile on the walls. Pretty! Lovely, thoughtful quotes on the walls everywhere regarding philosophy, higher learning and, of course--since this building was a library -READING. See The Palmer House. Near the El. Visit The Drake Hotel's lobby and shops. All, only if you love beautiful interiors and architecture-classical! Eat deep dish Chicago pizza at Lou Mulnattis (check the spelling) Was the best pizza our group ever tasted!! A tip from our SEE IT ALL CHICAGO tour guide. If you are into home decor, furnishings, designer linens etc---it's a must to spend hours and hours at THE MART. The showrooms are super.

When we checked out, we had to wait in a long line because there is no express checkout, as they actually use keys for the rooms instead of cards like every other hotel in the 21st century.

Despite reading on their website, and even in a brochure sitting in my room, that all bathrooms had a soaking tub and separate enclosed shower mine did not. It had a small tub with a shower head on the wall. The tub looked to be old and had been covered with some sort of vinyl covering that crinkled when you stepped on it. The black and white tile on the floors and walls reminded me more of a dorm bathroom than a 4 star hotel. Having stayed in many of the 4 star hotels downtown, I would say this is one of the worst. The \"fitness center\" is just an old hotel room that they have placed 4 or 5 cardio machines into with no other changes to decor. It was one of the worst I have seen.

I have never stayed in a finer hotel in Chicago. As a comparison, my medical conference was held in a \"Five Star\" hotel, five minutes walking distance from the Sutton Place. I was in several of the rooms at this \"Five Star\" hotel as a guest of fellow physicians. I in fact have stayed in this \"Five Star\" hotel several times in the past, yet without question the Sutton Place Hotel was finer, in my opinion, in all respects. The Sutton Place Hotel's price was one quarter of this \"Five Star\" hotel. I was placed on the Penthouse Suite of the Sutton Place, I had a perfect view, my room was spotless. Both room service and the attached restaurant / bar were excellent. The hotel offers a business center in which guests are able to use the internet for free, which allows me to leave my laptop at home.

The hotel felt like home away from home. The bed was very comfortable and I soaked in the big jacuzzi tub every chance I got. I had the corner room which overlooked the Pancake House and had views of Oak Beach and the Lake. I am a late riser and staff were understanding, they did not to bother me to clean the room. Luckily they have day and night cleaners, sometimes I never left the room until late afternoon, those were my lazy days. The room felt like an apartment and the stereo with speakers was an added amenity. When I read a book I would put the stereo on for background music and with the sunlight gleaming into my room it was very relaxing. The only disturbance I experienced was the slamming of doors by the housekeeping staff. I would suggest they use door stops when constantly entering and exiting the rooms they are servicing. Apart from that and the Friday night happy hour at the Tavern on The Rush, the room was reasonably quiet. Being a solo traveler I found the area around the hotel very safe and I felt comfortable walking about at night. Since there are so many popular restaurants in the area, it can get very busy with traffic and people in the evenings which is great for people watching. The beach and Mag Mile is about 2 or 3 blocks away, a 10 minute walk at best which is very convenient for lakefront exercise or shopping. I enjoyed the double decker bus and trolley tours, which I did twice, after all you can't see the best of Chicago in one day! The Lakefront Bike and Roll tour and the evening Architectural Boat cruise were my favorites, both tours are so very interesting and informative. Most people I encountered were very friendly and helpful, I met a lot of nice people, cab drivers, sales staff in the shops on State Street, the tour guides and other solo travelers on the various tours. Although I did visit Chicato for 10 days, there is still so much I did not experience, therefore I shall return. A big thank you to the Chicago forum, their advice in the pre planning stage of this trip was priceless.

The best thing about this hotel and the only reason I would recommend it and come back is its location. It is in the heart of the Rush Street scene and a short walk from everyting else including the Magnificent Mile and the Art Institute. Everything is right outside the front door-numerous great restaurants, shopping i.e. Barneys New York and the shops of Oak Street. There is a small park across the street which on a nice day appears to be the center of activities in the neighborhood. But as for the hotel itself, I am sitting in my hotel room now looking around it is hard to tell the difference between this room and one in a Holiday Inn. The hotel does not have a pool and the lobby is very small. There is no outdoor patio or seating area as part of the hotel. So I cannot see what would qualify this hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facilities as 4 star. Maybe 3 stars plus but no more. Plus one factor which really disturbs me is having to pay an additional $9.99 a day for in room wifi after paying $200 night for a hotel room. If you too are bothered by paying this go to the park I mentioned or the huge Starbucks next to Barneys of New York for free wifi. So as I said I would recommend this hotel and stay here again only if I wanted to stay in this neighborhood and could get a good price on the room. But if I could get the Sofitel which is only 2 blocks away on Rush Street at the same price, I would prefer to go there for a true 4 star experience. As for a great eating experience you cannot go wrong with any of the outdoor restaurants across the street from the hotel. You will see that they are all packed (as in 1 hour 45 minute wait for seating) every night and for good reason.

The Sutton Place is located in a wonderful location on Rush Street which is right in the heart of elegant shops, clubs and great restaurants with (weather allowing) outdoor cafes with happy Chicagoans enjoying the infrequent sunshine. The outdoor cafes reminded me of Paris. Our room was, as in the past 3 stays, perfect! We had a city view but for a little more money you can have a lake Michigan view, we opted for the gorgeous city lights. Room size was just right and the bed and linens top quality luxury. The best are the fabulous bathrooms - large and perfect for two. What a pleasure to be able to soak in the large soaking tub while my husband showered at the same time. Sure is convenient when you are rushing to meet friends for dinner. The staff was friendly, the maid service was on time and very efficient. There is a bar and restaurant on the ground level, bar was jumping and so we stopped in every night before resting for our evening on the town. Right across the street is a pancake house with wonderful breakfasts (long lines on weekends) and a fun, lively bar and restaurant called \"The Lux Bar.\" The food was delicious and reasonable and we later found out that \"The Lux Bar\" is owned by \"Gibson's\" which is a high end, expensive steak house, so no wonder the food and drinks were so great! We liked it so much, we went back a second time and the manager bought us our drinks for appreciation - that was very nice. I loved Chicago, it rained most of the time but it did not spoil our trip because we stayed at The Sutton Place which is walking and cab distance to everything in the city!

The hotel is conveniently located near Rush street downtown and was easy to find. Upon arrival, I opted for the onsite parking ($42/day) with valet service. Check-in went smooth and the room was nice although 10 floors lower than the one promised on the phone. The backside view was mainly of two buildings under construction but we could see the spires from the Sears Tower in the background which was nice. The room itself was luxurious and spacious and the bathroom was very nice... until you try to take a shower. The water pressure on our floor was trickling at best but I am glad I was able to take a good shower upon arriving before hitting the town. The next morning, we used the included continental breakfast voucher for room service which arrived in a timely manner. After breakfast, we were going to finish watching our movie, take showers, check out of the hotel and hit the art museum. Just as we were finishing the movie, the cable went out.. every channel. We waited a while and my girlfriend just got in the shower. She mentioned that there was not enough water pressure to make the shower work so after fiddling with it, we got it to work by starting on cold, activating the shower head and then gradually working it back to warm until it hit that sweet spot of luke-warm/showerhead turn-off. Little did I know she was lucky to get a shower to start with. When it came to my turn, there was no hot water at all (no water running through hot spigots in the shower or sink) and yellow water from the cold making us gag just looking at it. The toilet then started running continuously and filling with yellow water. A call down to the front desk at least a half hour into all of this indicated that a transformer was out down the street. I asked if there was anything they could do and they stated that it was out of their control and that there was absolutely nothing that could be done. I would have at least appreciated a call with an update or a late checkout or something - nothing was offered except a quick hang-up. I am not a rude traveler and I usually let the little things slide but not having water for a shower is a pretty big deal for me in a hotel. I am pretty sure I have never had that problem in other, less luxurious hotels - I HAVE had better service at almost ANY other hotel. So, if you are staying in Chicago for anything important and do not want to be at the mercy of excuses and poor customer service for problems \"outside of the hotel's control\", try out the Four Points by Sheraton downtown.

Although it was very very cold in the windy city when we arrived (now I know where this nickname comes from), we were hearty welcomed by Shelby, the doorman. Right after he took care of our luggage, we were able to check in with one of the receptionists at the Sutton. After a quick check-in, we were able to head up to the room to unpack. After spending some time in the room and enjoying the beautiful view of the city and it didn't matter that we were on the 8th floor, we headed out to enjoy the Gold Coast. Exploring the nice neighbourhood at the beginning, we finally ended up having a very nice (and huge) steak across the street. We called it a night after a few hours at a club around the corner. Since the Sutton is just 2 short blocks away from Michigan Avenue, the Magnificent Mile, we almost spent the whole day with shopping. After getting back to the hotel and recovering, it was very cold outside, we came to the lobby to see the concierge. Unfortunately, the concierge was not present at that time, but Tristian,one of the receptionists, was able to get us reservations for dinner though. We chose to have italian at the IlMulino's which was outstanding. On Sunday, we asked for a late departure and there was no problem to get a later check-out. After getting all of our stuff together and doing the express check-out, we were able to head back to the sun, back to California.

We really like the Gold Coast neighborhood so that weighed heavily on our decision. We had also stayed one night at the Sutton Place four years ago so we knew the property. Unfortunately, IMHO, the Sutton Place property and service has slipped in the interim. We stayed 1/18-21 on the 14th floor. Upon arrival at 3pm Friday, which is check-in time, there were NO doormen or bellmen around - we had to carry our own bags in. This saved me some tip money but it was very cold and we would have appreciated the assistance. However, there were FOUR front desk staff with no one waiting - couldn't they have pitched in? We asked for a deposit box for our jewelry and cash and the one they gave us was very difficult to open - so much so that the staff who retrieved it for us in later days bemoaned the original placement and said they should have given us another box that worked properly. Our room was as small as I remember them from the previous visit, and the TV was a flat screen but a tube and not HD. The carpet and wallpaper in the room and the bathroom tile and wallpaper are showing wear and the shower drain was slow. Also, the hot water was an all-or-nothing proposition so you either were chilly or lobster-red. When I approached the front deak about moving they informed me the house was full and there was nothing they could do. I like to work out and used the \"fitness center' each morning. It had a nice view of the Rush/State \"Viagra Triangle\" but was only a passing effort at being a real fitness center. Two treadmills, two bikes, an elliptical trainer and some kind of all-in-one weight/cable apparatus were shoehorned into what on other floors is probably a guest room. I really don't like to have to ask Housekeeping for ice but in the Sutton Place that is what you have to do. We enjoyed our room service breakfast daily - no problems there at all. Delivery and gratuity were included in the $20 per person charge and it ended up being probably a 25% discount. There were no newspapers or coffee service in the lobby of this hotel. I have become accustomed to beign able to enjoy a cup of joe with a newspaper apres workout while my bride sleeps in. Not at the Sutton Place. No en suite coffee maker either. We didn't even try MEXX Kitchen - when you walked into the waiting area of the restaurant from the hotel the temperature dropped about 30 degrees - not comfortable at all. I thought maybe there were trying to save money on the heating bill. Also - no free internet, wireless or not, in this hotel. You have to pay $9.95 for 12 hours (not 24 hours as at all of the other hotels I've ever had to pay for internet service) and their \"business center\" is accessible only for a fee. Upon checkout we had to wait for a bellman who then delivered our bags and shopping finds to the lobby - not to our waiting car. I tipped him and asked him to take them to the car, but he told me \"the doorman will have to do that.\" Sorry, but I tip only one bellman from the room to my car...so I took the bags out myself because the \"doorman\" was nowhere to be found. In short, we got what we paid for, I guess, but this is a 2007 AAA four-star rated hotel. What gives?

As I planned my itinerary, I initially shot for an airport hotel to save money, then figured on renting a car. But when my Chicago area friend suggested that I ditch the car rental and book a downtown hotel to better experience the city, I decided to look both in the Loop and in the River North areas. Somehow, Sutton Place caught my fancy, and I booked there. This is an edited version of a review that I had originally submitted to Epinions.com, which I have since deleted. -Rates- For Memorial Day weekend, the rates ran around $185 per night for a standard king room; without the Memorial Day discount, the room rates would've been closer to $225 per night. I booked four nights through United Airlines' UnitedEscapes package, which included roundtrip airfare from Los Angeles, for the grand total of $1,090, including taxes and fees. (The same package would've cost $990 if I had booked a day earlier. Tough luck.) -Location and Arrival- Sutton Place is a small chain of boutique hotels, with only four locations. The Chicago location is the only location in the United States; the rest are in Canada. The hotel's location was fantastic. Standing on the corner of Bellevue and Rush, it was literally steps away from the nightlife of Rush and State Streets, and only a few blocks from the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Avenue) shopping district and John Hancock Tower. Getting to the rest of the city was not too difficult, with Michigan Avenue buses heading for Lincoln Park, the Loop, Museum Campus, and Grant Park, and with two Red Line subway stations (Chicago/State and Clark/Division) a 10-minute walk away. The exact address is 21 E. Bellevue Place, Chicago, IL 60611. I took a cab from O'Hare Airport to the hotel. It was an easy ride on the Kennedy Expressway (I-90), getting off on Division, turning left, then heading a short distance to State Street. -Arriving- I arrived at 2 in the morning thanks to weather delays on my flight. Nevertheless, UnitedEscapesme, and a clerk checked me in without delay. I was given two metal keys: one magnetic key for my room, and one key for the minibar. Access to my 11th floor room was through two high-speed elevators. -The Room- Upon entry, I found a huge bathroom to the left. It was decorated in white and black tiles, with a bathrobe prominently hanging next to the full-length mirror. There were more towels and toiletries than I could count. The toiletries even included a clothing mending kit. I had to look into a drawer to find a hairdryer, however. The shower and bath were separate, and both had great water pressure and comfort. Opposite the bathroom was a roomy closet, with an iron, an umbrella (for those Chicago thunderstorms), dry cleaning bags, and an extra pillow. Next to the bathroom was the minibar and a counter. With minibar being quite expensive as usual ($2.50 for a can of soda), and with a breakable plastic tab keeping the minibar closed, I decided not to bother with it. The room itself was very roomy. Although there were no pictures hanging on the walls, a few mirrors here and there made up for it. The drawer cabinet had a large flat-screen TV on top (with 40 or so local and cable channels, including WGN and the all-important Weather Channel), and a DVD player and a receiver in the middle. A few CDs were also provided, so that I could listen to music while relaxing in the room; in fact, sometimes the housekeeping left my room with the music on. Toward one corner was a work desk, with the hotel's guide to services and a sign indicating the availability of wireless Internet. Since I didn't have a computer with me (my laptop was dead at the time of this trip), I didn't bother. I do believe that Internet connectivity cost extra - a minus in my books. A modern, purple lounge chair was located next to the bed. The bed itself was very comfortable, covered with white and brown sheets. I had no problem sleeping here, despite all the excitement of being in Chicago. The bed was flanked by two lights and drawers, one housing the Gideons Bible, and the other displaying various Chicago travel guides and magazines. My room was near the northwest corner of the building, affording me a good view of the Rush Street nightlife and a sliver of Lake Michigan. Despite the raucous atmosphere on the streets, my room was very quiet. Housekeeping came by twice a day. The first came midday to clean up, then the second came late in the afternoon to deliver two bars of chocolate, the next day's weather forecast, and a breakfast room service order sheet. The bed sheets were also folded and rolled down to make it more inviting for me to get into bed. Nice touch. My room key got demagnetized after three nights. For my final night, I had to show my ID at the front desk and get the key re-programmed. I didn't like this - reminded me of some seedy hotels in Washington D.C. and Seattle. -Other Amenities- I did not spend time exploring the rest of this skinny, tall 1988 building (remodeled in 2003), but I noticed a few amenities. Room 509 was a fitness facility. I didn't bother, as I decided that all the heavy-duty walking through the Magnificent Mile and the Loop qualified as workout. The fourth floor had a business center, but it opened only on workdays between 7AM and 5PM. I stayed over a long weekend, and the business center stayed closed for the duration of my visit. This forced me to visit the Apple Store on the Magnificent Mile to get on the Internet. There was a restaurant/bar on the ground floor, which I did not visit. I decided to eat out with my friend at a bistro (Bistrot Zinc) just a block away, and eat my brunches in some of Chicago's fine museums. There were a number of meeting rooms in the lower floors, which I did not check out. There were plenty of attendants in the lobby on the ground floor, happy to open doors and assist guests and visitors at all times. -Leaving- I left at 4:30 in the morning. Although I had the ability to check out using my room TV, I decided to check out with a clerk the old-fashioned way. With no purchases from the minibar, returning the key was all that there was. -Frequent Guest Program- Sutton Place has its own frequent guest program, with enrollment available online at its website, suttonplace.com. -As I look back- The key glitch and the closed business center made my stay at Sutton Place less than perfect. But the luxury touches were definitely refreshing, including the two maid services per day, the free chocolate, the DVD player and music, and the comfortable bed. I absolutely loved the modern bathroom as well. All at a price that's above my usual budget, but still within reason. And to top it off, the location could not have been any better, with easy access to the rest of town. I will definitely book here again for my next visit to Chicago - and given that Chicago has so much to offer, and I could barely scratch the surface during my weekend, I'm definitely returning.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taos NM", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "NMTaosena", "ReviewID": "UR11710219", "Content": "I LOVED my stay here.

Three small caveats: Parking is expensive - about $42/day - but you have in & out privileges, and if you want to just leave your car the doormen will direct you to a garage a half a block away that's half the price. The restaurant in the hotel has wonderful Mexican food, but music (from the bar) that is awful and intrusive. I really don't like vintage Rolling Stones with my dinner.

I am kinda anal about where I sleep, so I wanted to read the reviews about this place. Boy was I surprised to read those review, so you know I was skeptic, but we decided to stay anyways. This place was nice, as we came in, front desk was very friendly, even gave us a welcome package & the prices were cheaper than most, so we stayed here. I was a bit discouraged because I expected a pool, but the pool is being renovated as I type. They are to have a new heated pool & a new pool deck in two weeks or so they said. To make it better they discounted our rate & offered me a 15% off my next visit, something like a loyalty discount I think they said. The room (213) they said it was bigger then most of the other rooms & it was pretty big. The room was kinda stuffy, but nice. The bathroom was quite uninviting maybe if they had whiter towels & a better paint job it would be better , the walls need re caulking, patching, & painting, the electrical outlet needed replacing, & the room in general could use a new face lift. The hotel really needs work. NOW HERE'S THE BEST PART: Our room was an oceanview room with a balcony. It was a really hot morning so we were sitting outside watching the sunrise must say it was so amazing! We even saw some dolphines can you believe it? The seanery alone is worth staying here, at breakfast they had bagels, muffins, danishes, pop tarts, oatmeal, fruit cups, & coffee, apple, & orange juice. I would of expected a bit more or different. As we checked out I over heard the staff talking about a new change they are planning to do to inprove the hotel. They spoke of possibly renovating the front desk lobby & each room one by one and also possibly offering turn down service & front door service so that the guest don't need to keep comming to the front desk & they feel a little more like home.

We found out about 2 weeks before our vacation and called to make sure they still had our reservation which they did but at a higher rate saying that's the rate Super 8 gave them when they transferred all the info. After talking to the manager the rate was fixed but our room was downgraded to no kitchen. At that point we were just happy to have a reservation because as we checked in there were people that had booked through priceline that did not have reservations anymore. We knew that the quality of the hotel/rooms left a lot to be desired based on previous reviews and being there for the race we knew we were overpaying ($180 a night). Pros: -Motel is oceanfront in the area of the beach where cars are not allowed so we were in a prime location. Nearby shopping, restaurants etc. -Free Continental breakfast included bagels, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee and muffins and was restocked frequently. Cons: -Motel is next door to a bar/club that hosts a live band on the beach that plays until 12am. The music was so loud that even with earplugs (for the race) we were still unable to sleep. At 12am the party moved indoors and we thought we would be able to sleep... NOPE then the dj started and it was just as loud Friday/Saturday until almost 2am. -Customer service from the front desk was non existent with the night crew The second day of our stay when we returned to the hotel at night our front door was open. We went to the front desk to let them know that perhaps the maid had not closed it all the way and his response was \"What do you want me to do?\"... so at that point we told him we'd rather not have housekeeping enter the room if they couldn't be trusted with closing the door. We also had an issue with the toilet clogging and called the front desk. They didn't have anyone available to come up to the room right away and we were heading out for dinner and since we didn't trust the staff to enter the room while we were out we asked if we could just borrow a plunger. Simple request... The front desk had to call the manager because he didn't know where a plunger was, then call again and ask if it was ok for us to use the plunger, then he wanted us to come to the front desk to pick up the plunger. Geez we are willing to do the maintenance man's job the least he could do was bring the plunger to us. -The pool was out of order. I understand that in Feb. perhaps the pool usually doesn't get much use but the weather 10 days ahead of our arrival had Daytona Beach at 85 degrees. Knowing you have a full house for a special event perhaps you could get one of the few amenities you have to offer working. It looked like it was being filled but our 4 days there it never filled.

It wasn't our idea, as our trip was planned around our son's tournament. I was very reluctant to stay at this property and finally decided to call the front desk. The woman was very pleasant and helpful, so I added that I needed to be on the first floor. Checkin was quick and easy. The women up front all seemed quite knowledgeable. I booked an oceanfront room w/ a full kitchen area and 2 double beds (the nonsmoking jacuzzi suite was booked already and is located on the 2nd floor). Our room cost an additional $20+ per night compared to a standard room, but the kitchen and ocean were worth it. We stayed in the bottom corner room (113, I believe). I had low expectations and had packed air fresheners, santizers, etc. I was surprised to find that I didn't really need any of it. The a/c worked really well, the room was far more spacious than others. We drove to Walmart and bought a twin sized cot for my son to use. There was room for 3 or 4 of those. The kitchen area looked adequate, but we never used it. The fridge was full sized and really old, but it kept our drinks cold and ice frozen. The bathroom was quite clean, althouogh it could use updating. I was paranoid and looked for bugs the entire time. The only encounter we had was w/ a fly that was briefly in our room and possibly some spider webs in the hallway, but I didn't actually see anything that bothered me. The absolute best part was through the back door--the ocean was fantastic. We had a concrete area where we could leave our boogie boards, folding chairs, and shoes, which was convenient. At night, I slept in the bed next to the door and would just smile b/c I could hear the waves crashing. We rarely heard any other guests b/c the room is somewhat isolated. Housekeeping came daily and took care of all the sand we tracked in (despite putting towels down). Our friends enjoyed the pool area quite a bit, but it wasn't large and the chairs go fast. With the ocean 200 ft away, it seemed silly to sit there anyway. My hubby delivered a bagel w/ cream cheese and drinks to me each morning, so I suppose the 'free' breakfast was adequate. There was a 'room service' menu in the room and the prices looked decent. I don't think it was made on premesis, but was delivered from elsewhere. Since we were able to walk to so many restaurants, I never used the option, but it was nice to see it was available. The parking lot was tight, but somehow it worked out fine. And it was free, which wasn't true of the other hotels/motels nearby. I would certainly return based on this experience. I'm sure our stay was more pleasant than what others encounter at different times or in different rooms. We were so happy with the staff and were greeted by everyone, even the maintainence guys. The staff really seemed to care about the property. Our final night in Daytona was booked down the road at the Hilton in a cabana suite. It was a major mistake. It was crowded and awful. We spent the whole time in lines waiting for a room or for the valet. What a waste of nearly $400!

This turned out to be a stroke of luck, because this place has an incredible location and is really a remarkable value. Things did not start well. Check-in could only be described as nightmarish. Their computers had gone down, and my reservation wasn't on the printed list they had. Thankfully I was able to pull up my confirmation and receipt on my phone and show it to the front desk staff, or I might still be waiting for my room. The woman at the front desk was very nice and apologetic for the inconvenience, but even after I showed her the aforementioned documentation on my phone she seemed to have no plan to get me into my room and made me wait while she checked in several other guests who arrived after me. Finally, after I had waited in the lobby for at least 45 minutes -- this is no exaggeration, and it may actually have been over an hour -- a man who worked there took down the information from my phone and got me checked in. I really felt sorry for them because I understand they were in a difficult position with a fully-booked hotel and my reservation not being on the list, but after the first half hour of waiting I admit I felt even sorrier for myself. That was, however, the only blemish on an otherwise great stay. First, this property has to have the best location of any Super 8 anywhere. It's right on the beach, and the view from our room -- and from our balcony overlooking said beach -- was amazing. If you want to enjoy a beach vacation in Daytona, there is really no reason to pay more, especially considering that if you stay in one of the more expensive high rise hotels on the beach it would actually take you a lot longer to walk from your room to the sand. The hotel is right next to what turned out to be my favorite bar/club in town, also right on the beach, and a variety of restaurants, bars, shops, etc. are within walking distance. Really can't say enough about the location -- just shockingly great. The room itself was basic but spacious enough, and very clean. There's a range, sink, counter space and a fridge if you're inclined to cook for yourself. We were not so inclined, but there was enough room on the counter to hold boxes of pizza and enough room in the fridge to hold plenty of beer. They also serve coffee in the lobby in the morning, and it was really quite good. A/C worked perfectly. Parking was free but tight because the place was packed with spring breakers -- kids these days need to learn to carpool -- but we got a space right down the stairs from our room, so that was also very convenient. We didn't use the pool, but the pool area looked clean and pleasant. This was spring break, after all, so the whole town had a bit of a loud party atmosphere, but we had no trouble sleeping. There were quite a few college kids at the hotel, but there were also families with kids, and it seemed like a perfect place for either demographic. And yes, it's a Super 8 and correspondingly no-frills, but I would even recommend it for a romantic getaway -- after all the only thing more romantic than a great location on the beach is saving money on a great location on the beach.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basingstoke, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing location, although in need of a spruce up\u201d", "Author": "Jessy4Paws", "ReviewID": "UR95959031", "Content": "The views from the beachfront rooms are just beautiful, could not be better.

I found the room to be clean and ready when I checked in. Some reviewers have complained about dirty rooms and roaches, but I found nothing of the sort while I was there. There was free high speed Internet in the room, the refrigerator was adequate and the bed was comfortable.

There were plenty of towels, a coffee maker and television. The free breakfast was good, nothing fancy but the food, juices and coffee were fresh and tasty. The ocean view from my room was spectacular. The sunrise was magnificent. There is free parking, the staff was okay and overall, not a bad experience for the money. You could pay more than double and stay at the Hilton up the street (I have during another trip) and pay exorbitant fees for parking ($19 a day) and for Internet ($9 per day). Both are free here. This place is certainly not the Hilton, but for what it cost, it is more than adequate. Don't come here expecting a plush beachfront resort. If you do, you will be disappointed.

After driving around for about 30 mins. I finally got a parking spot, (that was after I had to ask the taxi driver if he could move his vehicle so I could park) you see, they have a line of about 10 taxis sitting out in front of this dump, covering any available parking spots. Park the car, go to check in and the ofc. is locked, you have to check-in through a bullet proof window with a tiny little opening in the bottom. The man that checked us in was pleasant enough. There was 3 families, myself include that was checking in (we were together) Had to sign a check-in sheet that requires all the usual info, name address, tag # etc. I was told not to worry about it just sign and give a copy of DL. Finally done with that and of to our rms we all went. Opened my door and thats when the SMELL about knocked me over, damp, musky, moldy, mildew. I went back to the ofc. to see if they had any other rms available as I didn't think that it would be to healthy to be there, but they didn't so I asked for some air freshener, hoping that would do the job, they gave it to me without a problem. Back to the room I go, opened up the door, sprayed the room and sat outside for about an hour. I wasn't the only one with the same prob. people I was with had nasty smelly rooms also. Anyways, finally went back in, thought all would be well, but then it got worse......... Flushed the toilet and the gates of hell opened up !!! now i'm back at the ofc. again, this time they send a young guy over with a plunger to try and fix it, he tried for about an hour and couldn't get it to work. After repeated calls to the ofc. from the employee to try and get me some help, they finallly got it working. By this time it is almost midnight, we where for a cheerleading competion the following day, and that left us with 5 hours to get some sleep. Sleep didn't happen there....... Walls are paper thin, could hear tv's from both sides, people outside arguing etc. ofc. was of no help. Dealt with it til We checked-out at 6:30. I'm done, but the saga continues. My friend that I checked in with had an even bigger issue !!! they had her car towed because they did not see her parking placard, $165 later, she got her car back and to the amazement of all, there was her parking slip on the floor, it had fallen of the mirror. Did they do anything for her ??? that would be a big \"NO\" lets just say if they had done the job right in the first place they would have had her tag # etc. So to any and all that plan on going there \"BEWARE\" it will be your worse nightmare, Sorry to make this so long but had to let people know.

My last trip however was a total nightmare. I arrived and as usual my room was ready early and Paula (I think) the manager was the best as far as service is concerned but what I found when I went to my room disgusted me. First off, there was a rank, old, smell that refused to be ignored. The carpet showed visible stains, and was so dirty that I did not take my socks off. Then there was a black, coal like substance coming from the ac unit that blew all over the beds. Next, mold and mildew was all over the baseboards and walls, especially in the bathroom area. I checked the beds and there was hair on the sheets. I don't like to make trouble, and I was receiving a pretty decent rate for the room so I decided to try and tough it out for at least one night. Well, when I tried to use the ac unit, it spewed black particles and made a lot of noise. I had to sleep in my clothes on top of the bed because it just wasn't clean. I tried to relax by going down to the beach but everytime I tried to get back in, my key would not work. I must have changed keys 3 times. Finally, I was moved to a new room only to have the same thing happen again, and this room was even dirtier than the last. Management told me that the locks were old and that this is a common occurence. Ok, well, I switched on the tv and it turned itself off, I turned it on again, and it turned itself off. I could not believe my luck. I reported the problem and had another set within an hour. The last day, I accidentally left my key card in the room and informed the desk.

We wanted to be on right on the beach so I booked an oceanfront room with a full kitchen. Pros: 1. We had room 113. It was a very large room. Kids had a lot of room to run around and play when it rained for a bit in the afternoon. 2. Location, Location, LOCATION! It was right on the beach. I could sit on the patio and watch the kids play. There are also some shops and restaurants nearby. It had a beautiful view. 3. The tub, sink, microwave, oven, and fridge were very clean on the inside. 4. The security/night worker was very nice and helpful. 5. Loved the large picture windows in this room that overlooked the beach. Cons: 1. The lady who checked us in wasn't very friendly. She just handed me my room key, didn't tell me how to get to my room, where to park or anything. I didn't even know about the cont. breakfast until the morning we left. (I guess I am used to that good 'ole Southern Hospitality) 2. There was a strong smell of ammonia in the corridor leading to our room. 3. The room looked fairly clean but had kind of a funky smell. I bought from Glade Odor freshener to spray. That really helped. 4. The outside of the fridge and stove was rusted and nasty looking, but as I said before, the inside was very clean. 5. There were no cooking utensils or silverware in the kitchen. I called the front desk early the next morning to get some. I was told the housekeeping staff came in at 9 and they would send some. I ended up just buying some plastic forks and knives to eat with. I had to call again later in the evening to get some cooking utensils. The gentleman, who I am assuming worked night security, was kind enough to bring some cooking utensils, but there were not any forks, spoons, etc. The pots were small (I was making spaghetti for dinner) and there wasn't a cookie sheet to bake in the oven. 6. The parking lot is very small. It is hard to maneuver a van or large SUV. 7. The pool was very nice, but the section that was supposed to be 3ft was almost up to my neck. My 5yo couldn't swim in the pool. I don't know if it was just over filled, or what. Overall, for the price, we were very pleased. Great for the two nights we stayed. It allowed us to just veg on the beach after our busy week at Disney and allowed us to rest up before our long trip home to TN. Next time I would bring my own cookie sheet and cooking utensils, just to be sure. If you are expecting a 5 star hotel, then I would avoid this place.

But upon arrival, we were told that room was already given out and that there were no other available rooms on the second floor unless we wanted a smoking room. Which I can not do because it makes sleeping difficult for me....so instead we got the nasty room...the one with the stained carpet that was slightly damp...probably due to the a/c unit that didn't drain outside but rather inside the room. So yea, the room was musty and slightly funky in smell. We had to buy an air freshener to help counter the funky smell. Use Oust disinfectant if you ever get stuck with a room like ours it helped elevate the smell a bit....not all...but at least some. The clerk didn't seem interested whether we wanted to stay or not, he was too busy answering his cell phone to care one way or another. But since we were already there and the price was okay and we weren't really going to be in the room much it didn't really matter too much to my husband either. So I held my tongue and beared it. The cleaning lady was nice though but the breakfast lady was not. I tried getting breakfast but the lady locked the door 7-10 minutes before 9 am so people wouldn't come in and if you didn't go to the front desk (like me) to inquire about it it would stay locked....and that was the first 2 days we were there. On our last day there was a different girl who was in charge and SHE at least did NOT lock the door until 9 am. Overall, it was an okay stay since all we used it for was to have a place to sleep and it was right by the beach. The other cool thing about it was that it was right next to Ocean Deck.

The room we first got wouldn't open with the key. A staff member tried to open it and then we had to go back to the desk for another room. The 2nd room had 2 doubles so another trip back to the office was when we were informed that they do not redeem Trip Reward points for king beds. UGH! Very aggravating.

You could not ask for a better place to stay on the beach for the price. We have never had any problems with anyone there. The staff has always been polite and helpfull. We stayed there one year and had a problem with the air conditioner the manager moved us from a standard room to a ocean front room without any additional charge. You are not getting a big fancy room with gold trim and if that is what you want you need to look else where. If you want a nice clean room at a decent price then there is no other place on the beach that compares to this one for the money. The Ocean Deck is right next door and it is a small walk to the Board walk and the Pier. Parking on the weekend can be a little trouble but never had any bad problems. We are looking foward to our stay this year as we have the last three years. I will not even consider another hotel as long as this one stays the way it is.

It was obviously cleaner this time. I stayed there this time and now have a dedicated destination for this area. It was clean, staff was very friendly, they cater to good customers....fun-loving but not to the extreme where it interferes with the other customers, family-oriented, safe courteous atmosphere.

We used the room as a cheap close place to stay near the nightlife so we could walk everywhere. For the price and our purpose we couldn't beat it. We got a coupon out of the Florida Tourist Guide for 43.95 a night! We requested a smoking room and boy did we get it! The fridge (for which we were very thankful for!) had obviously been used as an ashtray on several occasions but the inside was clean and smelled of bleach. The room was nothing special and the pool was extreamly small. But then again we didn't really care about that stuff. The best part about the whole stay were the great places we went to that night! Two places you really must hang out at are the Ocean Deck wich is right next door to the Super 8 (very short stumble back to the room!) They feature live reggaaee music and beach volleyball! Very Happenin Place! Another place you must walk on down the beach to is the Mai Tai Bar. This place truely has the best happy hour and friendly staff! We spend 5 out of 7 nights down at the Mai Tai! You just can't beat it. It is rated the number 1 singles attraction in Daytona Beach. But just be careful. Too many mai tais can make for a very long walk back down the beach to the Super 8!", "Date": "February 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay, Wonderful Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4301477", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Super 8 to visit family over the holidays.

Our room was lovely and the staff was so accomodating. I have read all of these reviews and cannot see where they are coming from.

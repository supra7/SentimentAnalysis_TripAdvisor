We were from out of state visiting family in the area. First the good - Very comfortable beds. Some hotel beds are so hard you can't stay in one position for very long. These were wonderful beds, even \"heavenly\". Only problem was the woven blanket between the triple sheeting was a little stiff and scratchy. Softer blankets would be nice. Maybe they are very new and need to break in a little. Room was comfortable with nice furniture setup. Never felt cramped. Loved the free WIFI! Hotel grounds are immaculate! You could not find any chipped paint or beat up things anywhere. Very well maintained with beautiful landscaping. Excellent location to everything. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Price was excellent through Priceline. Try it!!! Not so good - Being close to freeway (good and bad) can be noisy. Get in the tower suite area. Much quieter. Also parking can be difficult. We came back every evening after 10 and had difficulty finding parking spots. Try to get top floor. Several nights we heard people running around till almost midnight above us. Also shower has one of those saver heads. It was also positioned so high on the wall, it was a trickle by the time it hit you. And we are tall. Several times we smelled cigarette smoke. Finally last time, my husband went outside and found a guy smoking on top floor balcony, flicking his butts off to right near our air conditioning. Nice little pile was building up. Wasn't hotel's fault but irksome, nevertheless. Made our room stink.

There are a couple downsides, first being that it is right off the 405 freeway which creates a continuous hum of traffic. It's not really that bad -- more like loud white noise that helped drown out the gaggle of giggling girls that checked in next door at about 11:00 p.m. one night without any inkling that -- yes, at that hour -- people would be trying to sleep. The sound of these neighbors came through the doors that could link our two rooms. The doors were so thin (or the sealing around the doors so poor) that it sounded like these giggling girls were in our room.

Here, management, having been called by me at midnight regarding excessively loud TV next door, comes at 12:30, knocks on the offending door, gets no response and starts walking away. I call him into my room to hear how audible the TV is in my room and his response is that it was not that bad. At 2:30 A.M. I finally got dressed and went to lie down on the couch by the front desk. A half hour later, now 3 A.M., he offers another room. Too little, too late. Now, not only is that whole night ruined, but my schedule will be off for days.

There was also free internet access in reception, a nice pool and spa area with towels provided. The fact that Denny's restaurant was next door was also a bonus. The staff were pleasant and eager to help in any way. They had printed sheets with directions to attractions and local restaurants which they handed out on request.

I left valubles out by accident but nothing was stolen. The onsite Denny's was a plus and we visited often. We had a problem with the vending machines but the front desk quickly and happily refunded our money. There was also a Target and a Ralphs within easy driving distance which came in handy. The Galleria was not far down the road and had an abundance of restraunts and a movie theater. The hotel is right off of the freeway and very accessible.

Great shops on Ventura Boulevard and the Sherman Oaks Galleria are nearby. This is really a motel, with exterior walkways, and no elevators to the second floor. Since I was traveling alone, I asked for a room on the first floor to save me from lugging my suitcase up the steps. I was first given a room in a remote corner of the property, off the main walkway in a dark secluded area. When I entered the room, it felt damp and smelled musty. I returned to the front desk, and explained to the clerk that I didn't feel safe in that room. He was very nice, and explained that they only had a second floor unit available, but it was right across from the office. Given the other option, I agreed to stay in the 2nd floor room. It was a much nicer room, smelled cleaned, well lit and I did feel safer to be close to the office. Service from the hotel staff was mixed. Before I booked the room, I called to confirm close proximity to the hospital. The clerk responded by telling me he had no idea if they were near the hospital and didn't offer to check for me. When I asked if he could take my reservation over the phone, he suggested it would be faster if I did it myself online. I probably would have then looked for another hotel, but I was making last minute plans and had no time for more research. The first clerk that checked me in was curt and didn't seem interested in my needs, but the clerk who assigned me the second room was very pleasant and seemed concerned that I felt safe. Although I didn't get a chance to use it, the outdoor pool looked nice and was busy but not crowded. The hotel is attached to a Dennys so breakfast is convenient. Room service is delivered by Dennys as well although the selection was very limited. The room was clean the the bed was very comfortable. Wireless Internet worked well but cost extra.

Coffee and tea are available 24/7 and there were always cookies available in the afternoons. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was immaculate. The bathroom was on the small side with the lowest sink I have ever seen in any hotel. The sink height was just over my knees. All of the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. A big thank you to Fred (at the front desk) who goes above and beyond and helped us with directions and recommendations on the highlights to see in the area. You will definitely need a car to stay at this location. There were many restaurants that were only a 5 minute drive away. The hotel is right by the 405 and the drive to the Santa Monica Pier and Venice beach were an easy 10 minute trip. The hotel offers free valet parking which turned out to be a big plus as everywhere you went it was $10-$20 to park.

In other words, you do not have to drive through LA traffic to get to these places, this also includes Six Flags Magic Mountains. The rooms were clean, nice size on the beds etc. We never testet the swimming pool, but it looked okay. The training room is very little, with only a cycling machine, a running machine, and a strength machine. We were three people there at the same time, and it got very crowded. Never testet the breakfast, since it looked like the typical american breakfast with croissants etc, which does not fit europeans idea of a breakfast. The staff could smile a little bit more!

We got an excellent rate through an online site for a suite with two queen beds, separate sitting room and small balcony. The bathroom was quite small, but had been recently renovated and was very clean. There is only a large shower, no tub....which was no problem for us shower-takers, but might be a problem for families with young children or those who prefer leisurely baths. Beds were incredibly comfortable. I believe the hotel recently upgraded all their rooms with pillow-top mattresses. Plenty of pillows with various levels of firmness. The included continental breakfast was more than adequate, with cereals, hot pastries, bagels, toast, English muffins (and all the usual toppings), hard-boiled eggs (already shelled), juices, coffee and tea....also fresh fruits. The desk staff was very helpful, always willing to answer questions and provide maps and directions. The location is very good for those visiting the popular attractions in Santa Monica/Venice Beach, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and Hollywood. Sepulveda Blvd. crosses most of the main east/west thorougfares, so you can get to lots of these attractions without having to hassle with the freeways if you don't want to. The only kind of tricky part is the parking. Parking in their underground lot is free, but difficult to access if you are driving anything larger than a mid-sized sedan. We rented a Hyundai Elantra.....which was about as big as I would have been able to manage the steep curved entry. There is parking allowed on the street for those in larger vehicles, though. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a decent place at a decent price. While not fancy, it was more than adequate for all of our needs.

There are two parking lots, one is above ground and has about eight spots. It's a dead end lot so while getting in can be doable, getting out is a mess, as you have to manuever the other cars as well as the uncomfortably close walls of the hotel. Once you leave, you have to go out on to a busy street and your view will be blocked on both sides by the lucky guests who were able to find street parking. If you have to park in the underground lot, you have to manuever through other cars, poles, garbage, the ceiling (!), as well as the unsafely steep one way ramp that leads down to the parking structure. If you are entering when someone else is trying to exit, you'll either have to reverse up a narrow hill with walls on both sides or hope the other person will reverse downhill into parked cars. It's going to be an accident either way so just hope for the best. Once you get into the hotel, assuming you even make it that far, you'll probably have to try a few times before you get a clean room (i've stayed here twice and was shown to a dirty room both times).

It was a combo a/c-heater and only blew cold air, even after running for 10 min. Because we got back to the room late, we threw the quilted bedspread back on the bed and slept OK.

Okay, just got back from a 3-night stay at this motel. Let me first say that it is very convenient to many things, and is just a few blocks off of I-10. Not in the best neighborhood in the world, but still, relatively convenient. The front desk staff was nice when we checked in, and explained everything, as well as the free continental breakfast and where to park, and the best places to get to your room. Let me move right on to parking........as others have mentioned, it is HORRIBLE. We were driving a minivan, and were basically excluded from parking underground because they said our van wouldn't fit. There is a small amount of parking in front of the hotel, which is very tight. However, there's also a small parking area to the south of the hotel...a little bigger, but also very hard to manuever with a van. Parking is limited, so you'd better be back by about 7 pm! Otherwise, you'll have to spend a night parking on the street like we did. So...taking our keys, and having parked our car, we walk up to our room...a \"suite\". TINY! We had two queen beds in the sleeping room, and an additional room tacked on with a tv, couch, refridgerater, and microwave. The additional room couldn't have been more than 10ftx10ft. Although, we found we needed it so we'd have room for a suitcase or two as there isn't much room in the sleeping room for anything other than the beds, desk, and tv. One of the smallest rooms I've honestly seen. The air conditioning placement is HORRIBLE......right under the window, next to one bed. It's impossible to have the room cool without turning it on high at the coldest setting. It doesn't shut on or off by itself, so you have to leave it on high all night.......which means that the unlucky person (me) sleeping in the bed next to it gets an icy wind blown on them all night. The bathroom........................THE-SMALLEST-BATHROOM-IN-THE-UNIVERSE! And horribly constructed. First of all, the sink is short enough to comfortably accomodate a midget. There is enough counter space to maybe, just maybe store a tube of toothpaste on it. Oh, and I LOVE how the faucet is on the side of the sink....right next to an electrical outlet that has the hairdryer plugged into it. The shower is rediculous! Not only is it tiny, with ever changing water temperatures.......it also has a bizarre step in one corner that prevents anything but your head being hit by the water. Why they have this step area is beyond me. It prevents you from using that corner of the shower, which is needed. So, ladies, trying to shave your legs with the foam of your soap is impossible because a stream of water from the shower hitting your head drains down and rinses the soap off as soon as you lather it on....not to mention, you must fight with the shower curtain sticking to you the entire time. The lighting in the bathroom is horrible....there's a heat lamp that makes it intollerable when on after a shower because of the heat and humidity. The only other light is a florescent light, which makes you look horrible even with the best makeup job. The towel racks are placed right over the toilet, which is really dumb. We even had an incident where a washcloth fell into the toilet. Needless to say, we didn't realize this until a member of our party used the toilet and it tried to overflow when she flushed (luckily she thought to turn off the water...I can't imagine the mess if she hadn't done this). So, we called for maintenance. Apparently, there was \"nobody on property to help us........but we have a plunger you can use\". So, to make the long story short, WE got the toilet fixed and WE fished out the toilet water washcloth and threw it away. What a horrible place to put towel racks. The absolute only counter space is also located directly above the toilet. Needless to say, we kept the toilet seat down out of fear that a personal item would fall into the great beyond. Hmmm.........let's see....a good thing...quite a nice sized balcony. It looks out over the road, and the traffic didn't bother us. Housekeeping always seemed very good. We never really ran into any staff, but the room was always cleaned very nicely. The hotel does have a continental breakfast daily 7am-10am. They have cheerios, corn flakes, bagels, toast, coffee, juice, fruit, and tea. There's a computer in the lobby which I didn't use. There's a bunch of brochures in the lobby which is very helpful. The hotel does have a pool and jacuzzi, which both are pretty small, especially the pool. Neither looked appetizing at all to me. So................the wrap-up.........................we won't be back. The hotel is just too frustrating. There's more negatives than benefits. I just didn't like it, and couldn't wait to leave. Yes, it's cheap, but you could find much better hotels for the exact same price.

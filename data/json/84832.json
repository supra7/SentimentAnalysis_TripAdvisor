I was chaperoning a group of Girl Scouts so I did not pick this place myself. I was very pleased with the accomodations. I was in a one-bedroom suite with some other moms, which included one bathroom, a \"living room\" with a foldout couch and a small kitchenette. The room was clean, spacious and well-appointed. Most of the kids in our group were in the two-bedroom, two bath suites. A big plus is the breakfast buffet, which is included in the price. While this is not the lavish buffet you would find on a cruise ship, it was good. There were scrambled eggs, sausage and biscuits, pancakes, fruit, oatmeal, and a number of pastries, cereals and breads. I believe you could also make your own Belgian waffles. It was more than enough to sustain you until you got to the parks. There is a nice pool area with a bar, which we really did not have time to take advantage of. The hotel also has a nice small gift shop with decent prices. I never took the shuttle, though some of the older kids in our group did. They said it was on time and was a big bus. One group caught the last bus home at night and they did say it was kind of hard to find since they had not taken it to the park. that is the only glitch. It's about 4 miles to drive to the nearest park but it is a fast drive.

Normally we head out to explore but on our first night we were done for the day and figured we'd keep it \"light\" so ordered in - cautiously. We were pleasantly surprised, great taste and delivered hot to our door and added to our hotel tab. We did not take advantage of the shuttle service since we wanted to be on our own schedule but vowed to try it at least once, next time. We have not had good experiences with park shuttles at other locations since there are always far too many stops etc. The breakfast was awesome, the staff was really nice and the rooms are huge - the hotel is basically an Embassy Suites without the roof (and the price tag) which is far better in my opinion for those using the pool! NOTE - It is a family hotel - so for the couples that want peace and quite without little ones running around on the pool deck, go somewhere else, especially if you cannot tolerate that kind of environment.

I am a business traveler and stay in hotels throughout the world (12-20 days/month) and I am very qualified to give an honest review of this property. The property itself is VERY dated inside and out and appears to have been built in the early 70's. Now, it all depends on what your expectations are. We paid $169.00/night and I'm here to tell you that there are other properties that may be a little more expensive but are a quantum leap ahead in quality. For instance, Floridays Resort was $30.00 more per night but was recently built and has the same two bedroom suite layout. Check out their website (we moved to there after two nights at the Royale Parc). Anyway, it seems like the location of the property in relation to attractions is good. But, the immediate surroundings at the property are run-down. I would NOT let my kids walk outside the hotel at night and I'm not over protective. The pool is basic, a 2 out of 5. The roooms are large but as I said earlier - VERY dated. Knobs missing from AC units, toilets that need flapper valves and run constantly (I had to stick my hand in the tank to seat the valve and stop the water). The shower heads have calcium build-up and were 30% blocked. And the internet absolutely sucks! I know, who wants to \"surf\" when you should be vacationing? How about trying to find restaurants or book tickets to shows or check airline info and have the signal fail!! The internet worked 40% of the time! FInally, I learned that photos of rooms and buildings can be photo-shopped just like people can! The vibrant colors of the pool, shrubbery, flowers, even the room were enhanced.

You need to read this!\u201d", "Author": "Joel B", "ReviewID": "UR125953747", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that overall I would equate this to the luxury of a Motel 6. Be extremely wary of what you see posted on their website. Look at some of the pictures submitted by visitors instead, because they actually reflect the truth. For example, the beautiful picture they have of the hotel entrance on their website is nice and all, but they completely left out the giant Gift Shop building that masks the entrance. I am guessing they took that picture from the roof of the Gift Shop. Shuttle System: Another example is when they say that they are located only 1 mile from Disneyworld, which would have most first time visitors thinking that they could walk to the park like I did. In reality it\u2019s about a 10 minute shuttle ride to Epcot, the only place where the shuttle takes and picks you up from. You have to ride Disney transportation to get everywhere else which adds about another 30 minutes of travel time to get to your final destination. Pay attention to this because you have to leave the park an hour early to get back to Epcot in time to catch the return shuttle. The shuttle service is absolutely horrible. They only \"shuttle\" at specific times during the morning and then at night. For instance, the drop off is at 0745, 0930, 1115 and so on and then the only pickups are at 6:00p.m., 8:45p.m. and 10:00p.m. Almost every time we took the shuttle it was standing room only because the shuttle services four other hotels in addition to Royal Parc. So remember that when you take the late shuttle home and you are already tired from the day and you realize that Royal Parc is the last stop of five and the shuttle ride home is going to take you 45 minutes. They say the shuttle is an 80 passenger bus...I counted 16 seats on the biggest one we took, but I guess you could probably squeeze the rest in the back where the strollers go. Customer Service: When we first arrived, check in was uneventful and we made our way to our room without any issues. First impression was that they pictures did the resort WAY too much justice. When my mother in law booked the hotel she requested one of the renovated suites. She was told that it would be no problem and was noted in their system. When we got to our room and realized that the room looked like it had seen one too many spring breaks, my wife went to the desk and asked why we weren\u2019t given a renovated room. Their response was \"we already put you on a poolside bottom floor so deal with it.\" Wow, great first impression guys! Our very first attempt at taking the shuttle pretty much summed it up for us the kind of customer service you can expect from both the Hotel and the shuttle service Platinum they contract out to. We were on the curb 15 minutes prior to the pickup time and waited until about 20 minutes after the scheduled time without seeing any shuttle. My wife went in to ask where the shuttle was and the manager, Ricky, said that the shuttle had already come and left. When my wife told him that we have been out there the whole time, Ricky said \"the shuttle company told me they came and they have a GPS, the GPS doesn\u2019t lie.\" She tried to argue with him that we were out there the whole time and nothing came, but he stuck to his story. My wife came out and told me this and that Ricky had more or less called her and her mother a liar which made me absolutely livid. When I went in and confronted Ricky, one of the desk clerks mentioned that they have sidewalk cameras that would have recorded the shuttle. I asked to see the video to prove that we were right and Ricky said no problem, but again pointed out to me that the video and GPS does not lie, so we were wrong. Ricky disappeared behind the counter for about 10 minutes. When he came out he apologized to me and my wife and said that he called the company again and they did in fact NOT make the stop as contracted. I was not that mad about the shuttle, but having my wife and I called liars was unacceptable. Ricky did arrange for the shuttle to come and make a special pick up for us...gee, thanks Ricky, that sure made up for the crap we got from you. If you plan on bringing small children here who need their sleep at night I would also reconsider. What they don\u2019t advertise on their site is that every night by the pool, which every room faces, is an open bar. This bar really enjoys blasting music as loud as the speakers will allow. That in conjunction with the paper thin exterior wall means you get to hear it until they finally turn it off for the night...which is about 2 or 3 in the morning (no joke). When we asked about it we were told that we could ask the bar tender to turn it down if we wanted. Again, what the crap, really? Breakfast: I love how their website advertises a great \"hot\" continental breakfast. Here is what it consists of...Soggy and sometimes stale pancakes, stale biscuits and watery gravy, eggs (I think that\u2019s what they were), fruit loops, cheerios, raisin bran, bread, pastries and coffee. Basically, take what they say with a grain of salt, because they would be much better off just putting out doughnuts. Overall, the breakfast is very lacking. What brings it down for me is the absolute terrible service, cleanliness, and lack of family friendly environment.

Overall, the hotel gave us the space we needed for a big family without having to book 2 rooms. If we had less people traveling with us, we would probably have stayed somewhere else.The web site makes this hotel seem much nicer than it really is. The rooms were clean and tidy, although I don't think the carpet was that clean. The hotel is tucked back behind a gift shop, surrounded by other hotels and very close to a small amusement park, although the web site makes it appear that the hotel stands alone. If you are staying on the east side, you could have lights in your window all night. (they do have privacy blinds and the windows are mostly sound proof.) This area of Kissimmee is VERY busy! Breakfast was filling, but not great; scrambled eggs, small pancakes, danishes, small, dry biscuits, gravy, toast, dry cereal, oatmeal packets, juice, coffee, milk, and canned fruit cocktail. Fresh fruit of some kind would have been so nice! The \"gourmet coffee bar\" (as stated on the web site) in the lobby is nothing more than 2 carafes of coffee and packets of sugar and half-n-half. MY TIP: Get breakfast at the breakfast buffet and carry it up to your room. We used their disposable plates at the breakfast bar to serve our breakfast and covered it with another plate to keep it warm and took it to our room where we ate it at our clean table. With a family of 6, I took one of our kids to help me and we loaded everyone's breakfast on a tray to take to our room. (They do not have trays, so purchase or bring your own.) Even a reusable grocery bag would work. The pool was nice and my kids loved it. We were at Disney World during the happy hour most of the time, but when we were at the hotel, the happy hour was great! Bar tenders were very friendly. The shuttle offers very limited departure and pick up times for the parks, usually once a day for each park. We had a rental car, so we paid for parking at the amusement parks. The staff was easy to work with. We left 2 days early to go to the coast and stay there. There was no cancellation fee or early leaving fees. I called before our trip to make sure that was the case.

Two bedrooms and two bathrooms was essential as we all wanted our own space. After doing some research, we decided that the Quality Suites would work best for us, based on their website, TripAdvisor reviews, and free breakfast.

I wouldn't say it's false advertising--but the photos have been touched up a bit.The room that we got was nice enough, almost like a small apartment with a living room, 2 baths, 2 bedrooms, fridge, microwave, blender, and stove top. The rooms are a bit worn, but they were clean, which is most important to us. We requested a couple extra blankets and pillows, which were brought up to us no problem. The beds are comfortable, and we all slept well--also a huge bonus. The pool area is very nice. In fact, we spent the majority of our time hanging out in the sun and in the pool or hot tub. The pool towels frequently went unfilled, but that's semi understandable since it was constantly busy. There are quite a few lawn chairs and small tables to relax and enjoy the great weather. Tip: If you want a chair, you need to get to the pool area by about 10am, they go quickly when the weather is nice out! Breakfast was fine. It's served cafeteria style. The options are the same each day--scrambled eggs, mini pancakes, rolls, biscuits and gravy, milk, juice, coffee, toast, cereal, and fruit cocktail. It was okay, but it would have been nice to see some real fruit and maybe some sausage or bacon. I realize these items cost a bit more, but would add a lot more value to the stay. Tip: The 7/11 gas station behind the hotel has bananas for .50 a piece, and other fruit and healthier snack options for low cost. As others have mentioned, the staff working breakfast is less than friendly, and seem unconcerned about the messy sitting area. There's a great outdoor patio that was nice to sit at, though those tables were also missed after breakfast turnover. The food was decent enough and is still a great cost savings for those looking to get the most for their dollar. The poolside bar was great also. The drinks were good, but a bit pricey. However, the free happy hour definitely made up for that! From 6-7pm, they have free wine and beer. The bartenders were friendly and you definitely can't beat a couple free beers! :) That alone was a huge bonus. The majority of the staff--housekeeping, front desk, engineers were friendly and greeted us in the hallway. We did not utilize the concierge service while here for tickets or shuttle services, so I can't comment on that. Overall, the stay was nice, and great for families or a group of friends traveling.

The next bad news was that our room had been flooded by the burst pipe. Origionally we had booked a two bedroom suite for our kids and ourselves. They did try to make things right by giving us two single bedroom rooms right next to each other, but running back and forth from one room to another was awkward at best, if not down right inconvienent. The next problem we discovered was that there are no curtains that can be closed in the rooms. There were shears, but they did nothing to block out light, and little to obscure the veiw from outside the room. Since we were on the ground floor the lights from the cars at the gas station across the way kept flashing through the bedroom all night. In the morning when we showered we couldn't help but think that since you could clearly see the people through the shears as they walked to breakfast, they could probably see you as you stepped out of the ( somewhat small) bathroom nude to make it back to your bedroom (who's shears did little to obscure the veiw of the people going to their cars behind the room). If your proclivities run towards exhibitionism this might be a plus, but for us it was a definite drawback. The hot breakfast was also dissapointing. The eggs had a unique rubberized quality I have never seen associated with food before. The corned beef hash was obviously dumped from a can and then partially heated through. The french toast was served frozen, with the expectation that you would make it to one of the two toasters to unthaw it and make it edible. I will say that the rooms were large, the beds reasonably comfortable, and overall things were clean. The negatives however far outwieghed the positives. When you add into this the per day \"resort\" charge they have the audacity to add, this becomes a losing proposition. In short, do not stay here.

There are fun small scale rides, to-carts, number cars and a couple of daring others such as the slingshot and the sky coaster. I recommend the sky coaster! Looks scary but it's a thrill!

This hotel offers a lot for a very reasonable cost. The front desk staff was very helpful and pleasant. There is a gift shop in the hotel lobby. A Publix grocery store and a Walgreens is across the street and is walkable. Several restaurants and the Old Town area of amusement rides are also nearby and walkable .It's a great location near Disney and transportation to the parks is available from the hotel..

Twenty minutes later, following room instructions in the room, we called the front desk asking for the wireless password to be told tersely, \"You'll have to come down to the lobby.\" When I protested, she told me to be polite! Otherwise, the 3 night stay was adequate. The room was clean, attractive; the handicapped access shower was fine. The bed reasonably comfortable. The towels were threadbare at best and scarce. It wasn't that anything was bad (beyond the clerk's attitude). More, this very large place just felt worn-out, in need of a refurbishment. The chill on the stay took place at check-out. Again, no \"How was your stay.\" No, \"Thanks for staying with us.\" The check-out clerk was cordial but seemed baffled when we wanted to split the bill into two nights on one credit card, one night on another. When he messed it up, all he could say was that he could fix it, but it would take some time. His slow and inept execution of this simple request, led us to just leave. Again, no \"Have a safe trip,\" or \"Come again.\" The breakfast was ok, but the space woefully inadequate for the volume of people. When accosted to give my email to offer feedback, I eagerly agreed. You can guess what I'll say. In fairness, the other staff we encountered were courteous and helpful.

The unit comfortably accommodated our party of 4 adults and 5 children ranging in age from 3 to 16 who were somewhat weary from our 7 days at WDW and being cramped together in the small ALL-Star Sports Resort rooms for a week. WE NEEDED SPACE and more TV's. This was terrific and the price for our October 1 stay was truly a bargain. We stretched out, took a dip in the pool, watched three different TV channels at once and had a marvelous breakfast the next morning.

At check in I was slightly irritated when we checked in as the front desk attendant told us no 2 bedroom suites were available yet, which was not a problem, so we asked to store our luggage until our room became available so we could enjoy the pool and get something to eat. They do not store luggage..we actually saw a family sitting at the pool with all their luggage around them. They may want to consider adding that as an option. That was still not our problem..what happened next was. Another family checking in right behind us in a 2 bedroom suite checked right in. I was not very happy that one front desk agent had rooms available yet ours didn't..so I went up and asked why they had a room available and we didn't....she immediately gave us a room. I still can not figure that one out. Our only other bad experience was check out, we had a plane to catch and just wanted to turn our keys in. The front desk told us we could not just turn in our keys we had to officially check out, which meant getting in a line that went to the door. After waiting in line 20 minutes(our transfer service to the airport was very upset), we said something again and finally set our keys on the counter and walked out. We had no desire to miss our flight for poor customer service. That was the worst of our issues, which again was just inconvenient...some small annoyances were the transfers. It is true what other readers have said about the times being terrible. We woke up extra early for the seaworld shuttle, only to arrive at the park an hour before opening. We literally had to sit on the concrete outside of the turnstiles and wait for an hour. That seemed silly, we decided to pay for a shuttle for the ride back as the hotel shuttle came 4 hours before the park closed that day. That was the only shuttle we used, we had transfers to Universal and Downtown Disney. As for breakfast, we actually enjoyed it. It is exactly what you would expect for a complimentary breakfast and it is a BIG money saver. If you are expecting gourmet dining you should really consider what you are paying to stay here, you get a nice hot and cold breakfast buffet for the price, it can get quite full though so plan accordingly. OK, the room, we found it to be fantastic for the price. It is spacious, our room was clean upon entering and cleaned daily. The bedding is nice and our room looked exactly like the photos. If you are so picky that you don't like that there may be some scratches on your external door..well then maybe you should again consider staying at a 4 star and pay those prices. Of course there will be some wear to any resort you stay at, they can not refurbish them every 6 months. Our room was perfect though, honestly for the price it was far superior to what we were expecting. The pool was clean and our oldest son loved hanging in the hottub during the evenings. Wifi, is just as everyone says, spotty at best. They do have a business center that you can pay to use. It was fine for printing my sons boarding pass as he left our vacation early. Honestly, If you come expecting a concierge level resort, well of course you will be disappointed, if you come here expecting a resort based on what you are paying for it, well then I suspect you will be pleasantly surprised by this place. It is a fantastic value...and if it is any indication as to our real overall experience, we just booked a week here this upcoming March and will be bringing our sons girlfriend this trip!", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cBedbugs Bedbugs Bedbugs!!

I stayed here in August 2009 and stayed here again in August 2011. I picked this hotel because I wanted to save money on breakfast and transportation. Transportation: I went on this vacation with my brother and both of us don't drive so I liked that they provided transportation. However there transportation isn't that great, especially for Universal and Seaworld. They picked us up from the hotel at 7:40 in the morning to take us to Universal and Seaworld, by the time we got there the park wasn't even open yet. You can assume how annoying this was because we had to wake up at like 6 to get ready and make this shuttle. Who wants to wake up at 6 in the morning on vacation. This also forced us to be at the park for like 12 hours. This is because they didn't pick us up to go back to the hotel until 7:40 PM.By the time we get back to the hotel it 8 so we can never make it to happy hour. I brought a ticket to go to Universal and Island of Adventure in the same day. My brother and I were so tired of rides by 3o clock and we didn't want to go on any rides at Island of Adventure. We end up going on a few rides at Island of Adventure and then walking around until it was time for the shuttle to pick us up. This isn't the same situation for Disney, I am not sure why but for Disney they have more times for pick up and drop off. When we went to Disney we were able to sleep later because the shuttle bus came later. At the end of the week we got tired of waiting for the shuttle so we figured out how to take the public bus back to the hotel. For example, you can take the 56 from Disney to go back to the hotel. In addition, you can take the 50 from Seaworld to go to Disney and take the 56 from Disney back to the hotel. However the bus only runs every 30 minutes. Breakfast: As some people have mentioned, they serve the same thing almost everyday, it always eggs (scrambled, hard boiled) with some kind of meat (sausage, bacon) and bread/pancakes/eggo waffles and some kind of pastry. The breakfast isn't bad just you will eat similar foods all the time. Hotel: The hotel room is really spacious. For two people I thought there was a lot of space. There is also two flat screen TVs, so you don't have to share the tv. One is in the living room and one is in the bed room. The hotel is close to a 7eleven, a supermarket and a gift shop. The first day we went to the supermarket to buy food to make dinner. However the pots they provide for us is really small so it was hard to cook. At the end of the week, we order room service and the chicken wings we ordered wasn't bad. Housekeeping was pretty good, they did a good job on cleaning the room. They even put the dishes in the dishwasher for us, however the dishwasher is horrible. The only thing that was really clean after it came out of the dishwasher was the cups. The pots, plates, forks and spoons still had little pieces of food stuck on them and I always had to clean them again before using it again. The internet sucks! I brought my laptop so that I can do some research on the theme park and other materials, however the internet kept cutting off. I would be on a website and the internet would cut off. I had to connect and reconnect like ten times. It was so annoying and at the end I just gave up. The hotel is a little loud and there is always people at the pool and they can be really loud. I don't mind the noise so much cause once you turn on the TV you cant really hear the noise. In addition, the staff is really nice and always there to help. I think this is a plus because they have wonderful customer service which I like. Overall, as I said before you get what you pay for. I would stay at this hotel again but I would find another way for transportation.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mission Hills", "Title": "\u201cNot A Pleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "Kat4luv14", "ReviewID": "UR117553686", "Content": "My family and I had stayed here on Aug 18 and checked out on the 20th.

I had booked online through Quality's website. I discovered the price had dropped a few days later and called the hotel. They promptly adjusted my reservation to meet the currently published price. The room was very spacious (we liked the table and extra seating away from the bedroom) and housekeeping was great! We rarely saw them even though there were a few days that we enjoyed the pool and didn't leave the hotel until noon or 1. My only complaint here is that it looked like the bathroom floor hadn't been mopped for awhile. Other than that, the room was clean in all areas (very important to me). There were always plenty of towels. I was even surprised to find pool towels available in the evening (most hotels we've stayed at are out by early evening and you have to go hunting for some at the desk). The pool area is quite nice although we would have liked it if there had been an 18 and over swim maybe for the last hour from 10 to 11. While I love children (we have 2 although they're older), there were at least 2 nights we would have liked to swim but there were so many kids screaming (yes, screaming) and jumping in without regard to other guests that we (our son included) decided to skip pool time. I know this isn't the hotel's responsibility necessarily but wanted to warn others with older children or none at all. Breakfast was good (eggs, sausage or corned beef hash, danish or muffins, cereal, juices, oatmeal, toast, waffles...hot items alternated each day) but you have to time it right to avoid long lines. People were generally patient though and the staff was always very friendly and kept the food trays full. We weren't able to hear guests on either side of our room but the windows aren't very insulated in that we easily heard commotion in the parking lot and whenever kids went running and hollering past our room.

The hotel is next door to a 7-11, so we could very conveniently get drinks and fuel. There is a Publix grocery store very nearby (short drive, even shorter walk), so we got food there and ate dinner in our room, which helped our budget. Having a kitchen in our room helped make the stay more comfortable. The buffet breakfast was fine. The hotel gym looked very nice, and was hardly used. There are loads of restaurants very nearby so there is an abundant choice when eating out. Hotel parking was plentiful and there were even spaces in the shade (necessary for parking in the Florida summer). Criticisms: The hotel is older and is clearly worn in several places, which was not what I expected from the website. The walls are very thin and we could hear everything happening in the rooms around us and corridor outside our room. Although the hotel's website states they offer shuttles to the popular amusement parks (which was one of the reasons I chose this hotel), the schedule was limited and not practical (for example, one trip to Universal in the early morning and one returning in the evening; we had a child with us and we could not have withstood the heat for 12 hours) so we ended up driving ourselves to all the parks we visited (tip: if you stay at this hotel, budget for amusement park parking when planning the trip). The wireless network worked within the common areas of the hotel but only in the living room of our suite, so we were unable to use wifi in our bedrooms (which is not ideal when someone is sleeping in the living room). The hotel gift shop was very over priced, so we made the most of the nearby 7-11 for refreshments and the nearby giftshops for souvenirs. To anyone from outside the USA, where everyone is accustomed to carrying photo ID, please bring an official form of photo identification with you to this hotel.

When I asked if there was no one else working there, he told me that he guessed they must all be on break and that he was the only one employed there who did any work. The first night, perched on the sidewalk outside my room, three unattended teenage girls played three diffferent music devices. At 1:00 a.m., I finally had to get out of bed and step outside and ask them to move away from our window. They had been there for at least two hours, as they were there when we arrived at 11:00 pm. The second night we were locked out of the building, and when I approached the front desk, I again encountered a long line and one employee. When I explained that we were locked out, he told me to get in line. The only other person working was someone in the kitchen, who did eventually help us. On our last day there, my children wanted to swim. Although the hotel boasts that it is non-smoking, they do not enforce the rules, and the pool area was filled with smokers. As I could not get timely help from staff, I asked the smokers to move to the designated smoking area away from the children. I was received quite rudely, and the situation escalated when one of the smokers instructed her children to throw water on me. Two boys wetted my shoes and my camera. I asked that the hotel get security because our interactions were getting physical, but my request went unanswered. As my children and I attempted to leave the pool area, one of the smoking patrons yelled, \"Just get on outta here, you fat, ugly bi***!\" in front of about 50 people, still puffing on her cigarette. Again, I went to the front desk and asked for help. I truly wondered if I was going to end up in jail if the situatiion became physical and I attempted to defend myself and my family. My children and I walked across the street to a souvenir shop, and when we returned, one of the women from the pool was on the sidewalk outside of our room, smoking a cigarette. Again, I asked for help from the front desk, and again, I had to manage the situation myself. Truthfully, it was very difficult to refrain from a physical altercation. I didn't want to get arrested during my vacation. While I understand that some of the problems I experienced were the behaviors of the patrons, I also believe that the staff hanled the situation unprofessionally and unsafely. When situations escalate to people throwing water on you and your belongings (my camera is ok, thank God), people yelling and screaming profanity at you, and people waiting for you outside your room, hotel staff need to put a stop to it, even if it means calling the sheriff's office. Not only did the staff not help me, but they mocked me when I asked for help. I have since tried to reconcile the situation, but the only thing I've been able to accomplish is the customer relations specialist offering me two free nights at the same hotel (to which I said, \"No, thanks.\"). In my entire life, and I've been alive for 43 years, I've never had a more grueling hotel experience, and I've never seen such lax customer service people. I get better service at Motel 6. Let the fact that I turned down two free days speak for itself, and anyone who doesn't want to vacation with unattended teenagers playing loud music at 1:00 am and spend pool time in a cloud of smoke, beware! I regretted this decision from the first day I got there, and a week later, I'm still wishing I could do it over and choose a different hotel. It was supposed to have been my vacation! On a positive note, the breakfast was delicious and the beds and comforters quite soft!", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cDon't Believe the Negative Reviews\u201d", "Author": "RNtravler", "ReviewID": "UR115777473", "Content": "I can honestly say after reading some of the negative reviews on here, I almost changed my mind and canceled my reservation.

My family and I had the pleasure of spending the night here after a long day at Disney World on July 22nd. We arrived to the Hotel at 8pm and were relaxing in our very clean and spacious room by 8:15pm. The Check in process was quick and the employees were friendly. We stayed in the two bedroom suites with 4 double beds. The beds were comfortable and the linens crisp and white, each bedroom had its own bathroom which were also found to be clean and roomy. My only complaint was the lack of available towels, but it only took one call to the front desk and 10 minutes later we were brought a stack of warm white towels and wash cloths. There was some noise to be heard from the swimming pool at night, but we did not find it overly disruptive or loud in our room while watching TV. This noise was not heard at all from our bedrooms. The air conditioning system works great and was a welcome relief after spending all day walking in the 100 degree heat. The morning breakfast buffet was a good variety of food and replenished frequently. I can see how they may be a lack of seating if you are eating early to leave for the parks, but we arrived downstairs around 8:50 and found seating for a family of 6 without difficulty, nor did we stand in a very long line for food.

But the hotel was a little bit run down even though it recently had a face-lift. The main thing you need to know about this hotel is that it is quite large and is priced to accommodate large families or groups on a budget. And that it does. The day we arrived there was some sort of baseball thing going on and there were rooms filled with unchaperoned teenagers. We had to call the front desk about the ones next door who were making a big noise after 10. The front desk apparently called the coaches and the noise was stopped. The other noise factor is that the hotel rooms all face inward towards the pool area which is filled with rambunctious kids until well after 10. The pool area is fairly small and definitely not for adults who want a leisurely swim and a quiet drink by the pool. So if you have a big family that is there for the theme parks and are on a budget this might be an OK place. If you want peace and quiet and a more upscale experience, this is not for you. We were in Orlando to visit the Disney parks (5 adults) and I chose this hotel because of proximity to the parks. The website talks about a free shuttle to the parks, but there is an Orlando guide in the hotel lobby who immediately talked us out of the shuttle. This was because the shuttle only GOES to the parks in the morning and only RETURNS from the parks in the evening. He advised us to drive to Disney and park our car. Then we could return to our car and leave and come back if we needed a break (the Disney parking pass - $14 - lasts all day). Otherwise we would be stranded at Disney unless we wanted to take a cab. Our experience there was OK. We got a reasonable room and the beds were comfortable. The rooms were somewhat old but nothing objectionable. The free breakfast was not very good at all. The breakfast area was quite dark and very institutional feeling. The food was lowest common denominator canned stuff. They have a free beer and wine happy hour.

Our first impression was of the glass elevator (overlooking the pool area) that took us up to our 3rd floor room. It was a nice touch, although the air freshener made it smell like a department store restroom :). The room was suite was smaller than expected, but still plenty of room. One ironic issue was the lack of abundant hot water. An other review stated to be careful because of the scolding hot water. Well, neither bathroom got real hot at all. The repair man, who came right up after being called, stated that the hotel was only operated on 1 boiler due to the other breaking down. He managed to get the hot water in the main bathroom pretty hot, but not the other. While he was there, we reported that the TV in the guest bedroom was broken, and he immediately replaced it with another TV, which also was broken in a different way. I gave up on the issue because I really hadn't expected a TV in that bedroom, & we didn't watch it much any way (still had TVs in the living room & master bedroom). THe shuttle schedule had the shuttles not arriving at Disney until close to 10am and returning some days well before closing, which is unacceptable for our troops. Thus, we ended up not even utilizing the shuttle once. This was one major reason we chose this hotel, so that was a let down. The breakfasts were good. The meats alternated between corned beef hash, bacon, & sausage (mostly sausage) on the days we were there. That variety was a pleasant surprise, actually. Also alternated between pancakes & waffles. Always had plenty of scrampled eggs, but PROMPTLY shut down at 10am (fair enough, they always got SLAMMED!) It was better than most free hotel breakfasts I've been to. The happy hour was nice! That bartender was on the ball with whatever drinks we needed when we needed them. It was never overcorwded. The Wi-Fi was not accedible from most parts of our room. If I put the laptop right by the window by the door, I picked up a mediocre signal. I think it's meant for the pool area anyway. The busness center had 2 nice computers, which were busy. Some in my party ordered pizza & it was quite good. I'd order it again even if I didn't stay at this hotel :). If those pesky repair issues hadn't been there, & the they expanded the shuttle schedule to match Disney's schedule, I would have given this hotel a 10 out of 10 for everything. Overall, it was excellent for what we paid through the travel site that rhymes with cookit. Oh yeah, don't forget that \"resort fee\" when considering any hotel in this area. One reason we liked this hotel is because it was cheapest of all we had seen. P.S. Who CARES about the the hotel being right behind the 7-11?!?

I rarely give negative reviews but feel obligated in this case. This hotel was one of the worst we have visited. To be fair, I should disclose that we usually stay at 3 or 4 star hotels, so I am comparing Royal Parc Suites to hotels that typicaly cost $100 - $150 per night. We paid about $100 per night to stay at Royal Parc Suites - that is, we intended to. Instead we checked-out ASAP after night number one. In brief, Royal Parc Suites is a poor imitation of Embassy Suites (Hilton Hotel chain). I will list the most troublesome problems with this hotel: (1) dirty with in-room carpets filthy and discolored with repeated staining from who-knows-what, (2) unkempt and dilapidated walls with stains, scuffs, erosions nearly everywhere, especially in the rooms, (3) poorly maintained with malfunctioning mechanical and electronic devices, including the deadbolt on our exterior door, (4) bedding was so flimsy/over-used that my lower back ached in the morning from sleeping in a crevice, (4) narrow walkways and small common areas that make for bumping into other guests persistently, (5) no interior hallways (suite doors open to the outdoors), (6) located next to an obnoxious, purple-colored \"souvenir shop\" with bright parking lot lights, (7) no room service. Many other all-suite hotels in the Orlando area, including the Embassy, are the same price - stay at one of these instead. This place reminds me of one of the building facades at Universal Studies - where the appearance from a distance looks genuine and well-kept, but get a little closer and the truth is revealed. What was \"not-so-bad?\" The staff were generally not rude - to be sure, they weren't helpful, but at least they were not rude either.

This May, we again returned to our favorite hotel after a three year absence. The chaperones who had been on previous trips immediately noticed how the rooms had deteriorated since our last visit. It's time for a \"face-lfit\" once again. Chipped paint and an overall sense of lacking TLC seemed to pervade this hotel that has seen better days. However, the staff continues to be overwhelmingly helpful and friendly, and the breakfast buffet still offers a large selection of foods. Cafe hours have also been extended. Our group stayed for four nights. During this time, we did not experience consistent room cleaning, and my particular room experienced plumbing difficulties. In the past, we have given this hotel our heartiest thumbs-up, but I will be checking back personally to see if the quality of the rooms and overall cleanliness improves before I automatically sign a contract next spring.

Finally on our final night, Angel (an assistant manager, I believe) said the hotel was not \"accepting responsibility\" but that we would receive a resort fee credit for that day \"to make amends.\" I asked if the lock was ever interrogated and was told it was but never whether or not someone had actually entered the room.

Secondly, the complementary morning buffet service, although not particularly special--scrambled eggs, flat sausages, danishes, muffins, hot and cold cereals, toast, etc--was warm and filling. And lastly, being just a 2-minute walk from Walgreens to get supplies was convenient as well. Oh, and as an afterthought, you may want to try their Pesky Pizza. For $11.99 a pie, they weren't that bad. The Bad: - The Quality Inn offers a lot of complimentary services. The only thing is, they are not always what they appear. Their so-called High Speed Wireless Internet service, for instance, was terrible. The signal was not only weak, but kept cutting out. Their complimentary beer, wine and soft drink service that is offered nightly is from 6-7pm only. And, their free shuttle service to the Walt Disney World Theme parks, only runs after the parks open, and will only take you to EPCOT. The fact that they claim to be 1 hour from the Walt Disney World Resort means nothing. On a map, it may be a mile, but you can't get their by foot. It's more like 4 miles by car. The Ugly: - The one thing that upset me the most was the fact that I was told that their Disney park shuttle services left at 7:40am. This was a blatant lie. They will take you to Universal and Sea World at that time, but not to Disney. They in fact, will not leave until 9:30 at the earliest. On the way, of course, they will stop at two or three different hotels to pick up other passengers. The good thing is their shuttle service starts at Royale Parc, so you can be assured of getting a seat. The bad thing is you'll feel like you're riding in a giant sardine can for 30 minutes. By the time you get to EPCOT it will be close to 10:15. And, by the time you find a Disney bus to take you to another park, it could be as late as 11. Believe me, if you want to have a good time at Disney, getting to any of their theme parks before they open--preferably between 8:15-8:30--is a must. The fact that Royale Parc can not get you there by that time, but prefers to mislead you into thinking you will, would irk most pat To add injury to insult, their taxi service is highly unreliable. If you plan on going to the parks early by taxi, I would recommend that you think better of using Platinum. They will be very late or not show at all. It happened to me 3 times and I've witnessed it happen to many others. County Taxi Service will take you to the parks for $18, but like any service you have to negotiate and confirm the price before getting into the taxi. --- On the whole, Royale Parc Suites Hotel wasn't as bad as I made it out to be. They just need to make several relatively simple changes to increase their overall quality: 1) Offer free shuttle service that will get you to EPCOT by 8am; 2) Put their shuttle service schedule, complete with times and destinations, on their website so as not to mislead their patrons; 3) Find a taxi service that is not only reliable, but offers flat rates to the parks and airports; 4) Upgrade their WiFi Internet service; and 5) Let patrons know that the complimentary beer, wine, and soft drink service at night only runs from 6-7 pm.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shawnee Mission, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cMixed experience, but favorable overall.\u201d", "Author": "vince66226", "ReviewID": "UR101127935", "Content": "We stayed on the day before checking into Disney and the night after checking out of Disney.

The free breakfast was OK for free but you wouldn't want to pay for it. Depending on which park in Disneyworld you want to go it's not all that close and the free shuttle only goes to Epcot so you then have to wait around and catch a free disney shuttle to the other parks.

We also were joined by 2 other families who I know share similar thoughts as we do. Our room size was great, towels and beds were changed every day and the 3 sinks were wiped out. However in those 10 days our tub, bathroom floor or carpets were not vaccumed at all nor were the tables countertops or furniture wiped of dust or food spots. Our room was one of the newly renovated rooms but in those few years that they have been renovated, the walls were marked with splashes of food and stains already. In the bedroom that did not have the onsuite, there was a terrible urine smell that was embedded in the front corner of the room after 2 signs and telling the supervisor, they did come and clean that spot with a water vaccuum. But the smell was still there. In regards to the ammenities. The wii-fi, pool area was great. Never saw a free newspaper unless we were suppose to pick that up in the lobby. Room safe was never used by us, but we still have to pay the $2/day for their insurance purposes. The happy hour are very inconveniently timed from 6-7pm. as the first free shuttle returning from Disney world is at 7:15pm, so you would never be back for that unless you took a taxi (which was about $20). Another disappointment were the shuttle times that they offered. The first shuttle of the day was at 9:25 a.m. The next shuttle that came wasn't until 10:45. The shuttle took you to Epcot under 10 minutes, however if you were planning to go to the other theme parks, you would need to take a boat, monorail or another bus to get there from Epcot. there were times where we didn't even get to our destination until 10:30-11:00. So we did take a taxi a couple of mornings to get the fast passes for Soaring and Toy Mania (as those were usually gone by 11am) But with younger kids, it was so nice those mornings to get there early when the park opened. There were 3 return shuttles: 7:15, 8:45 and 10pm. By day 5, we envied those people whose hotel shuttles took you straight back to your hotel or straight to Animal Kingdom, Hollywood studios, etc. Breakfast were OK but very boring. The 3 cold cereals they had were generic. The butter for the toast was whipped spread, only jellies for toast. The same danishes, scrambled eggs and sausages every day. Oranges and apples were readily available. But with small kids: they only seemed to enjoy the toast, eggs on a few mornings and apples. They were longing for waffles or pancakes, yogurt and kid friendly cereal. So we did end up buying cereals and ate those is our room, we also cooked in our room one morning and made pancakes. Kitchen utentils were minimal like a pot, a pan, dishes, cups, plates and a corkscrew. No extras like a flipper. We borrowed from our friends' room which had a flipper. Room supplies were inconsistent: some days we would get dishwasher detergent, coffee packs, shampoos, replenished and then other days we would have to go to the desk to get dish washer soap or borrow from our friends's rooms again. So in the long run, we should have gone for a more expensive hotel as we ended up paying the same as a higher star hotel: for taxisand breakfast foods. As well as the feeling that your room was dirty and smelled did not make our stay as pleasant as it could have been.

We could pick from eggs, cold or hot cereal, sausage, danish, cinnamon swirls (to die for!!!). toast, fresh fruit, two kinds of juice, milk and very tasty coffee. The rooms were very clean.

There were 4 adults and 4 children (these suites hold up to 10 people) We had a late check in and it was bad. After a long day at the parks, all you want to do is get to your room as quickly as possible so you can rest, but once you check in, they make you go to another desk in order to get your parking permit and a property map. The reason? Simply because on this second desk there is a salesperson (no associated with the hotel) trying to sell you park tickets and timeshare sales presentations before giving you your parking permit. Sometimes there was another line for this desk made up of people waiting for their permits and others inquiring about the tickets. Luckily the hotel manager was the one who did the check in and I told him I wasn\u2019t too happy about having to go to another place and get in line so someone would try to sell me something I wasn\u2019t interested in. He agreed to give me the parking permit right there and pulled out a permit right in front of me, so obviously the other desk was just a scheme to hear a sales pitch. When we got to the room, my cousin who came with us called me over to show me one of the bathrooms. The shower was full of hairs and there were also some hairs on the floor. A clear sign that whoever cleaned the room did a terrible job. It was late, so we decided not to say anything and get ready for bed. During preparation to go to bed, we realized there weren\u2019t enough pillows or bed sheets. We picked two rooms with two beds on each room and a sleeping sofa. We were short of two pillows and 1 bed sheet. I immediately called front desk and I was told there had ran out of both, pillows and bed sheets. According to them, the hotel was full and they didn\u2019t have any more of those items. Honestly this is the first time I\u2019ve been in a hotel where they had run out of pillows and bed sheets. To be fair to them, I mentioned this issue the following morning during checkout and they took $20 off my bill.

At first I thought it was the hotel and then I realized that it was everywhere. Even in the Disney parks. I suppose we're just used to our water at home. The problem was easily solved by using bottled water! Everything else about the vacation was perfectly fine. I agree that it isn't a 5 star hotel with room service etc, etc. but for the price you pay, it is definately more than we expected. We were booked to stay 8 nights and on the 6th day our 14 month old son got extremely ill. We waited the day hoping he'd improve but he didn't so we decided to check out and begin the 24 hour drive home. I went to the front desk at 11:30 PM and explained that we were leaving and why. They refunded me the extra 2 nights!! I didn't even ask them to, I was totally shocked. We are in the process of planning our next vacation (May 2011) and will definately stay here again! I must add though that I don't understand why so many people are giving such bad reviews?? I don't get it. Even the breakfast was fine. It wasn't gourmet and it was pretty much the same breakfast daily but seriously?? It's free!! We did do a disney character breakfast one day and it cost us (group of 7) $260.00! One other day we went to IHOP and it cost us $54.00!

People were partying in the pool right outside our room until 4:00am....the pool is suppose to close at 11pm but NO ONE reinforces quite time. Plumbing was also a problem. Toilets won't flush and after calling, they came out but never resolved the problem. So we struggled to flush the toilets for two weeks (but mostly used restrooms out of our hotel.) I just have to warn you that this is not a good place for children due to partying guests encouraged by the management, poor cleaning and terrible buffet. By the way, buffet breakfast is a steal accross the street at the Sizzling Grill...it only costs 3.99 per person and they have TONS of selection and good food.

Please DO NOT go on any time share presentations for the offer of cheap tickets! Yes you save about $50 dollars on your tickets (\u00a330) but it wastes a whole morning/afternnon of your vacation. The sales people lick your butt all the time they think you might buy a time share and when you say no, they become bullying you and then get a real negative attitude. It is very stressful. The time shares are also not what they seem. We went to mystic dunes and orange lake resort country club. Unless you want a stressful experince and 10 years debt, plus rising maintenance fees (which they will deny) and to have to visit the same place every year, please take my advice and don't go! They time share destinations do look lovely, but you can stay there anyway without signing a contract!!! Now for the hotel. Me and my husband have stayed here twice. Sept 2009 & 2010. It is not as good as it was last year and would'nt stay there again. It's ok and it's comfortable. It's got all you need. The bed's are very comfortable. The kitchen only has an electric hob and microwave. No kettle! Last year we had a toaster, but not this year. The coffee machine in the reception used to also be there all day/night, now it's only in the mornings.The bathrooms are tiny but ok. Really cheap loo roll though!!! We had two problems on this stay, our door would'nt lock and the carpet door bar was broken and sharp, which my husband cut his foot on. We conplained about this and they did sort both issues out immediately, but no one actually said sorry. It's not a fantastic hotel but it's not a bad hotel either. I'd give it 6/10.

The windows looked as though they had never been cleaned. I assured my daughter that it would look better in the daylight. However, once inside the lobby, it looked worse. We noticed the furniture was very outdated and busting at the seams, quite rickety. The man behind the desk was cheerful enough. He gave us our room key and we proceeded upstairs. The elevator carpet looked like it belonged in a garage. It was heavily soiled and had rips and tears everywhere. As we reluctantly entered our room, our spirits became more and more deflated. What should have been an exciting time, became the beginning of a nightmare. The beds were thrown together and appeared quite untidy. The carpets were frayed everywhere throughout the room and its overall appearance was very dirty. We didn't touch a thing and quickly stepped back outside and glanced down at the pool. My grown daughter said \"mom even the pool chairs are slashed.\" Need I say more. When I returned to the lobby the receptionist was on the phone with a hotel guest, reassuring her that if there were bed bugs in her room, she must have brought them there. We immediately requested a refund, and was granted one. However, we were left out on the street, frantically searching for a place to say at midnight. Although, I might add, we were relieved to be out. We spent an additional $1,000 for 6 nights at a hotel that delivered what every family deserves, an enjoyable vacation. In fact, they proudly showed us their facilities prior to check in and then gave us warm cookies and a clean place to lay our heads for the week.

The fridge was missing a leg. Because of this, It was unstable and our drinks fell out and broke on the floor. Left a note for the maid but the fridge never got fixed.

In front of the hotel is a large discount gift store that sells everything they have at the Disney parks for 1/3rd of the cost. Purchase your souveniers there.

In this trip, we stayed in 7 different hotels in FL (from Residence Inn to Westin) and I have to say that this hotel is by far the worst one out of all of them. Let me talk about the pluses first: 1. The staff - all of the staff we had interactions with was helpful and very nice. They genuinely wanted to make sure that you had a great stay. 2. The hot breakfast - it's free and plenty. They serve basically the same stuff every day, but it's pretty good. Make sure you get there by 8 am to avoid long lines. 3. The free drinks - I don't drink, but this can be a big plus for drinkers out there. 4. Location - close to many restaurants and stores (like Walgreens and 7-11) and only about 12 minute drive to Magic Kingdom. Now about the bad: 1. Filthy - one of the bathrooms we had was simply filthy. We didn't even dare to look under the sink. I'd like to think that we're a pretty hardy travelers, but this place made all of us want to wear our flip-flops at all time. And yeah, the bathroom fan wasn't working either. 2. Wi-fi is bad - it was very frustrating to get any connections at all from the room. I called the front desk and asked how many routers they had and he replied \"two\". Yikes! I'm an IT professional; adding routers shouldn't cost that much. I had to go to the hallway to get any connection (a whopping 1 Mbps). In order to get a more reliable connection, you'll need to be either in the lobby or near the pool. Even that, sometimes my connection didn't respond too well. 3. Laundry facilities - the laundry machine doesn't clean too good and the dryer doesn't dry - not good. 4. Dishwasher - the one time we used a dishwasher, it leaked water (about a cupful, not too much), but still not a good sign. 5. Poor bedding - the beds are too hard to my liking and the sofa bed is horribly thin - not recommended for adults unless they are less than 100 lbs. We booked this hotel thinking that we had a good deal, but after staying there, I don't know I could say that anymore. Right now, I'm staying at a Hyatt near airport for 60% less than what we paid at Royale Parc; granted the location is far from Disney and they only offer continental breakfast, not hot breakfast. But the rooms are night-and-day; it's much cleaner and modernized here at Hyatt. I truly believe that Choice hotel is trying to improve this hotel, but to me is not nearly enough. The staff was great in making sure you have a good stay and that's a big plus.

The hotel was going through renovations when we were last there, and it appears they have done some extensive upgrades - flat screen TV's in most rooms and the cool top stove tops, and the refrigerator worked well -- even the freezer froze our bottled water quite wonderfully! Anyhow, we stayed in a 10 person, 2 bedroom suite with a kitchenette - had all we needed except for an oven, but we were out most evenings and didn't cook! The breakfast was a vast improvement from the last time we were here 4 years ago - there were scrambled eggs every day as well as either bacon or sausage every other day! We did have to ask for extra pillows, towels, and washcloths that first night, but they were brought to us quickly with no delay. Also, a broken faucet in the kitchen was fixed that next day. The pool was just as lovely as I remembered it. Every morning, I would see a guy cleaning the pool and the surrounding area, and the water was clean - not dirty as some other reviewer wrote!

Room was held until 6pm. Got stuck in rush hour traffic in Orlando. Called hotel at 5:50pm to tell them we were on on way, and would be about 10 minutes late. We were told that it did not matter, our reservation would be cancelled at 6pm if we were not there unless it was held with a credit card. Against my inner feelings, I provided the hotel with my debit card number to hold the room an extra 10 minutes. Upon arrival we found that the \"resort\" pictured on the internet was nothing like what we found. The hotel is nestled between other sleezy motels and run down commercial buildings right adjacent to Old Town. We decided to give the hotel a chance since the room was now guaranteed. We waited over twenty minutes to check in because two people were ahead of us. We checked in and got a room on the third floor. They advertise poolside rooms for an extra charge. Well guess what! All rooms are pool side. The pool looked disgusting. We went to one of only two elevators that serve the hotel. We waited 8 minutes and the elevator still had not arrived. We then decided to utilize the stairs, all twelve of us to include 8 kids under 12. We toted all of our luggage and coolers up three flights of stairs. When we arrived at our \"suite\", we found it to b very dated and dark. We unpacked and decided to go out for dinner and then to old town. We went to place some valuables in the safe (which the \"resort\" charges $2.50 a night to use) and found that it was locked shut. We had to call and wait 15 minutes for maintenance to arrive to unlock the safe. That posed a question: How safe is the safe if some maintenance guy can unlock it in 30 seconds with an electrical device? We then went out for the night, returning about 10:30pm. We started getting all of the kids bathed. We found that there were 4 towels with 12 occupants in the room. There was no soap and no washclothes. The hotel had placed hand towels in the bathrooms to be used as washclothes. We called the front desk for more towels, washclothes and soap. Ten minutes later, a not so pleasant houseman arrived with 4 towels. He left. We then called the front desk and again requested washclothes and soap. The same houseman arrived about 10 minutes later with two bars of soap and 4 washclothes (again we had 12 people). We decided to make do. We then found that one of the towels the houseman brought us was soiled. It had something on it that appeared to be either dried blood or motor oil. Still trying to make the best of our stay, we put that towel to the side and was going to share the remaining 7 towels. We then found what appeared to be pubic hair in the bath tub in the \"master suite\". After cleaning someone else's hair from the tub, the kids got their showers. We then started turning the beds down so we could get the kids to bed. We found food crumbs on the sheets of one of the beds. Food crumbs? Yes food crumbs! The sheets were dirty! We also pulled out the couch bed and found old M&M candies on the bed. A pipe in the bathroom also was leaking under the sink, puddling water all over the floor. We called the front desk, and asked to have a manager meet us at the room. We learned that with a \"resort\" that size, there was no manager on duty. We informed the front desk staff that we were checking out. It was 11:30pm. We packed all of our luggage and gather 8 very tired kids. We checked out, and I insured that no charges would be made on my debit card. I was provided a receipt that stated I had no charges. I was told the hold placed on my card for $290.00 would be released at the close of the day. It is now three days later and the hold is still on my account. We have been trying to work with the bank and the hotel to release the hold because it is holding money on my account. I have just learned that the hotel debited $290.00 from my account WITHOUT my authorization!

They did have a room ready and we were allowed to check in at 2:30 p.m. We had a two bedroom/two bathroom suite on third floor. Our suite was AWESOME! It was extremely clean and, we felt, very roomy! One bedroom had a king bed and the other had two double beds. All beds were very comfortable. The did have smaller pillows on them, but we each just used two instead of one. Both bedrooms were away from the poolside, so when we went to bed, the pool noise didn't bother us at all. The bathrooms were smaller, but they were fine for us. Our two teenagers shared one bathroom and my husband and I shared the other. We got along just fine and I didn't hear any fighting about space from my teenagers! ;) The breakfast was exactly what they tell you it is: scrambled eggs, boiled eggs (we did think these tasted funny - not sure why, but we just didn't eat them after that!), sausage or bacon (varied by day), small cinnamon rolls, danishes, waffles, seveal dry cereals, fruit choices, oatmeal, english muffins, toast, yogurt, juices, and coffee (the coffee in the lobby is better!). We stayed 8 nights, and while it would be nice to have things switched up a little more, there is enough there to change your breakfast choices each morning. We found it to be just fine and it filled us up - - note that one of our children is a 15 year old boy! We had great service during our stay. We found everyone on staff to be very friendly, accomodating, polite, and efficient. Our first morning there we had no hot water. When I called down we found out that a boiler had gone out. Those things happen and we survived the cold showers. By afternoon I still found the water to be lukewarm at best. When I called down again, they sent a maintainence right up to the room. He was very nice and joked around about spending his day getting us hot water! He explained how they had had to replace things and promised I would have hot water the next morning, which was all I was worried about. He was very nice, patient, and had a sense of humor about his crazy day! I also had to get extra towels, etc. during our stay and they were brought up promptly and with a smile. The pool area was quite busy while we were there, but I guess we expect that when it is hot outside, and when a large number of people are traveling with children. Our kids got into the pool a couple of times, but the crowds did discourage them. I think if you time it right, you could get in with fewer people, but we were going pretty hard at parks so that was difficult for us. The elevators have been mentioned - - they were warm while we were there and they do have an odor to them. I guess we didn't stress too much about it - - they are outdoor elevators and used by lots of people in a high humidity location. What do you expect?? They appeared to be cleaned each morning and there was a note in the elevator explaining that the hotel realized the air situation in the elevator and was working on fixing the problem.

I read many reviews that said this was a great place to stay. Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed. First of all, the hotel rooms are not very clean. They are MUCH smaller than they look in the pictures. Our first night there, I had to cal the front desk for hand towels and face rags. The second day, there was not ANY toilet paper in our rooms. The next 4 nights, I had to call the front desk for bath towels....as there were NONE in our room. One night, after the front desk not even answering the phone, I had to walk down from the 4th floor (because there were times that the elevator would take more than 10 minutes to arrive) and ask the front desk to hand me towels. As I am sure most can understand, after 10 hours of walking around Disney parks and finally getting back to the hotel, everyone is very ready to take a shower and relax. The bed sheets were not changed the entire week we were there, they just made the beds. We had planned on taking the shuttle from the hotel to the parks, but ended up having to just drive and park ourselves because the shuttle does not come and go very often at all...and it only goes to Epcot. With such a large family, I planned on washing clothes at least once while we were there. After a very long and exhausting day and after having to track down and wait for towels for our room, I ventured out with a large garbage bag full of dirty clothes. The laundry room is on the 2nd floor. Half of the washing machines were not working and the washers and dryers only take \"tokens\" instead of quarters. Of course, the token machine next to the washing machines was out of order, so I had to walk downstairs to the game room by the pool to get tokens. 8 tokens per cycle ($2.00) so I got enough tokens for 2 loads of clothes to wash and dry. Then I discovered that it actually takes 2 cycles in the dryer for your clothes to completely dry....so I walked again downstairs for more tokens. Very, very frustrating experience. The pool was filthy...3 of my kids broke out in a rash after getting out of the pool and they all said that the water was disgusting. The hot tub was so hot that I could barely put my feet in (and I love hot baths and showers). We never did get connected to the free wireless network at the hotel because the strength was so low.

We were there in May, so a quiet time - the pool fills up very fast and there are not enough chairs around the pool The breakfast was gross. Only white milk, no chocolate milk and the \"juice\" selection did not contain any juice at all, just sugary fruit flavored drinks, You would think in Florida they would at least serve Florida Orange Juice. Diet yogurt (not kid friendly), one fruit selection, soggy waffles because they make them so far ahead and then cover them in a tray until they are soggy and precooked sausage patties that are refried to heat them up. This is what they call breakfast meat. My kid ate cherry danishes all week and I had to buy chocolate milk and real juice from the 7-11 that most of the other guests have a view of.

I want to thank you so much for making our stay at The Royale Parc Suites an enjoyable one. Your staff truly helped to make our stay one that was memorable. Angel (Front Desk) deserves an extra pat on the back/hug/commendation/thank you for his efforts. Angel was just that--an angel. He smoothed out the initial kinks , showing complete understanding for us as guests of the hotel. He did everything in his power to make things right and he succeeded. He was friendly and professional. He extended himself and let us know that we could call on and count on him no matter the reason or the amount of times. He was genuinely concerned about our satisfaction. Please let him know how much my husband and I appreciated his help and appreciate him. If you are not his direct supervisor, please also make that person aware of Angel's success in pleasing the hotel's guests. Other staff members who are worthy of being commended are Holiver (Housekeeping), Carlos (Maintenance) and Susie (Housekeeping). Carlos has such a warm spirit! He was SOOOO refreshing! Meeting him and getting the opportunity to interact with him was a blessing. Please give him an extra pat on the back/hug/commendation for his being such a warm and friendly person. Please let him know that my husband and I enjoyed meeting him. Our interaction was brief but it meant so much. Holiver was humble and professional. He made sure he put forth his best efforts until things were \"just right.\" The hotel ammenities were great! I loved that there was more than 1 pool. My babies are beginners so having the \"Kiddie Pool\" was just right. I hate cold water so the warm jacuzzi was great. My husband enjoyed the big pool. Providing breakfast was also great! Despite wanting 2 sleep in, it was wonderful being able to get up & mingle w/other guests in the restaurant & the outdoor cafe. Allowing 3.5 hours for breakfast really gives ample time for everyone to have the opportunity to enjoy a free breakfast. The free breakfast really helps out not only for the on-site convenience, but it helps for our budget. The kitchnette is also great for the budget. I didn't realize dishes/pots and pans would be provided! I cooked for my family several nights. We utilized the laundry room. We LOVED the fact that you have an on site fitness room. We had fun utilizing that as well. I again have to thank you for added that \"something extra\" to help make things better. U certainly gave us a warm welcome. I thank you for all your email interaction with me prior to our trip in an effort to insure that everything was to our satisfaction before we made it there.

The interior doors do not close due to being old and having coat after coat of paint on them. Although the bathrooms have had a few cosmetic updates they are very small, dingy and still appear old . The fans in the bathrooms need replaced. The mattresses are fine for small children but very small and uncomfortable for two adults and we are not large adults. I slept horribly and my parents slept separately in the guest bedroom because of the mattresses. The air conditioners are as old as the building. We all had sinus problems before leaving after a 7 day stay. The guest bedroom air conditioner did not work. It blew out air but it was not cold. We did let the front desk know and maintenance did look at it quickly. It did not get fixed on our stay, but we were ok with that. The kitchen does not have an oven and only two cooking pans. Housekeeping is the worst. Our beds were made a couple of times. We had to ask and wait for towels and washcloths, not very fun after staying at Disney all day. Nothing was cleaned or wiped down.

With a destination as busy as this, wear and tear is an issue at just about every hotel in the area. 2. In-room DVD player is great for rainy nights: plus there's a Red Box at the 7-11 right in front of the hotel: convenient 3. The free breakfast is marginal at best and gets REALLY crowded by 9am. We skipped it and hit Denny's instead (hint: the Denny's and Ihop nearest the hotel are MOBBED, keep heading east on 192, past Vineland, there's a brand new Denny's on the left, no crowd, super clean and nice staff). 4. The pool and hot tub are overrun with kids, so if you're thinking about quiet time at night in the hot tub with your spouse, well, you can just put that out of your mind right now. 5. Old Town is within walking distance, what a blast. Best to go on Saturday night for the cruise night with 300+ pre-1975 cars cruising right down the middle of Old Town. 6. There's a Publix supermarket right across the street so getting groceries is easy, although we made limited use of the \"kitchen\"...as it were. 7. Get a room on a lower floor or get ready to hoof it: the elevators are the slowest on the planet. 8.

All they did was replace our towels and make our beds. They left the garbage (coffee cups) as is ! Paper everywhere even on the floor. They did not even replace our toilet paper when we checked-in, we had to do that ourselves. 2. Toiletries there are 3, a one-time use of shampoo, lotion and soap. Of which they do not replace. 3. The refrigerator kept freezing our milk. There is no oven just a stove top. 4. Dishes there are 6 plates, 4 bowls, 6 cups, 4 glasses and some utensils. 5. Concierge sold us on going to a 2 - hour timeshare presentation on another hotel property, in return we get 50% off tickets to Magic Kingdom and Hollywood studios. The tour actually takes up 5 hours of your day! When you say NO to the timeshare they treat you like you have committed a crime! If you are short on time do not go to the timeshare tour. If you want the discount, yes you will save about $150.00 on tickets. Benefits: 1. You get breakfast every morning. 2. The room is bigger than your average room. 3. There are 2 flat screen TV's with about 20 channels to surf. 4. Shuttles are free, but very few timings. 5. There is a grocery store across the street, and a gift shop to get discounted disney souvenirs. This was not a 4 star, definitely a 3 star. Many couples with kids there.

When we arrived our fridge was not working. I called the front desk and it didn't take more than 10 minutes to solve the problem. Front desk people are very friendly and willing to help in anyway they can. I thank especially Magaly, she is adorable. I was never bothered by concierge to attend timeshare sales. We have annual passes to Disney, so once told they never pushed anything or were rude because we declined tickets to the parks. Breakfast is way more than you'd expect. Hot and cold items, everything always fresh . I only missed the waffles they used to have in the past, but that wasns't an issue at all. Our room, 326, faced the parking lot and was just across their laundry. If you are a sensitive sleeper , ask for a room at the rear end of the hotel, they are the quietest. We were never bothered by the noise from the pool. The only suggestion I have would be to limit smoke to the bar area and not the pool. I suffer from ashtma and sometimes had to leave premises due to the smell from cigarettes and cigars. Saw people smoking by the kiddie pool, which in no means is healthy to little ones. Our room was a bit outdated, but we did not bother asking for a change as we would be spending little time at the hotel. But they do have renovated rooms, is this is an issue, ask for one! Housekeeping did a great job, even though we did not request it every day. There was always plenty of towels and toiletries. Location is really a plus at this hotel. There is a 7 Eleven right by the hotel, a Publix supermaket, Dunkin Donuts, Logan's restaurant right accross the street, and if you are driving to the Disney Parks you'll be there in less than 10 minutes.

We just wanted to get away for a bit, but not spend a lot of money doing it. The kids really wanted to go back to Disney, so we ended up choosing this hotel because the price was right. Before going, the mixed reviews had me a little worried, but we were all pleasantly surprised upon arriving. We ended up coming here based on what we had read in \"The Unofficial Guide to Disney\", which rated this hotel as very good. This is not a 5-star hotel, so if that's what you're expecting, don't come here. They also don't pretend to be one. If, however, you want good, but cheap quality, and space, this is the place to be. Yes, the elevators need a bit of work. Who cares? Yes, the hotel itself needs some upkeep. Who cares? Yes, the jesters in the lobby are a little freaky. And yes, the location of the hotel (behind a gas station and hoaky gift shop) leaves something to be desired. Who cares? What mattered to us was that the service was there, it was clean, it was close to amenities and Disney, and it was safe. I give this hotel a rating of four and five for all these things. We had a 2-bdrm, 2-bath suite, and it was wonderful to have the space, with two kids along who like to squabble. Most of the time, when we weren't at a park, they were holed up in one bdrm or another, or at the pool, which was great. The suite was a bit smaller than I had thought, but it was still big enough, and a lifesaver at times. It was also very clean, with cleaning service doing a good job. There could have been some improvement in the kitchen clean-up, but all in all, good enough. The pool area was not that bad in terms of noise. If you wanted to sleep, you would go into your bedroom and close the door, and you would not hear a thing. I got very ill during our trip, and spent the last half in the hotel room, and I don't remember hearing anything. The only thing I didn't appreciate at this hotel was the \"concierge\". I don't like being taken for a fool. And because I had read the hotel reviews before going, I knew exactly what was going to happen, and they tried to get us to go to a timeshare meeting, but we politely declined. I could tell they were not happy about that, and for that, I was not pleased. This was not a concierge. It was a glorified salesperson. The breakfast buffet was wonderful. The food was freshly made, delicious, and varied, with both hot and cold items, really good coffee and juices, and fruit. We looked forward to it everyday, especially our kids. And it was wonderful to have access to this for some of our early mornings when we were heading out to the Park. It made a big difference in our days. Other than the \"concierge\" (and a hairdryer not working, and the internet being a bit sketchy), it was a great place to stay while in town. If you're expecting a classy joint, don't go here. If, however, you just want a safe and clean place to stay while visiting, this hotel is more than adequate for any and all your needs.

I would certainly stay there again if they add a little more variety for breakfast. I stayed for seven days in November-2009 and the only issue I had was with the breakfast (repetitive after seven days). I originally selected this hotel because of the breakfast buffet and the idea of not having to dine out. Although, there was bananas, oranges, yogurt and cereal and oatmeal-the hot items (scrambled eggs, sausage, hard boiled eggs) and danishes, toast, english muffins and cinamon rolls were the same for the whole stay. Pancakes, bacon, muffins, bagels w/cream cheese and omelette's would have made a big difference during those seven days; especially for the kids. We decided to try IHOP and Denny's for the last four days. I chose the hotel solely for the breakfast and the comments from management on October 20th as follows: Management response from royalparcmgmt, Hotel Management (Management representative) Oct 20, 2009 The management of the Quality Suites Royale Parc Suites would like to thank reviewer mandella914 for her positive comments about the hotel\u2019s attractive suite pricing and the spaciousness of our two bedroom suites. The Royale Parc Suites offers both hot and cold items on its extensive complimentary breakfast buffet. Daily selections include scrambled eggs, sausage links, white and wheat toast, yogurts, bagels or english muffins, cold cereals, oatmeal with granola, raisins and brown sugar toppings, muffins, danish pastries, fresh whole fruit, Minute Maid fruit juices and drinks, regular and decaf coffees, teas, and milk. This breakfast is served daily from 6:30AM to 10:00AM with seating in the charming indoor Cajun Quarters restaurant and adjacent Sidewalk Caf\u00e9 outdoor gazebo. A comparable buffet breakfast at other Orlando resorts would cost $13.95 per person plus tax and gratuity, so it offers families a great savings on your overall vacation costs. Although, I agree on the cost of eating out, they just need to add a little variety for breakfast...just a little tweak! Other than that, everything was great!

You are not getting luxury accomodations, but it is definitely a great value. We were going to WDW daily, and the hotel was very conveniently located (only a couple of miles from the WDW complex). There is a grocery store across the street and lots of places to eat on 192.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201cNot as good as the pictures.\u201d", "Author": "USA4eva", "ReviewID": "UR35814287", "Content": "I had booked this hotel on line, most reviews were good and the pictures very impressive. Check-in fine, went to check the room, the elevator was in a disgusting state, the cobwebs were thick and you could hardly see through the windows, this disappointed me as I feel the public areas should be as clean as the rooms. The room was OK, but because we had teenagers of both sex we needed to use the pull-out sofa bed. This was in a stained condition and every spring could be felt by just putting your hand on it gently, it would have been very uncomfortable to sleep on. We went back to reception they were very sorry and offered a deluxe suite for the same price. I checked the room out to find the sofa bed exactly the same, in fact unless you want the dvd and toaster and large coffee maker it is not worth the extra money as it was exactly the same as the first room. Also if the the sofa bed has to be used it takes up the whole of the living space. I went back to reception and they told me the sofa beds were the same in all the suites, so offered me to cancel my booking with no charge. I was very disappointed as I had hoped the suites would have been as special as the pictures on the web site, I can't see how any adult could possibly sleep on such an uncomfortable surface. The suite would probably be ok if you dont need the pullout sofa. But for the money there are other places nearby.

It looked nice enough, was affordable, big enough for everyone, and I trust the Choice Hotels brand, so we gave it a try. When I booked my hotel in the fall of '08, it was around $1500. By the time I finished changing my reservation in April, it was down to $950, so I was excited. When we arrived, the man at the desk was very helpful, as was the concierge. I was impressed with the size of the bedrooms and the comfortable beds upon arrival. When we returned from dinner the first night is when the trouble started. For a hotel that advertises room for 10 adults, you'd think they'd have enough towels. We had about five bath towels in the entire suite, and no washcloths! Seriously! We had to call the front desk several times, and the little weasel who finally brought them had an attitude as if it was our fault housekeeping didn't leave any. We also had to ask him to bring sheets for the sofa bed since it didn't have any, more pillows, and a blanket for the sofa bed that took about two days and a change of staff to receive! The kitchen floor was not clean, nor was one of the tubs. I don't doubt that housekeeping came everyday as our beds were made and the dishes were washed, but she didn't do the best of jobs! The laundry rooms was a disgrace! It was full of lint and a mysterious brown smear on the wall. The washers took $2 in tokens and the dryer an additional dollar, and they didn't even work good. The breakfast was bland. Bland eggs, bland sausage, no bacon, cold pastries. There weren't nearly enough chairs for the crowd. This was one of the worst aspects of the stay because the convenience of not preparing breakfast is what made us choose this hotel over a vacation home. We ended up going to the Publix market across the street and buying microwavable breakfast foods at incredibly low prices. The hotel sales Disney tickets, but at the gate price and it takes forever. And they stop after like 8 PM. No one told us that the night before. The Universal tickets sound like a better deal, but only if you're willing to listen to a timeshare pitch at another hotel. It's easier to go to Orlando's Convention and Visitor's Bureau and get tickets at a real discount. I must clarify that most of the problems occurred with the night staff. The day staff at the desk and the housekeeping staff all seemed to be friendly. They did address problems promptly. And the concierge with the blonde hair on the night shift was great. She was very helpful. I've stayed in fine hotels and mediocre hotels across the country, so I know I'm not being picky. I didn't expect five-star quality, but this was ridiculous. The customer service was about 99% of the problem. Perhaps if people would have been more willing to address the issues, I would have given the hotel a better review. It has potential because it's large, affordable, and incredibly close to Disney. They've almost got it, but not quite. If you choose to stay here, just take this into consideration.

We stayed here in January and was given a price over the phone of $99. Great. Then called back in March because we were going again but this time the customer service rep was rude and gave us a price of $129 and accused us of making up that we had stayed there in January and paid only $99. He then ended up looking up our past stay and did in fact see we did pay only $99. Didn't matter, he still said there was only a few rooms left and the price was $129. So my husband booked the room over the phone with his credit card. Well, me and the kids were to be at the hotel hours before my husband would arrive so he gave me his credit card for check in. I get to the hotel at 3:00 pm to check in and the girl at the desk finds the reservation on the computer and then asks for the credit card it was under and my ID. I give it to her and she says...\"do you have your husbands ID?\" I said \"Of course not\". Well, then that was it! She says well I can't go to the room until he gets there. I say he won't be there until 9:00 pm and I have three kids waiting in the car. Why does he need to be here!? She says because he has to verify information. I say I can verify anything she needs to know, after all it is my husband, we have the same last name, live in the same household, etc. AND the reservation has already been made by him on the phone the day before with THAT credit card. She asks if I have a credit card she can use and I say only my checking/debit but I don't want to run it and be charged. She then goes on to explain how a credit card is different from a debit card which I cut her off since I don't need my time wasted with a useless explanation like that. She then says...\"Well, what do you want to do?\" I say \"Check into the room!!\" She continues to repeat that she needs information verified but will not let me verify it, so I say fine call my husband. She calls him and asks him our address, phone number, his name AGAIN, and then his driver license number. She hangs up and gives me my room key. So just a warning to others, if you plan on checking into this hotel regardless if you have already made a reservation on the phone or online AND paid for it, you will not be able to check in without the driver license number of the person who made and paid for the room. And apparently it doesn't matter how much info you can verify or how many times you have stayed there.

The room was a 2-bedroom suite w/1 king size bed in one of the rooms and 2 beds in the other room, a kitchen, small dining room and a living room. Upon arriving in the early evening of our first night stay, I was informed by the front desk personnel that our room was unavailable due to a toilet that had flooded and saturated the carpet of the entire room. I had traveled by car all day and was a little annoyed to know they had known about this issue all day, but failed to contact me \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t want to lose my business\u201d. The employee behind the desk offered me a 20.00 discount per night if I would change to a 2 small beds per room suite, and advised me that I would be saving 120.00 dollars for the duration of my stay, as if that was supposed to give me an overwhelming pleasing feeling to jump on the deal. I agreed to stay in the \u201cother room\u201d for one night, but upon my request for the original room was told by the desk personnel that I could be moved to the original room style I reserved starting on the 2nd night of my stay. I was fine with that, but that\u2019s when the real nightmare began. After a 13 hour day at Magic Kingdom my family and I were ready for a hot shower and good night\u2019s rest. We didn\u2019t get back to the hotel until 11:00PM, so we didn\u2019t get to sleep until about midnight. At about 4:30AM our rooms phone rings and an individual identifying himself by name and says he\u2019s working \u201cthe front desk and states we have an emergency.\u201d He goes on to tell my wife that \u201cYour room has a gas leak, the fire department is on their way, I am contacting all the rooms on your floor, you need to stay calm and follow my instructions. \u201c Before he said anything else she wakes me up and hands me the phone. The phone falls off the night stand and accidently hangs up on the desk as she hands it to me. Within about 10 seconds (and before I can clear my eyes enough to call him) he calls back and says, \u201cSir, I need to you stay on the line with me and follow my instructions so I can make sure you are safe and then I need to call the next room.\u201d He stated, \u201cThe first thing I need you to do is wake your family members and put them in the bathroom. Also ensure they place a towel under the door to ensure they no more gas flows into that room.\u201d I did as he asked and then got back on the phone. He then told me that I needed to ventilate the room to the parking lot side of the hotel because the leak was coming from the hotel side. At that point he told me I would need to get a chair from the dining area and break a window in the bedroom to help ventilate the room. Now remember, it 4:30AM and I\u2019ve only been asleep for about 4 hours when all this is happening. I go to the living room, grab a chair and do as he says. After breaking the window I told him it was done and he could continue onto the next room cause I thought I was finished with his instructions so I hung up the phone. He called me right back again and said, \u201cSir, please stay on the line, I need to make sure you are following my instructions.\u201d He then told me to go to the living room and break the window there. I asked him why I should break the window on the side facing the inside of the building if that\u2019s the area that the gas is coming from? He again instructed me to break the window, and then I asked \u201cwhy don\u2019t I just open the door because it\u2019s facing the same side of the room?\u201d He said not to open the door and insisted I break the window at once because he needed to call the next room. I opened the blinds to the window and in the courtyard I saw 2 county deputies walking without any protective masks or any equipment that would indicate a gas leak. I flagged down the officers by knocking on the glass and got them to come to my room while I still had the desk on the line. One of the officers came in and I handed him the phone. The \u201cfront desk\u201d talked to the officer for about a minute before the officer interrupted him and explained that the individual on the phone was not who he claimed he was. The officer had just come from the front desk and he was that there. At that time, the individual on the phone hung up. The officer stated that a guest in another room had also broken a window. Apparently the individual calling was someone who was familiar with the hotel, knew which rooms had kitchens, knew what to tell the front desk employee to allow him to be connected to multiple rooms at 4:30AM, and was familiar with hotel procedures when dealing with an emergency situation. The office also said it has to have been a former disgruntle employee. At this point I was furious that I had been in the hotel for 2 nights, and had issues both nights. I wasn\u2019t going to let the rest of my vacation be ruined by the hotel and their staff, so I decided to check out. We gathered our belongings and I went down to talk to the manager when he arrived at 7. The other individual that had broken a window had accepted a move to another room, but I refused to stay there another night. At that point the manager said, \u201c\u201dthen you\u2019re going to have to pay for that window.\u201d I said I wasn\u2019t paying for the window because it was their front desk that was allowing those repeated calls to come through to my room and work his way down the hall. \u201c I also told him that \u201cif he wanted my money for the window it would have to go through my attorney.\u201d I told his he should be happy enough that I\u2019m paying for a service I didn\u2019t receive, 2 nights of rest in his hotel.\u201d The manager\u2019s name tag said \u201cRicardo\u201d, but when I asked for his name he handed me a card that didn\u2019t have it, but the name of another person, Cedrick Thomas. When I asked him to write his name on the back of the card he simply scribbled \u201cRicky\u201d. I then asked him if his name was \u201cRicky, Ricardo, or if it was Ricky Ricardo because what his tag said and what he wrote were to different things.\u201d He then stated his name was \u201cRicky Ricardo\u201d. I asked him if all the employees had their last names on their tags because I wanted to make sure I had his name correct. He then pointed at a sign on the wall that verified his name wasn\u2019t Ricky Ricardo, but in fact, Ricardo Robles. I asked him why he gave me a fake name and he did not respond. When I asked him to give me the room number of the guest that had moved from 206 so I could get his information for my complaint he would not, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t know the guests last name.\u201d I had met the man only a couple hours earlier when we were both standing at the front desk with the county sheriffs, but he knew why I wanted it and at that point was \u201cplaying the game.\u201d I then requested the police report numbers and those were provided. We called the Royal Plaza hotel in Downtown Disney and they had heard it all before from customers coming from the Royal Parc Suites. They were kind enough to allow us to check-in early that morning and we had a great experience there for the 4 nights left of our vacation. I ended up paying over 300 dollars for the 2 nights I was in the room, but that was all (as of right now). I re-injured my right rotator cuff that I have been getting cortisone shots for and have been taking anti-inflammatory for.

Unfortunatly there are about 5 on that road and it hard to find the right one without a noticable indication of which one they are.When I arrived the front desk reception was great. But when we got into the room the first thing I did was walk to the seven eleven, bought cleaning supplies and clean the suite. It is very noticable the cleaning staff do not pay attention to detail. It only took a little scrubbing to remove the stains on the counters. They need to keep an eye on the base of toilets and corners of the floors. Also, the carpet was so dirty I couldn't let my kids walk around with out shoes or slippers on. I think they should have at least spot cleaned the bigger stains. When the cleaning staff did come in while we were out, they still did little more than make a bed. I would still have to clean the sinks, toilets and bathtubs. I finally told the forget it I will do it myself so it was done right. They really may want to keep the concret on the property cleaned regularly at all levels.This alone give the first impression of uncleanlyness. The laundry was handy but filthy and unkept. Should make the signs on the dryers more obvious for what money slots are for what dryer. I had no problem, but several times people put tokens in only to find the dryer not running then I would have to explain they put them into the wrong one. Trying to sleep at night was not good. They constantly had people running around making all kinds of noise by scremming , yelling, music and such sometime well after 2 am. I call and complained and was told they had spoken to certain parties and it would get better.........never did. They told me a security guard patrols at midnight but I never saw one and nothing changed. It is hard when there are childeren who go to bed around ten. They should have quiet policy in place for families with young kids. Maybe keeping it down after 11 pm until 8 am. The breakfast \"buffet\" was hectic and disorganized. They need at least two or three updated toasters that they can keep clean. The line was forever backed up with people trying to cook their own things. the one they had was old,with only two slots and always drty. Basically, the layout need to be adjusted slightly to make it a flow friendly. The pool was freezing the entire time we were there. It would be hard to convince me and others I spoke with it was heated in any way. The hot tub was much hotter than the 104 they claimed. When I used a digital thermomitor( I got one to prove to someone it was hotter and not safe to be in too long) it read around 107. There were several of us out there from many different rooms who all agreed. Though there were disappointments the price was good for what we had.

The hot tub was great. Breakfast was OK...it's free, can't complain too much. Housekeeping was good. Our lady didn't speak English but there was someone there to translate our needs. They were all really nice and got everything we needed quickly. My only complaint was the shuttle service to Disney...also free so can't say too much. The problem was their pick up and drop off times. Was something like 8am, 10am and 11am but to get back to the hotel the earliest pick up time from the park was 8pm. The first day we ended up taking a taxi back which cost us $22. So the next day we just drove and parking was $13. The parking fee is good for all the parks if you have park hopper tickets like we had.

Decent enough accomodations. Clean and tidy public areas. Breakfast is ok; and as expected for this type of establishment. The Happy 'hour' is truly one hour. Free beer [Bud/Bud light] and box wine for the hour. The hot tub was hot - a GREAT perk after a long day on your fee. Pool was clean.

The Bad: internet access - free - and you get what you pay for. Constant dropoffs, weak signals. Blankets are thin and essentially worthless and you need three of them to stay warm at night. Pillows are all very very soft feather - and they do not have anything else. There is no signage: the only sign is the large green Quality Suites sign - you do not see the name of the hotel anywhere until AFTER you turn off the street between a gas station on the right and an ubiquitous Orlando style T-shirt and junk store on the left. I can imagine many people never found the place and are still wandering Irlo Bronson looking for it. Location is tough - tucked next to the freeway.

We thought, \"Quality Inn- oh no!\" We were nervous when we entered the lobby- it was nice, but huge, oddly-out-of-place life-size jesters stood guard in the lobby, a slightly creepy fellow offered us coupons and a map (and asked waaaay too many personal questions), and the clerk on duty that evening was not too pleasant, but we were exhausted and went up to the room.

Happy hour was cool- complimentary beer, wine, and soda- and the other guests and the bartender were really nice. Breakfast was totally impressive- plenty of scrambled eggs, saus links, muffins, bread for toasting, french toast, fresh fruit, cereals, danish, beverages- you get the idea. Note for Internet users- the hotel advertises wireless, but my laptop could not even get connected in my bedroom because the signal was too weak. Another guest mentioned the same issue. The channels were limited, but the flat screen TVs were great. The local pizza place bombarded us with flyers- between Mon and Wed, we received at least 9 menu flyers in the door!

There were also no shampoos in the bathroom. Only a single bar of face soap. My guess is that the maid did not restock them from the last guest.....or clean the room well for that matter. So I called the front desk and they gave me a different room. So I got to the 2nd room. the 2nd room had multiple issues as well..... The towels in the bathroom were obviously not restocked since the last guest. There were several bath towels, two hand towels, and no facecloths at all. There was also a hand towel already hanging on the towel rack which was all disheveled as it had obviously been used.... While laying a shirt out on one of the beds, I noticed MANY hairs on the pillow cases and the sheets. Upon closer inspection, there were hairs all through the bed. I checked the other bed and found the same thing. The beds... While impeccably made, still had the sheets on them from the previous guests. There is no way they had been washed because many of the hairs were loosly laying there. Very disgusting!!!! So I called the 800 number form the 2nd room to complain and to see if they could find me a room in another one of their hotels nearby. The rep came back on and told me that the hotel refused to refund my money for the first hotel because I had already checked in. I hadn't even been there a half an hour or opened my bag yet. So basically they tell me that they are keeping my money even though I was put into two different disgusting hotel rooms.... As if it's MY FAULT!!! I find this to be inexcusable. As I said...

The pool area was kept tidy and cleaned every morning, with plenty of towels supplied at least twice a day.There could have been more seating but on our last day they did get a shipment of new chairs and were busy setting these out.

We usually got the shuttle to Disney but then came back on the local bus service as it has service to the area twice every hour. We took a taxi to and from the Orlando airport - this was a great way to go - just show up at the taxi stand and you are on your way - no waiting for the shuttle to the rental office and the long line-up to get your car. The only problem we saw was with other holidaymakers - a few children were not well-behaved and some families were a bit loud around the pool - but this has to be expected -everybody is trying to enjoy themselves and the hotel is not at fault in that area. Usually this occurred in the evening when everyone returned from the parks - during the day the pool area was usually very quiet and you would almost have the pool to yourself.

The breakfast was a GREAT moneysaver for us, There were eggs, sausages, waffles, toast, yogurt, cereals, juices, fruits, toast, bagels, a very large selection ALL INCLUDED!! It never ran out when we were there, and was never very crowded. The location is very convenient, of course in Orlando, you need a car, everything is so far apart. But, we were 5 minutes away from Old Town which is 2 streets of bars, live music, car shows on Friday and Saturday, and also connected to FunSpot which is a mini amusement park and we spent 4 hours riding go-carts. It was great to be able to walk back to our hotel and take a rest and go back! Across the street is a Harley Davidson shop, Chinese buffet, souvenier shop is right next door. For food, there are tons of delivered items, Wendy's is in walking distance, KFC, Chick Fil A, and Red Lobster, and Joe's CrabShack are all within walking distance. Wal Mart was a little hard to find. Disney World, Universal, Sea World and International Drive are all within 10 minutes drive, or you can use their free shuttle. I will definitely go back whenever we go to Florida. We stayed at this hotel for 11 days, and it became like home! No timeshare pushing here, just fun! We had a great deal from hotels.com at only $89 per night and $100 back for staying over 10 days plus a $50 gas card! One note, if you are well-to-do, this is not the place for you. Kids run up and down the hallways until midnight, there is loud music from the bar, and people are yelling and splashing in the pool until it closes at 11 p.m. But if you want FUN, this is the place to be!", "Date": "October 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, VA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "Toonces76", "ReviewID": "UR21104563", "Content": "This was our first family trip to Disney with a young child, and we chose this hotel for its proximity to Disney, the shuttles, the suite layout, and the free amenities.

Again, I travel a lot with my job and stayed in hundreds of hotels and can tell you I have been at Hiltons that looked worse then this.

The pool was big and clean and the kids loved it. The lobby is nice and clean and the staff is more the helpful. There is plenty of security in the hotel. Aside from maybe renovating the rooms a little I have no complaints about the hotel. Some of the reviews are scary but I think its all about expectation.

Had 1 bedroom suite which was clean and functional,had 2 lcd tv's,fridge,small kitchen,bath with shower and comfortable beds. Overall well cleaned and maintained hotel,although external walkways,these were overlooking pool rather than typical outside external to building. Room changed immediately on arrival due to soaking carpet due to air con leak. though on here patrick from BOOKIT says extensive breakfast over 100 items,we found like other guests we spoke to that there were only 2 hot items,sausages and scrammbled egg and although bread and waffles could be toasted this in my opinion a continental breakfast with the exception of eggs and sausages. All day coffee bar was usually not HOT but luke warm as they were thermos flasks rather than coffee machine. You could make tea and coffee in room if you wished so not too bad. They were constantly cleaning and keeping hotel well maintained,so nice to see. the poolside bar tender 'Jennifer' was the best staff member at the hotel,friendly, welcoming and attentive and made for a lovely stay and great value for money. the concierges were helpful even if they always tried to get you to go on vacation (timeshare) style tours every time you asked them for tickets to any park,some did not even have the courage to tell you about the tour when offering discounted price!! didn't like that! With that said this is not a 5 star hotel and for what we paid we got good value for money a great bar tender,didn't put on too much weight eating free breakfast(you really do get bored of that,so all guests we spoke to agreed.)and with the pentagon shape and good security,we would say we had great value for money for what we paid,and looking at some of the neighbouring hotels,this was the nicest and well located too. Whilst I have read other reviews,and we had a few issues needing resolving,this was done immediately with no fuss,and the security comments I find unbelievable as during our stay the security patrols were all night long and highly visable. Yes we arrived labour day weekend and it was busy and as this is an affordable hotel you will always get a mix of good, bad, loud and quiet,but unless you pay for 5 star exclusitivity,you should find the hotel and securty are more than capable of handling the roudy guests which we must say were certainly not there on the 1st week of September. We enjoyed our stay at Royale parc suites and with some of the other comments we would not have booked,and to be fair this was better than most 3 star hotels in orlando we have stayed in,and we would go back just for the friendly bar tender (jennifer)who made for many enjoyable nights around the poolside bar meeting people from all over the world,having fun and laughter and resting our tired feet!

Is it on US 192 or is it on some side street off US 192? It's on the side street off US 192 and if you miss it while looking for the place, keep driving, your money elsewhere will probably be well spent at another one of the hotels on the strip. Hell, the Old Town Suites down the road or some other hotel on 192 that was selling rooms for $24.99/night would've been better than this place. My parents had made the reservation as they were spending two weeks in the Disney area. The only PRO to this place that it was close to the Disney entrance (US 192 route). That was cool, but outside of that, let me start nit-picking every detail about this hotel. First off - I read the other reviews about this place and it looks the manager of this property said there was security that patrols the hotel? There is? Where? The place could potentially be a hotbed for criminal activity as people are free to come and go through the side entrance that's kept open at night which accesses the pool courtyard and five floors of hotel rooms where the purpritator could get access to ANY room. Second - the room had a musty odor in them. I'm not sure if it's because someone had used the restroom in the hotel room, but it smelled like the room hadn't been cleaned for weeks and before the room was sold to my parents, housekeeping came in and surface cleaned it (dusted the shelves, straightened out things, etc.) Third - The beds were very small. My wife and I aren't skinny people, but we're not fat, either. We couldn't exactly sleep in the same bed together, at least comfortably. As of this writing, we came home early because now we're looking forward to sleeping in our bed tonight. My parents wound up sleeping on the bed that folded out of the couch. According to my mother, she had to get extra blankets to cushion the bed padding so that the folding bed hinges wouldn't stick in her back. How nice, huh? Fourth - You want a hot shower? That's funny. You'll be better off taking a lukewarm shower and enjoying it rather than getting maintenance up there to figure out what the heck is going on with the hot water. Fifth - The free breakfast buffet. No wonder they're giving it away for free. No one in their right mind would pay for such crap! You might as well go to the Golden Corral Buffet Restaurant down the street. You'll get a better breakfast in there! The eggs were runny, the sausage was rather chewy, the juice from the juice dispenser was \"cool\" at best and usually when I stay in a hotel that has a free breakfast buffet, there's real dishes on a plate warmer next to the buffet line and not styrofoam plates with plastic forks, spoons, knives. Sometimes free is good, but in this case, shell out the money and get a real breakfast elsewhere. Really, I didn't feel safe at all at that hotel and left. While my parents are enjoying it up there (which I'm shocked because my parents have better taste in judgement when booking a hotel in Orlando), my wife and I packed up and came home early. Next week, we're staying at Embassy Suites. If you're reading this review and it sounds like this is the room/hotel you want to stay here - be my guest.

We overlooked it then since we were so excited about going to Disney the next day and, well, kids will be kids. The next night (Thursday) was different since those same teens were now throwing soap bars and coffee mugs at each other while running and yelling around our floor. At 11:30p I called the front desk 3 TIMES to report this...no answer. I decided that after spending 11 hours at Disney, I wanted to sleep, so I WALKED down to the lobby and told the guy at the front desk what was going on. He said he \"would take care of it.\" An hour later (12:30a) \"the teens\" were still running around AND NOW playing the drums on the railing, bouncing balls, and riding skateboards. Again, I called the front desk and I was told that he would take care of it himself. By 1:30a nothing, still, had been done about this problem. When I called the front desk to complain AGAIN and ask where the parents of these MINORS were, I got the annoyed response of: \"Uh, I'm working on that.\" I was under the impression that this establishment had 24 Hour security...I only saw him 1 time during our stay. By 2a, I gave up. Who needs sleep anyway, right? Friday night was quiet (since \"the teens\" checked out that morning). However, we returned from our second day at Disney to a hotel room that had been moderately cleaned by housekeeping. One of the two bathrooms had not been touched! Toilet paper and towels had NOT been replaced!!!! Cleaning one bathroom must have been easier and saved more time. Saturday was a disaster. Again, we did not have enough towels to accommodate us, coffee was not replaced, and there was a fresh stain of what looked like menstrual blood on a bed that 2 kids were sleeping on. We called the front desk, AGAIN, to ask for more towels and a fresh set of bed linens. An hour and a half later, we had facial tissues delivered to our room. ??? A new set of teens had arrived that afternoon and once again we were awakened by yelling. However, this time, there was arguing, cursing and threats between \"the teens\" and another guest (no one with our group). I called the front desk to report this disturbance and man who answered the phone blew me off and seemed very annoyed. I don't think security ever went to check it out b/c \"the teens\" were still outside yelling. Here's the kicker...when checking out, we told the girl at the front desk about our complaints, and all we got was \"Oh, Sorry. I guess we just have a bunch of teenagers running around.\" NOT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE if you ask me.

The positives far outweighed the negatives, but some issues at the hotel should be addressed by management; In general; Nice pool area, although all the kids complained of too much chlorine (better too much than not enough in my opinion though). Quite crowded, but the noise was not an issue for us as we were on the top floor and it was a fun \u201ckids\u201d atmosphere, rather than a rowdy crowd. Decent small gym with all new equipment (no fee). Computer/business center that charges by the minute for the computer use or by the page for printing. We used it only to book and print some boarding passes at the airline so it was worth while. Probably not worth the cost for anything else. The hotel advertises free wifi, but we didn't bring a computer with us, so can't comment on that The room has been about 75% renovated with new furniture (very comfortable beds), carpeting, linens, paint, partially updated baths, etc. Our room looked very much like the hotel site photos which was a relief after seeing some of the other reviews here that stated they didn\u2019t. The room had 3 separate a/c units which appeared new and worked great and it was nice to be able to adjust each to fit the peoples needs/wants in each room. The kitchen was not totally updated, but everything worked fine and was clean. We stayed in a top floor suite with 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, living area and kitchenette with cabinets, sink, stove (no oven), microwave, dishwasher and nearly full sized fridge. It was stocked with all necessary utensils, dishes and pots & pans, coffee pot, toaster, blender, etc. (although we used paper and plastic most of the time out of preference). Both bedrooms had 2 queen beds and the living room had a pull out sleeper sofa (very comfortable and private for the 5 of us). The master had a private bathroom and the 'common bath' was adjacent to the living area and the kitchenette. Two rooms (master BR & LR) had a new LCD flat panel TV and the 2nd bedroom had an older standard TV. All worked well except the channels were very limited with the majority being news and/or local. They had Showtime which is no ones favorite and there is no other premium channel or \"pay per view movies\" as most hotels have these days as options. There was a VHS/DVD player in the living room, but the hotel doesn't offer movies for rent which seemed odd? So bring your own unless you want to go to the bother of joining a local video store (we didn't). There are free sodas, beer and wine at the pool every day from 5pm to 7pm which was nice. We went on 3-4 occasions and the service was fast and friendly The free breakfast buffet is nicer than most area hotels with muffins, bagels, pastries, breads, cereals, fruit, juice/coffee/tea, and hot waffles, sausage & scrambled eggs. Very crowded between 8:30-10, but nearly empty earlier when I usually went around 6:30am. There is also a free coffee/tea station in the lobby all day. There is a small gift / snack shop in the lobby. Prices aren\u2019t very good and the products aren\u2019t very fresh. I pointed out several snack items to the clerk that the expiration date had expired on (several months ago in some instances). Would recommend you avoid this place and walk the few hundred feet to the 7-11 store in front of the hotel as we did for \u201csnacks & drinks\u201d if so desired. Better selection, cheaper and fresher. Positives: * Good location near I-4 and 192 about 15 minutes from Disney (when factoring in the traffic, etc). There is no left turn when exiting onto 192 though, so go through the Days Inn parking lot next door when exiting so that you can use the traffic light and avoid trying to make a u-turn on 192 when going towards Disney, etc. * Good overall value for a family needing a suite rather than a \u201croom\u201d * Updated and comfortable with good free breakfast buffet * Good pool area and amenities for a family * Many restaurants and stores in the immediate area. Several within walking distance * Good parking unless you return late at night when you may have to use the overflow lot behind the hotel * The web site is pretty accurate with the description, which isn\u2019t always the case * Free shuttle was on time and convenient for getting to Disney, did not use it for the return trip to the hotel as we had a car for pick-up at our leisure * Lots of closet space and they even have shelves as well as hangers and rods Negatives: * Housekeeping was below par and much too late in the day. I believe they need to hire more housekeepers as many days things weren\u2019t cleaned properly and/or items were not replenished \u2018no clean towels one day\u2019, no soaps and shampoos left another day (but they are cleaning \u2018apartments\u2019, rather than hotel rooms, so more time or help is probably needed). And they need to adjust their cleaning schedule. In our 10 day stay, our room was never cleaned before 3:30pm except for one day and on 3-4 occasions wasn\u2019t done until 5pm. This is fine if your at the parks until late at night as you\u2019ll never know the difference, but on the other days it\u2019s quite annoying. In essence, we never had a clean room except at night which is unacceptable. We contacted housekeeping and the front desk to see if possibly they could even alternate days so our room wasn\u2019t one of the last ones cleaned every day, but were basically shrugged off and told that the maids finished at 5pm. End of conversation. The maid (who only spoke Spanish, but so did one of us) informed us that the \u201ccheck out rooms\u201d received priority and had to be done 1st and then they did the other guest rooms. I\u2019ve never stayed at a hotel with such late cleaning times every day? * As other posters have noted, the elevators are very slow, hot and need cleaning * As already mentioned, better quality control is needed at the snack/gift shop as many items were found to be past their expiration dates. There is no excuse for that. * Put a stop to all the people shoving fliers for bogus pizza restaurants under your door every evening (although there are signs stating same is prohibited, we saw the security guard on more than one occasion just watching the people do it, rather than telling them to stop)", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cLOVED IT!

We stayed at the Royale Parc Suites for 4 nights. I was very nervous after reading some of the reviews on here, but was pleasantly satisfied with our stay. We are a military family of 4. Two adults and 2 small children. We were supposed to stay in Disney at the Shades of Green in June, but had to cancel due to my husband's work schedule. Next, we booked a room at the All Movies resort, but after reading their reviews, we were disappointed with the room size and lack of amenities (no breakfast, no fridge, etc). We stumbled upon a deal at the Royale Parc Suites for about $80/night and decided to take a chance. I would like to address most of the concerns point by point: #1 Annoying check in. Unfortunately, we did find this to be the case. We avoided the front desk during our stay for fear of having to deal with this again. My advice is this, once you have received your room key, you will be directed to the concierge desk for your \"welcome packet\". Unless you still need to buy your park tickets, avoid this desk! They will try to talk you into a free breakfast at their new resort and a tour. Now, if this is your type of thing, by all means, go for it! My husband had 4 days leave, and we are already strapped for family time, so it was not for us. We like our privacy when on vacation. #2 Cleanliness. We had no problems here. Our room didn't have the fancy granite or anything, but it was clean. The maids did a good job everyday keeping it clean. I also saw someone cleaning the pool everyday. One day we came back from the parks just as happy hour was ending and were disgusted to find vomit all over the stairs. My husband called the front desk and it was cleaned up immediately. #3 Comfort. My husband and I had a one bedroom suite. It was ample. My children slept in the living room on the most comfortable sofa bed ever. I loved the duvets and pillows. My husband and I had a large bedroom with 2 double beds all to ourselves. #4 Accessibility. I agree, the hotel could be hard to find if you are looking for the Royale Parc Suites. We almost drove past because the sign reads \"Quality Suites\". Fortunately, I saw the 7-11 the other reviewers mentioned, and we were fine. You have access to the 7-11 from the hotel parking lot, and we found ourselves using this often. With 2 little kids, we always seem to need something, and it was nice to just walk to the convenience store. #5 Happy hour, I really can't say anything about this one. I wish the free drinks had been from 8-10 but I realize that's not really happy hour. We were never back from the parks early enough to take advantage. #6 Breakfast. It is what it is. I'm health conscious and I had wheat toast, scrambled eggs and a lowfat yogurt every morning. Better grain breads, and more fresh fruit would have been nice, but you get what you pay for. My husband and kids were happy. They are much easier to please when it comes to food. I'm the snob, so I recognize it as my problem. The food was sufficient (and most importantly: included in the price!) #7 Access to the parks. We took the shuttle to sea world the first day, and would have stayed later if we had drove. I've never been big on having to stick to someone else's schedule. That's why I don't take cruises. I also found it annoying that we drove right past Seaworld and dropped off at Universal studios first. But on the return trip, being picked up 2nd was to our advantage. Driving to the Disney parks worked out best for us, and it was easy to get there, and easy to get back. We didn't know what to expect on a holiday weekend, but we never experienced parking problems or traffic. The shuttle times were difficult to make. The first was at 0730 (it was too difficult to get my kids up and fed and dressed by then. We were too tired from the night before). The 2nd was at 0945 which we felt was too late. We were usually ready to hit the road around 0830-0900. For the most part we were satisfied with our stay. We have been all over the world and have stayed in 1-5 star hotels and I think we knew what to expect. The room was decent, not fancy. The amenities were the same. The location was ugly, but convenient. We had a horrible view of the gas station from our bedroom window, but learned to appreciate that 7-11 by the time we left. Once you are in the courtyard, you forget about the ugly location. The pool area was nice enough, but again, nothing fancy. There are tons of restaurants in the area, but we spent most of our time at the parks, so we never had a chance to check them out. I was excited to see Dunkin donuts and starbucks across the street, but the coffee in the hotel lobby was excellent, so I never needed to go anywhere else. We were frustrated one night when we returned late and couldn't find a parking spot. We finally found overflow parking, and it sucked carrying two sleeping kids to the hotel from there, but we lived. It would be nice if they gave you a parking pass or numbered the spaces to correspond with the rooms to control how many parking spaces people are using. We had one car and shouldn't have needed to park in the overflow. We didn't bother complaining to the management though, and didn't have a problem again. Another complaint was the lack of a DVD player in the living room. Again, we avoided the front desk, so we didn't complain. We just used our portable. Our location right across from the 3rd floor elevator was a little noisy at times, but not too bad. Just at about 11 pm when the pool closed, and then it was quite through the night. We only had neighbors on one side, and we never heard them. I think we will try staying at a Disney resort next time for the convenience, but I would consider this hotel as a back up choice.", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Schaumburg, IL", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel near everything in Orlando\u201d", "Author": "DaisyDeeDee", "ReviewID": "UR16292865", "Content": "Our extended family of 6 (Grandpa, Grandma, daughter, son in law, 2 boys ages 4 and 1) stayed 5 nights here in May 2008.

We went to Universal Studios (15 minutes away) and Sea World (10 minutes away) along with the new Sea World Aquatica. It was a pleasure to return to our hotel after long days being tourists and walking into our spacious cool rooms and then hitting the pool. Our 2 bedroom suite was larger than expected! The frontroom has a comfortable couch (pull out sleeper) with coffee table. The kitchen table is near with 4 chairs. There is a breakfast bar next to it with a couple of high stools. The kitchen was nice and stocked with the plates, glasses, silverware, pots, etc. that you would need. It is a small refrigerator and a 2 burner stove which is ample. Plenty of room to walk around in the kitchen. The main bedroom is quite large (accommodated the crib nicely) and has 2 beds with a connecting bathroom which has a tub. The second bedroom is also large (at the end of the kitchen) and also has 2 beds. The beds are really comfortable and each has feather pillows also comfy. The second bathroom is off the kitchen and has a shower. If you need any additional towels, shampoo, etc. and phone and request it, it is brought up quickly! Other reviewers have complained of noises heard in the rooms next door. Honestly one night we did hear noise, but called the front desk, and they immediately came up and everything got quiet next door. All the rooms (5 floors) overlook the courtyard which is landscaped very nicely. The pool is larger than expected and very refreshing (not cold, but nice!). There is a small baby pool that has water fountains in it, and also there is a hot tub that is nice. You can take as many towels as you want right in the pool area. The whole pool area is fenced off, with a small playground right outside it. There is a game room next to it also. The 5 to 7pm happy hour is just what is advertised. It is also outside of the fence, but right next to the pool. They offer soda, tap beer and wine. Each time one of us went us we ordered 2 or 3 drinks and gave a $1 tip. The morning breakfast is nice, especially that it is included in the price. The choices minimally change each morning (bagels one day, english muffins the next and different fruit also). They always have scrambled eggs, sausage links, bacon, toast, waffles, danish, juice and coffee. Hey, it's free so anyone that complains is crazy! There is alot of shopping down Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy along with many restaurants. However right across the street is Logan's Roadhouse. I would definitely recommend it! They have peanuts in the shell on the tables and bring you fresh hot bread pretty quick. The prices are very good with a nice selection of food. Behind that is a good, large grocery store also.

It is only 5 minutes from DW and within walking distance to many eating establishments (mostly low priced buffets).

The only issues we had during our stay was one evening our toilet became plugged, but one call to the front desk and help was there in under 3 minutes. Also, the size of the room was great, but the bathroom was pretty small. It was a tight fit for 2 adults to be in the bathroom at the same time and me and my wife are not big people.

There were an abundance of luggage carts available outside the hotel; not just 1 or 2. I had some trouble maneuvering my cart so the security guard in the lobby helped us with the cart and even helped us bring our luggage and groceries into the room. There is a PUBLIX and Walgreen's across the street. The gift shop also carries emergency items. At no time did the concierge pressure us into a timeshare presentation.

They had folded towels to resemble swans and placed one on each bed. There was also a ducky dish towel w/dish-washing detergent for the dishwasher in the kitchen. The closet space was more than I had seen available at other properties. The property has added closet organizers; which was a nice touch. The bathroom was spotless with plenty of towels, soap, shampoo and lotion. I have no complaints about the water pressure or amount of hot water, it was always good. We did have a clogged drain in the shower but maintenance fixed it within 10 minutes of calling the front desk. There are privacy curtains in the living room and bedrooms, they are kind of hidden behind the actual drapes; my daughter found them before I did. Bedding is all new and very comfortable. There are 3 very cushy pillows on each bed and the sheets were changed as requested every other day (I have allergies).

They were right on-time and offered a small discount for a round trip. The hotel shuttles were luxury buses, very nice. Tip \u2013 they don\u2019t take you to the individual parks, only the Magic Kingdom transportation center \u2013 you will need to plan accordingly. The latest trip back is 10:45pm.

We stayed at Royale Parc Suites in Kissimmee. Let me tell you- this is THE best place we ever stayed for vacation as a family! We arrived on Saturday around 7:30. Check in was quick and easy. We did get asked (well, begged) by the concierge to sign up for a Condo tour in exchange for $70 cash; however, we stayed firm with our \"No thank yous\" and was left alone for the rest of the trip. Our room was a two bedroom suite on the bottom floor in room 123. We could walk out to the pool from our front door. We couldn't complain about the pool noise late at night, because we allowed our teens to stay out at the pool until closing at 11pm most nights. After all, they are on vacation, too! You can only hear outside noises from the living room, not the bedroooms, Each bedroom had two very comfortable beds, dresser, large closet, lots of room. The master bedrom also had flat screened TV, an in-room safe, and a bathroom. There was another bathroom off of the living room. The kitchen is fully equipped with appliances, ccokwear, dishes, fridge, stove, dishwasher, and dishwashing soap. The living room has a pull out couch, flatscreen tv and a table with 4 chairs. There are also two barstools at the kitchen counter. Nice heating/airconditioning set up with separate controls in each bedroom and living room. The staff was awesome! The maid even washed our dishes. They only change sheets every 3 days. Not really a big deal since you are the only one sleeping in them! The pool is heated, which came in handy since the weather was colder than average (60-70s) Hot tub nice. Also noticed kiddie pool. The poolside towels were plenty. I've never seen anyone keep so many fresh towels stocked! Arcade near pool, as is the bar, and an outside eating area. The poolside bar was very tropical with friendly bartenders. We just loved Jenifer but both were great. We took advantage of the free beer, wine, soda at managers cocktail between 5-7pm. Never had to wait long before we got a refill.

You must consider everything when choosing a hotel and this one has everything! Check-in was fast and courteous, tickets were available in the lobby at the lowest prices. No waiting in line when you arrived at the parks! Breakfast every morning was hot and plentiful! ( not your usual muffin and juice, but eggs, sausage, bagels, cereal, fruit, and more.) What a great way to save money for other things.. Grounds and pool area were very nice, pool bar, clean towels, playground for kids all first class. Nice gift shop in lobby if you forgot anything. The suites were the best! Large rooms, very clean, comfortable beds, everything you need. The staff at this hotel went out of their way to make you feel like you were the most important guest in the hotel.

It also was not located in the best of areas. the pool was so cloady you could not see the bottom! The online price was $200 a night but I got a AAA rate of $125 a night. Not worth it. Spend a little more and stay at the Nick hotel or a Disney resort. We live in So Cal and take many small trips a year as well as 2 to 3 big trips a year. This was probably one of the worst hotels that we have stayed at. I was dissapointed. The hotel website does the place justice. Belive me, it does not look like the pictures!!!

After reading the previous negative reviews it makes me wonder if we just got lucky? Our group of 24 (14 adults, 10 kids) stayed in 6 suites. No one complained. I can't speak for their rooms but our 2 bedroom suite was nice. Housekeeping did a great job of cleaning our room daily. Okay, so the towels aren't plush but there were plenty of them. The \"master\" bedroom faces the pool and has a TV but could be a bit noisy. The other bedroom faced the parking lot and was quieter but didn't have a TV. We didn't miss it as there was a tv in the living room. The beds were comfortable with lots of pillows. The bathrooms were clean (no mold that I saw) and the toiletries replaced daily. The free breakfast was a bit crowded, and you do get tired of it after the first two days, but it wasn't half bad --eggs, sausage, cereal, waffles, juice. The free happy hour was enjoyed by all and a nice perk. Bartenders offered great service. The free internet was great and a very strong signal. There was a security presence at the hotel which is typical for an Orlando hotel on a busy \"strip mall\" road. The hotel charges $2.50 per day for the in-room safe whether you use it or not. Makes me wonder why the person who put their credit card in the drawer didn't use it? The staff was pleasant and professional. Yes, there were lots of kids there including ours -- but what do expect for an all-suite hotel in Orlando? They do go to bed you know. There are many restaurants within walking distance. If you like steak, try Logan's Roadhouse across the street. Good food at reasonable prices. We actually went twice. If you're looking for luxury then stay in a Disney property for twice the price.

My family has traveled a lot sometimes staying in really expensive nice places and other times staying in cheap decent places. I have NEVER written a bad review about any hotel before, actually I have never written a hotel review before, but I feel the need to write and warn people. So ahead of the review I do apologize for the length but I feel you need to know everything that we experienced before you make the decision to stay here. Also, before I get into the review I have worked at a hotel before and it was a older one. I know that sometimes things go wrong and the cleaning staff can't get everything. I know how hard our cleaning crew worked and I know how hard our head housekeeper worked to check every single room everyday to give it approval of a good cleaning job. Still even then things got reported. I understand all of these things and appreciate the hard work housekeepers put in everyday. Which makes this review that much more disappointing for me to write. My family and a family friend decided to take a vacation in Orlando over my brothers Spring Break. Unfortunately we only had a weeks notice to make the hotel reservations and we needed a 2-bedroom Suite. I came across this place and the pictures made it look amazing. I thought what a wonderful place but I don't put much stock in photos so I came here and a few other places to check reviews. Like always some were bad and some were great. You always take a gamble with a hotel with several bad reviews that you may end up in the same situation as one of them. We arrived on Saturday with plans to stay a full week. The exterior of the building is really cool and looks nice and even the lobby is very welcoming. The courtyard with the pool, bar, playground, and arcade is very well kept as well. BUT that all stopped when we got to the room. The awe of the place ended as soon as we opened the door. The room was much smaller then the pictures would lead you to believe. It only had 2 TV's and I'm talking about TV's that the late 90's just called about and they want them back. The remote for the living room TV only had volume and channel control with no number buttons. It was very possibly the most pathetic remote I have ever seen but we thought we could live with those small issues. I called the front desk to ask about the 2 TV's and they said that the room was only supposed to have 2 TV's. What 21st century hotel doesn't provide a TV in every room? But again we were willing to just let it go. Then things got worse...much worse. Trying to put some of our stuff away we were looking in the cabinets to see what we might need to buy and what kind of plates and stuff they provided. One of the plates had a mold colony growing on it that I'm sure a scientist would have had a field day with but for a guest in a hotel it was beyond nasty. We immediately took every cup, utensil, bowl, and plate out and put them immediately in the dishwasher. Then we found out the toilet in the master bedroom took about 10-15 minutes to refill with water so it could be used again. I called the front desk for the second time to report the toilet issue. One bright side is they did send someone very quickly. He was at our door in minutes and had the problem fixed in under 10 minutes. It wasn't ideal but we thought we could live with it. But still things just kept getting worse. We went out for a bit to look around and came back to the room to start settling down for the night. I went to take a shower and the water nozzle in the 2nd bathroom was so lose you could move it from side to side and the shower mate had mold all over it and the shower bottom was a bit slimy feeling. I didn't want to put my shampoo or anything in that shower it was just nasty. When I got out of the shower the floor was sticky to the touch but I though it was because I was wet. Once I got dried off I talked to my family and they realized that the kitchen (if you can call it that) floor was also very sticky. We planned to just report it all to the front desk in the morning given how many times I had already called. Because I've worked in hotels, I didn't want to be trouble for them. Then we realized the bedroom door to the 2nd bedroom was so warped it wouldn't even shut all the way. My mom and I both have asthma and we realized that the door jam at the base of both bathroom doors were black and cracking with mold growing which was just gross. That was it, at that point we could no longer just let the issues go. Several of us got online and started looking for places to get us out of this science experiment we were staying in. We found an amazing place that was 3 times as big almost like a small apartment and CHEAPER then this god awful place. The only thing currently keeping me from wishing TripAdvisor allowed a 0 rating is the staff. I called at 1:30 am and laid down our lists of what was wrong. I asked what it would take to get out of the full reservation and he asked if I was looking for compensation or to change our checkout day to the following morning. I told him we just wanted out so he said he would change our reservation. Always being a bit weary I called back in the morning and he hadn't made the change but the woman I talked to was very nice and made the adjustment immediately. Myself and a couple others went out to the parks for the day and let the rest of our party deal with checking out and checking into the new place. Upon elaborating on the multiple issues they gave us an additional 25% discount for the night we suffered through. Things happen I get it. This was a busy weekend so maybe the cleaning crew just did a quick job. But they should have someone checking behind them to make sure the room is acceptable for human use. That room needs to have a serious bleaching and disinfecting before anyone is allowed back in it. My hope is that is what they did after we left but in all reality I know some poor sap looking for a room available ended up stuck in that room. To you, I wish you and your families health the best of luck. Some of you may have okay stays here but don't expect to see results of that \"multi-million dollar renovation\" they say they just completed. I could see signs of an attempt at renovating but it fell very short. I do have to praise the staff or the hotels policy though for letting us out of the week we had reserved. That was the ONLY good thing I can really think to point out to you. I do recommend a place called \"Runaway Beach Club\" because at least the week we registered it was cheaper then Royale Parc and just look it up online and you'll see that it is SO worth it to bypass this place and go straight to where we ended up. It's not but a couple of minutes down the road in the same area. Doesn't have a continental breakfast but it has everything else including 2 pools, a basketball court (with basketballs), a very nice gym, an awesome lake, and the rooms better known as condos/apartments are extraordinary for the price especially since we are here at Easter and paying less then $200 a night. I'll be posting a very positive review for them once we checkout. Everyone has to make their own decision and take their own gamble on a place like the Royale Parc. For some this might be exactly what you want and you're okay with issues. But if any of what I said above worried you then save yourself the headache and disgust and find some other place to stay.

For what we payed we were more than satisfied with the hotel. We had a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom suite. Both of the 2 bedrooms were huge and clean. The living area was also decent size and clean also. The carpet had been redone and was fine. The couch was a little bit hard and not that comfortable. The tile in the kitchen and bathroom are in need of replacement or fixing. All in all the room was fine though, nothing fancy but adequate for our needs and what we paid. The breakfast was fine, lots of choices. A lot of it isn't the healthiest but they had cereals, oatmeal, oranges, apples, yogurt, etc if you wanted healthier stuff. They also had some excellent pastries, including cinnamon rolls, and blueberry muffins which were so soft and fresh. We also didn't care for the boiled eggs, they were very hard and rubbery. I think the problem is that they should keep them in their shells and put them in cold water instead of hot after boiling. Everything else was fine though. And if you want a heartier breakfast, Ponderosa is right accross the street and has a $3.99 breakfast buffet which is pretty decent. We ate breakfast 5 of the 7 days we were at the hotel and found it adequate for us. The pool area and grounds of this hotel are nice and well maintained. The only negative are the elevators seem to take forever sometimes. The pool temperature was nice during the days but chilly at night. The hot tub was nice and warm. The fitness room and computer room were good and never busy. This hotel is in an excellent location. It never took us more than 10 mins to drive to any of the Disney Parks. 7-11 is right beside. Right across the street is Walgreens, Pondorosa, and many other restaurants. There is also KFC, Mcdonalds, etc just down the street. A short drive (5mins) down 192 and you get to target, Walmart, Nike clearance, etc. The Florida mall which is huge is about a 15min drive away. Old Town is right next door and is a fun place to spend a night or two itself. I didn't do any of the rides but it was cool watching the free entertainment like an Elvis impersonator one night. They also have really cheap, cold, draft beer there. I would definitely stay here again. For the price that I paid, it was comfortable, clean, safe, and an excellent location.

Although not ideal - as we could not unpack that night - we reluctantly agreed that we would move the next night to a Deluxe room. When we arrived in our room - there was no cot for our daughter - something I had specifically arranged in advance of our visit. After 2 telephone calls to reception and well over 40 mins wait the cot eventually arrived. They guy hung around for a tip but he sure wasn't getting one that night! The cot in any case was old and creaky and had a thin cheap mattress - wrapped in a full size bed sheet - luckily we had bought some of our own bedding!. When we moved rooms the next day - they again forgot to move the cot along with our luggage - again many phone calls and a long wait before it turned up. Speed of response isn't exactly a priority at this hotel! With regard to the rooms - we failed to understand why the \"Deluxe\" suites were so called. We had a more comfortable (King Size) bed in the normal room - having 2 double beds in the Deluxe - which were too small and uncomfortable also! The fixtures and furnishings have been upgraded in the rooms - but the renovations were superficial. The kitchen and bathroom areas were old and shabby. Kitchen worktops were stained and marked and we had trouble opening the dishwasher every day. Towards the final days of our stay - we were disturbed by loud drilling and banging noise around 11:00 am when our daughter was having her nap! I phoned up reception to find out what was going on and was informed that there were builders replacing tiles in the room next to us - and that they would be finished soon. They were still at it when we left a few hours later! I had been told that renovations were complete but obviously this is not the case. As mentioned in other reviews \u2013 the cleaning staff leave a lot to be desired. It was pot luck every day whether we would get new toilet paper, dishwashing powder, creamer etc left for us. There was a thick layer of dust under the TV\u2019s for the entire duration of our stay. That brings me to my other complaint! The website advertised that there were flat screen TV\u2019s in both bedroom and living room \u2013 no such luck! The TV\u2019s were bog standard, cheap and old! Breakfast was also below par. I know it was free but they could at least make an effort to have something cooked and something healthy. All there was every day were high carb pastries, waffles and muffins! I would have preferred to pay less for the hotel and use the money to go over the road for a $3.99 all you can eat breakfast at one of the diners on Hwy 192 \u2013 as least they had some variety there. To cap it all \u2013 when we checked out we were charged $2.50 per day for use of the in-room safe! We argued that we hadn\u2019t even used the safe \u2013 but were told it was policy to charge everyone for the use of it.

First, the positive.... The customer service was excellent. We had requested a top floor when booking online and received it upon arrival without asking. The front desk accomodated an invoicing request with no questions asked. Positives cont... As the other reviews suggest, there have been some upgrades. Not as extensive or thourough as one might expect. For example... New furniture, new mirrors, new carpet, new paint, new front entry doors, new tub surround paneling, new bedding, and new drapes. No upgrades were given to the tv, water fixtures, countertops, cabinets, dishwasher, sinks, moldings, caulking, toilets, shower heads/faucets, tile, or interior doors. This leads me to the negatives, which unfortunately if your a picky clean freak like me will take the remainder of this review to explain. First off, the caulking throughout the entire bathroom tub surround, toilet surround, sink surround had mold all over it. (Nasty) The tile on the floor was old, had paint splatters and was cracked in some spots. The bathroom door frames nearest the shower had black mold spores all over it. The cieling fan was extremely inefficient and filthy with dust and debris. The Towels that were delivered were appropriate size for my two year old, but not for the average male or female. (You will go through the towels with this in mind) Do you like stained bath towels? I certainly do not, but Quality Inn maingate East seems to think it's OK to provide stained bath towels to there guests. Hair ladened towels also seem to be the new trend at Qulaity Inn Maingate East. For new carpet, they sure do not maintain it. My white socks were black by the end of the night. The mini fridge was wobbly and filth around the handle. This handle on the fridge had a crust on it that a college dorm room mini fridge wouldnt develop in 2 semesters worth of parties. The windows in the bedrooms were filthy, rusting, and peeling. The wall around the windows was painted but you could tell there was bubbling(water damage that was painted over). They still do not have flat panel tv screens in the rooms, like there website touts(coming soon I guess). The dust and filth under the TV's suggest that it had no been cleaned since the inception of the new furniture within the rooms. The Toilet brush must have been broken, because underneath the rim of the toilet (not that I routinely look, but something caught my eye) there was build up not worth descirbing that had built up to a disgusting level. As one might guess, the cleaning staff is probably overworked and underpaid and under appreciated, becuase their mentality for clean is quick, and superficial. (The running theme here is- You get what you pay for). Now, on to the continental breakfast area and choices given for your morning pick me up. As one review suggested and I will have to plagairise due to the accuracy of it, \"1) The continental breakfast was sub-par. Now, I have never been one to criticize a free breakfast, but this was by far the worst I have ever encountered. Anything involving a huge vat of boiled eggs and a huge vat of canned peaches...draw your own conclusions. Basically carb-laden and impossible to eat healthy.\" The area around the breakfast selections were infested with some kind of little insect. The web site and management will tell you that there will be a breakfast buffet with eggs and pancakes, basically the works as part of the upgrade to the hotel. They have some real polishing to do before this will ever take effect. The free \" Happy Hour,\" was over run and understaffed. If you were the only person there you might have gotten two drinks, but because they advertise this as being free, like anything else, people will come. Note: to Quality Suites Maingate East, \"Properly Staff your happy hour/ Bar.\" Also, there was a stench of stale beer within the confines of this bar. Very unsatisfying and hard to relax with a smell like this. The Free Wi-Fi was under repair and after reading previous reviews, sounds like a constant problem for the staff. We had intermittent connections at best. Nothing replaces a hard line connection, maybe the next time they do their so called renovations they can hard wire the rooms. On that thought, the outlets in the rooms were barely attached to the wall. The outlets were worn out and in need of repair and cleaning to say the least. As part of a renovation, you would think attention would be paid to details like this. They would be a good candidate for a \"Flip this Hotel\" show similar to the \"Flip this House\" show already a hit on TV. The hotel was cleaned up superficially, renovated minimally, and the shortcuts were obvious. I do not recommend this Hotel.", "Date": "February 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cOne Word - BEDBUGS\u201d", "Author": "Winue", "ReviewID": "UR13087889", "Content": "We had booked a one week trip to this hotel. We were there for two nights, and on the second morning, found 2 BEDBUGS in our 2 year olds bed. We know these were BEDBUGS as we work in a field where we need to deal with them, and confirmed it online. We kept the 2 BEDBUGS in ziplock bags as proof to management. I went down at approx. 7:30am, and found the customer service rep. When I showed him the bags he was disgusted, and did not want to even touch the bags. He only offered us THAT night for free. We made it clear that we had wanted BOTH nights for free, as we would have SLEPT WITH THE BEDBUGS the other night, just didn't find them then. This rep. said we had to wait until 9am when management arrived. We went back to our room and started packing, shaking out all out belongings, although knowing how BEDBUGS travel through vents, etc, that we were very likely to take them with us hidden somewhere in our belongings. We called the DISNEYWORLD RESORT, and told them the issue, and they found us a room. At 9am, I went back to the lobby to meet the Manager, Melissa. The rep. had told her that I was coming, and she was aware of the situation. She had assummed that I had just wanted to check out, and said that the other staff had given us the last night for free. I explained that our entire visit of the 2 nights should be free. Manager Melissa stood there and argued that she couldn't give two nights free. As I continued to explain that JUST BECAUSE WE DIDN'T FIND THEM THE FIRST NIGHT, THEY WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM WITH MY 2 YEAR OLD. Manager Melissa stood there silent staring at me, waiting for me to accept the one night free, and PAY FOR THE FIRST NIGHT FOR BUNKING WITH THE BEDBUGS. Manager Melissa stated that she wanted to have the BEDBUGS in the BAG. I HAD TO THREATEN TO TURN AROUND, SHOW THE LIVE BEDBUGS TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE LOBBY AND IN THE FREE BREAKFAST ROOM. All I wanted was a total of zero on my total. She grudgingly did this as long as I gave her the bags with the BEDBUGS. I provided this to her, and shared my HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS to others while leaving the building. Sure, the place looks nice, but we would suggest doing some research on BEDBUGS before going. They bite, and the have a long life. They spread like crazy, and they are a HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERN. After, we stayed at the Coronado Springs Resort at DisneyWorld, and would stay onsite again.

Yes | No\u201d link at the bottom of this review. This will encourage me to write more reviews!) My wife and I, both in our early 30s with no children, stayed at Royale Parc Suites in Kissimmee, FL (yes, this is the same hotel as Quality Suites Maingate East; the name has been changed slightly), from Jan 4th - 13th, 2008. I will attempt to make this review as thorough as possible with the hope that it will help you understand how much we liked this place! I believe you should know our travel history before reading my review, as this will help put this review into perspective. My wife and I have been fortunate enough to be able to do a large amount of domestic traveling, and we have stayed at inexpensive hotels (Econolodge, La Quinta), mid-range Bed and Breakfasts, and higher priced hotels, such as a beautiful $400/night V-Suite at TheHotel at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (due to a free upgrade)! So, I think it's safe to say we've experienced all types of accomodations! With our background in mind, I'll first list all of the complaints that we had with Royale Parc Suites over 9 nights: 1. Our fridge was a little wobbly. Ok, that's it for the complaint list. Now on to the good stuff... As of the time I am writing this review, this hotel is ranked #24 of hotels in Kissimmee (on Trip Advisor). This hotel will go UP this list fast... We had originally planned to stay at #9 on this list, Comfort Suites Maingate (due to a great past experience), but we found a ridiculously good price for Royale Parc Suites, and after reading multiple good reviews online, we decided to give it a try. Our overall experience at Royale Parc Suites was GREAT! We checked in after midnight on Friday, Jan 4th, and the front desk staff was awesome. The guy who helped me actually said: \"I see you have requested a king bed suite, and we have one available for you.\" This was a surprise, as usually this type of request goes unnoticed at hotels\u2026and we usually have to re-request this verbally when we arrive! Our room was a 1-bedroom King Bed Suite. The room was very large, approximately 600 sq. ft., and very nicely decorated, CLEAN, and NEW (due to a recent multi-million dollar renovation)! We had a separate living room with a couch (pulls out to a bed), T.V., table with 4 chairs, air conditioner, and closet. There was also a kitchen area (off of the bathroom) with a small fridge (which actually froze one of my drinks before we turned it down!), microwave, burner, dishwasher, coffee maker (w/ coffee), plates, utensils, dish detergent, etc. Our bathroom was actually very large, and there was enough room for the 2 of us to get ready at the same time. And, as a bonus, the shower rod is one of those \"curved\" ones, so it gives you a little extra room in the shower! The bathroom had soap, shampoo, lotion, etc., a hair dryer and towel rack, and plenty of towels (at least 4 or so sets each day)! We never had any problems with hot water, flushing the toilet, etc. The bathroom was extremely clean! Our bedroom was also very large! Our king bed was VERY comfortable, and it came with 4 pillows (+ 4 more hidden in the bedroom closet)! The bedroom also had an air conditioner, T.V., good-size closet, safe, iron, and ironing board. Practically everything in the room was new (with the exception of the kitchen appliances), including the furniture, couch, carpet, and paint. The room was VERY clean....no bugs, no dirt, no stains, etc. We were VERY pleased with all aspects of the room!! Housekeeping was great! We left our room for the day as early as 9am or as late as 2pm, and our room was always cleaned by the time we got back! On to the rest of the hotel... Complimentary continental breakfast is offered from 6am-10am every day in the cafe located off the lobby. Breakfast consists (each day) of coffee, juice (orange, apple, etc.), oatmeal with granola and brown sugar toppings, 2 types of cereals (i.e. Cheerios or Rice Krispies), a combination of 2 out of these 3: danish/muffin/mini cinnamon roll; hard boiled eggs, bagels, waffles, yogurt, and either a fruit, such as apples, or a fruit-cup-like mix. There was seating available inside and outside, and I also saw some people taking food back to their rooms. We made sure to enjoy this breakfast each day! Since we ate so much breakfast, we visted the hotel gym often! The gym has 2 treadmills, a cross country machine, a stationary bike, and 5 weight machines: bench press, ab cruncher, and 3 leg machines. All machines are NEW, with not even a scratch on any of the seats/cushions! There is also a water cooler and clean towels, and 2 thermostats so people like me can make the room as cold as possible! The pool area and landscaping were very beautiful and clean. The pool, bar, hot tub, kiddie pool, jungle gym thing, and game room (with air hockey, pinball, and video games) are all located in the courtyard (the hotel is 5-sided with the courtyard in the middle). There are a ton of lounge chairs, and we never had a problem finding a seat. The pools open early in the morning and close promptly at 11pm each night. Every night, from 5-7pm, the hotel has a \"happy hour\" outside at the bar, and wine, beer, and soda are free (yes, FREE!, but please be nice and leave a tip for the bartender)! I'm not sure what type of beer was on tap, but they offered 3 types of \"Sutter Home\" wine: Chardonay, White Zinfandel, and a red (I believe Merlot). The location of Royale Parc Suites is great! It is located on 192 (W. Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway) in Kissimmee, FL, and it is about 2 miles from World Drive (which is the \"driveway\" to Disney World). Our total one-way driving time to the furthest of the 4 Disney Parks, Magic Kingdom, was probably about 10-12 minutes from the hotel to the Magic Kingdom parking lot. There is a 24-hour 7-11 (with gas station) in front of the hotel, and there are a ton of places to eat (from McDonald's to Arabian Knights) and shop in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. We also accidentally discovered the Orlando Premium Outlets that were less than 15 minutes away, so if you get sick of all the Orlando \"gift shops\", then a visit to the outlets may help! The hotel is approximately 20-25 minutes from the Orlando airport. Also, within walking distance of the hotel (just walk out of the Royale Parc Suites, through the neighboring hotel's parking lot, and you are there) is a place called \"Old Town\", which is basically a carnival/fair atmosphere (but free to explore), with a few rides, games, a bunch of shops, a couple night clubs, and a few places to eat. It\u2019s a cool \u201cfamily fun\u201d place, but it\u2019s also a little weird, as it contains shops that sell knives/swords/smoking equipment (\"for tobacco use only\", according to the sign!), tattoo parlors, and simulated electrocutions. Yes, you read that last part correctly. If you bring a dollar, you\u2019ll understand. Anyway, to sum up my review of Royale Parc Suites, it is a great newly-renovated family-friendly hotel that is worth a visit (most groups seemed to be families with children)! The hotel is very clean (we even saw housekeeping dusting the outside windows of each room, which is something that is often overlooked at other hotels) and we always felt very safe. We\u2019ve read reviews where people complained about the stairwells being a little dirty, but besides the natural \u201cdirt\u201d that is bound to build up on an outside stairwell, the only \u201cdirt\u201d we saw was those left by smokers (there is a no-smoking policy inside the rooms) as many seem to have a problem with discarding their cigarettes correctly\u2026.i.e. throwing them in the trash (however, housekeeping did a great job of sweeping up). Our 1 bedroom suite was very large, and while it was perfect for the 2 of us, it would also be perfect for a family of 4 or 5! And, if you have an even larger family, then one of their 2 bedroom / 2 bath suites may be perfect for you! (As a side note, the hotel charges an additional $2.50 + $.18 tax per night to cover insurance for the safe in the room.) If you are planning a family trip to Walt Disney World, then my wife and I highly recommend a stay at Royale Parc Suites!", "Date": "January 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place...can't wait to return\u201d", "Author": "Don1111", "ReviewID": "UR12607690", "Content": "Great Surprise.

We took advantage of the free breakfast every morning. While we wished there would have been more protein and fresh fruit (mushy red apples) it was adequate for our family. It had previously been mentioned bagels only once a week - we stayed five nights and had bagels offered four of the five. The coffee is great (available 24 hours a day in lobby as well as breakfast). Because of the small window of time, we did not participate in the free happy hour. One downside - it seemed as though we were the only non-smokers staying there. While the rooms are non-smoking, you are bombarded with smoke at the pool. I suffer from asthma and it would be nice to see a non-smoking area at the pool for us to enjoy (we had to move three times to avoid the smoke). Also, they are not very good about pool towels being available. When we got to the pool and noticed there were no towels ( we had exhausted the supply in our room for showers) it took two hours for someone to bring any out after we notified the front desk.

Our only complaint with the appliances was the refrigerator was just \"cool\" but we found if we kept sodas in the freezer they were good and cold.

We were an extended family consisting of four adults, two children (6 and 9), and two teenagers (17, 18) and everybody was content with plenty to do.

I did not report it since I was travelling alone but these kind of problems are really annoying normally. The wireless internet is really not what you expect on a modern hotel today, the connections timed out all the time. I tried to use it to communicate with my family at home. I reported the problems to the frontdesk but they did not seem to know much about this. I was only informed that there were problems \"now and then\" that they were aware of. This needs to be taken care of.. also the fact that you have to re-logon every ten minutes is something we remember from the 90's The hotel is being renovated, I was not disturbed by any noises at all. The pool area and the Tiki-bar is very well kept. The elevators look a bit worn, maybe because of the ongoing renovations.

Paid about twice what you would pay for other hotels in the area and expected some benefits in return- which did not come true. First of all, if you like breakfast to be somewhat like survival training, this is your place. You fight for the food on a sticky floor while kids are hurtling orange juice and chairs at you. Selection is limited- we could not determine what about it was supposed to be \"deluxe\". The hot and cold part only came true after you toasted the stuff three times. Therefore, toasting obviously takes forever. Bagles were only available on one day, the other days only sweet stuff like muffins and danish. A lot of families with 4 and more kids stay here so be prepared for noise and not enough seating. Two mornings we ate seated on pool chairs, balancing the food on our knees. Room service was okay- downside is the room will not be vacuumed daily (therefore, also the floors aren't being cleaned) if you stay 3 nights or more. I don't quite get the logic, but hey. We could live without new shampoo samples, too, would have been nicer to have them, though. If you want new bags for the ice bucket, you have to figure out a way on how to get them. If you do, tell us how you did it, we would be amazed. We had a kitchen (which is nice) without cutlery (which is stupid). On our fist night, we tried to get Soda out of one of the vending machines. One did not work right and when it finally spit out a bottle of Coke, it was absolutely stale. The machine one floor below was jammed with coins so you could only use bills. When we mentioned it to the front desk, they did not really respond- it took them more than 12 hours to put up signs that the machines were out of order- does not reall solve the problem, either. Neither were we offered a refund for the undrinkable bottle. Thank heaven for 7-11 which is right next to the hotel- they sell decent Coke. Be careful, as well, 2,50 per day is charged for the safe, whether you use it or not. Only nice part is the open bar from 5-7pm every night. However, it does not make up for all the other little disappointments. Maye to you this sounds as if we're difficult travellers, but we really are not picky.

We booked a 2-bedroom suite. The hotel management impresses me so much that I would do myself a disservice if I did not write this review. At the point when I was considering booking this hotel, I wrote in to them to ask about the conditions of the rooms, having read all the bad reviews. To my surprise, I got a reply immediately from the various department, the Sales and Marketing, Housekeeping, Front Desk. Everyone was so keen and reassuring. We were promised a newly re-furbished room with good view of the Courtyard and that was exactly what we have got. Check-in - Checking-in was quick and hassle free. General - The suite was clean and tidy. The carpet was newly laid and clean. The sofa in the living area was also new. During our 7-day stay, we did not experience any noise or disturbances due to the renovations. Location - Just 1 mile away from Walt Disney World (WDW). Perfect for us as we spent 7 of our 7days there at WDW. BedRooms - Both bed rooms are spacious. Beds were firm and very comfortable for 4 person in each room. Kitchenette - Fully equipped with Fridge, Dish washer, coffee-maker, cooking utensils, cutlery, dishes, cups, plates and even dishwashing liquid! Useful for us as our children needed supper and we could prepare night snacks for them. Bathrooms - One is attached to one of the bedroom, the other is a common bathroom. Both bathrooms has more than enough towels for all of us. The hairdryer was perfect for us. The toiletries include Shampoo, conditioner, lotion and bar soap. This has saved us a lot of luggage space. Pools - We did not use the pool at all during our stay there. We did had our happy hour drink once. It was great !! Transportation - We did not rent a Car in Orlando, so we needed to commute by the free shuttle provided by the hotel to and from WDW. However, there is no return shuttle in the afternoon. It would have been nice if there is a return shuttle in the afternoon, say around 1, 2 or 3pm. During my stay there, the earliest return trip from WDW was 7pm. Fortunately, there is a Lynx 56 that goes to and fro WDW, running at half an hour interval. The bus stops were along the main road just outside the hotel, about 5 minutes stroll away. Breakfast - Adequate for us. There were bagels, bread with butter, jam, philly cheese, Danish Pastry, hard boiled Eggs, Yogurt, Waffles with maple syrup, Oat, juices, cereal with milk, coffee and tea, fruits such as oranges and apples. What more can you ask for ? I would like to thank Ms Diana, Mr John, Mr Thomas, Mr Aaron and your team at Royale Parc Suites for making our stay there so pleasant and memorable. I will definitely return if I were to visit Orlando again.

The other drinks I ordered were not watered down either like other places-they were good. The hotel seems to cater to families, my daughter made a few friends in the pool. The pool also supplied rafts & inner tubes for them to play in while we were there. Pool did not seem heated like they said it was- very cold.

Never heard back that night, and never bothered calling about it again. Definitely not a place to stay if you're on business. Because it's cheap, different crowds come and go. Our first day the pool was taken over by college students, who didn't really make room for the kids. The second day busloads of jr high students invaded, running down the hallways and screaming with no adult leaders in sight. Complained to the front desk and they quieted down quickly.

Major plus: the suites. If you are going with kids, it's great -- one kingsize double for Mum and Dad and one separate room for the kids. Two TVs (but one is in Mum and Dad's room! What?! Give it to the kids), two bathrooms, mini-kitchen, plenty of room, good maid service. The downside is that the hotel is trying too hard to be a three or four star when it is not. All rooms are accessed from the cement outsides, accessed by dirty lifts and back stairs, so it has a bit of a motel / Butlins feel to it. It looks great when you first arrive -- nice pool, palm trees and the like, but it feels a bit more steggy when you have been there a few days. When we went, it was packed and everyone is shoe-horned in. The breakfast is not a happy experience. You can't get a table, and it's pretty low quality; my kids just didn't want to have the breakfast at all and were thrilled when we decided to miss it on the last day and go to a proper hotel for breakfast. No major complaints -- this is a perfectly OK hotel and yo are paying for the pleasure of having the suite. But there is no question that you can get far better hotels, if you don't want the suite, for cheaper inside Walt Disney World.

Overall, it is exactly what it claims, a nice hotel. I booked the hotel direct (got a cheaper rate direct than through the online agencies) after reading all the trip advisor reviews. Both good and bad reviews are somewhat correct, and after being there, I can see their varying points. On the bad notes, a few spots could use a good pressure washing/cleaning externally, whereas, the rooms were exceptionally maintained considering the immense amount of people that move in and out of this hotel daily, it is large (large, high traffic rooms can also give you some expectations of wear and tear, especially since I understand this a favorite spring break hotel, but nothing more than a ding in the frig or a bare spot of paint, nothing disastrous in my opinion). Whereas the good reviews are correct, as I never used my vehicle until we ended our stay, everything inclusive or within close walking distance (Walgreens/Restaurants/Publix Grocery, etc., within a block). Since there are a number of reviews that state some of the obvious things, let me state, this is a nice \"hotel\", if you are expecting a resort, I suggest checking with the many resorts in the same area, some of which are extraordinarily lavish. Otherwise, if you are looking for a nice, prompt, helpful staff, with a LARGE room with separate bedrooms for two couples to split the cost, usable kitchen, and an endless supply of entertainment by watching the various crowds around the pool and bar at night, and anything your heart can desire within walking distance of the grounds, then stay here, you won\u2019t be disappointed. With enough being said about the property, I thought I would mention some hints for those that choose to stay at Main Gates East. First, the shuttle is free, and only once was dead on time, but then again, was never more than five minutes late. Literally, with all the various stops, still only 15 minutes max ride time from everything. Every night, it seemed we had a different crowd returning to the hotel. Before you freak out, if you ride to the park in a small shuttle/van, a larger bus comes back for you, so do not call the company requesting two buses, a larger one will arrive, they have experience in this, they won\u2019t leave you stranded, although you might stand on the ride home if there is a big crowd. But, I must admit, in our 6 days, one day, we took a van ride with a lady driver who gave us more thrills in her driving ability than any Disney ride, and the last day, our bus driver decided to remove the mirror from the bus next to us at the Disney toll booth, which caused a minor delay and I think got him a traffic ticket. Also I might mention the buses/shuttles/vans pick up people for about 5 hotels in the area. Quality East is always the first stop going, so you are guaranteed a seat, and generally the second stop returning back from Disney or wherever. I also might mention, in my little corner of the world, my culture considers it rude when you walk up to the arriving bus and jump in front of the people that has been waiting, but I digress. It does have a single going and return times for Sea World and Universal. For Disney, there are four or five trips leaving in the morning, and 3 or 4 returning at night, and the 7:30pm return was always the busiest for us. Other hints, never use the 1-800 number on the website. I literally stayed on hold for an hour, and then it finally hung up. Use the 407 number and you\u2019ll get someone polite and get them instantly! As far as the breakfast, it is exactly as you have read. Those accustomed to eating in buffet restaurants will find it lacking, whereas those that have stayed in a Holiday Inn Express will find it bountiful. The only crowd issues is when a youth group or sports team check in and all hit the place at one time, otherwise, no problems, and even if so, do as some did, carry it back to your room! Internet access is available, but with the hotel capacity rising, the more people bring their laptops, and loosing signal is quite frequent, if doing something online, save as you go! Smoking is prohibited in all the rooms, but there seems to be a congregation of smokers that hang over the balcony every night. There are smokeless ashtrays located in every corner/floor of the building, but to keep from smoking out the people getting on the elevators, I might suggest bringing your own ashtray if you smoke. I am the only person in our group that does smoke, so I am not being hypocritical if I ask smokers to please not use the balcony as their ashtray, as this is what gives the bad reviews of the floor condition, there are ashtrays available, please use them! From my perch on the 5th floor balcony, I did find it quite interesting to watch families with small children enjoy the large heated pool/hot-tub and game room while sharing courtyard space with the 70+ year old inebriated golfers in speedos at the bar, but the hotel security does take their jobs seriously and I never noticed any problems whatsoever. Also, they patrol the parking lots, so high marks on roving security guys! The concierge desk is helpful, but if you don\u2019t pre-purchase Disney tickets ( I recommend this highly), they are awful quick to offer you a breakfast tour of a local resort/condo for reduced prices. I literally hate condo tours for timeshare, but it literally saved us $400, so I went for the two hour breakfast, was honest with the salesperson that she wouldn\u2019t be getting a sale that day, and the process was semi painless for the cost savings. But the desk was helpful with printed driving and walking directions to anywhere we wanted to go, and once you agree to do a timeshare tour, you instantly become their best friend and are extremely helpful. Be warned, $2.50 for a 20oz Pepsi in the gift shop, and $0.80 for two $0.24 postcard stamps, so avoid the ridiculous prices by simply walking across the parking lot to the adjacent 7-11 to the property. And, if driving, the entrance is between a gift shop and the 7-11, so look closely or you'll miss it! I hope some of this helps and you didn\u2019t consider it too much of a ranting. Would I stay again? Of course, and I\u2019d recommend it to any of my friends because most of my friends are value conscience, and this place exceeds standards to any economy listing. And, to me, just being first the first stop on the shuttle is worth any price differences from any of the immediate competitors to the area. Also, the coffee in the lobby is great. I don\u2019t drink, so can\u2019t comment on the free beer or wine, but as in the prior reviews, the cups did look 12 \u2018ounceish\u201d. Hope that helps! If you want the Gaylord Palms, go there. If you want a nice, clean place to stay during a vacation or business visit to Disney, you won\u2019t be disappointed, a lot of bang for the buck!", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, NY", "Title": "\u201csomewhat acceptable, but nothing great.\u201d", "Author": "Eileenp65", "ReviewID": "UR7199922", "Content": "I'm currently staying at the hotel on a family trip to Disneyworld. I have been to Disney between 15-20 times in the last 10 years. Most of the time we stay on site with The Contemporary being our favorite, but this trip we needed a suite. I will try to make this short- PROS: 1- If you get a good rate (under $100) I would considerate it a moderate value. 2- It is close to all theme parks & many restaurants 3- The free buffet breakfast is acceptable and comparable to Holiday Inn Express with only cold items & the ability to toast mufins, bagels, waffles, etc. there's yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal, juice's, semi-decent coffee. etc......I have found that at any time of the morning, you have a hard time finding a seat. 4-The free beer/wine from 5-7 pm is nice, but some people drink too much & the atmosphere changes. CONS: 1-Small bathroom for a suite and the toilet is not separate from the shower/dressing area. So if someone is in the shower or getting ready, you're out of luck. 2-The elevators are somewhat slow & smell bad by the end of the day. 3- Outdoor corridors. 4- Housekeeping can be somewhat dissapointing even with a $5 daily tip................. 5- There's no place in the bedroom to get ready ( no dresser with mirror), so once again, if the bathrooms tied up, you're out of luck. 6-Pool maintenance is not frequent, so it is dirty more than it is clean. 7-Water (for showers) is not always hot, especially after 4pm and especially when your room is on the opposite end of the building from where the boiler is located. (That explanation is suppose to make you feel better???) Although it doesn't make your water hotter. 8- The blankets are old & some even have holes. 9-There is no other food available here after breakfast, you can drink, but you can't eat. 10- make sure you get a room that has never had pets if you don't like the smell of cat urine.( My sister's first room was like that, although they were able to change it immediately at her request). I must say management did try to address & resolve complaints in a speedy fashion, but they weren't always able to fix problems immediately ( no hot water for bath at 4pm, after 11 year old child had been puking all day).

We were looking for a nice vacation, close to the Disney parks (but did not want to stay directly in Disney). Qualtiy Suites was in the perfect spot! The hotel is located on International drive, which is on the main route through Kissimme. This location has much to offer...many restaraunts of all price ranges and varities, tons of shopping, entertainment and very easy to get around. Location was great! We booked a poolside room, which was promoted on the website as \"new\". The original room we were given did have some problems, but as soon as we notified the staff, we were moved to a much nicer room in a better location. (The toilet was water was \"running\" constatnly, the phone didn't work, and the safe needed to be reset). My only concern was that I questioned why we were originally given a room with problems, when there was a perfect room in a better location available for us the whole time??? **Perhaps a suggestion that the hotel staff - please check out the rooms a little more carefully prior to new guests arriving....we were happy in the end, so no problem! The room was big! 2 big bedrooms with nice comfy beds, plus a kitchenette, living room, and 2 bathrooms. Everything was very clean and looked new . The room was cleaned quite well each day with lots of towels and pillows. Breakfast was free and there was something for everyone. Coffee, Juice, cereals, muffins, toast, waffles, and a little fruit too. There was a lot of people eating in the cafe, but also many who took the food back to thier rooms or ate poolside... Speaking of poolside...who doesn't enjoy free beverages by the pool each evening from 5-7? It was a lot of fun having a drink, watching the kids swim, and meeting other guests from around the world. I thought it was a very nice little bonus that this hotel has a free happy hour. Nice pool with lots of surrounding palm trees! Good experience over all, and great location.

Minuses: Noise from pool area. Rude and unruly guests late at night. Room smelled like chicken soup! Shower and sofabed needed updating. Overall Recommendation: Nothing luxurious or exotic, but quite adequate and functional. Not spotless, but fairly clean. An excellent value and choice for families who don\u2019t want to be squished into a small room. However, even though we loved the roominess of the suite, unless the management addresses the excessive noise issue, I am not sure we would stay here again. General comments and info: Kitchenette has a few basic dishes, pots, tableware, coffee pot. Overall, the hotel is a bit dated, and our room was in need of updating \u2013 particularly the shower \u2013 which was rather shabby \u2013 and the sofabed, which was stiff and uncomfortable for sitting. I imagine it would have been very uncomfortable if we had needed it for sleeping. Free beer, wine, soda from 5-7 pm located near the pool was nice, and did not seem to detract from the family atmosphere of the area. Free breakfast buffet \u2013 nothing special, but handy nonetheless. I cannot comment on the shuttle service as we did not take advantage of it. Overall I\u2019d say the hotel was mostly clean, thanks to the staff who worked hard to keep up the public areas (walkways, pool area, breakfast room) etc. But over the course of our 3-night stay, it was not uncommon to find walkways and especially the elevator areas littered with cigarette butts, small trash, etc. Because all of the rooms surround and overlook the pool area, they are subject to a lot of noise. In our 2-bedroom suite, the back bedroom was noticeably quieter, but it was very noisy in the front bedroom that faced the pool. Early in the day, this is not a big deal, but at night, the pool is open until 11 \u2013 which made it very difficult for the kids to get to sleep. Our last night the noise was worse \u2013 and quite noticeable even in the back bedroom. The pool closed at 11, children were running up and down the walkways literally screaming and screeching until midnight and later. I called the front desk to complain and was told they could not kick the guests out. I said that I was not asking to have the guests removed \u2013 just for someone to demand that they not make such a racket so late at night. By 12:30 a.m., things had improved.

We probably shouldn't have moved since the only material difference was the size of the fridge, one more tv, and vcr/dvd - but it was very nice of the hotel to offer this free upgrade. The pool is a nice size and the kids loved it - we stayed at Disney's All Star Resorts 2 years ago and I had trouble keeping an eye on my kids in the massive pool - this was much better. The bar is located near the pool - free beer, wine and sodas from 5-7 p.m. - but this did not detract from the family atmosphere. The room was very nice -no issues here - it was clean, comfortable, and included a safe which aptly stored my laptop - my one and only complaint is that if you don't know where to get the shuttle to Disney, you're in big trouble - as we were. When we checked in, we were not told that you have to pick up the shuttle at the side of the building. Having gone on many tours across the US with hotel pickup, I naturally assumed that we would be picked up in front of the hotel. When the shuttle sailed by us, I went to the front desk to check - and we had been waiting in the wrong place! The front desk personnel called them to return. I looked at the shuttle times information sheet I had been given the night before - perhaps I had missed seeing the pickup site. Nothing was mentioned. I looked out front of the hotel. No signage in place regarding shuttle pickup. COME ON! I was informed that I should have been told when I checked in, which of course, I was not. At any rate, we did a wild goose chase to get picked up and to make the story a little shorter, it wasted a good hour of our time. Cedric was very helpful in resolving the problem, even said that he would have taken us himself if we hadn't gotten picked up, and stated that the signage problem needed to be addressed. Quite frankly I would be surprised if there would be any signs out front today. There is a little plaque in an interior hallway stating shuttle pickup, but unless you were walking down that way, you wouldn't see it and wouldn't know. This must be rectified - something so simple but so upsetting to travelers and soooooooo easy to correct. Comparing the All Star Resort to this property, I would probably stay here again. It's much nicer with 7 people to have a 2 br suite at a lower price than 2 separate rooms, the shuttle isn't bad IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO GET IT! - I would like to see a later pickup time added at 11:30 so that you can stay until the park closes instead of having to leave early to make the shuttle.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brandon, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay!\u201d", "Author": "Eagmommy", "ReviewID": "UR5337533", "Content": "I recently stayed here in a 2 bedroom pet suite with my three kids, a friend and her two kids.

We had stayed here when we visited Disneyworld five years ago and returned again after reading the current reviews on TripAdvisor. One of the key factors in selecting a hotel is knowing what level or class of hotel you want or need. If you choose a 2 or 3 star hotel expecting 5 star service, you'll probably be disappointed. If you select a 5 star hotel, your expectations should be higher, because you're paying for that level of service and amenities. This hotel is rated a class 3 by TripAdvisor and we found it to be an excellent choice for our family. Is it a perfect hotel? No, it's not, but management is actively working toward that goal. In all the reviews I read on hotels outside the park in Kissimmee, Orlando and Lake Buena Vista, this is the ONLY hotel whose management took the time to respond to customer reviews on TripAdvisor, whether positive or negative. My impression is that this hotel is truly interested in hearing about customer issues and very concerned about improvements to its service and facility. Would we stay at this hotel again? Absolutely! The location is perfect - just a couple of blocks from the intersection of I-4 and Route 192. Literally only ten minutes from the hotel parking lot to Disney's, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning. Excellent selection of restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel - Bennigan's, Logan's Roadhouse, Ponderosa, just to name a few - and within easy walking distance of Old Town. When we were there, Ponderosa was offering an extensive hot breakfast buffet for $3.99, which is terrific if you're looking for more of a hot meal than the hotel offers. There's a great Publix market just across the road, which was handy for keeping the fridge stocked. Our room, a one-bedroom suite on the fourth floor, opened onto an outdoor walkway, which overlooks the courtyard, as I believe all rooms do. The room was exceptionally clean and always well-stocked with towels. It had been updated fairly recently and was in excellent condition. Perhaps there are other rooms in the hotel in need of refurbishment, but if this is a concern to you, you can always contact the hotel to inquire. As another hotel guest had mentioned in their review, one of our air conditioning units was a bit noisy, but we solved the problem simply by lifting the lid of the control section to stop the rattle. The pool and playground are located in the private, open courtyard - away from traffic and passersby. The pool is lovely and clean and our two kids (ages 11 and 7) spent many happy hours there. During our stay, we saw members of the hotel staff cleaning the walkways around the rooms, but the stairwells remained dirty. Part of this, I understand, is because all the walkways are exposed to the elements and people can easily track dirt onto the stairways from outside. However, I believe most of the problem lies with hotel guests who believe that since they're on vacation they have to the right to toss cigarette butts and trash anywhere. The hotel has numerous trash cans and cigarette butt containers around - if more of the guests used them, the staff wouldn't have such a tough job keeping the facility clean. My husband actually witnessed a young child become sick to her stomach in the area of the pool deck and the mother walked casually away from it. We can only hope she was on her way to report the incident to management, but I wouldn't count on it. I'm not saying this hotel wasn't adequately clean - it is. But I can see how difficult it must be for the staff to keep it up. Think how much nicer ANY hotel would be if more of the guests showed consideration for the hotel property and for other guests! One last comment about management response - the last night of our stay, when we were packing up and trying to get the kids to bed early, we had a problem with a malfunctioning lock on the main door. The front desk had someone there within ten minutes, but the problem was not easily solved and it was determined that the lock should be replaced. I called down to the front desk, explained the situation and asked if there were any other rooms available that we might move into for the night, since we wanted the kids to get a good night's sleep before our early departure the next morning. The front desk staff immediately found another room for us and sent a staff member up right away with a set of keys for it. No questions asked - and nothing but a positive attitude about it. So, if you're looking for an excellent mid-class hotel that offers families a terrific location, a free breakfast buffet, a clean, beautiful pool and an active management team, all for a reasonable price, you may want to talk to the folks at this hotel.

Limited television station options. This was not a big deal for us because our days and nights were busy. General hotel impressions: Pool area was clean and attractive. A kiddie pool and a hot tub were also available. All suites faced the pool. The hotel felt safe. Only 1 time during the whole week were we not able to find a parking space very close to our suite. Free breakfast each morning was nice. Pastries, waffles, pancakes, fruit, juice was the norm. Only one morning was there scrambled eggs. Some mornings there were hard-boiled eggs.

Everyone in our group said they thought the beds were comfortable and that they slept well. We also got a good price through hotelportalplus. The entire hotel was full while we were there but it didn't seem overly crowded. The hotel staff were awesome. They let us stay in the pool/hot tub area for awhile after the official closing time which was great for when we got back from the parks late. The cleaning staff always did a good job of our room, they would leave our stuffed animals propped up on the bed so that they looked like they were watching TV. The kids loved that! They had security guards that would come and chat with us once in awhile. It was nice to know that they were around. The front desk staff were quick to deal with any concerns we had. The free breakfast was more than enough to satisfy the hungry morning people in our group. The location of the hotel is really good too. There are lots of restaurants across the street or at Old Town which is a block away. There is also a Walgreens and a Publix grocery store across the street. There is also tons of places to shop! Try the 250 stall flea market across the street. We didn't rent a vehicle so we relied on the city transit (Lynx) busses. These were GREAT! They run every half an hour to and from the Disney Transportation and Ticket Centre. We used them for every park and for Sea World. We never had to worry about whether we would get a seat or if we missed our shuttle. We bought 1 week passes from the Lynx website for 12.00 each and had them mailed to the hotel.

The second morning one of our toilets overflowed, however maintenance came quickly to fix it and to clean up the mess. The \"heated\" pool was very, very cold but then the weather was a little chilly as well. The hot tub on the other hand was blistering and I had the feeling we were all being cooked in a stew pot! The elevator in our corner was very scary with cracked glass and in general the rooms just needed updating. It was a good location for the price. The breakfast buffet was good. We also saved some money by cooking our own food on the stove, using the fridge & microwave and toaster. There were only about 6 tv stations, so that could also be improved. There was a dvd player, however, and that saved us on the day it rained like crazy. Overall this is a fairly well maintained hotel that needs updating (new carpet, furniture, etc.).

The free breakfast consisted of various beverages, cereals, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, waffles, muffins and various breads, grits, and oatmeal. The eating space was large, but so was the crowd. However, there were tables set up outside by the pool where you could also eat. There were trays on which to carry your food. I was really impressed with the set up of breakfast.

Since I have little kids, and the price and location look good, so I decided to give it a try. We stayed there for a week, right before Christmas. Overall it's just a so-so hotel. First I asked for a quiet room, the front desk gave me one right by the main street. I checked it out and just too noisy. So walking around, I found many rooms on the other side (away from the main street) were vacant. I went back to front desk, and specifically asked for a room over there. They said only one available was right at a corner. Other than that, not much hesitation from them (I told them that I didn't move in). It's good to me, I thought, all I need is a clean, quiet place to rest. This room faces the loft area by the stairway, so no view to the pool, which turned out to be great for me. Since looked like every other day (we stayed for a week, booked 2 month ago), there were some big parties going on by the pool side, till 11-11:30pm. Almost every other room on the floor faces the pool, definetly would be much noisier. But the worse thing was the bedroom floor next to shower room has about a 16\" wide strip area, was soaking wet! And it smells stink! I liked the quiet corner, so just took it. Went to WalMart got a deodorizer, put a towel there everyday, and turn the condition on to cold (de-humid). Looks like a structure problem, walls were wet too. I've asked housekeeper to vacuum it, still wet. The breakfast was good. Quite some varieties. It's the room too small! It has table and chairs outside, but it's cold weather. My daughter never try the pool, too cold, and too tired. Also, first thing I settled in the room was to check the air filter on the condition units. As usuall, they were ugly. So have to rinse them. But I did see on another day, a technician replacing the filters on another floor. Maybe it takes them a year to replace a round. I think this hotel maybe OK for summer time, kids can use the pools. But a few suggestions to management, since management looks like do listening on the site: 1) make sure carpet is dry and clean. Fix any structure leaks! Wet and stinky carpet just turn people off. 2) stop the loudspeaker in the night, before 9:30. Many people here come with little kids. They need sleep. 3) better changed to light color carpet, and use brighter lights. The dark blue color and dimmed lights make the room feel depressing. It's far from the demo picture on your homepage. 4) if you can't get breakfast room larger, lengthen the time. Since management looks like listening to concerns, which is a plus, I may come back, but not after trying out other suites.

When we first arrived I ran to the bathroom to make sure it was clean, and the sink was dirty - the best way to describe it was it looked as though water had backed up in it after someone ashed cigarettes in it, and it left a black-ish film on the bowl (the room did not smell at all like someone had smoked in it though). We called the desk right away and they gave us a different room (we didn't request it) and the second one was fine. The carpet looked very clean and not one bit worn and the couch didn't show any obvious signs of wear. I don't like staying at hotels much because I don't sleep well if it's noisy and this one was not. We didn't hear any footsteps or running in the room above ours, slamming of doors, or loud people in the halls whatsoever. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was also concerned that there was no internet access in the rooms but it turns out there is, you just have to get an access code each day from the front desk, so that was nice.

We were smack in the middle of a bunch of wrestlers (no pun intended) that were very noisy until early in the morning, but when we complained, they comped us a night (which was nice). the happy hour is great, the bartender at the pool Leah is wonderful; the breakfast was great, saved us lots of time and money. The suite was huge, two bedrooms and two full baths, it was very clean and we had plenty of towels. you can't beat the location or the price. the front desk staff was very helpful about restaurants (there are lots of them close by) and helped us make arrangements for one of our party to travel to Sanford Airport. All in all, it was a great stay, Quality Suites is terrific for families.

I read the reviews with trepidation, but we were overall satisfied with our stay. That's not to say that there were not problems, but they were relatively minor considering the good things we experienced. The problems: As was written by an earlier reviewer, there was a water outage at the property on the evening of June 11th. When we checked in, the front desk staff stated it was a city-wide outage, but we found out later that it was limited to just that property. The problem was fixed overnight, so we had water for the rest of our stay (If it was NOT fixed, we would have left the next day for somewhere else). We also had problems with our toilets, which we ended up fixing ourselves. Also, upon checkin, I asked if we could upgrade our room to a 2-br Full Suite per our Choice Privilege membership agreement. The girl at the front desk acted as if she didn't know anything about the Choice Privileges program, and she took my paperwork to the back to \"check it out\" and left me out there for about 5 minutes waiting with my family outside in the pouring rain... I ended up asking the other clerk about the upgrade policy, and she told me it was from a 1-bedroom to a 2-bedroom (they wanted to charge me an extra $50 which was not MY understanding of the way the Choice Privileges worked. It would have been nice to have that extra space, as the room we were in did get cramped, but since we were in the room so infrequently, that was a minor problem). I also asked about late checkout on the day of departure, and they were equally clueless (the girl on checkout said it was limited to availability, but she gave it to me free anyhow after I told her I spoke to a Choice Privilege representative). Apparently the front desk staff need additional training in the Choice Privileges program. Though the pool was great, there were not enough towels in the evenings, so we had to hoard towels during the day to have some in the evening when we returned to swim. The Good Stuff: The Pool was nice, the kids enjoyed using it in the evenings after a long day of theme park adventures. The Hot tub was great for feet soaking after a long day of walking. The Continental Breakfast was GREAT - it had a wide selection of juices (orange, cranberry, apple), coffee, cereal, oatmeal, toast, waffles, pancakes, English Muffins, pastries, danishes, muffins, fruit (oranges, apples), fruit salad (peaches, pears, apricots, fruit cocktail type stuff), and there were even BOILED EGGS which offered a protein choice. The breakfast alone saved us approx. $30-50 per day in breakfast costs!! The housekeeping staff provided us with adequate towels for our room and they kept us in plenty of soaps, shampoo, coffee, etc. And though they had problems repairing our toilet to our satisfaction, they were quick to respond to any questions or complaints. And ond final thing - my sister needed to consult a security officer due to a problem with one of the other tenants at the pool, and he was prompt and courteous to respond to take care of the situation. All in all, I would stay there again, but the staff need to be trained to know how to handle Choice Privileges customers.", "Date": "June 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTotally positive experience June 8-11, 2005\u201d", "Author": "Sask_tourists", "ReviewID": "UR3576118", "Content": "My mother and I just returned from 10 days in Kissimmee and Disney World. We had a one bedroom deluxe suite. It was exactly as the website pictured. Everything was clean -- bathroom, kitchen, fridge -- plus plenty of towels. The front desk person was cheerful, positive and friendly. We were too late on arrival day for the free poolside drinks but the 2 for 1 drink coupon encouraged us to visit their bar that evening. We had a view of Old Town -from the bedroom window and of the pool area from the front door of the suite. Old Town, incidentally, is great fun; try the instant ancestors photo studio for a great souvenir. The pool was quiet in the afternoon (June 9 and 10) and later in the evening. We enjoyed breakfast around 9:30 all three mornings we were there. Yes, it is busy but we always managed to get a table (just two of us) and ended up sharing the table with two other adults. It was not so busy or noisy that we couldn't enjoy a conversation and relax over breakfast while making new friends. The breakfast is very good -- definately a great value. You can also take the food back to your room, including some fresh apples and oranges to enjoy later in the day. If you want something quieter, there are good buffet breakfasts available within a block or two, for about 3.95 per person. The free wine and beer was enjoyable on the afternoon that we spent at the hotel. It was not busy at all, and we chatted with another family while enjoying a couple of drinks. I had trouble with the key card one evening, and the front desk sent someone to the room within 5 minutes. ALso, the fridge was not cold enough on the first morning. I called the front desk before going for breakfast, and it was fixed and definately COLD when we returned an hour later. All in all, great service. The buses only run in the early morning and return when the parks close. I rented an SUV for just over 100 dollars plus tax for an entire week. Great location. Many good restaurants and buffets are reasonably priced and serve dinner until 10:30 or later to catch the crowds returning from the parks. The buffet across the street serves dinner for 8.95 -- less if you get a coupon for a discount. The only negative comment I have is that someone threw up in the outdoor corridor just down from our room. I didn't report it and obviously neither did anyone else, as it wasn't cleaned up the next morning. However, having said that, the rooms, lobby and pool area were immaculate. It's a good value, friendly, and great area.

Everything about the Quality Inn Maingate East is pathetic. As I write this review on June 11, 2005, all of the hotel guests are experiencing a loss of water that has lasted (so far) five hours. The front desk staff told me that the problem would be resolved shortly, but nothing has happened. When I called the front desk at 6:30, they told me to turn off faucets because they did not want an overflow when the water comes back on. This is par for the course for what could be the worst hotel in Orlando (and I have stayed in many). The hotel management responds on this site with cut and pasted claims that they make every effort to meet guests needs and that they have remodeled the hotel. Well, I came expecting a much better room (given their claims on the website) and have never been so disappointed. The refrigerator is broken, with no switch to control the temperature (see attached pic). And I had to throw out many food items because of them being frozen. As well, the kichen is sub-par and will not work for cooking meals. There is no oven, and just a poor person's plug in two-coil stove. I consider the management to be engaging in misrepresentation of their property in stating that the suites have a kitchen. It is hardly that. As well, I was given a handicap room, even after reserving months in advance, and the shower overflowed every morning. I had to put towels on the floor to swab up all of the water. The carpert is also dirty and the overall feel of this place is of a gothic castle combined with a garbage dump. Oh, the advertised shuttle. It is a bus operated by Carribbean and it runs only once per day (pick up at the hotel in the morning and return from the paks after 8 pm). Also, the hotel staff is unprofessional. On numerous occasions, including once from the airport, they were unable to advise me on transportation.....I was disconnected twice when I asked for directions. Also, on June 9, 2005, a very rude attendant at the \"guest services\" desk asked me to \"not use my suitcase wheels on the floor because we have justed waxed it.\" I picked up my suitcase and then she laughed and said \"fooled you.\" After a long flight, I am not interested in pathetic jokes from an immature attendant. Still waiting on the water and I am not expecting to have it running again tonight.

From my understanding the first week of May is usually quiet in that area so we encountered no problems with noise whatsoever. There were people staying next to us but we did not hear a peep. Upon check in we were greeted very promptly with no wait - took about 5 mins. Since check-in was not until 4pm and we arrived at 1pm they locked our bags in storage area beside front desk and enjoyed the pool area until room was ready. Elevators worked fine - but slow - we were only on third floor so were not opposed to walking. Front desk staff were very friendly & helpful as were staff at the \"attractions\" desk. Our room was very clean upon arrival - perhaps a little\"tired\" looking but can be expected with the amount of people traffic that I can only imagine this hotel sees. Housekeeping did an excellent job cleaning while we were there. Front desk called on second day to make sure all was ok with room- nice surprise. Pool area was busy at night after crowds returned from parks and a little noisey but to be expected as hotel definately caters to family & kids. Pool area clean and tidy - fresh towels, patio bar. Location was great= Publix supermarket across the street (busy street!) along with Walgreens drug store & various retaurants of all types and price ranges. Free shuttle service worked well - we did not rent a car so we were very dependent on this. Arrives as early as 7:45 for Disney and returns as late as 10:30 -check with driver or attractions desk for schedule, picks up & drops off at different Disney theme parks throughout the day and evening. Also picks up at 3 other hotels on the way so total shuttle drive to Disney takes approx. 30 mins. Breakfast buffet was adequate - enough to get you on your way early in the AM. All in all we found it to be \"as advertised\" and definately a step up from a \"Days Inn\" type hotel. I have definatley paid a lot more for much less in other areas of Florida and the US. Besides, we were there to spend time at Disney not relax by the pool or in our room....we were away from 8:30AM not returning back to th Hotel until 8:30PM - some nights 10PM.

Our first room (422) smelled bad, the carpet was really stained, and both bathrooms were dirty (toilets, tubs, and floors). I was so disappointed because the rooms looked so much nicer on their website. The front desk was very kind and gave us another room (416) which was cleaner and smelled better. However, one of the bedrooms was missing closet doors, and the kitchen table rocked a bit, but it felt clean at least. Both suites we were in had shabby sleep sofas. The cushions were completely smashed and it was a good thing we weren't planning on sleeping on them. We covered the sofa with a bed sheet each day just to sit on it. The maid replaced towels and made up the bed, but I don't think he/she ever swept or washed the bathroom floors. The suite itself was very spacious which was a plus, and we had plenty of hot water and good water pressure from the showers. Breakfast was fine. The pool was nice, but not all that \"heated\".

Final bit of advice - if you think you might need to do laundry at the hotel, go to a store to buy your laundry soap and softener. The gift shop charges $1.92 for a tiny box of Tide, and $.35 per dryer sheet. There are six washers and dryers, which are pretty nice and cost $1.50 each per load.

We stayed 10/12 to 10/17. Pros: Proximity to Disney resorts. It only took us 5 or 10 mins to get to any of the Disney parks or Downtown Disney. And of course, at the end of the day, it only took 5 or 10 mins to get back to the hotel. Proximity to restaurants. Rte 192 has every chain and franchise you have ever heard of. If you do not have a car, there are plenty of places to eat within 15 minutes walk east or west along 192. Nice continental breakfast as previously described here. We like to eat in our room so I would take the tray and the coffee caraffe from the room and bring back enough for me, the wife and our 7 year old. Nobody complained as I walked out to the room with my tray piled very high. Nice pool and hot spa. We weren't there in the busy period so the pool wasn't crowded as described elsewhere. We sat with our feet in the spa and enjoyed some cold ones after doing the Disney thing every day. Very enjoyable. Nice Tiki bar. Happy hour is from 4PM until 6PM every day - free beer, wine and sodas. Excellent. Met some great people each afternoon. Friendly staff. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. No complaints. Maid service was very good and we got a newspaper every morning outside the room door. Now the cons: Rooms are a bit tired and although clean, one gets the feeling that they're not because of the old fabrics, carpets, wall treatements, furniture etc. The bed linens were nice and clean though. If this place had a coat of paint and some new furniture, it would have got 5 stars from me. Two mornings in a row there was no hot water. We had to wait a while - apparently some boiler problems which I assume were fixed as the other days were fine. There is no bar before 4pm. After one of the days at Disney, we got back early 2PM ish and decided to sit by the pool. No beer! Walked to the 7-11 next door and bought a 6 pack. It miight be because we were there out of season. Not sure. All in all though, not a bad place!", "Date": "October 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cPoor quality suites Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2624485", "Content": "I was there during hurricane jeanne, the people where rude and poorly trained to handle a problem.

Hotel is hard to see from the road, but once we found it check-in was quick. Two bedroom/two bath was a nice size but very tired. Our room (318) was clean and everything worked. Linens and towels were clean and plentiful. Bathrooms were clean. I wouldn't go to 'spotless' but not a problem. Maid service was good. The furnishings could use some work (broken cabinets, chiped floor tiles, stained chairs, nicked tables, worn burners, loose bathroom door knob, etc). Nothing major ... just beat up a bit. Breakfast buffet was nice. Typical 'continental' items along with toasted waffles/pancakes, hard boiled eggs, and instant oatmeal. Courtyard and pool were very nice and looked recently upgraded. I thought the pool looked very clean and I have one in my backyard but we did not get a chance to swim. To busy enjoying the area. Tiki bar was also a nice touch. We were having a good time until Hurricane Jeanne chased us out of town. All-in-all a fair place if you want a little more space, for a reasonable price, very close to Disney. Just don't expect the Four Season at this price. The rooms are NOT what you see on the internet. If every room got new appliances, cabinets, furnishings and a paint job I would rate it above average.

The pool was dirty, I allowed room service once in the five days I was there and they left my room door ajar. Anyone could have had access to my room that day and to top it off they did a terrible job the room looked just as we left it that morning. The micorwave was inoperable we had no use of a microwave. There was no cable TV. The kids were not having a good stay we were limited to four local channels of which one was a sports channel and the other was CNN. My husband got an eye infection from the dirty pool. I would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family. Of all the hotels I've spent time in vacationing the best that I would recommend is the Sierra Suites. I so regret not staying with them on this trip. That is a mistake I will not make again.

We have stayed at the Polynesian twice and Holiday Inn family suites once and overal we liked this the best. It is great to have some room to spread out (staying at the Polynesian is like staying in a high priced camper). Our room was an upgraded 5th floor 2 bedroom suite with 3 tv's, 2 baths, a mid size refrig, microwave, coffee maker and a blender and 3 large closets with plenty of room to store clothing (on hangers or shelves) and luggage. The room was of modest decor, but was clean and cleaned daily except when hurricane Charley hit (they left a notice indicating that only limited staff was available and they would not be able to clean all rooms). The staff was friendly and responsive when we needed aid. The 4-6 pm free beer and jug wine was great and a tip to the bartender resulted in automatic drinks each time I showed up within eyesight of the bar. The pool area was very clean with nice landscaping, although more lounge chairs would be nice. The pool was noisey and full each night after 9 pm, but we found the crowds small most other times. The continental breakfast was about average. They had coffee, tea, milk, juice, toaster waffels (aunt jamima), muffins, mini cinamon buns, english muffins, toast, instant oatmeal packets, 2 types of dry cereal and oranges each morning. In addition most morning they had a bowl of hard boiled eggs. They also had a large bowl of canned fruit each morning they rotated between peaches, pears and fruit salad.

Nevertheless, our stay with a 2 year old and 5 year old was less than enjoyable. After deciding to forego staying at a nicer hotel in downtown disney vs. having a suite, we were hoping for the best! We figured with a suite, the kids could go to bed and we could stay in the living room and watch our favorite shows. WRONG! TV problems every night, no ability to watch CBS or NBC without it being all noisy and lines going through it. They tried to fix it, but there is something wrong with the hotels cable provider or something. They did very nicely, adjust my room charge, but nevertheless it wasn't the vacation we hoped for (a little alone time to chill and watch TV after being at the parks all day). ALSO, the living room is the closest room to the pool, which has a radio blasting and children screaming until ATLEAST midnight, so forget this hotel if anyone is planning on getting a decent nights sleep in the pull out sofa. Finally, not the cleanest place I have ever been in - bathroom need serious updating and scrubbing (black marks all on the outside of the tub).

Got a decent price. Checkin was quick and efficient. There seemed to be a lot of teenagers -- I guess they were on spring break. They were chaperoned and well behaved. The room is dated with indicators that the hotel, whle well maintaining the property, has not renovated. For example, the bottoms of the doors were chipped and shredded from years of use. The night tables had nail heads pushing through. The bathroom was quite small with little room because the door swept through most of the floor space. The tub failed to drain adequately when showering. There was no wifi available in the rooms -- another indicator of the long overdue need to upgrade. The remote control was weak. The a/c worked quite well. Sleeping was comfortable but a lot of outside noise. The location was superb -- just steps from the subway and Times Square. Check out was a breeze. Because of the dated, worn look, I agree with Priceline with three stars -- average. It's clean with a great location and worth the price.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carmichael, California", "Title": "\u201csimply splendid\u201d", "Author": "pert_11", "ReviewID": "UR126565302", "Content": "From 3/8 through 3/17/2012, I, my daughter and 14 year old grandson, stayed here.

The second day we came back from a day out and couldnt get into our room, we went to reception who said they only has us booked in for 3 nights. This made no sense... why couldnt we get into our room? We never had a call from the man who checked us in. We spoke to the manager who didnt even apologise until we asked her to. We showed her the proof we were booked in for 4 nights and still she didn not believe us. After a long argument she offered is free breakfast for our stay. We then got a phone call the next day to say we were booked in for 4 Nights. The staff were very unproffesional and not very happy to sort this matter out for us. We booked the hotel through get a room.com I will not be booking through them or staying at this hotel again!! Apart from the reception staff the hotel is in a good location in Times Square.

The bathroom was small, but the shower was great, blasting me awake each morning. The room was a bit tired but very clean. It was over \u00c2\u00a3300 cheaper than the next hotel I looked at. My boyfriend insists on a gym with weights, so it limits my choice a bit, but I definitely thought it was better to save the \u00c2\u00a3600 for spending money than have up to the minute decor, but that was my choice. The staff were very friendly and helpful when we needed to ask them anything and they organised a late checkout for us at no extra charge. I would say that the lifts were noisy and although they didn't keep us awake we were aware of the noise, but not sure what they can do about that.

The hotel puts you right in the middle of Broadway, so getting to your Broadway shows is really just one or two short blocks away. The number 1 subway station is also just one block away, so going around via NY subway is also quite convenient. A couple of office buildings around the area make this also quite easy for the business traveler. There are very good restaurants around (but you can say this for most parts of mid-town anyway). There is nothing extra-special in this hotel. The rooms are what you expect a Sheraton or Westin to be -- clean, classic lines, comfortable, functional. I will not say no to staying here again, mainly because you know what to expect -- everything works! You will not get unobstructed views, since the hotel is surrounded by tall buildings from all sides. That is the trade-off for being in the middle of the city. There were quite a few disappointments: 1. the gym is really inadequate --- just a few machines, and one all-around for weight training. 2. The lobby can get quite crowded, and there is hardly any place to sit if you are waiting for guests --- the free wireless internet at the lobby makes it the station for people checking email of checking stuff on Facebook. 3.

Anyway when we checked in we were given free wifi as it was my birthday (have since found out a few people were given this anyway) The wifi didn't work in the room and only in reception, which was a bit pointless as we didn't spend much time in reception. When we got to the room, which was at the end of the corridor on floor 6, we were happy with the size and layout of the facilities. However, after closer inspection the bed sheets were not the cleanest, the bath had hairs in it and the room needed a good clean and quite possibly a good refurb. We also had to get someone to come and sort the safe as it was closed, therefore we could not use it until someone came up. We decided to grin and bear it (the queue at reception also put us off complaining, we had little time in new york as it was) The next day the room was cleaned much better and sheets were cleaner so we got over the initial dissapointment. However this dissapointment returned on the first night when the maid decided to hoover right outside our bedroom at 2am! this happened 2 out of the 3 nights we were there and then on the final night we had noisy neighbours in the adjoining room (to be honest it could of been a lot worse, parties etc but still not very good soundproofing) The location of the hotel was excellent and the bellboys and concierge were very helpful (reception staff, not so much) Overall, we were quite dissapointed with this hotel but not with our trip to New York.

This was our third trip to NY from the UK and we are used to the small and old fashioned style of rooms you get in the city so we were prepared for the same here, however when we got to our room we were surprised and very pleased to see that the room was quite big for New York sizes and modern looking. We did get an upgrade as it was my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday so I am not sure whether all rooms are this standard. The location of this hotel was the big selling point to us, we wanted a central location so being 3 blocks north of times square and 3 west of the Rockefeller was ideal for us. From here it is a 15 min walk down to Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or 2 min walk to Broadway. Check-in was a breeze, we arrived around 17:00 and there was only one couple ahead of us, the girl on the desk was very nice and helpful, as mentioned above we got an upgrade after mentioning it was my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday, however, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this every time, we dropped on well, not all staff members on check-in desks give an upgrade, a $20 tip does help sometimes but most hotel chains are now trying to cut down the $20 sandwich upgrade trick. Room: The room had a big king sizes bed and was really comfy with lots of pillows, we had a flat screen TV on the wall which was nice to relax and watch while getting ready to go out at night. There is also coffee making facilities, however my one gripe with this was they gave us 3 sachets of install on arrival and not re-stocked, I am sure if you ring down they will bring more up but I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly concerned by this. The bathroom the usual, half-tub with shower, sink and toilet, they bubble bath and shower gel provided by the hotel smelled lovely and did the job (these were replaced daily). We had a view out over 52nd St and up 7th Ave towards Central Park, as with everywhere in New York you get traffic noise 24/7 but what do expect from being in the centre of a big city?? We did not use the concierge during this trip but after checking out we waited around the lobby for an hour for our lift to the airport and overheard the concierge helping a lot of people and these guys were super friendly and very helpful. From giving directions to booking taxi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, trips or shows they were doing the lot and all with a smile, so from that experience I would say they are worth a visit. The service with a smile seemed to be a common theme around this hotel and it makes a difference, it made us feel like we were welcome here and that we are being listened too.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Camborne, Cornwall", "Title": "\u201cGood location for New Year but doesn't tick all the boxes\u201d", "Author": "flexible", "ReviewID": "UR122917697", "Content": "You only get one chance to make a first impression and the management/owner of this hotel was sadly let down when we arrived by your staff. We arrived at 18.30 to be told that although we had pre-booked two rooms together about 8 months before they actually wasn't together. The guy on the reception said we could have the two rooms now on the same floor, not together, or if we wanted them together would have to wait for them to be cleaned. We asked how long would we have to wait as we would pop out for something to eat and know when to get back, he went to the back office, came back and said he was waiting for a call and would let us know in a moment. I asked why when you have to check-out by 12 noon and you have this booking are the rooms not ready, he was quite abrupt and rude and said some rooms are ready......he ignored the point completely. Well we stood there and waited to be told what time they would be ready and we waited and waited. Well we could not believe what we witnessed whilst waiting. The most rudest man we've ever seen, one of the hotels concierges.......make a note of his name \"Ronald\", avoid this man and if the hotel has any sense and wants paying guests to recommend or return here get rid of him. A French couple, paying guests mind you, made a mistake. It was due to a breakdown in the language barrier. Well hello Ronald but this hotel will get people from all over the world, and sadly you are employed there to assist these guests....yes they are guests, if no guests then no jobs.....you may want to remember that. Looks like you need to retire as you are past it as no patience or customer service skills whatsoever. You will get guests who annoy you or make mistakes but thats part of the job - deal with it. These people had asked him to book a car for the next day to take them to the airport, which he did. Then they went away a little confused as they'd paid him.....the confusion arose as they'd already paid for a car but actually just needed to arrange the time for collection.........an easy mistake to make if neither sides speaks each others language. They then went back to \"Friendly\" Ronald...........he was so rude to them and went on and on how they had made the mistake and how they should have shown him this particular piece of paper they now had beforehand, no kidding he repeated himself over and over again and was waving the piece of paper literally in their faces, he wanted everyone in the hotel foyer to hear, which we all did, \"You made the mistake.....not me\", over and over again, \"I can refund it, no problem but you made the mistake not me......\" then went over it all again, and again and again, instead of just refunding it. He then called a colleague over and asked him if he spoke french to which he responded that he didn't, that colleague then went to the back office and brought a lady out who spoke to them but not before good old \"Friendly\" Ronald told her it all again, only Ronald did embellish it more now and said how the couple were not listening to him and arguing back, well I beg to differ there old chum as that couple deserved a medal as anyone else would have told you straight, they just stood there not saying a word, the poor woman was so embarrassed we really felt sorry for them and said so to the receptionist staff, who too were clearly embarrassed. I got the impression that this was normal for \"Friendly Ronald\". Well after that long marathan write up you have probably realised that to witness all of that we must have been stood there a while..........oh yes......we were still waiting to be told what time the rooms would be ready.........40 minutes later still waiting. Then the receptionist looked up and said \"One is ready now\"??? Er we weren't actually waiting for it to be cleaned all this time, we could have been out eating all this time. So we went to this one room and dropped the luggage and went out. When we got back the guy on the reception had gone so someone else gave us the other room key and guess what..........the rooms were still not together. Incredibly they were on the same floor which apparently we could have had when we arrived so we waited 40 minutes for absolutely nothing, other than witnessing The Manhattans own floor show starring Ronald. This receptionist guy, meant to get his name but sadly didn't, something like Paoblo or something, could be wrong short guy with glasses, very nice man so helpful and kind and apologetic, he said he didn't know why the first guy, larger bald and miserable had said the room next to the one given to us earlier would have been ours as that was never the case as someone else was in it. But he kindly arranged to meet us the next day to move us to be together, which he did. Thats the kind of staff you need, perhaps he can train Ronald and the other guy. If anyone from this hotel is actually reading this and is really interested in improving the customer experience look at your staff rota for the night of 28 Dec 2011 at 18.30 you'll know to whom we refer. When we got our rooms the next day, location good but not brilliant rooms. Sheets and towels clean, bathroom cleaned but the carpets could do with a really good hoover rather than a quick skim over, the alarm clocks were thick with dust in both rooms. I've stayed in better in NYC. That together with the staff experience has sadly put me off, however if I really want to stay in Times Square and nowhere else available I would go back. Great location for the New Years Eve experience but there again so would some of the hotels be as well. Could have all been so different. Had the pre-booked rooms been ready we wouldn't have had the couldn't care less attitude of one receptionist and not seen the \"All shouting and all blazing Ronald\" in all his glory, such is life eh! I feel sorry for the managers if not aware of this but there again as you get thousands of visitors every year to Times Square for everyone not coming back you get plenty more coming along, so probably not bothered.

They were performing major renovations (much needed) throughout the hotel without shutting it down. The fumes in the lobby when I walked in the door were so noxious, I began coughing and gasping for air and my eyes began to water. When I commented to the front desk clerk, they actually tried spinning it into a positive by suggesting I could get a good high from inhaling. That should have been my first clue, but it only got worse. After checking in I proceeded directly to my room to hopefully escape the construction noise and horrible smell. When I opened the door, there were empty liquor bottles, newspapers, trash and stained sheets thrown around the room and it smelled worse than the lobby where the construction was going on. When I went downstairs to complain, they laughingly apologized that the room was not clean. They told me it was the last room in the hotel that they knew for sure was empty, because their computer system was down. They offered to have the room cleaned if I was willing to wait an hour for the housekeeping staff to return from their break - this was at 1:00AM in the morning. At that point, I refused to take anymore from this dump of a hotel and asked to be \"walked\" to another property. It is standard practice when you have a guaranteed reservation for a hotel to make other arrangements on your behalf if they do not have an available room upon your arrival, but here they refused to honor my request. I then asked to speak to a manager, only to be told there was not one on duty. After pressing the issue, they finally connected me to the manager of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sheraton New York\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sister property two blocks up the street. When I finally got him on the phone, he seemed understanding of my concerns and offered to help if he could. I asked if I could walk up to the Sheraton to meet him in person, because I could not stand the fumes in the lobby for even another minute. He agreed and I walked up the street in the rain to meet him. When I got to the Sheraton, the manager I had spoken to was nowhere to be found. I waited 45 minutes for someone to find him, but he was gone, instead, one of his assistants came out to talk to me. I again asked to be walked to another property. The assistant responded that the Sheraton was sold out. And he would not make accommodations at any other SPG property because all that was available that night anywhere in the city was over $500 a night, which was too expensive. I asked him to come back back down to the Manhattan Hotel with me so that he could see for himself how bad the situation was. He agreed and we walked back together, but even though he vigorously coughed when we walked into the lobby, he tried telling me it wasn't bad enough to merit walking me to another location. After 20 minutes of arguing, while he would not agree to walk me (make the arrangements and cover the costs) he agreed to at least cancel my reservation at the Manhattan and allow me to make my own arrangements at another location, which at that point I gladly accepted. Now here's the real kicker - after all that, it turns out that the Manhattan Hotel charged my credit card for the full price of the room anyway. How is that for service to a SPG Platinum member?

The hotel is literally in the heart of time square and there is something very special when you leave the hotel lobbey and you are bang slap in the heart of one of worlds most famous and exciting places. We could walk to any of the theatres, rockafeller center, 5th Ave, Central Park in minutes - and there were lots of fun bars and some great restaurants of any cuisine you fancied within minutes too. We were in NYC for 3 nights for a special family birthday and the Manhatten at Times Squares comfrotable, clean and spacious rooms, and its truly fantastic location really added to our trip.

The hotel in places was dated for example worn carpets and the health centre changing rooms but this had no effect on my enjoyment of our time in New York.

The previous guest in our second room had tried to tape the drapes closed with electrical tape. The maid who cleaned had left all the tape stuck to the drapes which gave the room a kind of Halloween/horror decor. If you are a traveler who needs to use the lobby for meetings or as a work space, you should stay elsewhere. The lobby here is like a luxury hostel - it has a little bit of marble tile, but a hostel-like atmosphere and very little seating. Lastly, the free newspaper is USA Today. What?? This is NYC - why not the NY Times? Or at least give a choice. In summary, expect very little and you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bergen", "Title": "\u201cNearly perfect\u201d", "Author": "naitS", "ReviewID": "UR119349115", "Content": "It seems this this establishment sparks either pure praise or harsh remarks from the reviewers.

Otherwise, dumpy!\u201d", "Author": "Flyairhost", "ReviewID": "UR119218707", "Content": "The Manhattan at Times Square is conveniently located in 7th Avenue and 52nd street in New York. This is a Starwood property. This hotel used to be called The Manhattan Sheraton but they dropped the Sheraton part. Read the review to find out why. Location: This hotel is located in the middle of everything! Just steps away from the subway, Times Square, Radio City, and everything the typical tourist wants to see while in New York. Lobby: I noticed tons of people in the lobby when I arrived wondering why as it was late. I did notice a line of people waiting and I thought it was for the concierge desk or something. It was for the free internet/computers in the middle of the lobby. The front desk is to the side and a bar/restaurant to the other. Small lobby seems to always be very crowded with people waiting to use the computers. Amenities: As mentioned above, the internet in the lobby is free. However, a charge of $14.95 is added to your bill if you use the internet in your room. Luckily, I was able to get free wireless from who knows where in my computer and did not have to pay for the connection. I've always say it is an oxymoron to charge for the internet connection in the room when it is free in the lobby. I guess it is a convenience fee... we went out and after a late arrival (past midnight) there were tons of people still waiting for computers and seating on the floor in their pajamas with their laptops. Pathetic... Rooms: Very cold feel to them. Everything old is the name of the game!!! Hotel does not offer room service or any other type of amenities that is offered by other Starwood properties or Sheraton hotel. Not even a minibar in the room. In-room coffee machine is available. At least a big flat screen television that worked only during my first two days and went out on my last day for a long time, until my departure. Room size is typical of a New York hotel, not much more bigger than any other one. Plenty of hangers and two luggage racks (which could be a luxury for most hotels) were in the closet. The in-room safe worked fine as well. The bed was very hard and old. I lifted the comforter up and against the light and you could see old \"stains\". It looked like it was washed but I took it off the bed right away.... yuk! Disgusting! On my last day, I went to take a shower and the hot water was out! Seriously, the hot water was just a drip and it was very difficult to take a cold shower. Bathroom: Moldy, smelly, old pink tiles, bad paint job and the kicker, the bathtub seems that they added a tub lining (like those from bath fitters) and they did such a bad job that there was a huge air bubble trapped under it. When I took a shower and moved, I felt this bubble under my feet all the time moving from one side of the tub to the other or up and down. The drain stopper was off the drain and it look very disgusting. Wake-up call: Worked fine and came every day right on time. Service: I barely had any interaction with anyone except with the housekeeper. A nice lady that was talking on her cellphone all the time. She was cleaning the room next to mine. I could hear her in my room and I thought it was the guest or two housekeepers working together. When I went out, I look over and she had one of those headphone style things and she was talking all the time while she was cleaning. This went on every single day.... who needs to speak to anyone that much??? But she did leave extra coffee and condiments and clean the room as requested. Overall Experience: This place only gets an extra star because of the location. Otherwise, Sheraton/Starwood should be ashamed of offering a hotel in such a horrible state. But the price ($179/night) for this location is unbeatable. Needs major remodeling, new beds, new baths, amenities and bring it up to the Starwood standards... otherwise, it does feel more like a run-down hotel in the middle of New York.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cOutdated Rooms, Awful Service\u201d", "Author": "TKHAL33", "ReviewID": "UR119192271", "Content": "For US Business Travelers: Please stay away from this hotel.

You're looking at this hotel because you're on a budget. So before I dive in, let's just establish one thing. You can't pay a budget price and have world class accommodations. It just doesn't work that way. The rooms, though outdated, are big by NYC standards (we specifically booked a handicap accessible room). We stayed at a Marriott in Boston a few nights before, and paid the same rate per night for a smaller room. So that should tell you something. Room size is not an issue here. The lobby is immaculate and they are doing more work on it. It's very classy and updated. The quality of the room is another story. There's outdated wallpaper, light fixtures, and decor. So don't expect a Hilton. Again, you're paying a budget price. This didn't bother us because we knew from reading reviews that this would be the case. We stayed relatively close to the elevators and ice machine. If you can help it, try to avoid this. Every time someone used the ice machine it was pretty loud. Our bathroom was a great size. Just know if you do choose do book an accessible room like we did, the shower head is on a hose and sits lower in the shower than is comfortable for anyone over 5 feet tall. However, you can remove the shower head from the wall and use it accordingly. The bathrooms are so-so. A few rust stains in the sink, a loose toilet seat, and some tile work that could probably be fixed. This is probably where most people would get a bad taste in their mouth. No one likes a dirty-feeling or looking bathroom. Ours did have that feeling, but it wasn't so bad that we were entirely grossed out. It just needed to be updated. The staff was amazing. We didn't have any problems during our stay, other than DirecTV cutting out while it was raining in the middle of the night. The channel selection was okay when it wasn't raining, but we didn't go to NYC to watch TV. So we didn't care. The location is great. Step outside the hotel and look to the right, and you can see where the ball drops in Times Square. There are several subway stops within a 1 to 2 block radius of this hotel that will get you just about anywhere you need to go. Also, you are one block away from Broadway, and just a few blocks from Rockefeller Plaza. We didn't use the pool (ironically, because that's why we booked this hotel). It looked nice though. The bottom line is this: if location and room size are important to you, stay here. If immaculate accommodations are important to you, stay somewhere else.

We never felt like we were in any danger and the city handled the situation very well. My sister was also in town for the games and was in the same hotel. We all know the stories of Bed Bugs in New York and my wife and i and my sister took all the precautions we could to not have any problems. I was on the 22nd floor in room 2204 and had no bites or bed bug sightings. My sister was in room 1001 on the 10th floor and sadly to their horror, found one a day later. I know that the bugs are a real reality in this day and age and are a problem everywhere, not only the Big Apple so i don`t fault the hotel for perhaps having the odd bug issue. What i`m interested in is how they handle the problem and The Manhattan handled it very professionally in my opinion and the were given a new room right away. In regards to some of the other things i have read about this hotel, i would agree with most of it. The hotel is old and it shows. The dust and what not around the room is there,but not a huge deal. The restaurant only seemed to be open for breakfast and there was no room service. The beds are good and the rooms are nice.For a middle of the road hotel, i was happy even tho middle of the road in New York is still expensive.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAmazing experience !\u201d", "Author": "Gigiwoz81", "ReviewID": "UR117476801", "Content": "The hotel location is perfect, behind it were the theatres..

I think the video on their website said it best. They are the 10 minute hotel. 10 minute walk from almost everything in NYC you need to see.

I knew a NYC hotel would likely have small rooms and this place definitely did along with a bathroom the size of closet. But, on top of that, the room walls are so thin just as many reviews said..we literally could hear word for word convservations that our neighbors would have and it woke me up early each morning. In addition, the rooms really do need a serious update..1980's for sure. The front desk staff were not very friendly..acted as if we were a bother to them because they were always so busy and maybe because we were priceline customers (which I don't think should matter, should still be treated with equal respect). We had requested a room with two beds, but there was not one ready when we checked in so the clerk said he would send a rollaway bed up right away, well guess what, we get back from an entire day's excursions at 11:00pm at night and no rollaway bed. And what made my review jump from average to poor, is that I just checked my credit card statement and there is a charge from the hotel that I did not authorize. Even though we were priceline, you still have to give your credit card for incidentals when you check in, well we charged nothing at all to our room! We were only in the hotel long enough to sleep and get ready each day and when we checked out, there were no charges, but now there is charge for something. I called the customer service and of course, I don't get connected to a real person, but had to leave a msg and wait for someone to call me back within 24 hrs, so we'll see how that goes. But, the the only staff that were friendly were the bell captains so that we appreciate! And the room was pretty clean (not spotless though, always hate when I find other people's hair in the bathroom) and the location could not have been better..really right in the heart of the theater district and times square! We never had time to even make it to the pool or fitness center so can't comment on that. Overall, if you get a really good deal on this place, then it might be worth booking only for the location, otherwise, it is just very average to poor with nothing memorable other than the location. If they would do some updating and make you feel more important there, then I would probably think differently, but we'll see because I am really interested to see how they will handle this mysterious charge and why the heck it is on my credit card, grrr!", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Midlands, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location...not much else going for it\u201d", "Author": "HunterTravellor", "ReviewID": "UR114934989", "Content": "OK, I stayed for 4 night.

I stayed here because of the proximity to my business travel meeting locations and that this hotel is part of the starwood chain (which I often use for travelling) and I therefore had more faith in this hotel as a result. My first impression upon arriving at the hotel with staff outside to greet you, assist with bags, and walking into the lobby is that this looks like a nice hotel after all. The lobby looks like a 4 star hotel and they offer free computer terminals with internet and printing in the lobby area as well as free wifi. After checking in and taking the elevator up to my floor, the shock when the elevator doors opened was ridiculous. When you step out of the elevator into the hall it's like a time warp going back to the early 80s which is when it appears the rest of the hotel (other than the lobby) were last remodelled. Everything was old and the room was even worse. I knew it was going to be small (12' x 14' perhaps) but I was fine with that as a single traveller. The room had a queen size bed and from just about every outside wall in the room (including from the door to the hall) you could just about touch the bed. The biggest issue I had was that it was not very clean. The sheets were white but the carpet wasn't well vacuumed, there were hairs on the bathroom floor, in the tub, walls surrounding the tub, etc. Due to cleaniless alone I would not dare bring my family to this hotel nor would I stay here again for business. The other issue I had was that the toilet didn't flush nor did the shower drain. I did call down and they did come up and fix it promptly. I found that the shower didn't train and I noticed the plug didn't look like it was sitting in the centre of the drain. I therefore lifted it up and it actually came out of the drain hole. What came up with it was enough hair stuck it to in a big ball to fill the palm of your hand. Disgusting. No wonder it didn't drain. Bed bugs - there were NONE. I checked every day and lost sleep over it the first night as I kept on waking up to check. I checked when I got there by pulling the bed off the wall, lifting the mattress, looking for any sign of them and I found no evidence nor was I bitten, etc. That is one good thing going for this hotel plus the free wifi in the lobby.

I realize in many large cities, that things are more expensive and smaller, but this hotel was not at all what I expected by looking at their web-site. The Manhattan Hotle in NY Times Square, has nothing to offer, other than a good location. I hear its one of the cheapest for the area, but I would have rather spent some extra money to maybe have one emenity. I stayed at the hotel for 6-nights, and wanted to leave early... They have no room service, no fridge in room, no coffee, or simple foods on site to buy. The internet accsess did not work in room, and beds are fullsize, and room is very cramped. The gift shop that is supposed to stay open late, almost always had a closed sign on it in the evening, and after I inquired about this; I was told its privately owned... the girl was in there, but would not work- she was eating, and on telephone. This happnened every evening- as hard as this is to believe. The hotel has one restraunt, but it looks very fancy/expensive. The hotel doesnt even offer a free bottle of water, everything you will purchase from stores blocks away, or their vending machines, or gift shop when open, and pay a high price. The pool area is shared by residents, or other patrons from other hotels- I was surprised by this, and each person is greeted by a YMCA type of mentality- who will only want to give you one towel per person, and you are not allowed to leave with their towels to go back to your room- so bring a cover up. I have had better service at a Holiday Inn, and I am not joking. The hotel is packed with teenagers coming in large groups, and this may be due to price. The computers that have free internet are in main lobby, but there are only 6 for hundreds of people- so good luck using one. The only thing good about this hotel is the location, but after 2-days of seeing advertisements, this gets old.

For a nyc hotel, I think it is a very good value and would call it a 3 star hotel, but certainly not a luxury hotel. I've visited multiple times for a few reasons. First, I can use cash + points with my Starwood membership, and it costs very little compared to other nyc hotels. Also, I enjoy visiting nyc to see broadway shows, and the location of this hotel is right in the middle of the Times Square action. Lastly, it is one of the very few nyc hotels to have an indoor pool, which I very much enjoy when I travel. The hotel and the rooms, themselves, are not anything special and the decor is a bit tired in my opinion. However, the beds are comfortable, there are nice sized flat screen tvs in the rooms, and everything is clean, which is more important to me than the decor. The rooms and bathrooms are small, but not compared to other nyc hotels. I think the amenities at this hotel are great for the price. I used the gym, which is not huge, but has a decent selection of new equipment with individual TVs on the machines, which I like. I love the indoor pool, which is large and overlooking the city with big windows. It would be great if there were lounge chairs around the pool, rather than just the few tables and chairs, but overall, the pool is a great feature that makes the hotel appealing to me. The only issue we had while staying at this hotel last weekend was we were woken up both mornings by noise in the hallways. But it's hard to say if we were just unlucky by staying on the same floor as some very loud guests. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to others for location and comfort if you would like to be in the middle of Times Square. If you want a luxury experience, this is probably not the hotel for you.

For a recent business trip, I booked this hotel because of the central location (51st street and 7th avenue), and the fact that it was a \"preferred\" hotel by my company. The lobby is fine, and the reception staff was nice (for New York). I also thought the fitness center exceeded expectations -- good sized pool, and fairly new equipment. But the room was tired and begging for a renovation. The furniture was VERY worn, and there were even exposed screw-holes in the middle of the night table. The room was extremely cramped -- and not in a trendy, well-designed way, like the Philippe Stark hotels. Just cramped. As with many NY hotels, the walls had chipped paint and uneven plaster, and the tile work in the bathroom was dirty and uneven. And the window curtains were ratty.

This year, my sister suggested that we stay a night at a hotel and take my children. We searched for a hotel that would be near or on the parade route and close to Rockerfeller Center. The Manhattan fit the bill. We had a BLAST! The hotel lobby was festive- with holiday decorations- very appealing to little ones and big ones alike! Check in was nice and easy- we did not experience any log waits. The staff greeted each person and upon check- in, gave each child a chocolate turkey- needless to say, the kids were thrilled from the moment we arrived! Our room was great! Spacious and VERY clean. We always check for bed bugs when we travel, so the first thing we did was inspect the mattresses, closet and drawers. They were pristine and we felt as if we could settle in and be comfortable. We were able to get a mini fridge to keep some snacks and drinks for the kids, which was a nice comfort. We had connecting rooms with my sister, which, if you are traveling with little ones is GREAT! ! We were able to put the kids to bed in one room, while the grown ups got to hang out together in the other. We left the door between the rooms ajar to keep an eye on the kids and we did not have to whisper and go to bed too! The staff were all friendly and helpful- we asked for suggestions of places to eat and places to get treats and they knew just where to send us! Their reccommendations were hits with us and the kids (carlos pizza and Magnolia bakery- all within walking distance)! We had no problems, but given the responses we got from helpful staff, I am certain that if we had, they would have addressed any problem graciously and quickly. The location is GREAT! You can easily walk to many, kid friendly places to eat as well as some of New York's most famous attractions. We arrived the night before Thanksgiving, had a great meal (thanks to staff recommendation), took the kids to swim in the pool (it is open until 9:45!) and got them all tired out. The kids really enjoyed the swim at night however, the BEST part, as far as the kids are concerned- is being able to see the parade right from our room! The windows opened and we were on a lower floor- putting the balloons at eye level! We could have chosen to go outside and secure a good spot, since we were right on the route, but there was nothing better than being able to enjoy it with the energy of the other spectators, but in the privacy of our own room(this was the best part as far as the parents are concerned:). We could hear and see everything and when we needed a break or wanted to warm up, we could close the windows and not hear a thing! The hotel provided exactly what we were looking for: a clean, comfortable place to stay with an attentive staff, a good nights sleep, the excitement of Manhattan at Holiday season and a birds- eye view of the parade without the crowd!

I had booked both The Manhattan and Sheraton Towers across the street. Well, my last stay at The Manhattan was horrible (room falling apart, busted tv, lukewarm water) and go zero response to my email following up my stay. Since the Towers isn't participating in the 2x/3x points per stay, I decided to give Manhattan another chance for my current stay. Huge mistake. Upon check in, I asked about a Platinum upgrade - no suites, but \"upgraded\" to a higher floor King bed. (just to throw this in my buddy gets top floor and is gold). Get to the room - it's beside the maid room & service elevator. This is even worse than beside the elevator because every 5 minutes someone is dumping stuff in the room. So I call down to the front desk to switch - \"come down and we'll change your room.\" What kind of customer service is that? Every time I've had to switch rooms (This would be the 3rd time: once for a busted AC, once for busted outlets) it's \"oh, i'm so sorry sir, let me find a new room and send someone up with the keys.\" Fine, I've got 10 minutes to kill before I have a meeting so I go downstairs. SPG line? Nope, just one line to filter everyone, which it was 6 deep (and only 2 CSR's working). Get the new room (now double beds) on a lower floor. Well, I don't know what decade Manhattan was last updated, but my bathroom tile is pink. In all, the room isn't bad, except there are no outlets near the desk. Most have the outlets in the lamp which gives you one for computer and one for the phone. I have to pull the desk out, and start unplugging things to get my computer hooked up. Below you can see the vent in my bathroom - it's a solid 1/2 inch of dust/dirt balls all over, no way it has been cleaned this year. I've attached a picture. Is this place just a stepchild of SPG? Do they not care at all about customers, or loyal SPG customers at that? I want to cancel and go to the Sheraton or Westin TS but don't want to get hit with a cancellation fee.

There's no room service, but to be truthful - if you're in the busiest section of one of the greatest, biggest cities on earth and you're ordering room service, GET A LIFE! There are plenty of options, even next door, to bring stuff back to your room,, but the hotel's location puts it smack in the middle of the theater district with restaurants aplenty. A quick subway ride will take you to non-touristy places to eat; and several lines of the subway are a couple minutes walk from the hotel. Carnegie Hall (and the Carnegie Deli!) are right up the street. Front desk personnel are multi-cultural and could be difficult to understand. Their message got through though, with a smile, and a THANK YOU for my business. It's so simple, but very rare these days. My room was a nice-sized King on a comfortable bed, with nice bath amenities. Wired internet (no in-room wireless!) was a downer, but worked fine. I don't normally like to stay in Times Square on business, but this hotel is so easy for me for everywhere I'm going. It's greatly improved in the last two years, and will be undergoing an even bigger renovation at some point. I applaud the management of this hotel for setting a tone of quality service and reasonable price for the area.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for - this hotel is worth it.\u201d", "Author": "Koho26", "ReviewID": "UR85504708", "Content": "Friendly staff, great location near Times Square, decent rooms, and no bed bugs.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Front Desk Service\u201d", "Author": "Docrtu", "ReviewID": "UR85391365", "Content": "Stayed for three days with three different friends.

The service at this hotel was very good - especially the restaurant staff at breakfast ! Really nice and funny! The food was great too! Thanks again :) The concierge made dinner reservations for us which was really nice of him to do for us - and unexpected! Little service details like that go a long way! The hotel itself is your typical NYC one - small rooms and older. I knew before getting there that the rooms would be small and I was right - quite tiny actually. The bathroom was tiny too. However, the beds were very comfortable and the room was quiet for the most part except for some noisy chatty neighbors and we rarely heard street noise so that was good. The room was clean but definitely needs a refurbish , especially the paint and wallpaper. Scuffed edges, part of the drywall falling apart in the bathroom, etc. It didn't ruin our trip or anything. We still had a great time! I did get a chance to use their pool which was perfect! Nice sized clean swimming pool with a neat view of Times Square. The sauna was clean and comfortable too ! I highly recommend going in for a dip, especially after a long day of walking and sightseeing!

We were only in our room to basically sleep and it was adequate for that. A thorough check for bedbugs showed many signs of recent treatment (including all new baseboards and lots of a light pinkish powder on the mattresses and box springs which looked very new and were NOT encased) but I saw no signs of active bedbugs, which has been a problem at this hotel (see bedbugregistry.com). We were on the 10th floor and street noise wasn't too bad, or maybe we were just so tired from walking all day we slept too hard to notice.

She took a long time with the one other person in the room and then was very slow to check me in. I had called earlier in the day to both let them know I'd be arriving very late and also that I would be checking for bedbugs upon arrival and to please place me and my children in a room that had been inspected and cleared, as I would be camping in their lobby at 3am if there was a problem. I was assured that they had not had any problems recently (not according to the registry!) but would make sure I was placed in an inspected room. Perhaps that is why it took so long to get me into a room? I am not sure. The girl checking me in stared at the computer for so long I thought for a few minutes they did not have a room for me or something.

The hotel foyer is nice and welcoming, and there is a nice bar/restaurant called Russos, however I see from one report that it is shortly due to close which seems such a shame. Once we checked in and took the elevator up to our room we were a little concerned as the corriders are a little grubby and could definately do with some decoratng. We were originally given a room on the 14th floor however when we went in, it had not been cleaned and I have to say I am glad as it did not look nearly as nice. The only complaint I have about the room is that the walls are paper thin and unfortunately we heard EVERYTHING from the room next door . The location is absolutely perfect, the swimming pool on the 5th floor was fantastic and we managed to have a swim most days. Had a few drinks in the hotel bar but did not have a meal or breakfast so not sure what the food was like.

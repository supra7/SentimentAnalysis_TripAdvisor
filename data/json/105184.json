Not a terrible place but not what I would expect from a Marriot chain. Check in was no problem, less than 2 minutes. Room was very small, even with only 1 bed. I can't imagine what a 2-bed room would look like, probably incredibly crammed. The bathroom was a decent size though. The bed was comfy and I slept well. But try to get a room on the backside of the hotel. It was confusing when I entered the parking lot - which is enormous (I think an outlet mall used to be located here and was torn down) and as you enter the parking lot you see the back side of the hotel. There wasn't a single car and I was concerned it might be closed, but as you pull around to the other side of the building you see the front - facing the interstate. There are gigantic flood lights in the parking lot in front of the building right in front of the windows. The room was actually brighter with the lights off at night. It took some crafty furniture placement to pin the drapes shut to keep most of the light out. The fitness room was a joke. Just an eliptical and a treadmill with a tv. It's about the size of a janitors closet so you can't even do any calisthenics or plyos. There was a sign posted about an option to use a nearby gym for free as a hotel guest - but I didn't have the time to go. There is also an indoor pool and hot tub which looked pretty inviting. As far as amenities go it wasn't a bad place. Breakfast was good and free, but no hot food. They have the do-it-yourself waffles that every hotel is in love with but I'm not a fan, and they also have breakfast sandwiches you can microwave. Also cereal, fruit, mini muffins, bagels, yogurt, etc. Internet was free and worked fine, and parking was free and obviously plentiful. Business center also worked as well as I needed it to. I just wasn't a fan of the hotel location. It's right off of the interstate but at an exit that doesn't seem to be really near to anything. There's some fast food places nearby but not many restaurants. Also, there's a local college right next door, and the only access to it is via the road running along the parking lot - and it is flooded in the morning with traffic. It took me about 15 minutes to get out of the parking lot, but even then due to the really fast changing light at the intersection I had to take a roundabout way and turn around to get around the light fast enough to get to work. Again, not a terrible hotel, and not many gripes about it, but I just wasn't overly impressed.

I used the priceline.com name your price feature and won a bid that was about $20 per night less than the lowest internet price. Because of the low price, I consider my stay to have been OK; otherwise, I would not have been as happy. The location is good - right off I-40 at Sycamore View - with plenty of free parking. The hotel itself is nice enough, with a big indoor pool, basic public areas, and updated guest rooms. My room, which was a one king bed setup, was spacious and comfortable. The bed was comfortable as usual for Fairfield Inns, and everything in the room worked well. I found it interesting that even though the parking lot was half empty (most likely indicating that it was not a fully booked night), the pool was overflowing with kids - and I mean dozens upon dozens of them running through the lobby and all. Despite the nice facility, I was not able to get to sleep until 3AM because there was a party going on in the room across the hall. There must have been 25 people in that room, with music, loud talking in the corridor, and people constantly going in and out slamming the door. I [generously] gave them until midnight to quiet down and then called the front desk, as I needed to be well-rested for an 8 hour drive the following day. The clerk did not seem the least bit motivated to tell the partiers to quiet down despite me asking him to do so. Instead, he offered to move me to another room, which really wasn't an issue as it was midnight and I was leaving at 6am. I just wnted to get some sleep. I can see people having a party until a reasonable hour, but talking in the halls and slamming doors until 3AM is totally inconsiderate and unacceptable for the hotel staff to turn their head to it going on. Every time I asked him to please have the partiers quiet down, he had some other idea for me. It seemed as if he was avoiding the problem at hand. Upon check out I was given a $25 Marriott gift certificate due to the inconvenience. I have no idea why the hotel clerk would not just ask the partiers to quiet down. I'd have much rather got a decent night sleep as opposed to a $25 coupon.

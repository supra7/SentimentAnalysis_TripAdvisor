Conclusion: If your idea of a trip to Walt Disney World is saving as much money as you can, and you don\u00b4t give a damn about comfort, cleanliness, bad breakfast and sneezing all night long cause the room is mouldy and smelly, then this is the place for you. If not, then stay away! Oh, almost forgot. Not the safest place in the world, since the rooms are facing the street.

There was a continental breakfast that didn't offer much. The food was subpar but acceptable, however it ran out quickly so we ended up getting Krispy Kreme donuts down the street each morning. One big complaint-I don't see how that hot tub passes any kind of safety codes. It is badly deteriorated, so much so that a couple of us ended up with scrapes on our feet or behinds from stepping or sitting on chunks that had chipped off. The worst part was the fiberglass! We were all miserable because we ended up with fiberglass burns. It felt like I had been sitting on old-school fiberglass football bleachers. Ugh, it was horrible. Seriously, don't go near it. You'll regret it. When one of my teenagers was talking about it, I blew her off because I thought she was being dramatic, then I got in myself. If you must go in, don't sit down & don't lean against the sides. Trust me. All in all, it was a fine place. Nothing good, nothing bad. I got a very cheap rate through online bidding. Don't pay much, because there are better places for the same price range in the area. But if you're looking for a quick stop, it's fine. Just don't take a relaxing dip, because it will backfire.

It was clean, no musty smells as we read in other reviews. It was quiet-we could hear anything outside or in other rooms. The room was immaculate. Very speedy check in. The \"free\" breakfast was a nice idea, but they only had like 6 tables and it was cereal, we chose to spend the 30 bucks and go get a real breakfast. It was great for a one night getaway with the kids especially when we were at the parks all day & just needed to shower & crash. I'd definitely stay here again.

The room itself was clean and big with two Queen Beds, table and chairs, desk, and cable tv. I only gave it an average rating because there was nothing above average and nothing particularly bad. When I was there the weather was warm and sunny and the pool was icy cold. I was not leaving without a swim and did swim several days. The big hot tub was actually warm, just the temperature I like. Most of the rooms were empty yet when I asked to stay in my room for an extra day they said it was rented out. I checked again on the day I needed and the desk clerk said, no, still being held and I would have to move. I almost made a reservation elsewhere since if I was moving, it might as well have been close to the airport. Then I checked the Internet for the hotel I was in and found that there was a room like mine available. At least when I told the desk this, they did let me stay the additional night. Why all this fooling around is beyond me. i had some problems - the TV did not work when I got into the room, the refrigerator stopped working, and the maids were not good about putting coffee packs in the room. The breakfast was no good - nothing like they picture it and the room is dreary. No healthy food either. If you skip it you really lose nothing. Still, I do say that you probably will find the place OK for a short stay (I was there a week). Just do not be expecting a really nice Comfort Suites type of Choice Hotel. Also, be sure you get the right rate as listed on the Choice Hotel Web site. I've seen people come to the desk at more than one Choice Hotel and pay the highest rate when they obviously could have a lower rate.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cQuality value\u201d", "Author": "ELCHEAPEE", "ReviewID": "UR10867422", "Content": "Had two bedroom king suite paid $95 for first night and then came back a paid $103 for another 3 nights - big suite with big rooms, average bathrooms, lots pillows on bed, nice white bedding, lots of towels, comfy beds, fairly quiet, nice pool, breakfest is pretty good with waffles, cereal, toast, danish, cinnabon, muffins, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, canned peaches, apples & oranges, juice, and coffee.

Had some problems with first check in as key lock would not work, move to another room where bathroom ceiling leak water, and move to another room, gave us 50% off for our troubles for first night. Despite early troubles, we returned for another 3 nights because the rooms were newly renovated and very nice. Great location if you have a car to drive to disney - parking at disney is $11. Bad thing - $2.50 per day safe charge (even if you dont use it) and time share presentation ($90 credit per couple if you choose to go). They will not sell you disney tickets if you dont go to time share presentation. 24hr walmart sells disney tickets (min 3 day tickets) at discount.

Any bad reviews are just angry people with one little problem!!! The hotel is just what you pay for. It is affordable and the rooms are nice. Big bathroom!!!! The hotel allowed us to check in 3 hours early and check out 3 hours late at no additional cost. He wasnt supposed to do it but that is what they are there for. Transportation to the atrractions is VERY LIMITED!!! One bus goes to the each park once a day and returns only once a day and much after the parks close. Public transportation is great if you dont have a car. Busses run right infront of the hotel and run every 20 min or so. Suggested to take bus route 56 to Disney, it runs all day and you dont have to wait for the other bus. DONT ASK HOTEL STAFF TO GET YOU A TAXI!!! Also dont use taxis, they rip you off and take you way out of the way! Overpriced!!!! All in all was a nice hotel. Hot tub wasnt on! Pool was nice!

My husband went to get some soda and snacks he didn't get to see the bugs. I called down to the person up front and they told us they would being a key to us for another room. We waited for my husband my sister inlaw and I and my 8 year old daughter. We decided we wanted to check out and leave and go to another hotel, when we went downstairs the lady was very nasty with us and told us \"I don't know what you did in that room so I can't refund your money.\" we were stuck in this motel for the night. They did give us another room that still had bugs I got bit . In the morning about 9am the cleaning lady tried to come through the door while we were still in bed. We had the door locked and she still tried to come in. No apologies. At first when we tried to check out they were not going to give us any refund but I think because we were starting to get un patient they gave us back half the room rate.

The room was typical of the Kissimmee area 192 strip - very old and housekeeping could have been better. The beds were old and hard, TV worked, they had a coffee pot (didnt use it) and towels were clean but so old that they were paper thin. Found an old pair of socks??? From previous guest???? We had room #309 right by the COLD Jacuzzi??? Swimming pool was not heated but clean and did get crowded. There is a small playground and Jet Ski rental on the property. Also a game room and laundry room. We did not eat their free Breakfast which consisted of the usual make your own waffles, etc. The staff was very nice (young kids) and eager to help. Hotel right in the middle of everything and 2 miles from Disney. All in all this place was worth the $65 not a penny more, but I knew this coming in. I would not stay here again if I could help it.

The breakfast was very basic, but what do you expect, you do get it free after all!! The swimming pool was a little on the small side, but there was never anyone in it, so was great for just the 2 of us. Also the jucuzzi was brill, just like stepping into a hot bath! Hotel is about a 10 minute drive to all the disney parksand about 20 mins to universal studios. There were lots of places to eat around the hotel and lots of gift shops.

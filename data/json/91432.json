The cancellation policy there states that the reservation must be canceled by 6 pm on the day of arrival. When I called the hotel at 10:15am the day of arrival, the general manager told me his cancellation policy was 4pm the day before arrival. He told me that I would be charged for the first day and that he would cancel the second day. I hung up and immediately called customer service at Ramada. It seems that they have no control over this Ramada be cause \"it is independently owned and operated\". They offered to file a concern that would go to the general manager of the hotel (the guy I had just spoken to). All in all a pretty low class operation. I recommend the Red Roof Inn for budget travelers in this area. I did manage to cancel my debit card before this clown charged me so I wasn't out any money. It just seems odd that Ramada has no control over the franchisee and his \"new and improved\" (for Him) cancellation policy. Poor Poor Poor, They should be ashamed. I would give it a zero star but one is the lowest you can go. It doesn't look good for Ramada and Wyndham resorts, the parent companies. Oh, I forgot to mention, I had to cancel due to the death of my brother in law in Harrisburg, PA. I looked at booking a Microtel in Mechanicsburg, PA, but they are also owned by Wyndham so why would I?", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Smithfield, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cRamada????\u201d", "Author": "Manda04", "ReviewID": "UR124262573", "Content": "I stayed one night at this location for SuperBowl weekend. Let's just say I would never have paid the normal price of this room never mind the amount we paid . At best this this is a 2 star motel. The room itself was semi ok, somewhat clean, the bathroom was aweful, I actaully cleaned it before I would use it. I can't believe that this is owned by the Ramada chain. I am thankful that I only spent about 5 hours in this room total. The only thing nice I can say is that the front desk staff went out of their way to welcome us. I suppose that's what happens when you are paying a 5 star hotel price for a 1 star motel.

The staff was wonderful, very welcoming and making great effort to ensure that our stay was pleasant. When we checked in they offered to change our room from the two doubles we had booked through Hotels.com to a queen room. This moved us from second floor to first. (No elevators) While the room was very small, it was clean and comfortable. We had a minor problem trying to access the internet from a second laptop, but a call to the desk had them issue us a second password in minutes. Staff person, perhaps one of the owners??, asked us each and every time we saw her if all was good with our room. I will say the room was tight, but we were only there two nights and were not uncomfortable. If you are going to be staying longer and perhaps having people come to your room, this may not be the place for you. I would definitely go back to this hotel and will recommend it to anyone traveling to Indy.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent hotel on the outskirts of Indy\u201d", "Author": "Igiss", "ReviewID": "UR121254551", "Content": "Stayed there during the Indy-500 race that took place on May 31 2001. The last victory of Dan Wheldon, sadly. Anyway, the hotel was quite impressive: located in a pleasant suburb with clean green lawns and accurate one-storey houses. Yet, there are restaurants nearby, a supermarket, a cinema (!) and a bus which goes to the center of Indianapolis each half an hour. Since I don't drive cars anywhere this was an important amenity. And it's even better if you do drive, since the roads are great and I didn't observe any traffic jams. The hotel is also at a 1,5-hour walk distance from the Brickyard. Which was fair for a sole visitor like myself, since no transportation is available on the race day. The staff of the hotel is very thoughtful, as other reviewers rightfully noted. Especially the manager, Johnny B. In addition to a great stay, it's because of him that I got some of my forgotten belongings shipped to my location in Moscow, Russia. I purchased some items in a local supermarket and forgot them at the cashier, and only realized the loss in the airport a few hours later when there was no time to go back and return the items myself. I called the hotel, and the items were returned without much trouble.

A Ramada is a Ramada is a Ramada. It's on the side of two freeways. It's clean. But what sets this place apart is the realization that most chain hotels are franchised and thus individually owned. That can set a place apart. We made reservations and indicated we had our 11 year old Golden Retriever with us. We got there and the owning couple greeted us warmly, greatly looking forward to meet our dog. The gave us a nice corner room close to a place for her to go potty at night. Overall, you could just tell they cared about their hotel and placed energy unto their guests.

He is serious about making his guests welcome as the other reviews attest. The motel is out of town but was only about a ten minute drive to Lucas Oil Stadium. So it was very convenient. This motel will not knock you over with its amenities but it was clean, roomy and comfortable. It even had a refrigerator in the room which was convenient.

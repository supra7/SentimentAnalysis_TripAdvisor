This hotel is ideal for patients at Virginia Mason Medical Center, as there is an elevator that connects (via sky-bridge walkway) the hotel with the medical center. There is storage for guest's baggage and I heard from more than one guest that hotel staff delivered their bags to their hospital rooms for them. Yes, this hotel is a bit dated, but it's clean and the price is right for a Seattle hotel in a good location.

The 80 room hotel sits atop First Hill, in a quiet neighborhood of historic mansions, cathedrals, medical centers and tree-lined streets. Just a few blocks walk to the city core. It looks like a boutique European hotel, brick building with a colorful awning, flower-boxes and polished brass everywhere, a cozy lobby, a great cafe for all three meals (we ate dinner there) and courtyard. The staff is more than terrific - from the desk staff to the cafe servers, its evident they enjoy working there and are great concierges for the city. The rooms are nice and are very fairly priced. The housekeeping is immaculate. The suites (we didn't stay in one but toured several) are very nice and two are on the top floor where there is an open terrace for a terrific view of the city. We'll stay in the \"fireplace\" suite on our next visit to Seattle. A real neat spot.

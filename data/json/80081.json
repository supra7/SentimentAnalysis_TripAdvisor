You can either get up and showered early, or (like we did) just throw on a coat and go get your breakfast before getting ready for the day.

DIRTY, SMALL, LOUD, UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF!!!\u201d", "Author": "ldelaney", "ReviewID": "UR109201748", "Content": "I am writing to express my DEEP dissatisfaction with my stay at the Chelsea Inn. My stay lasted from May.14th 2011-May.18th 2011. I chose to stay at the Chelsea Inn due to its location and reasonable prices. Another deciding factor for my choice was the flexibility and the ability of the staff to accommodate my needs via the phone before my arrival. However, when I arrived this was simply NOT the case. I requested two beds on my reservation. I knew it was a long shot, but I added this as a comment in my reservation. I received an email stating that there would only be one double bed. So the next day, I called to make sure that there was the possibility of having two beds. The reason being, that I was sharing a room with my father and sharing a bed was something both of us were not comfortable with. I spoke with a gentleman with an accent who stated that this would be possible and that he would write a comment to make sure that it happened. If this had not been the case, we certainly would have explored further options. When my father and I arrived on the 14th the gentleman at the front desk went frantically looking for another room with another bed, but upon his return, apologized and stated that if we could excuse him this one night, he would compensate us (a measly $10.00) and that tomorrow it would be taken care of. As uncomfortable as it was, we slept in the same bed the first night. However, the second night of our stay we had heard nothing about the second bed. So when we called the front desk they sent a maid upstairs. She came with a less than desirable roll away. The problem besides the comfort with the roll away was that logistically it would not have been possible to fit in the room we were in. If we put it at the front of our room it would have been blocking the door which not only is a fire hazard but inconvenient in that we both use the restroom during the night. Obviously, none of these choices sounded comforting to my father or I. So needless to say, for four nights my father and I shared a double bed. A few more things that were less than desirable were the fact that it was not made aware to us before our stay that there is a nightclub right outside of our window that shook our room and kept us from sleeping as well as construction that kept us up as well. Additionally, on our first night at the inn, our restroom was out of order for a couple of hours. In all, both my father and I agree that this was the worst experience that we have had when staying in a hotel or inn. Aside from all of this, the most inconvenient occurrence was that of being charged TWICE for my stay which resulted in my account being overdrawn and not having money for the last two days of my NYC vacation. It also appears that some of the rooms are residences as well. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE! PAY THE 50$ EXTRA TO STAY SOMEWHERE NICER. IT WILL BE VERY WELL WORTH IT.

I asked reception why nobody had told me and how long it had been there, she got very annoyed and looked at some random piece of paper before announcing it had arrived very late last night and they didn't want to wake me so had left a note on my room door.... this would be an invisible note then? So I then had to repack in the hallway. Who knows how long it had actually been there, the tag showed it had arrived in New York 4 days previously anyway. We were asked how our stay had been we said \"ok\" clearly not wanting to elaborate but she pushed us asking \"just Ok? Why not good?\" I merely mentioned the radiator as I couldn't be bothered realing off the list of irritating things that had happened. I was told with an angry tone that I should have said something and we could have moved rooms. This is a lesson learned for me but in a fully booked hotel over New Year I'm not sure how they would have managed that. Perhaps they have invisible rooms to go with invisible notes. In general, it's a good location for exploring New York and cheap. It would do if you're on a budget. However, staff extremely rude and unhelpful, bed like rocks and loud clanging radiator which almost induced a heart attack at 3 am.

Our room was very cute and comfortable. It was very very small and we even laughed at the fact that my husband, who is 6'4\", could touch both sides of the room while stretching out in bed. However, the rooms have really high ceilings and so it does not feel claustrophobic at all. The room was very long and had lots of room for our bags so we did not feel cramped. And as we were visiting in winter, we really appreciated that the heating was warm and comfortable at all times. Our room faced the inner courtyard and thus was very quiet, but I believe that the rooms on the street side may have been nosier.

When we made the reservation, the male attendent asked what time our flight was landing. We stated around 12:30p.m.. When we finally arrived at 2:30... our room was ready and waiting for us. The female desk attendent, originally told us it wasn't and we would have to store our lugguage under the stairway. After a couple of questions, she 'finally' checked, and found our room was ready. Saved us a couple of hour wait for the \"already\" room to be ready! There is no lobby. Only a corridor that leads down to the desk. Across from the desk (very close) was our room. We had Room 102. It was $239 + taxes. It is on the first floor in the back of the building, overlooking a courtyard. The courtyard is used by a bar next door. I understand that the owner of the Chelsea Inn allows the bar next door to use it. The west side of Chelsea Inn is a restaurant. On the east side of Chelsea inn is a bar (same owner of the restaurant.) You wouldn't know there is a bar on the west side because we didn't see any signs. You have to buzz to gain entrance. We didn't go, but wish we did. It looked like a nice place to have a glass of wine in the courtyard. It would also be a great place for guests of Chelsea Inn to eat their breakfast (since we heard that the owner of the Chelsea Inn owns the courtyard.) but appears to be unavailable to the guests. It was mostly quiet, except for the children that seemed to be occupying the unit above this one. They were noisy. The unit was large by New York standards. There was a private bathroom, small mini kitchen/dining area, a sittng area and a very small bedroom. My husband could \"almost\" (minus one inch) touch wall to wall. The bed has a small double bed. In the sitting area, there is a daybed, that could be used as is or pulled out into a larger bed. Because the bed in the bedroom was so small (husband is skinny but 6'2\", he pretty much occupied the whole bed, so I slept in the daybed. The sitting area also had a very small television. Because the window A/C is about 5 feet away from the television you needed to turn up the televison to hear it. The channels on the television were basic cable. Nothing more. A weird note about the unit. When I was using the remote control to change channels on the television, it had to be pointed \"exactly\" at the television. In the morning I was haphazardly clicking channels on the television and the A/C was going off and on. On the remote control, if you clicked the UP channel (the only thing on the remote control that I found did this) and point it to the window A/C you will be turning off/on the A/C. If you switch if back to the television it will work on the television. Weird, but we tried it many times. The mini kitchen had a dorm refrigerator, a microwave and a coffeemaker (no coffee is supplied). The breakfast was supplied by the bakery underneath the Chealea Inn. It was good. A (great) coffee, fruit or a fruit juice, and a pastry. I liked it. The room is old, and about a hundered coats of paint, but still quaint and interesting. The oldness didn't bother me. Many many old b&bs are like that in Europe. 2 of the 6 candlelights in the chandelier were burned out. And at one point the lights on the fixture just popped a fuse. Luckily the fuse box was in the room, so we could just switch the fuse back on. Shower was ok.. Water was great. Didn't seem hard at all. The bathroom had a pedestal sink, which made it very difficult to lay out my toiletries in the bathroom. They would either fall on the floor or fall in the sink. The toilet was so close to the wall that you could hit the toilet paper holder. You needed to turn to sit on the toilet. There is a safe in the room. But... if it worked it didn't work according to the instructions on the wall. From the instructions... if you use the safe and you called the desk to open the safe after you put something in it and couldn't figure out how to open it, it would cost $20 for them to open it. We chose not to use it. The most disappointing part of the visit was one of the main reasons we chose this inn in the first place. Because of the internet access. It was down the entire 2 days we were there. We carted a laptop half way across the country, only for their internet service to be down. We \"never\" would have stayed there if we knew that. They said \"sorry\" and that was it. Not sure if I would stay there again because of that. Best things about the inn: Most of the desk attendents. Clean rooms Worst things about the inn: Didn't have internet service.

Some members of the party (4) had a few worries beforehand after seeing mixed reviews on the web. However expectations were not too high to begin with and though first impressions were not positive for some of the women in the party, by the 2nd night everything was fine. The hotel is old and relatively basic, but then it is NYC, many other hotels are exactly the same and if you going to be out and about for most of the day, you are not looking for a spa/sauna here when you get back. The rooms have all the essentials: safe, fridge, dressers, TV, good bed. We stayed in a \"suite\" so we had 2 rooms adjacent to each other, a small \"hall\" with its own door (so the rooms were separated from the other rooms in the hotel) and our own bathroom that was shared between the rooms. The bathroom was fine: tiled, large, usual US shower that wakes you up like nothing else. The street outside was pretty noisy during the night. This is probably related a lot to sleeping patterns being confused by the travel, as both couples woke around 3am the first night (which would have been 8am in Europe for us, so normal getting up time !) and hence then found the noise difficult when trying to get back to sleep. There was some building work in a nearby building and the guys seemed to be getting some delivery during the night of skips or something similar (that was just noisy when being dropped off and being dragged a few yards). At the weekend the noise dissipated a lot and sleep came better. Did not hear much of the gay night club down the street and did not feel that it made the area seedy or anything like that. There was never any problem coming or going at any hour of the evening or night. The breakfast at the little shop at the entrance to the hotel is grand to start you off on your day (OJ, pastry, tea/coffee) - try the cheese filled Danishes - they are really nice.

So even if you get sick plenty to do right around the hotel. Only thing I can say that had room for improvement would be the internet situation. I only got a signal one night out of four in my room and it was kind of late at night. I stayed on the fifth floor, so it can be sort of understandable, but I met some kids staying on the third who said they didn't get a signal the first night they were there. I actually met them while on the stairs using my laptop and we all went out and had a great time that night so the wireless signal strength actually ended up being a good thing in the end, but yeah a wi-fi signal booster would be a good thing guys!

It really feels like you are renting a room in a home in circa 1890's New York. Our expectations weren't high as we knew this wasn't a Hilton, but we were pleasantly surprised with this little gem. The check-in was smooth and easy. The nice lady named Melissa offered to make us dinner reservations if we were hungry and gave us a free copy of Time Out New York magazine to help us plan our time there. We were way up on the fourth floor and since there is not an elevator...carrying our 50lbs. bag up the stairs was not an easy task. Once we got to our room,,,we loved how homey it felt. Nice big window, tall ceilings and a quilted bed. There was also a sink and a mini refrigerator which was very nice to have. Free Wi-Fi was also a plus. Sharing a bathroom with another room was no problem at all. We never saw the other people and it was always very clean. In the morning, you are given coupons to the downstairs nook of a bakery called Nana's Treats. You get coffee, a pastry and a piece of fruit every day of your stay. (I recommend the cinnamon rolls) The little breakfast helped us save a few bucks each day. The location was perfect. Only two blocks from Union Square. SO many restaurants on the hotel's street alone and only half a block from awesome shopping: H&M, Kate Spade, Zara etc. There are two clubs near the Inn but from our room, we couldn't hear any noise. I also felt safer knowing there were always people hanging out or waiting in line to get into the clubs when we got back to the hotel late late in the evening. Check-out was just as smooth and a very kind and patient woman named Rada answered our last minute questions. All in all, I loved it here.

One of our friends was getting married and we had her bachelorette party in the city. When I first heard we were going to the city, I immediately was on Trip Advisor looking for something decent. So, I sent my friend who was coordinating this party 2 or 3 hotels that had decent reviews and weren't outrageously expensive but this was not one of them. Anyway, she booked this hotel because there were 8 of us and the man on the phone said the 5th floor has 4 bedrooms and 2 baths and would be perfect for us for a great price I might add. So, after reading reviews on Trip Advisor I was like oh boy. I really didn't want to stay here but I was not in charge and she was trying to keep it cheap. We were warned that there was no elevator so climbing to the 5th floor was an adventure! When we got there, the person at the desk said oh I have 3 rooms on the 5th floor and 1 on the 1st floor. The whole point of the discount and us staying together was obviiously to be together well after hemming and hawwing the woman all of a sudden said let me see what I can do and all of a sudden the 4th room on the 5th floor was available...weird! Anyway, the rooms were ok, plain but clean! Bathroom...plain but clean! There was AC which worked great in some rooms but not so great in others. There was a fridge there which was great for soda and water. The cafe next store is awesome and so quaint. Try their belgian waffles, they're to die for! One problem we did have was that the hotel had 2 entrances and after a night out none of us realized that we went into the wrong entrance until after we walked up to the 5th floor only to see what was NOT our room. So, we walked all the way back down and all the way up to get to our rooms. Our fault, but just be careful and watch the entrances. I heard no noise coming from a club so I'm not sure what everyone is talking about with previous reviews. We all did get a free voucher for breakfast which was outside and down in a very little cafe where you can get coffee, juice and pastries, that was ok, the cafe next door is better though. All in all the Chelsea Inn wasn't as bad as I thought, I probably wouldn't stay there again unless I was heading down there with the girls again.

The A/C doesn't make the room cold but it drowns out street noise and if angled right can blow cool air on you. We were fortunate to be on the first floor avoiding the stairs- there's no elevator. The room lacks an alarm clock (but who needs that these days anyway), hair dryer, coffee maker and other regular features of hotel rooms. The staff isn't there at all hours but when they are there, they are friendly and ready to help in any way. The price is very reasonable considering the proximity to Union Square, two subway entrances and, of course, a gay bar. In the day, there is minimal traffic making this a NY-quiet neighborhood. (Sirens, trucks and trash pick up are noisy everywhere) I personally enjoyed my stay and have no real complaints (I'm easy to please and don't need much for comfort) but I can see where several people I know would be less than comfortable, which is why I'll probably not recommend this place unless they are on a tight budget.

This time, all we could find for our budget was the Chelsea Inn. Overall, we could say our stay was ok, but that is all. Avoid rooms on street side: quite a lot of noise from customers of Splash nightclub, garbage trucks or fire trucks passing by, almost all nights. Add to this someone who played with the intercom, ringing our room in the middle of the night (what is the point of having an intercom in a hotel???), well we had a few sleeping problems... The room was indeed very large compared to what we were used to, but the carpet is old and stained. We saw at least one mouse rushing through our room. The sink in our room was barely working. The place is somewhat smelly, like an old hotel with old carpets everywhere. Nonetheless, the shared bathroom was spotless, as well as the bed and bedsheets. As for the TV, it was the worst selection of stations we ever saw: if you want to look at the TV Guide Network, you have it thirty times. Otherwise, all you have are local tv stations who seem to care only about local murders or robberies, as well as all kind of rreality shows. We were not in Manhattan to look at the TV, but it would have been interesting to be able to have international news... Breakfast is ok, but you can find a lot better in the neighborhood.

We had no problems with the shared bathroom, it's only shared with one other room anyway. Stairs up to the 3rd floor were fine too, unless you are old or have trouble walking. I found the Chelsea Inn to have a lot of character and we don't regret our choice of accommodation at all. Union Square tube station is just around the corner (feed the squirrels!).

I desperately asked if there is anything he could do he coldly said no, although I can go online to hotels.com now and book it through them for $50 extra per night.

We found it to be like a 3 star budget hotel. It was very quiet and we felt like we were staying in our very own apartment in NYC. The room was large with a TV and fridge (great if you are on a budget) with a sink in the room, and a bathroom shared onyl between us and one other room. The staff were friendly and accomodating. I have seen reviews where people say their bedroom door was left unlocked after cleaning - this happened to us on the first day aswell, but we simply found the maid, asked her if she could make sure our room was locked after she'd finished each day, and it was without fail. The breakfasts are yummy and again - typically New York. You get a tea/coffee, fruit juice and freshly baked pastry. The lady in the breakfast place is really nice if you are nice/polite to her, and she makes all her own pastries and cakes which are delicious! Overall we had a GREAT stay at this place.

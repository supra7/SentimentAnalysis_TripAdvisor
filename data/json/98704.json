For a place representing Wyndham it is very badly cared for and not worth it. As for their \"breakfast\" it consists of coffee and juice alone, and the free internet is a joke if you can get on at all. The rooms are very dirty at check in and roaches were seen during our stay.

It was pretty ok. Like the title says- if you just need the basics(bed, bath, sleep), then this motel will do the job. It's in a quite area- so no worries of loudness outside. I did notice a sheet on the table that stated 'Room Service' but my friend's friend stated that it was pricey(she had gotten there the night before). She said she walked on over to the Sonic- it's a couple of blocks from the motel. They do have a couple of places that deliver to the motel. The motel is located next to some woods and from the looks of it could be considered isolated. So if you are traveling by foot, then be careful when going out. If you want a no frills place to cover your basic needs as well as saving money, then I suggest this place.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cShhh, SO QUIET!\u201d", "Author": "TeresaVzqs", "ReviewID": "UR115304007", "Content": "I absolutely hate it when you get to a highway-side motel and it's loud, and cheap and obnoxious. This one was only cheap, but not in a bad way. We were only a few blocks away from i35, (where there's a very busy McDonald's, Sonic and other fast food restaurants) but all that is safely near-reach (even when walking) but OUT OF SIGHT. It was such a relief to avoid that mess, when all we wanted to do, was go to sleep and walk to a pancake-restaurant in the morning (I hate cereal) before an afternoon flight. It was annoying having to ask the clerk for a hair drier, an alarm, when they should have them already in the rooms; plus the tv remotes are so confusing... I would've deducted a star if the clerk hadn't been so sweet as to cater to all my questions. I really value customer service. Our room was clean, nicely sized, we even got a desk and a recliner, which was good, because I needed to finish some things on my laptop. The lack of pool is great too, since I just wanted to sleep, without rowdy kids screaming and water noise.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNo extras, but nice.\u201d", "Author": "Cawcker33", "ReviewID": "UR114720852", "Content": "Everything seemed made to cut costs, but what it lacked in extra amenities, it made up in cleanliness, location and a fast, warm staff.

I said I wanted to stay another night and the man left. 20 minutes later the manager called wanting me to pay immediately. I offered my credit card over the phone, highly anoyed that I couldn't wait an hour, and the manager said I had to come down in person immediately and that my credit card over the phone was insufficient.

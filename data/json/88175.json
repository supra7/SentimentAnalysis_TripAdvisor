The front desk staff was efficient, polite and professional. We received prompt service and a room upgrade to a suite without even asking. Our room was large, clean, functional and well decorated. Largest flat screen TV I have ever seen in a hotel bedroom. The bathroom was the cleanest bathroom I have ever been in. Well done to the cleaning staff!! The hotel definitely reflects classic mid west theme and is relaxing. The location is perfect for the down town Indianapolis area. The lobby is inviting and comfortable. We ate dinner at the restaurant and experienced wonderful service (only couple in the place but still above and beyond). Food was fresh, hot, fast and delicious. Prices were reasonable to fairly cheap for a hotel. My wife and I have decided next time we are in Indianapolis we are staying at this property again.

The service here has always lived up to the standards I expect from Sheraton, and the rooms are always clean and nice. As always, the Sheraton beds are pretty much the best ever. In the summer, the rooftop pool is absolutely awesome, and as this hotel sits right on the circle, I don't think there is a bad view possible. Even if you aren't using the pool, I suggest going out on the pool deck just to check out the sweet view. During this stay I visited the hotel bar briefly and the bartender was awesome. She made it so that I would drop by for a drink even if not staying here. It was a bummer that there was no room service after 11pm, but it worked out as they have a convenience store in the lobby that is open 24hrs. Potato chips to the rescue! As is a problem with all Sheraton's, you do you have to pay for internet, though I believe they have a business center where you can use a computer with internet for no charge. Regardless, I feel that with the money spent for a room at a Sheraton, included wifi would be a nice touch.

She always goes out of her way to make me and my coworkers feel welcome, saying hello and greeting us by name.

The hotel is conveniently located, the beds are comfortable and the bar has decent food and the price was right for a stay downtown. Nothing fancy, but certainly clean and comfortable. There is a fitness room (small). The only problem I ran into was during a visit in early April.

That said, I'd never go back to this hotel again. I just spent a week there with a convention and here's the low-down... The best feature of this hotel is its location, right in the heart of downtown Indy. Everything seems to be nearby or within a distance of short walk. I also found the staff to be pleasant (if not exceptionally outgoing) and efficient. And, at first glance, the hotel seems to be up to par... but after a short period of time the cracks start to show. First off, parking and the hotel's restaurant are ridiculously overpriced. $30 for a breakfast for two, and $23/day to park? Come on. This is Indianapolis, not midtown Manhattan. More importantly, the place could definitely use some sprucing up. While the main public areas and room would rate as average in my book, the parking garage and adjoining lobby areas are depressingly dingy, as is the not-changed-in-the-slightest-since-the-60's pool area. I would have said that the overall cleanliness of the hotel was on-par, if not for the visitor I encountered on day four. On my way out the door, there, right above the door handle on the door frame, was a perfect, 3-inch-long specimen of the all-American cockroach. Now folks, I live in the NYC Metro area, so I know a roach when I see one. And this guy was a whopper by even New york standards. Some may argue that any building can get cockroaches. I'll argue back that I don't want to spend $129/night to stay in one of them. In all fairness, I did report the sighting (and subsquent killing on my behalf) of this visitor and the hotel did make a monetary adjustment to my bill. For that, they get a two instead of a one-dot rating... at least they tried. But I still have the willies.

The location was perfect for exploring downtown---just a block away from monument circle, a few blocks from the capital and museums, with restaurants and shopping all close enough that we did not move the car once we checked in. On the business side, my husband reported that the conference rooms were comfortable and easily accomodated the large number of people and various meetings that were being help with his convention. The only negative comments I have are that the free wifi was only available in the lobby, not in the room, and that it was not working for most of our stay.

While I do think that some of the floors and rooms could use some updating, the rooms are well maintained by the staff. (Perhaps this Sheraton is on the list for future renovation?) The key is to get to know the staff, feel free to try to negotiate, as my team had the promise of 10+ rooms for a number of months - you'll be surprised what *wood will do to keep your stays in house. I have to say, the hospitality here is better than the Westin in my experience. The Sheraton staff went above and beyond, whereas the Westin simple treated you like any old guest (in my experience) - and I'm not one to seek out pampering, or expect it. If you find the need to stay in Indy and are looking for value and service. I strongly recommend the Sheraton Indianapolis City Centre.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Experience!!\u201d", "Author": "DKline56", "ReviewID": "UR80749730", "Content": "A couple of buddies and I flew to Indy to watch the Giants/Colts game last weekend.

We parked in the parking garage connected to the hotel, which had numerous spaces available and was well lit and felt secure. When we got to our room it was not quite what we expected. It was clean, which is always a plus, but it was VERY small. The air conditioner in the room was not working properly all weekend. We turned it down to 60 on Friday night and it was still a little warm in there throughout the night. By Saturday night we had the a/c down to 53 and on high and the room was still not very cool. We called the manager and he did bring us 2 fans to help with the cooling issues. Here is my biggest gripe about the hotel...parking. When we left the parking garage on Saturday afternoon it was a nightmare. I put in my ticket to leave the garage and the gate would not lift so we had to wait until an attendant came out. The attendant informed us that as a guest of the hotel you need to get the parking ticket validated at the front desk, which we were not informed about when we checked in. Once it was validated we went in and out with ease. On Saturday night when leaving for the concert we were in a line of about 15 cars trying to get out of the parking garage. A friend walked up to the front and informed the people who were trying to get out that they had to go in and get their ticket validated to get out.

I ate in the hotel several times (breakfast x2; room service x1; restuarant x1) and the food was good. The breakfast buffet was nothing spectacular but was perfectly adequate and good value I thought at approx. $13.95. Plenty of non-guests seemed to come in for breakfast.

The only negative: After a walkabout in downtown Indy (the Sheraton is just one block north of the center of the city - great location), we decided to go to the pool. Using the hotel provided robes, we went to the pool. The pool was clean and clear but there was no shade whatever from the very bright sun. A few tables with market umbrellas would be nice. We would definitely return to the Sheraton!", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "Fastco", "ReviewID": "UR19805738", "Content": "Spent two weeks in Indy, began with 2 nights at the Sheraton and ended with 1 night at Sheraton.

While we appreciated being able to get a hotel room for the Gencon convention, if the next time we visit I have to choose between staying outside the city or this Sheraton, I will find a hotel that is distant. We encountered a variety of problems at the hotel from the moment we checked in on Wednesday evening right until the last minute we checked out on Monday morning. I have stayed at Sheraton hotels in the past and had generally positive experiences, but this experience left my family and I less likely to choose Sheratons in the future. Upon arrival, we were directed by hotel staff to the parking garage attached to the hotel. What we didn't realize was that the garage was $10 more per day than any garage in the area (including other nearby hotels and the garage 50 feet down the street) and that the hotel offered no discount for using it. We discovered that 'validation' was simply code for 'pay at the front desk', a nonsensical idea given that there was nowhere else to pay during most hours. It's unclear WHY the garage was so expensive, given how poorly lit it was or how the security doors to the hotel were broken and allowed anyone in, despite what the signs next to the door claimed. Upon checking in to our room, we found our Internet service was non-functioning. After repeated calls to the front desk, I contacted Z-net technical support. We quickly determined the nature of the problem...the DSL modem in the room was broken. However, when I contacted Guest Services, they were unsure what to do. After having their staff check, they discovered they had no spare modems. But instead of simply getting a modem from a customer who wasn't using the internet service (since the hotel was fully booked), they asked me to check with them the next day, after 12PM. While an inconvenience, I did so. They had forgotten about me, however, and we repeated the same process. Wireless Internet service was available in the lobby, but this was inconvenient for more than quick uses in the limited seating and in a public space. Thursday evening, after several visits, the manager on duty and support staff managed to locate a unit and provided it to us, after I showed them where to install it. The manager then offered us the service for free, due to the inconvenience, which we appreciated. We would later have to argue to have this charge removed from the bill, however, as the promise of the manager didn't translate into informing the staff or making proper notation on our hotel information. When I did get access to the Internet, I went to my bank's website to perform some bill-paying. It was then that I noticed that the hotel had put a $1000 hold on my account for our stay, something that I am unclear on why it was done or why we weren't notified of the same. It had no effect on our stay, but seemed to indicate that this Sheraton, unlike others I've stayed with in the past, considered us to be risky customers. More onerous was the fact that $1000 exceeded the cost of our stay, meaning that the Sheraton Centre City was tying up my funds based on their belief that I would be incurring charges of hotel services. I have not experienced this practice at other hotels and found it somewhat insulting. Perhaps the hotel thought I would be buying one of their $4.50 dollars of bottled water they left in the room, but like many other overpriced services at the hotel, we opted to not use them. Had we not been promised free Internet services, we surely would have used it less, as $12.95 is $3 more than I have paid for similar services in any hotel I have stayed at in the past decade, including those in New York City, Columbus, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Orlando and San Diego. Being summer, we were looking forward to using the hotel's pool. The stark reality of the pool, however, we as disappointing. While the pool on the 9th floor did provide an excellent view of Monument Circle, that did little to make up for the fact that it was badly in need of repair. Cracks were visible throughout, and the pool has no steps, only ladders. This made the pool inaccessible for my 8 year-old without my help. Worse, the ladders were no longer bolted properly to the side of the pool, making them less safe. The sharp drop-off of the pool made it less family-friendly, as well, so that I needed to keep my 11 year-old in a small confined area of the pool to ensure her safety. Our room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Unfortunately, the room had its share of problems, as well. The door jammed every time we used it, often requiring us to spend a full minute just to open it. There were signs the door had been modified with some metal attachments and that's why it stuck. Some of the electrical sockets had faulty wiring and would sometimes work and sometimes not, as I discovered when trying to charge my laptop and our cell-phones. The air-conditioning also malfunctioned several times, changing its output dramatically from night to night, without us changing the thermostat or settings. This resulted in us being freezing cold one night and sweating in bed the next. While I compliment the hotel staff for their general overall friendliness, this was overshadowed by their general lack of knowledge of what do when presented with requests. This was best illustrated when it came time to check out of the hotel. By the end of our stay, I wasn't surprised that our bill showed the charge for Internet service that we'd been told would be free as billed to our account. While courteous, it was clear the desk clerk had no idea about the issue. He then provided the last part of our dissatisfaction for our stay when we 'validated' our parking for the stay. I paid the fee and then went to our car. As we attempted to exit the lot and begin a 10 hour car ride, we found the system said our ticket indicated we had not paid. I stepped out of our car, walked directly through the glass doors and walked straight to the front desk. I then informed the clerk our ticket said we hadn't paid and wasn't allowing us to leave the lot. The clerk then offered that he could take my payment...FORGETTING THAT I HAD PAID HIM LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES AGO. When I pointed this out to him, he buzzed the front gate, allowing us to leave. In summary, my family and I left the Sheraton in Indianapolis having had a good time DESPITE our stay at the hotel, which I remain unhappy about now, over a week later. I have paid less to stay in better hotels in larger cities and gotten better service. I expected better of a Sheraton hotel than this and it has lowered my opinion of the chain as a whole. I know for certain we will NEVER stay at this hotel again and I will be more cautious at staying at any Sheraton in the future.", "Date": "August 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pelham, AL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "luvleightoo", "ReviewID": "UR19475906", "Content": "We stayed two different nights within the same 2 weeks.

It's about 5 feet at its shallow end and is a little cooler than what a indoor heated pool at some of the other hotels would be. Other than that, I really liked being able to swim outside and on the 9th floor!! Great view of the city from the pool deck. Very relaxing.

I suggest taking the additional insurance at your rental car company if you plan on parking at this hotel. I stayed at this hotel when it was a Radisson and I must say they have upgraded some features during the transition but are not done yet. While the changes such as bed linens and toiletries have been made, the rooms are still in need of remodeling. My room had an old air vent which made it difficult for me to sleep well, the carpet was also dingy and in need of replacement, the bathroom also needed retiling and my room had a dank smell like it use to be a smoking room or something. Oh yea\u2026 only a few of their elevators were working and the morning wait to get to the lobby was upwards of 5 minutes. On a better note the staff was very friendly and made up for the hotels physical appearance. Aside from the $2 charge for a small tube of toothpaste I was very pleased with the level of service I received. While self parking I ended up in a valet space because they were full. I let the bellmen know and they were very helpful, one of them moved my vehicle for me and the other one helped me with restaurant recommendations while I waited to get my keys back. They also have a Starbucks located in the lobby which is always a plus for me.

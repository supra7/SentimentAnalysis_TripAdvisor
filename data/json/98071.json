Appears that some undesirables live in the motel rooms and not on vacation. They were up al night pacing from one room to the other..banging on doors etc. Looks like it is a bad area and would not advise to walk out at night. The toilet had blood on it and the bath plug did not exsist , meaning I could not enjoy a nice soak after a long day. On the plus side, the cleaning ladies seemed really friendly and the bed was a good size and comfy. Overall I would advise not to stay here and choose another motel like motel 6 graceland, which seemed better..we chose not to saty at downtown after 1 night and moved onto motle 6 graceland.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHorrible\u201d", "Author": "JennSB", "ReviewID": "UR119206768", "Content": "I am writing this review as I am currently staying at this hotel.

We knew going in that Motel 6 was \"No Frills\", but we were primarily interested in this hotel's proximity to downtown Memphis - approximately 3-5 kms away. No frills means just that - no microwave, fridge, hair dryer, shampoo or iron. We were able to acquire an iron and blow dryer by leaving a $5.00 deposit for each. The rooms were clean and bright enough, while the hotel is also fenced in, probably to discourage the suspected drug dealers who periodically lingered nearby - but never bothered any of us. Parking was well lit and ample, while across the street was Japanese food which was quite good and reasonably priced, along with a Walgreens, Arbys and Burder King all nearby and within walking distance - DURING THE DAY ! CJ's was recommended by hotel staff as a good breakfast destination - the food was just OK, while waitress was terrible, and someone we never saw again after delivering our meal. Definately wouldn't recommend this restaurant ! Also at this hotel during tornado warnings, we did feel safe based on the concrete structure of this hotel, although the hotel staff were of little help in regards to any safety recommendations. If you're looking for a good location, with good value, just make sure you're prepared for the No Frills which await you, and you'll be fine. Also be smart in regards to personal safety, minimizing any walking around at night - particularly alone !", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cCheap but not scummy\u201d", "Author": "fvlb", "ReviewID": "UR91749664", "Content": "My hubby and I stayed here to watch the Dawgs lose at the Liberty Bowl. Check in was easy and everyone was nice. I have stayed in worse places for the $50 price. The location is great. It was a $10 (with tip) short cab ride to Beale Street. Everything we wanted was close. I didn't see any bed bugs or any other type of bugs and nothing was stolen. The shower was a nice surprise with great pressure. There are no hair dryers or fancy soaps..... it is a $50/nite motel. But for a $5 deposit you can rent a hair dryer from the front desk. My only real complaint is the room stunk of stale cigarettes. It really bothered my allergies (I am rarely exposed to smoke), so I had to benedryl up. If you want feather pillows, room service, and continental breakfast, then you will hate this place. If you just need a cheap and clean place to crash for a night or two, then this place might suit you.

My parents booked this hotel for the soul purpose of being cheap as we were staying there for 9 days. I should have left when on the 2nd night of our stay someone tried to break into our room while we were sleeping. We called security and they took over 15 minutes to arrive. Of course we made a complaint to the front desk but she had no sympathy for what had happened. This didn't happen once but TWICE. On our 7th night stay, they same thing happened, someone tried breaking into our room. They tried so hard that my father had to force the door shut with his own body weight. We had to make so much noise to try and alert other guests and hopefully that would scare off the intruder ( I apologise!) . We did call the police followed by the security. We should have left the moment the first attempted break-in happened but finding another hotel was impossible during Elvis week. Towels were never replaced and had to continually ask for them at the front desk. The washer/dryer damaged my clothing and the bed and pillows were like sleeping on rocks. Overall I was shocked to know that a hotel like this could still be in business. The staff were not at all concerned about the break-in attempts and replied to our complaints as: \"It happens\" Before booking this hotel, please ask yourself: \"Is my safety worth $50 a night?\"", "Date": "May 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "510Traveler", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for.\u201d", "Author": "510Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR10004993", "Content": "Another stop on our road trip out east... We stayed here one night because it was cheap ($50), close to downtown (~1.5 miles), and pet-friendly. It is the most simple place you will possibly find and good if all you want is JUST a bed to sleep in for the night. As soon as we drove up, I was regretting our decision... Then we got inside... there was a brown spot on one of the hand towels, NO bath towels, black specks (like cigarette ashes) all over the plastic that covers the plastic cup, small bathroom, cracked hole in one of the drawers, small bathroom, and NO internet access. We drove around the building once before finding the check-in office, where there was one lady behind a counter with a phone and a computer. Other than that, the place was pretty much bare. It was the only place we stayed at where we paid up front and got a receipt for our stay at check-in. The only thing that made us feel better was that we had our dog (the place is pet-friendly and does not charge a fee), as we felt unsafe otherwise. There was a party of beer-drinking \"white frat boys\" staying in a few rooms some doors down, hanging out in front of their rooms... seems like it might have a been a good stay for them?

When I first checked in the electronic key to my room did not work. I had to go back to the front desk for it to be reset. The lamp on the bedside table with the phone and phonebooks did not work.

Later on the maid came in and told me that she told the front desk the room was not ready (I checked in at 4:30PM on a Friday) and she put a quilt on the bed leaving the top part down exposing the pillows. The furniture had stains on them. The bathroom doorknob was loose and shaking. The next day at 10:33am the maid knocked on the door and I told her to come back later that we were out late. She never came back and told the front desk that I said I did not want my room cleaned. I had to go to the front desk to get me clean towels and soap.

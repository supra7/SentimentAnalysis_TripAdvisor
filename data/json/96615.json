Location was good, near Hwy 65, right on the strip, and just down the street from the Landing. When we got to the hotel, we checked in with David, who was very friendly our two nights there. Check-in was fast. However, when we got up to the room we noticed a strange smell right away. It wasn't overpowering, but still very noticeable, so much so that we didn't want to stay in that room for 2 nights. We called down to David, and he got us another room, which was much better. Rooms were nice, seemed recently updated. However, as a review before mentions, the showers are very small. Not what you would normally get at a hotel. But, all was clean and comfortable. Besides the shower, our only other concern was the TV in the room, which had horrible signal. We lost signal every few mintues sometimes, and at first we were not even able to get the tv to turn on. Not wanting to move again, I pulled the dresser out and unpluggd the tv, and plugged in back in myself, which seemed to fix the problem. But the reception was still bad, which was frustrating. Didn't use the pool, but it seemed nice for kids. Fitness room was small but sufficent for running/walking. No weights or anything. Breakfast was good. Hard-boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, waffles, fruit, cereal, juice, etc. Because of our issues with the first room, the shower, and the tv, I'm just giving an average rating.

Overall nice clean room, nothing real fancy except I had a King room which came with a Jacuzzi which I did not use because it was very hot (103+) when I was there. Room was clean, modern and comfortable. Staff were very friendly and helpful, especially with directing me around bad traffic spots and to local (non-chain) places to eat. Exercise room and pool were quite modest. Breakfast was the standard fare continental with the exception of a can of whipped cream and some strawberries with heavy syrup by the waffle machine; this made them into \"Belgian Waffles\". After my 1st morning I just took advantage of the many fine breakfast buffets available on the Strip. Worst part about the experience was getting on and off the property.

After checking in we left and arrived back at the hotel around 11 P.M., when I entered the lobby I was greeted by an older gentleman and I asked if we could have some extra pillows and blankets for our room.

The location is really easy to find and is convenient, close to the highway and near the Downtown area and the Branson Landing. Although it is technically on the Branson Strip, it's fairly far from where the tourist attractions are. Check-in was quick, the older lady was very friendly and even offered good advice on a little pizza place that was very good. I went up to my room and noticed that the elevator (only one) was fairly old and was not kept up. When I gotto my floor, I noticed scuffs up and down the hallway walls, which was surprising since the carpeting looked fairly new. I got to my room, and noticed some newer furniture and a nice TV. So far, so good. Looking in the bathroom, the spa tub from the 1980's stuck out like a sore thumb. New sink, new tile, but old tub, and the jetted tub didn't work - where the controls were supposed to be, only a blank wall plate. Oh well, no spa tub for me. But what that did is leave a small, outdated tub. The room was warm, so I turned the A/C on. It ran for a few minutes, then quit. Seems that the AC units cycle off a bit. I turned the fan on, lowered the thermostat to 65, but it still seemed to be on some kind of timer? I'm glad it wasn't August... The room itself was very nice, with newer carpeting and furniture. TV reception was pretty bad, though - I kept losing the TV signal. Wifi worked pretty well. A while later, I noticed I had forgotten shaving cream and a comb. Well, with the standard \"Forgot Something?\" sign in the bathroom offering compimentary toiletries, I called the front desk. Comb was a go, but the younger lady informed me they didn't have any shaving cream, but conditioner works well. No thanks. What bugged me here is that she told me \"if you want one (comb), come down and get one.\". I headed down, wondering why someone couldn't bring one up, when I discoved the clerk (a different gal than earlier) chatting with friends and eating her dinner. Ah, customer service at its best. What really caused the review to be marginal is the breakfast offered. The standard waffle maker and continental fare was laid out and looked good (in addition to biscuits and gravy), but after cooking my waffle and dishing out a biscuit and gravy, they tasted awful. I don't know how you can mess up waffle batter, but they did. The gravy tasted off as well, all confirmed with a travel companion I was with. I only ate a couple of bites before throwing away my plate and heading to McDonald's down the street.

However, the parking lot wasn't fully scraped and the sidewalks were a bit icy (potential hazard). The beds and pillows were comfortable, and I was 8 months pregnant at the time and have difficulty getting comfortable in my condition. However, the heater was loud and refrigerator made random noises. Our room was a king size bed with a jacuzzi, and was unfortunately right next to the fitness room. We were awakened very early the next morning by guests working out on the equipment and loud sounds of running water. The continental breakfast was a free and was typical based on my experience in various hotels (muffins, cereal, juice, yogurt, french toast, etc). The staff was extremely friendly and courteous during the entire stay. The shower is extremely small and extremely difficult to maneuver in for a tall and pregant woman. My husband also complained about it's size though. I was able to relax in the jacuzzi later and worked great and had hot water. Spent day out and didn't get back until late and my husband had to park extremely far away and not in an area designated for parking because the lot was full (since the snow hadn't all been removed, it was taking a lot of space). Luckily we weren't towed though. During our second night, the sounds of running water continued to be quite loud and would often wake me up. My husband had no problems (but he sleeps through almost anything). The morning shower on the second day was impossible - there was literally no hot water and the front desk stated that they were almost at full capacity and apologized for the inconvenience. Also realized that morning that our refrigerator didn't actually work and our food that we had put in it the night before was spoiled. For two nights, our visit was about $155 total. Based on prices for other hotels in the area, we had a great price - so I'm not one to complain about a few inconviences. Was a great location for going to both Branson Landing and the main road of Branson attractions. Room was completely clean and I didn't see any bugs that others have spoke of. Since it was during the off-season, I would think that the hot water issue should definitely be addressed though.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olathe, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cmake sure you know what you're getting before staying here\"\u201d", "Author": "crane58", "ReviewID": "UR92005095", "Content": "i found an offer on email I got from Branson tourist info for a New Years Eve package offer from the Baymont Inn and Suites-get commemorative glasses, bottle of sparkling wine, continental bkfst and transportation to and back from the Legends show. what they neglected to tell me when I called and made the reservation was that I had to make my own reservations for show. stupid me-I thought that when I booked they would do that and I would pay on arrival. they also neglected to tell me that there was an extra charge to take us there-the venue is less than 6 blocks away- and pick us up.

This hotel used to be the Holiday Inn Express several years ago. The hotel staff was extremely friendly. The hotel was not crowded as it was the off season. I was not impressed with the price. I had booked a two night stay in which I was given an online discount (from the hotels website) of 51.00 per night for staying two or more nights. A single night was about 69.00. We decided to arrive one night early. They would not give me the two or more night rate as it was a different reservation. The clerk did give me the AAA discount though. The lobby was clean, our room was on the third floor. The hotel has 5 floors. There was only one elevator but it was quick. Upon entering the room, it was very clean. We walked around in socks, and they did not turn black so the carpet was clean. The flat screen LCD tv's were a nice touch with full cable and a lot of channels. I did use the WIFI and it worked good and fast. Our room faced away from the highway so there was no traffic noise. The heater was a little bit louder than I was used too. Also you could hear the foot traffic in the hallway a bit more than some other places. The beds were comfy and came with 4 pillows each. The bathroom was clean and had a jet tub. However, I am 6'0 tall and I could easily touch the ceiling with my hands. The shower nozzle would be lower than most but I made do with it. The water pressure was good but the water temp was not consistant. I like hot water but out of nowhere the water turned extremely hot and then went back to where I had it set. I noticed it did this the next day as well. So be careful with that. The continental breakfast included dry cereal, breads, fruits, and waffles and slices of french toast to be put in the toaster. I had the french toast each day. There was also apple and orange juice and even hot cocoa which my daughter loved. Yea it was free so it was good for me.

The driver was having a discussion with a female hospitality worker who was very obviously pregnant... and smoking a cigarette. The other hospitality workers were inside the lobby sitting on the couches, waiting on their rides home, talking loudly to each other and just, overall, acting obnoxious.

We arrived shortly before check-in time, but they had a room ready for us. The front desk attendant was friendly and informative. The lady who put out the complimentary breakfast was also very friendly and helpful (usually this person is nowhere to be found). The room was clean, spacious, and tastefully decorated. The TV was up-to-date, and the bed was comfortable. If I had a suggestion to make, I'd say more lighting.

It was very easy to find off of the main highway and was located near everything we wanted to see. The rate was very low, making me wonder if it could be as good a quality as we wanted. We arrived late and were welcomed by the staff there. Even though it was after hours, the staffperson on duty let my children swim anyway and even gave us cocoa afterward! Our room could not have been cleaner had it been the White House. The breakfast in the morning was wonderful, had some healthy choices as well as not so healthy :). We had a great time and I would highly reccomend anyone who is going to Branson to stay with the Baymont Inn. I had read some reviews that were not so positive but they must have been before the renovation last Fall. The entire hotel looked new, clean, and nice and the staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable, had a good time, and had everything we needed.

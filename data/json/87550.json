Staffs at the front desk and breakfast area are very nice. The room is spacious. However, the carpet and the walls need remodeling. There are white stains on the carpet, and later the front desk lady told me those could be paint stains from remodeling. I found two things different from the Expedia description. First, the front desk hour ends at midnight, not 24-hour. Second, the breakfast selection is much better than in the picture!", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for the price-worth going out of your way!\u201d", "Author": "Jsgulbrandson", "ReviewID": "UR122081894", "Content": "My husband and I were traveling with our two small children over Christmas when we came unexpectedly upon a need for a hotel.

I usually go with hotels I am familiar with and comfortable with, as well as the free breakfast! In this case I still wanted the free breakfast, but outside of that I was open. I plugged in my GPS and asked for a list of hotels, scrolled through and found \"Comfort Inn\", which I knew had a free breakfast. When I called, the clerk answered \"Quality Inn\". My GPS has not been uploaded for new info for a long time. I asked \"Do you have something for tonight?\", and he said yes. \"Do you serve free breakfast?\", and he said yes again. So we drove over there. There was very little to complain about. For $80.99 plus tax, we had a double with a box TV and a bath. The beds were comfortable, the TV worked, and the toilet flushed. The room was very clean, and the pool and hot tub, while I didn't use them, were observed to be clean and warm. Breakfast was served from 7:00 to 10:00. They served biscuits and gravy, do-it-yourself waffles, hard boiled eggs, assorted sweetrolls, donuts and English Muffins, dry cereal, juice and coffee. The coffee was great! There was no hot oatmeal, and that was a disappointment, but the serving area was small. The staff seemed friendly and accommodating, and they weren't very busy. In fact I doubt even half of their rooms were taken. The hotel was very quiet, and there was plenty of parking in a small lot on this Friday night. If there was anything to complain about, it was the size of the bathroom. To get to the shower we had to close the door, and closing the door meant a tight squeeze. I was also a little perturbed that the water pressure at the bathroom sink was weak. However design flaws and water saver faucets go back to senior management, not local staff. The carpeting in the dining area was bunched and wrinkled, but staff there said someone had bought the hotel and it was going to be completely rehabbed soon. From my experience, there didn't seem the need to rehab too much.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoud, bland rooms, small parking lot\u201d", "Author": "Meecea1", "ReviewID": "UR117448076", "Content": "Parking lot is somewhat small.

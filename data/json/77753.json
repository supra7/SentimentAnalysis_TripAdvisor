The guy at the front desk then changed me to a room on the 14th floor and it was only just \"really bad.\" Both rooms had stains on the carpet, dust on the fixtures, and the aura of doom.

I had originally planned on staying at some cheap Rodeway Inn or something that was out in some desolate industrial area and had a beyond rude Indian guy there who tried to raise the rate up to 89 a night from the original 59.. I just wanted to not drive around anymore because I started seeing more and more Florencia 13 gang markings and figured I'm going the wrong direction lol. Every other place we called that night wanted like 79 or 89, it was pretty rediculous. So I called this place and figured for $59 it would be a total dump but being downtown and not in some gang turf, I didnt care. I was really surprised it has some look of elegance in the lobby, and feel of an old historic hotel. The room was on the 14th floor, and the window opens up the entire way. Not something normally seen at high story hotels. It had a very close view of downtown skyline being there on 7th street. The shower required that you be about 3 ft 11 or less and one leg half length of the other in order to really be comfortable in it. It was slanted halfway at the bottom and 2 different heights and the shower was chest level standing on the lower area of tub. Other than that, hey it was a room in a central location close to everything, at a very low price.

I have read tons of negative reviews of this hotel ahead of my visit and that made me nervous of course. I have lowered my expectations then in order not to get disappointed as soon as I get the first-hand experience of what most people refer to as awful service and bad stay in this hotel. First and foremost, the value is unbeatable. It is very reasonable and considering that most holidays are all about outdoor activities,you don't really need a huge, grandiose and elegant hotel - you will only use it for sleeping and a bit of shower. Apart from the price, I thought most of the staff were very pleasant too. Juliana, the hotel manager, was exceptionally nice even before my visit as I had loads of questions through email. The concierge and the housekeepers were also friendly, warm and welcoming. The state of the rooms, I have no issues with. I stayed in a Queen Deluxe room which perhaps may have explained why the state looks perfect and flawless. Should I have stayed in one of the standard rooms, then maybe I could have spotted something else. Nevertheless, it was a good hotel to stay if you are just after the touristy spots. The neighbourhood was my only problem. If you're looking to do daytime activities, this is ok for you it if you are looking for a fun and entertaining night life, I wouldn't recommend not just this hotel but the whole of downtown as the whole environment is dodgy, full of scary homeless people who, any minute, might just grab and hurt you.

Overall, our stay was fine. If booked through online discounters, it's good value. The neighborhood is a little rough, but typical of downtown fringes. Plenty of grocers and cafes, and only a couple of blocks easy walk from the high-rises, a half hour by foot from City Hall, etc. - 5 minutes by cab. Reception was efficient and friendly. The concierge helpful. Room was OK, though AC struggled on a hot LA day and a couple of drawer pulls were missing from the dresser. The \"king\" bed was double+twin mattresses pushed together with king-size linens. Firm but a good sleep. Limited amenities and plenty of towels. Housekeeping was fine with clean floors and tub. We recommend the top floors because the mid-sized windows both open a bit to let in fresh air and offer a superb view of downtown LA. Inside parking is an additional $10/day with easy in-and-out. The one disappointment was breakfast which came from a simple menu and was uninspired and lethargic, despite a nearly-empty restaurant. Ham from a processed loaf doesn't qualify as ham, just luncheon meat. Didn't get to try their lunches, and it's closed for dinner. There are also banquet and meeting facilities. The Historic Mayfair is good for a visit to downtown LA when having an inexpensive but decent place to sleep and clean up is the main requirement.

The bathroom was sooo small we had to step into the tub to shut the door. The furniture and ac looked like it had been there since the 60's. We called the front desk to get a different room and we were told that there was nothing he could do. We called Hotels.com, that's who booked our reservation and they said that it was up to the hotel as to whether we could get a decent room. So the next morning we spoke with Juliaanna the front desk mgr. and she gave us a new room that was larger. The problem was that the ac was broken and we were told to go out for a few hours and they would have the ac fixed. We came back 6 hrs later to find a room that was hotter than it was outside by about 15 degrees at about 80 degrees. We called the front desk and they told us it would get fixed in the morning. Then the engineering guy said that he couldn't figure out why they gave us this room because the ac had been broken for months. We then called Hotels.com and told them about the problems and that we wanted to cancel the rest of our stay and get a refund so that we could go to a better hotel. Hotels.com said that if the Mayfair didn't want to refund us the money for next three nights that there was nothing that they could do. Hotels.com did nothing to help us at all. The Mayfair would not refund us for the next three nights. So we were stuck in a hot room. The next day we get a knock on the door from engineering to let us know that the ac couldn't be fixed until the following Monday because of the 4th of July and that the parts place was closed. So they moved us to our third room in three nights and that's where we stayed at least the ac worked. So let's recap, rooms in bad shape, the front desk staff is curt except for the graveyard shift.

Bad - you are very lucky if reception answers the phone at all when ringing from your room .I've gone downstairs after ringing for over an hour to find an empty lobby and the 3 people doing nothing behind the desk said they were too busy. This is a regular occurence. If you can't be bothered going down then ring from your cell. - most staff have a don't care attitude. If you need anything ask for Bing, she is the only one who seems to care. Maintenence are also pretty quick to respond, their no. is on the phone. The owners and management are very hard to pin down so don't bother - instead of evacuating guests during the recent earthquake, all staff downstairs ran for the door. The building also shook, creaked and swayed like a drunken 90 year old. - if there is a quake above 6 this building will most likely come down, check out the huge cracks in the building - smoking rooms have no ashtrays and have burns on the edges of the furniture - some rooms and bathrooms are very tiny and outdated - a lot of the TV remotes don't work, ring maintenence - some rooms have no ironing or coffee facilities, keep ringing maintenence if this happens - some beds are rock hard and will cause neck/back problems if you sleep on your side - thin, old curtains let in lots of light - walls are very thin - lots of noise on 7th St side from traffic and the Church across the road - the 3 elevators are very old and break down all the time. Sometimes there are only 1 or 2 working and you can wait up to 6-7 minutes to get in. The cleaners also block the doors to keep them on the floor they are working which doesn't help. Good - cheap, from $870 for a monthly rate on a smaller room - 5 min walk to Downtown - most rooms have a full-size refrigerator and microwave which can save a bit of money on eating out. - some rooms and bathrooms are quite spacious. For a small room with a huuuuge bathroom, ask for a corner room on the SW side. for a bigger room with medium bathroom ask for a corner room on the North East corner - rooms are quite clean, haven't had any problems with bed bugs which is highly unusual for any hotel. Carpets are steam cleaned pretty often. - cleaners don't steal your money or possesions when you leave them lying around, although I wouldn't recommend this - restaurant is fairly good value but don't bother with room service - closets are fairly spacious, even for a resident - everyone says it's a dodgy area which 2 years ago it probably was. I'm very small and walk around the area nearly every night and have never once felt threatened. I've found the people around the area to be very hospitable and polite. - unlike the Downtown hotels there are no beggars or homeless people residing near the entrance. - the bar downstairs is very cheap. - internet service is excellent most of the time, very quick and very cheap ($20 per month). Not sure of the nightly rate I reside here so it cant be too bad. The very cheap monthly rates outweigh the bad points for me.

Despite that I had a number of questions and called to change my reservation several times (including in the middle of the night), the employee who assisted me was always helpful, informative, and cheery. I had chosen this hotel in particular because of the other reviews (that the hotel was old but clean and small but affordable) and was actually looking forward to writing mine even while staying in the room--it was everything I hoped that it would be. When we arrived we were able to park quickly in their garage, which was easy to find and accessible. The parking is $10 a day, which you can include in your room's bill, and there is an attendant on duty 24 hours which made me feel much safer about my van. We had a slight issue due to the cartop carrier making my van higher than the height limit, but the hotel rectified this quickly, allowing us to park in a reserved spot just inside the door where we could fit (I later learned this was the hotel manager's spot, and if he ever reads this I'd like to thank him for allowing us to do this.) The lobby was white and clean with marble floors, comfortable chairs, and a grand piano. They have a large collection of art decorating many of the walls, and three extremely fast elevators that saved me several times when I'd been running late. Check-in went smoothly, and we got into our room. I will agree that these rooms are SMALL. We had rented a room with two double beds, and with four of us in there we were very cramped. Everything was very clean, comfortable, and elegant, however, and the staff responded very quickly to our requests, so it was actually a good value for the money. The shower had a...strange issue. It tended to alternate between warm and cool water, but it allowed enough time between changes for me to get the job done so I wasn't terribly concerned. On the third night we decided to move into a Junior Suite so that we'd have a bit more room, and this made a world of difference. If you have the budget, I'd strongly suggest booking one of the Mayfair's suites, because for the same price that you'd pay for a regular room at most of the other downtown hotels you get double the space, two bathrooms, two closets, an extra TV, a microwave, refrigerator, and a couch that pulls out into a bed. Each pair of us was able to take our own half of the suite and close the door between the two halves for a welcome bit of privacy and extra bed-space. For only an extra $35 per night we essentially got an entire extra room. Beyond the cleanliness and value, I had MANY exceptional encounters with the staff, who very quickly were able to take care of needs ranging from moving us to our new room, finding us an all-night Thai restaurant that delivered, and locating a screwdriver that I borrowed for a last minute fix to one of our convention business displays. I do agree that the neighborhood is rough. However, it is not scary so much as it is just OLD and somewhat dirty, which is a strange contrast to how it looks just a few blocks down across the highway. I did go out at night, however, several times, and did not have any real issues. If you are staying at the Mayfair for a convention, I would recommend against walking (it is somewhat far.) We took our van daily to the convention center and parked it there for $12, which was cheaper than a taxi two-ways and more than worth the cost to not have the inconvenience of that distance on our feet. I found it a great place to stay for the convention, however, because the distance kept away the majority of the crowds and allowed me to relax easier at night without worrying about noise or parking. Because of the Mayfair hotel, I'm already looking forward to next years trip to LA.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine", "Title": "\u201cNot the best place to stay...\u201d", "Author": "lobstahgal", "ReviewID": "UR17784374", "Content": "Our family attended the Rotary convention.

Two employees were behind the desk but one was eating from a to-go box and the other was quite slow in accomplishing even simple tasks. Once registered, though, it was downhill.

When we went to the first of the rooms and used our card to open the door we scared the hell out of a small Chinese woman who had already occupied the room. We backed out apologizing but, when we went back to the desk to get a new room and complain, we were pretty much just ignored save to give us a new card for a new room. and then their attention went to the next \"guest\" in line No one said anything about the abysmal level of professionalism that this mistake made plain. The so-called \"Queen\" bed was in an extremely small room and was no wider than a standard double bed and still only left about one foot between the bed and the walls. The shower and tub (which they advertised as a \"bathtub\") was 32 inches wide and 36 inches long (give or take 2 inches). That was, even as a stretch of the imagination, not a tub. We ate at the hotel's restaurant and found that the food quality was less than average and the service left us sitting for 5-10 minutes waiting for a simple coffee refill. The waffles had no real taste and the eggs were overcooked and cold. All in all I would strongly recommend against staying at this hotel. Between the staff's incompetence and the hotel's definition of a Queen bed and a \"deluxe\" room you would be much better served to save the overpriced rates and just stay at a Comfort Inn or a Motel 6.

Almost, if any bigger, than a janitors room. The bed was right next to the door, the tv was right in frotn of the bed with arms reach, and the bath room was next to the door. Ok we dealt with that. We check the bath room. I was able to stretch my arms from one side of the wall to the other, that included their sink, their toilet, and their bath/shower. We layed ready for bed, so just hear the springs popping under the matress. Then you could hear people coughing, sitting on their beds, talking, and you could hear everything through their walls.

Then on the way out, we ran into a cute couple of 3, females wearing see thru underwear and a see thru shirt into their parking lot, through their hotel, and back to somewhere where some very interested hotel workers followed to the unknown area of the parking lot.

The front desk manager was very polite and helpful. The parking garage attendant was also polite and helpful. There is a $7.75/day fee to park, but it was definitely worth it, and we always found a spot, no matter what time of day. (We came and went a lot.) The neighborhood is on the edge of downtown, but the convenient DASH bus will pick you up directly across the street from the hotel lobby if you are going to other downtown locations. (And it only costs a quarter to ride.) Anyway, the blocks that are adjacent to the hotel aren't terrific. I don't think I'd feel safe walking alone after dark, for instance. But during the day there is so much traffic and hustle-and-bustle that it wasn't a problem. If you park in the garage, you don't ever have to walk on the street. There is an entrance from the garage to the hotel. Our room was on a non-smoking floor, thank goodness, and had a nice view of the city. We could see the Hollywood sign in the distance. The building is old, but shabby bathrooms and carpet don't really bug me. It was clean and comfortable. There was a coffee pot and ironing board in the room, plenty of fresh towels, decent pillows, comfortable mattress, etc. The television was fine. My only complaints are of a stale odor in the room (probably from the old carpet) and the shower head was for short people. I am 5' 8\" and had to stoop. Oh, one other complaint, actually: we tried to call the front desk and the hotel operator to ask a question, and no one ever answered the phone even after 20+ rings. That was kind of disconcerting. But the staff in the lobby was helpful. There is a concierge as well as front desk attendants. Bottom line: this place is dirt cheap, so if you aren't picky about luxury accomodations and want a central location in L.A., the Mayfair is a steal.", "Date": "February 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "halifax", "Title": "\u201cBetter than what it looks like from reviews\u201d", "Author": "Sarah2855", "ReviewID": "UR5900106", "Content": "I booked this hotel and then read the reviews written about the hotel.

The good part of that is that you don't have to deal with any of the vagrant downtown crowd panhandling while waiting for buses. The bad part is that you aren't near anything and it is unwise to walk anywhere at any time of day. There are some run down apartments on both sides of the hotel and several hotels across the street charge hourly rates. These were all strategically omitted from any of the pictures you will see of the hotel. The lobby of the hotel is very fancy looking and has 24 hour security which does a good job of keeping non-hotel guests out. The hotel also has an attached parking garage with 24 hour security at a reasonable daily rate for downtown ($5). The rooms are nothing more than utilitarian, and the complaint about the old musty air conditioners is valid. Mine broke and leaked water everywhere and I was forced to change rooms during the middle of my stay. In a city where a Super 8 can run you $90/night, the room is not a terrible value, especially in comparison to the typical chain hotels in the area (Holiday Inn, Hilton Checkers, etc).

We were in LA for the Pac 10 tourney and we did get a rental car so that we could drive around and do some site seeing in our free time. We ended up walking to Staples Center and back to the hotel on the third and last day of games because we saw nothing threatening about it.

The main reason we walked was that no one told us that the US runs on small change. The buses and trains required EXACT change but no shops would give you any unless you bought something. One bus driver had us begging other passengers for change. When we finally got the hang of holding our coins for public transport there was a 'dash' bus right at the front door that joined buses for any part of LA at a quarter (25c) a ride. Our room was much larger than we expected (and as it turned out larger than all but 1 other room we had on our world trip) but it wasn't huge either. The coffee/tea percolator in our room was great but I baulk at powdered coffee whitener. The bathroom was fine and the decor rustic.

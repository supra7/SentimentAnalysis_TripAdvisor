Check-in was easy and nice, and they are great about allowing dogs. The hotel, room, bathroom was very...tired. I just think this Fairmont is in need of a facelift. We stayed in a suite, which was large, but it just had an \"old\" feeling to it. They really need to do an upgrade to this hotel and restore it to its previous grandeur. I remember coming to brunch here as a kid, and it being the nicest hotel around. It's still nice, but not the immaculate, to-the-nines Fairmont that I am used to staying in all the time (DC). We did have some issues with their service (they made me chase down people in the lobby and then the bar to get a corkscrew), but the manager rectified the situation upon checkout and was very professional about the issue.

I have stayed at Fairmonts around the world. As I type this, it is with the background of being a fan and the sadness that this was the worst stay I have ever had at a Fairmont. I struggled with the thought of not posting this, because it may taint the Fairmont brand, but rethought since I feel this site deserves honesty. I stayed at this hotel for a week over Christmas. I was first escorted up to my room by a very nice bellman, JD. The ice machine outside my room was broken and the whole hallway smelled of must/mould. The fan used in the hallway to clear/dry up the leak was very loud and could be heard through my room door. Although the suite was a recently renovated space and as lovely as it was, it was as if someone had stopped renovating/decorating it right before the last of the finishing touches were done. There was one phone in the whole suite, no lamp on the phone table in the living area, toiletries were incomplete and the musty smell was intolerable. I asked for another room. When JD moved me again, I have to say, I was exhausted from my trip-I had been up 36 hours by this time and I just wanted to go to sleep. This was not easy-my new room,1201 had: a leaky tub faucet ( I had to close the door to not hear it) a torn arm chair arm no recycling basket the note pad stuck to a spill on the end table which also was missing the finish in several places the garbage was missing in the bedroom there was a paint chip missing out of the door at eye level the toiletries were mixed up (no lotion but 2 body washes) I was ill on the on the second day of my stay, so I did not want people coming in and out of my room. I called down later to let the front desk know of the tap and the end table issues only, because at that point, I had not seen the other problems. When I returned later to my room the third day, I saw that none of the issues had been dealt with. In addition, I then saw the torn chair arm. I had a friend coming to visit me and I had been bragging on the Fairmont chain; this was embarrassing. I asked for a new room and came to be in 1600. Daniel was excellent in helping me move-very kind and professional. He is proud to work for the chain. I began to feel better about my Fairmont brand. He helped me set up-again. Whenever he saw me, he always said hi and asked if he could be of service. I looked around my new suite and found that the end table was also missing several chunks of finish and had black stains on it. I asked for a new table-for two days. It never came. The TV in the bedroom had no cable but was eventually fixed. The toiletries were mixed-Miller Harris with their new brand. I never knew if I would find small bottled water in this room or not. In the other room (1201) there were always several bottles-very inconsistent housekeeping. The portable phone by the bed did not work nor did the remote control for the TV in the living room. I asked for them both to be dealt with- the remote was but the portable phone still did not work. I let Royal service know and said that could be addressed tomorrow. Later that night, a manager and a maintenance fellow showed up with a new phone. I said I could live without it for the evening and was getting ready for bed, could they come back tomorrow? I did appreciate the fruit tray sent to 1600, but housekeeping left it in the room for 3 days and things were beginning to mould. I left the lid off the tray to indicate removal-but I guess I needed to put a note on it for it to be taken away. I am assuming the tray was an apology? I called down to find out why it was in my room, but the clerk didn't seem to know why. I can say the food and the fellow who delivered the room service were great as were all of the valet staff. Sadly, the rest of my stay did not match. When I let management know, they apologized by email and offered me one free future night in a suite -for the whole week of issues and having had to move three times in said week. In my many Fairmont experiences, this hotel is NOT up to the brand name or attention to detail or quality experience.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe maids steal and the food sucks\u201d", "Author": "FairmontSucks4", "ReviewID": "UR125682136", "Content": "I am from Dallas and have been to all of the nicer hotels downtown for business...

Before our visit I arranged with Phillip in the concierge dept an in room massage for my husband and I. He was also very helpful with other information. We arrived and were treated like royalty! Very helpful staff & friendly! The hotel is aged a little but the customer service makes up for it hands down!! The bed was very comfortable & the liens soft. Room was very clean. The only issue I had was that the massage therapist named Sarah tried to cheat me on my 90 min massage but Phillip not only adjusted the different between the 60 massage I received but also took off the amount of the tip that I gave her plus more!!! He was one of the best concierge's I have ever had the privilege to work with. Everyone really cared to listen to me and made me feel very important. So the only suggestion I would recommend is that if you get an in room massage which is pricey but sooooo worth it, is to make sure the therapist can come up shortly before your schedule time and reenforce the time amount with the therapist. Check the time before & after. If they cheat you then take it up with them at that time. Also don't pay them directly charge it to your room so if you do have an issue with them the hotel can address it.

My husband and I, on a budget, thought that this hotel looked really nice online, the price was nice, so we figured why not! When we arrived we found out they had MANDATORY valet parking (which yes is very nice and convenient, but NOT when you didn't budget for it!) This service at a whopping 26$ a day, took a little chunk out of our spending money. (Nowhere on their website or Orbitz did I see this information) Next, we brought our dog, which the hotel so nicely accepted. Surprise! There was a 25$ a DAY fee for that too! Another chunk out of our spending money. (Once again NEVER mentioned) After checking in, yes this hotel is BEAUTIFUL. But I was very disappointed with our room. It was very small. I have had much bigger hotel rooms for the price. When we walked in our hotel room was very warm and stuffy. We immediately turned the AC on and turned it down low. (Yes it's cold weather outside, but we like to stay cool and snuggle in blankets). After leaving for a few hours, then coming back, our room was still super stuffy! We called the front desk and they sent someone to fix it. He came up, \"fixed it\" and left. Let's just skip forward about 2 hours, after they showed us 3 other rooms, tried to fix it again, to finally the front desk calls us and says the AC is completely turned off in the wintertime. TURNED OFF. They said they could give us a box fan. And move us down a few floors, maybe it will be cooler. A BOX FAN. So we sat in our small hotel room with a dusty box fan from maintenance. On a side note, when we moved rooms, since we packed up in a hurry, we had accidently grabbed the remote from the first room. When we realized it, we took it down to the front desk and told them about the mix up. Later we checked our bank, they had already charged us for that remote!! They had just issued a credit. We were still in the hotel and they didn't even ask, they just charged us. Also, that's about the time we noticed they had put a $150 hold on our account for \"just in case\". Now seriously, I understand this is a fancy hotel. I just wish all these crazy fees would have been listed!! Through all of these unknown fees, we ended up paying about 60$ a night MORE than we originally bought. We will never stay here again, no one could give us a straight answer and they did nothing to help us with the AC. Our stay was terrible all because of this hotel.

Le Labo products have a nice consistency with a faint---almost unisex---rose smell.

We booked rooms which gave us access to the Gold Lounge as it meant some free food and free access to the internet, so we could book in online to our flight, but we could not recommend this hotel enough. The first day we got there, my friend and I went straight to the lounge while our other halves dropped the car back to the rental company. It was so nice to relax there after our hectic week. When the men came back we had a few drinks and the evening nibbles were served. We didn't need to get any dinner after this. We then went down to the pool as they were showing 'Ghostbusters' against a wall down by the pool. Picture quality was not as good as a cinema, but the sound was excellent and the whole experience was wonderful. We had a few cocktails and popcorn and there were some people dressed up as Ghostbusters as well. It was a great atmosphere! The rooms were very nice, our view was of a freeway and part of the city, looking towards the Hard Rock Cafe/Hooters area, but it also looked towards the setting sun and the sunset was beautiful. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable and huge. The Gold Lounge was the best thing about the stay though. You are told when you first enter that you should treat the lounge as an extension of your room. It includes a living room area on one side, with TV, books and internet access (1 terminal). On the other side are tables and the kitchen, which always has food available and drinks. Soft drinks are free, but alcohol is not, it is an honesty bar, so you write down what you have and your room number. The food served in the lounge was delicious, breakfast has a great selection and was very tasty. Once breakfast was finished there was tortilla soup and some other bits available, including sweet stuff, the tortilla soup was outstanding. In the evening there was hot and cold food, the first night included mini pots of macaroni cheese, that were so delicious, I think it had truffle oil in it - YUM! You can order food from the restaurant up to the Gold Lounge as you would to your room as well. The lounge is never over crowded as only 3 floors, which means about 30ish rooms have access to it and the 2 ladies who were looking after the lounge in the time we stayed there were so wonderful.

What ensued was 30 minutes of \"deer in headlights\" looks from hotel staff, including concierge, with very little explanation as to what was being done and what to expects if my bags could not be found. All I was told was that if my bags were found they would be shipped to me at no charge. Nobody said they were sorry for the inconvenience, gave me their name, business card, phone number so that I could follow up, etc. Throughout I had the feeling that everyone just wished I would go away. When I mentioned that I missed my airport shuttle I was told that I should just take the next one. When a woman from security took pity on me and put me in the cab she got evil looks from concierge as if she was doing something totally unacceptable. The good news was that just as I was about to leave for the airport without my bags, the shuttle driver returning from the airport arrived with the missing luggage.

Pros: The \"Gold\" club floor lounge is one of the best I've experienced. I normally stay at Starwood properties (Westin, Le Meridien, Sheraton). It's definitely better than almost all of the Westin/ Sheraton Lounges, and almost as good as what I've seen at Ritz Carlton. The afternoon food service included fruits, cheeses, tuna tartare, bacon mac n' cheese, and great mashed potatoes. There's an honor bar (you should pay for what you drink). Breakfast was similarly impressive. It rivals the full size buffet of many hotels--scrambled eggs, scrambled omelets, two kinds of sausage, bacon, hash browns, cold cuts, smoked salmon, cheese, fresh fruit, oatmeal, cereal, lots of juices and so on. Really great food service here. Cons: The air conditioning is questionable. My room must have been 85 degrees when I checked in and was still at least 80 at midnight. I had a corner room on the 19th (highest) floor. It had two sets of large windows and only one inadequate air vent. The hotel engineer brought a Lasko box fan and poked the vents when I complained about the heat. Eventually, the hotel moved me to the 17th floor where the air conditioning was much better (this whole ordeal took about an hour between 11pm and midnight). It was 105 degrees outside when I checked in at 3pm. Rooms are \"met expectations\" for a 4 star hotel. The king room I originally had was spacious enough and almost junior suite like with its small work area separate from the bedroom. The bathrooms are small and have only a walk-in shower. The fixtures are average for a 4 star hotel (granite vanity, Restoration Hardware like fixtures). Really, the bathroom reminded me of a newer Westin (which I think is good). The work chairs on the Gold rooms are Herman Miller \"Embody\" chairs which are very ergonomic. In juxtaposition, the work table is too high to be ergonomic and the crossbeam supports underneath are routinely hitting my legs as I write this -- this is very annoying. Check-out at the Gold floor lounge was pleasant. The staff comped my parking ($22) and alcohol charges due to the inconvenience. I am undecided as to whether I will stay here again.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach, VA", "Title": "\u201cNothing to do. . .\u201d", "Author": "sawsan22", "ReviewID": "UR115900482", "Content": "Hotel was nice and clean, yet, the surrounding area offers nothing.

Careful what you ask for from the beer menu - they had none of the bottles listed on the menu that I asked for - and I asked for four different brews. (3) The room was spotless and cleaned well everyday. It is a bit annoying that I was out of my room from 8am to noon on most days and found my room not cleaned until after that often. Still, the housekeeping staff does a great job and I was impressed with their attention to detail. (4) Location is great. Easy walk to west end - many good places to eat - the art museum, the aquarium, other hotels, etc. Valet is expensive but only half what you'd pay in most East coast cities, so it is all relative. (5) Other guests all seem to be happy - evidence to me that they are enjoying their stay. The Not as Good: (1) The hotel is older - so while it is nice, it lacks some modern flair. The rooms are dated...again nice, with flat panel HD's, but the bathroom tub in my rooms struggled to drain.

Loved the little kitchenette and having a fridge was handy. I do wish the room had more outlets. There is a lovely vanity area and I sat down to blowdry my hair and then discovered there was no outlet in that area at all. Caution: You WILL catch glimpses that will flash you back to 1989 in some places like old phones in the bathroom and an elevator that sometimes acts wonky. And I'm sorry but I can't STAND having to use my room key to access all floors in the elevator (not just the Gold floors). It's very inconvenient when you are carrying files or bags around.

I had high expectations based on the reviews I read and research that I did before arriving.

We arrived around noon to check in and the woman at the check-in desk informed us that since they were still cleaning the rooms, our king bed room wasn't available at that time. She gave us the option of waiting or she could assign us a queen sized bed room. We decided to wait for the king and she took our cell number and promised to call as soon as the room was ready but then said \"Let me check one more time\" and found us a king room. She did all of this with a smile on her face and a great attitude. She also gave directions to local attractions and places to eat and was more than happy to answer our many questions. We arrived at the room, which was nestled in the corner of the hallway, and found the room to be clean and spacious. The bathroom was good sized but only one sink but since my fiance and I were on different schedules, that wasn't a problem for us, though it might be for other couples. A desk with two chairs was convenient as both of us brought our laptops and needed to work at the same time. A mini bar refrigerator and plamsa HD TV rounded out the room. Heading out to lunch, we encountered a doorman/bell hop that asked us if we needed help. That was the theme of our stay: all employees were pleasent extremely willing to help. He directed us to a great BBQ place and gave us tips for getting around Dallas. Overall, our stay was great. The bed was comfy, housekeeping did an excellent job keeping the room clean. The staff was helpful and available. The only complaint I have is that the prices for drinks at the gift shop were outrageous. Ten dollars for a water and soda.

Don't get me wrong, we love kids and left several at home with their dads for the night. This is definitely a kid-friendly hotel which is sometimes hard to find in a downtown location. The hotel room was wonderful, well appointed double room with a nice large desk, several lamps and reading chair. The bathroom was very nice with granite counters and rainshower shower head. The valet attendants were all very friendly and everytime I called for the car, the lady I spoke with on the phone was wonderful!

The service was prompt, friendly and warm in all areas of the motel (including lounge). Just beware...since this is a beautiful motel numerous weddings and celebrations take place there. I am sure the reason we received such a discount is because there were five weddings and two graduation celebrations scheduled during our visit. However, the motel in general is very quiet on the room floors and the only inconvenience we experienced was at valet parking (they were very busy!). But patience and kindness goes along way and, eventually, service is provided by a very friendly staff. Or better yet, schedule your arrival/departure to accomodate. So before you stay, check on the scheduled events and get a discount if you can...paying less goes a long way in making a person more accomodating.

Everybody was very friendly and engaging, and every question or issue that we had was dealt with expediently. Even a woman from the accounting department helped out when we were going to be late for a dinner reservation because our streetcar broke down. Our 17th floor room was fine, although in a few spots showed some aging. The elevator system works very well---even as far up as we were, we never had to wait long. The lobby area is elegant. The location is in the Arts District just a block or two from several major art museums, and within a 10 minute walk of the West End entertainment district and the downtown hub. There are many good restaurants nearby, or you can take the free streetcar a mile or so up to the trendy Uptown district. Another plus is that the hotel is easy to find and access if you're driving. Getting out of town is easy---just one block over and you're on an expressway. Parking is valet only, and we never had to wait for our car. The hotel's fitness room was just OK, but the outdoor pool area is very nice, a large area with lots of foliage. As expected, given the hotel's weekday corporate crowd, the prices in the hotel's restaurant were very high, but we never planned to eat there anyway. We ordered a glass of port one night in the bar, and all they had was one for $20 a glass---ridiculous! We passed. In addition to the restaurant, there is a Starbucks in the hotel, so you can get some muffins, coffee and juice (but no orange juice) there for breakfast.

After waking up feeling like a mature adult, I ventured into the bathroom and had a time warp into my college days. The toilet looked like something that belonged in a public bathroom and the shower head reminded me of dorm showers - you need to block your skin so as not to get seared by the spray! Maybe I'm being picky but when you walk into a room where to unlock the door all you need to do is wave your key in front of the lock you would expect the bathroom to be a little more 'up to date'. All of that being said, the room service was prompt and tasty. The meeting rooms were very nice and the hotel was very accomodating for our extremely large group. Everything was in either walking distance or a short cab-ride away.

Given what I paid, most of my experience was very good. The room was nice. We were close to the elevators so we could hear faint sounds constantly, but it was not imposing. The bathroom was a little small, but it was clean. The concierge was very helpful. He recommendend Y.O. Steakhouse where we had a good lunch and RJ's (Mexican) where we went to dinner one evening. I highly recommend RJ's! The food and drinks were fantastic. Other positives to this hotel -- it had a Starbuck's in the lobby and it is very close (about 5-6 blocks) to the West End where many restaurants reside. The West End is also where the 6th Floor Museum (aka The Book Depository) is located. We had an easy walk to the West End and also to the American Airlines arena to catch a hockey game. Ok...here is where I have to point out a MAJOR flaw of this hotel. The bar and its service were abysmal. We had to beg for service. We went there on 3 occasions and each time it was the same. One night the couple next to us got up and walked out without ordering anything because they were tired of waiting. One afternoon we were the only ones in the bar. We went up to the bar to order our drinks (we had learned our leason from the night before to not wait on them to come to you). We sat down at a table and enjoyed our drinks. Do you think the bartender checked on us even once? No. And when they are fairly busy (Fri/Sat nights) you are definitely better off going to the bar to get your drinks, otherwise, be prepared to wait. Although even getting your own drinks could be delayed. When we went to the bar one night and the service was also slow there, they tried to say they weren't supposed to give more than 3 drinks to a single customer. Ok...then get a good waitstaff! Also, their drinks are not cheap and the pours are not generous, so if you can go somewhere else for drinks, I'd highly recommend it.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe Fairmont\u201d", "Author": "ElizabethM6", "ReviewID": "UR53049973", "Content": "This hotel is gorgeous and has all the amenities you could ever want.

Things that were misses. The \"business center\" is incredibly over-priced ($30 to receive a small UPS box that held two binders, and then the shipping people took forever to bring it, finally the cashier in the business center went to get it). I think the restaurant menu could be a little broader, and that the breakfast buffet is ok, but could have more variety and be presented more attractively; after 10 pm or so, if you call room service, you get the hotel operator, who then has room service personnel call you back. My room had some sort of ventilation thing that I couldn't control, so there was quite a bit of white noise; it didn't bother me, but light sleepers probably would not like it.

I thought I would treat her to a night at the Fairmont. Being a travel agent I love the opportunity to preview hotels so that I might add them to my arsenal of suggestions to my clients. I was looking forward to seeing what the Fairmont had to offer. Though the Dallas traffic and bumpy roads are never delightful, the location of the Fairmont offers easy access to major interstates and many downtown options. As expected, there's no parking at the hotel itself but you can find parking garages within walking distance, or, as many do, use the valet system at a cost of $21 per night. It's just plain easier and if you're a woman alone, especially traveling at night, this might be the suggested option. Car drop off didn't take long and we wheeled our small bags into the lobby. It's less than grand, looking slightly dated but we pressed on. We received a lovely warm welcome at reception and in no time were on our way to the 15th floor to our room. The room overall, was nothing to write home about. Drab. But I had expected this. They rarely give travel agents the best room in the house. Great view with really fabulous window darkening curtains that really do work. The highlight was the bed. One of the most comfortable I have ever had. High marks here. Granite top night stands. A LG flat panel TV which was not functioning. Turned out the cord had been pulled from the set itself but they sent someone up to fix it right away. Three phones, one on the desk, one on the nightstand, one in the bathroom. Just incase you can't walk three feet to reach a phone, I guess! There is a small coffee pot with choice of regular or decaff and a few tea bags. A huge locked honor bar where A rice crispy treat was $3.75. Fiji water, $7.50 a bottle. Not having time to run around looking for places to eat, we ordered room service. A simple meal, hamburger and chicken roll up, both came with french fries and a pickle. This was delivered on a cart, not tray, and rolled into our room. Very nice service at a cost of $47, with ice water to drink. Morning brought quick check out and the bag boy collected my bags from reception while the concierge desk printed out my directions to find my way back onto the interstate. Our car was waiting bags were loaded and off we went. It wasn't until I returned home that I noted one bag was missing. It was a small canvass monogrammed tote that luckily, contained nothing of value however, the bag was brand new and I really wanted it back! A call to the Fairmont proved fruitless. No one located my bag, which would have easily stood out in the crowd. Nothing was found in lost and found, nothing at the bell station. Somewhat disappointing but not a huge loss. Would I stay again? Yes, but mainly because I get a Travel Agent's discount and the price I pay is an exceptional value. It's not the Fairmont of San Fran or Hawaii and while the staff tries very hard, there's just something off the mark here for a Fairmont. I had expected more because it's a Fairmont. That being said, the location is excellent, the rooms are very clean, the bed exceptionally comfortable. Staff was accommodating and very polite.

Some of the decor was a little outdated, but it was classy and not tacky in any way, and it certainly didn't affect the things that matter most to us. The pool is great - much bigger than some we've seen in major cities which allows you to find a quiet corner even if there are rowdy kids splashing around but it's not open year round so check with them first. Some reviews commented on the staff but we had very little contact with them which is just the way we like it. They were there (and very accommodating) when we needed them but not in our faces.

Anyhow, I went to the Hyatt at Reunion Blvd, where my colleagues where staying and it was nasty- the rooms were old and dated, and a street person was roaming the lobby asking for money!

We got an extremely good, online-only rate of under $100-a-night for a deluxe king room on the Fairmont Web site (one slightly scary catch: it was a pay-in-advance, nonrefundable rate; fortunately, we didn't get ill or otherwise have to cancel our trip, so it did work out perfectly for us, but it still made me a bit nervous). The room was large, well furnished and had a nice downtown view (we could see Dallas' famous, old Mobil Pegasus neon sign from our window). You could find a few little signs of normal wear-and-tear in some of the furniture and fixtures, particularly in the bathroom, but nothing that in any way detracted from our comfort or enjoyment of the room. Might be just enough to disappoint someone heavily fixated on a utterly immaculate 5-star luxury hotel experience, though. The valet parking is a notable extra expense at $21 per day. While I naturally would like free parking, I do understand that this is downtown Dallas and parking is at a premium. What bugged me far more than having to pay extra for parking is that it was valet-only and we weren't given ready access to our car. So, just to fetch something out of the glovebox of the car required going through the valets with an additional 10-15 min. wait (could grow to 20 mins. at really busy times) for them to bring the car around, along with the polite but clear expectation from the valet of a small tip. Quite a substantial inconvenience; I vastly prefer self parking, whether it's paid or free. One other minor annoyance is that the rooms, even the deluxe kings, don't come with mini-fridges. Mini-fridges are available, but only for an additional $25 (that is per stay, thankfully, rather than a per-night charge). Our room would've had plenty of space to inconspicuously place a mini-fridge. Probably a minor item for many travelers, but I must say that it definitely struck me as rather chintzy that a luxury hotel like the Fairmont didn't have as standard an amenity that's now pretty much expected in your average Comfort Inns and Best Westerns. One tip: It's a good idea to go to the Fairmont Web site and join their free \"President's Club\" loyalty program, ideally before making your reservation. As a \"President's Club\" member, you get free in-room Internet access and free local calls, plus expedited check-in and check-out. Since there's no charge to join, it's definitely worth the few minutes it takes to sign up.", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City", "Title": "\u201cThe Fairmont is AMAZING!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "charlieswife17", "ReviewID": "UR28320769", "Content": "My fiance and I just returned from a weekend get-a-way to the Fairmont in Dallas, TX.

The desk agent told us that he \"didn't have any King bed rooms left\" so was upgrading us to a king suite. Strange as the bartender later told us they were only at 12% capacity and we never saw a single other guest on our south tower elevators in 3 days. Hey, no complaints! The suite is wonderful. Nice walk in closet, sofas (one pulls out) and eating table in the sitting room with flat screen tv, large desk and sitting table in the bedroom with another large flat screen. The only complaint is with the design of the bathroom where the door nearly hits the toilet. You'd think that in the design of a suite they could've found another couple of feet to steal from the bedroom to make the bath more comfortable. Still, this is NOT a big deal. Service was incredible throughout. Very nice concierges who were helpful as was the rest of the staff. The bar never had more than 4 other guests in it. They told us that this is the low season for their main business which is conventions. Maybe that's why it was so nice and quiet. We were a little grumpy about the nickel and dime-ing that happens with the internet service. $13.95 to connect (wireless or wired) in the room. Then because I don't have a printer, I had to use the hotel's business center to print our boarding passes -- another $7.99 for those 6 minutes. At the price per night, I'd expect this to be less. The restaurant is one block from the museums which was perfect for us, and one block from the free McKinney Ave Trolley which can take you uptown a bit to more restaurants and shopping. The downtown area where the hotel is has zero restaurants for breakfast that we could find. If you don't mind walking, there are several good restaurants within about 1/2 mile. The very pricey but excellent Stephan Pyles is one block away. The Dallas Fish Market is also great (about 1/2 mile). We also walked to the JFK museum, about 3/4 mi. I think, and on the way the Village Corner Bakery is a good breakfast spot. We did this trip without a rental car which is doable but ONLY if you like/don't mind walking...a lot...for everything.

The wine steward was a great help and provided some great information. My husband thought the filet he had for dinner was one of the best ever.

Response to all our daily issues/problems was polite, quick & fixed as much as possible, but some things, just weren't fixable. So, while room was great & hotel is lovely, not sure I'd stay again just because, heat, A/C, water are pretty basic requirements & having inconsistent basic necessities really cuts back on quality of stay. Too bad because the Gold floor is a real addition to hotel.", "Date": "April 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Experience\u201d", "Author": "marcia0222", "ReviewID": "UR14950272", "Content": "I booked this hotel via the hotel website and came up on a really good deal.

I should have known it was too good to be true. I often wonder whether the management at hotels actually spend the night there occasionally to see what guests go through. If the Fairmont by chance does this, it's been some time since the last try-out. They need to take a look at this property. First impressions are good. It's in an excellent location downtown and the lobby is as plush and impressive as you'd expect from a Fairmont. The service was good. Unfortunately, the room wasn't the same. It was the size of a small European country with a large sitting room and an enormous bedroom. The furnishings looked a tad tired and for some bizarre reason the insides of all the windows were soaking, so the first noise I head was a gentle drip-drip of water dripping on to the carpet. The bathroom was small and the tub was miniscule, no longer than about four and a half feet, so I had real trouble getting washed. And this in what was undoubtedly supposed to be one of the best rooms in the hotel. Worse was to come. I was on the 21st floor of the south tower in a room that looked out both over a highway and some sort of industrial facility (or a massive block of air conditioning units) which churned out an amazing amount of noise. I quickly fled the bedroom and took refuge on the sofa bed in the sitting room, which of course happened to be next to the elevator machinery. So I slept badly all three nights. Everywhere there are signs of people asleep on the job. The TV turned on with the greatest of difficulty (I had to press the button with both thumbs) and when I called downstairs to ask about the handy \"Internet on the TV screen\" function the person at the other end said \"Oh, I've got a note here, it doesn't work\". According to the room guide you could either have a formal breakfast in the restaurant or something less formal in the lounge downstairs. Nothing was on offer in the lounge for the three days I was there. That said, the restaurant breakfast was very good (as tends to be the case with Fairmont) and I consider $18.50 for an unlimited hot buffet in the morning a great offer. Dinner in the restaurant was pretty good too. A hint -- don't bother paying the daily $20 valet parking charge. There are plenty of parking meters and lots very close to the hotel. If I came back I'd insist on a room well away from the noisy side of the hotel. That is, if I come back.

The receptionist stomped around because i had a few traveller cheques to sign and then gave me a key and i had to ask her what floor, i found her attitude a bit crap and i was after an 11 hour flight with stopover and delays. The room was nice but small and the bed was small for a kingsize but squash in and it was comfy. We had a corner room so maybe avoid this type. The bathroom was small but spotless with nice selection of toilitries and towels. Concierge desk was a breath of fresh air very polite and helpful. The hotel itself is lovely a bit of old fashioned glamour in a handy location quiet close to Dealey Plaza and there is tourist office also near Dealey Plaza which was convient . Breakfast outside the hotel is mission impossible,however if you walk towards Dealey Plaza there is a carpark on open ground and on it in a corner is a strange almost invisible little blue and white hut which was fab...looks aren't everything as you stand outside,my husband has a serious food allergy so we can't just eat anywhere.

Cabride to Greenville is approx. 15 minutes, as opposed to 5. Also, if you want to enjoy a nice breakfast outside the hotel, you have almost zero options (we ended up walking the McKinney Avenue \"free trolley\" route - the trolley never showed - to an area where we stumbled upon a French creperie (not my idea of a great breakfast, but it worked). Dealy Plaza and the American Airlines Center are also within walking distance. Above all, we were suprised by the quality of the hotel for the price we paid.

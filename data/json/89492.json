We also had an ocean view. The room was outdated but most importantly was clean considering this would be a heavily used room at the beach. Had a small kitchenette that was furnished but we only used the refrigerator. This hotel definitely is a good place to stay with being located on the boardwalk. The boardwalk tram goes by frequently so if you don\u2019t walk long distances this is an excellent option. Hotel is real close to a pizza shop on the boardwalk in case you get a late minute hunger for pizza, like we did. We enjoyed our stay here and would come back. My suggestion is to stay here if there is an urge to go to Ocean City. A negative is that you can hear the glass sliding door open and shut each time from the room above us which became annoying since they were in and out a lot.

An added bonus was that there was a screen door to the balcony, allowing us to keep the door open on the cooler nights to listen to the waves as we fell asleep. The room was very clean as was the bathroom, and the towels were plentiful. The full service kitchen gave us the opportunity to make breakfast each morning and to sit out on the balcony to enjoy it. As far as service goes, it was excellent. One night we asked for additional coffee and within minutes housekeeping arrived with what we had asked for. On another occasion, something went wrong with our tv. Upon calling the front desk, within 10 minutes of calling we had that tv replaced with another working tv....awesome service!

I hadn't stayed there since 2007, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was actually better than before. The indoor pool area has been nicely redone and is no longer stuck in the early 1970's. Most of the rooms have been redone, some more recently than others. I prefer the tower building, which is newer and nicer than the main building. I am not sure when or if the northern view rooms have been redone. Most rooms are efficiencies with either private balconies or patios overlooking the ocean. Our room was nice, spacious, and clean. The hotel has two nice sized outdoor pools and an indoor pool with hot tub. There is also a game room and small exercise room. The pools were cleaned Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Paula, the maid, did a good job taking care of our room and giving us new towels. Overall I though that the hotel was quite nice and reasonably priced for Ocean City. I would consider it to be a 2 1/2/ star hotel, as it is neither a dump nor a 5 star resort. Also, while it may not be the newest or nicest, it certainly serves its purpose and there have been a lot of improvements made in recent years. My only suggestions would be to renovate the northern view rooms and it would be nice to have flat screen TVs in the rooms.

I originially was not suppose to come here. I was suppose to be in Miami, but there was a tropical storm approaching July 23rd and rain and thunderstorm was in the forecast, so we had to take the kids somewhere. HILTON was booked so I had to take someone's advice. O.k. first about the hotel. Someone swore up and down that it this hotel was good, even after reading the reviews I was hesitate, but the person told me not to believe the reviews on tripadvisor - Suggestion BELIEVE THE REVIEWS ON TRIPADVISOR. Oh boy, where do I begin. Quality Inn Boardwalk PROS: the view from balcony. I had a king size room with pull out. Oceanfront view. That was nice. CONS: The receptionist swore up and down that my room (room 509) was in the premium renovated area. - TILL THIS DAY I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT!. I guess everyone have their own defiintion of renovated and premium. Just look at the pictures. I am not lying!!!! Please believe the reviews that are rated from average to poor. They are not lying!!!! My room was outdated and old. Brown carpet, I mean come on really. The room was right by the elevator, if you do not want to be waken up by people talking in the hallway and chatting, do not take this room. Really do not pick this hotel. Everything just seemed old and outdated and we were in the renovated section! So I cannot imagine how the nonrenovated section looks! DO NOT EAT AT THE HOTEL: The all you can eat breakfast buffet, disguisting looking. Too pricey like 8.95 for adults and even children under four still had to pay. It was dark inside the restaurant, which I definitely do not do. I must see my food and see cleanliness. OCEAN CITY in general is a waste of time. The beach is dirty and the water stinks and is the color brown. I am not lying!!!!. So when you read these reviews regarding how clean the hotel was and how beautiful OCEAN CITY is and how they would come here again and again. I CANNOT SEE IT! and I was only there for a weekend. I am sure, you can do karoake, carnival, mini golf, racecar track in your own area for half the cost. What is the atrraction to OC? I am still wondering!!!!. The dirty beach? I have spoken to many people who have stayed a week! Why? I have spoken to people who have come here year after year - Why? I'm sorry to say this. The only type of people I see , are low income, people who could never afford to go to the carribbean and see what clean water looks like or people who just don't know any better, or people seeing something I CANNOT SEE! I would NEVER recommend coming to OC! NEVER NEVER NEVER! Here is a tip: There is a trolley or bus, whatever it is called that goes up and down the boardwalk. It costs $3.00 one way. Everyone pays, even if you have a small child. SKIP. Go two blocks and take the city bus for $2.00 all day ride! AND THE BUSES RUN FREQUENTLY. The most we waited at a stop was ten minutes. Also in the evening, do be careful crossing the street. My husband almost got hit by a Papa Johns delivery man. His fault entirely, we had the right of way to cross, he was not looking. Thank GOD he didn't pull off fast, or we would be on the 6 o'clock news. RESTARUANTS are all the same quality - TRUST Me when I say this!!!!

I did find the hotel a bit dirty at times, like a chicken wing bone on the stairs for two days, the stairwells are completly nasty, and the lack of wireless internet in the rooms this day and age is not acceptable. Also upon entering the room the room stunk something fierce,stunk of musty/mildew.

We waited until it was too late to book a reservation in 2008, but returned recently fter a two year absence. The improvements were noticeable. The place seems to have less wear and tear, and a cleaner look, the service is even friendlier - the addition of a concierge is a nice touch - and there has been some remodeling. For example, there are brand new restrooms by the indoor pool. The big advantage of this hotel is its location at 16th street on the boardwalk. Further up, there are very few shops and places to eat. Further down and it gets noisey. Also, to the west of the the boardwalk near 16th street are lots of things within short walking distance: a CVS pharmacy, a catholic church, miniature golf, Layton's for donuts, etc. The hotel has two outdoor pools in addition to the indoor one. One of the outdoor pools used to be saltwater and attracted birds, but both now are chlorine. There is a decent exercise room and small arcade. The main restaurant now emphasizes ribs and barbeque and was respectable. There is also a bar and grill by the outdoor pools. We stayed in a nice-sized family suite with a pull-out couch for the kids which can be curtained off from the parents' bed. The kitchen has a full-size refigerator, stove, microwave oven, dishwasher, and toaster. Our room was in the \"tower\" section on the southside which seems better than the northside - the hotel was apparently once two hotels that were eventually joined together.

It is probably the original bathroom and has had no updates. The cabinet doors were sort of curled up at the bottom and nailed shut. No drain stop in the tub or sink. The grout for the tile on the floor is wearing away. There was hardly any space to keep all your travel toiletries out at one time. The sink faucet was loose and needed tightened.

It was right on the boardwalk, not far from the amusement park, and close to many restaurants. The rooms however, were not as great as we thought they would be. The room definitely wasn\u2019t new and it looked like it hadn\u2019t been fixed since the 1960\u2019s. We thought that since we booked our room kind of late, and that it was peak season that we just got one of the last rooms available. We decided it was something we could live with, and that we would just spend a lot of time outside. When we decided to watch some tv in the room, we turned it on and had a terrible picture. When we went to check the cords in the back of the tv, a mouse ran out from under a chair and ran to somewhere else in the room. We told the staff what we had seen, and they were very VERY nice about everything. They were very accommodating and moved us to another, nicer, bigger room. Our second room was still old looking, but definitely not as bad as the first mouse room. We had a beautiful view of the ocean, and enjoyed sitting out on our deck everyday (even though the sliding door was squeaky). The maid did an excellent job with our room, and got us new fresh towels everyday, and even did our dishes for us!! We really enjoyed the 3 pools they had. We didn\u2019t use the inside pool though because we wanted to be outside as much as possible and enjoy the sun! The outside pools were very clean and inviting, and we didn\u2019t have any trouble finding lounge chairs next to the pool, like we do in some hotels. The parking was not bad either, it was hard to find a spot in the main lot, but the second lot was right across the street, and easy to get to. We had no problems parking at the hotel. I didn\u2019t like that there wasn\u2019t any Internet availability in the rooms. You had to go down to the lobby to get wireless internet, and even then it was hard because there were always people down there, and there wasn\u2019t much room to sit. One day when I went down there to use the internet, the manager came over to me and gave me a box that allowed me to hook up in my room, which was much more convenient for me. I would say that if it weren\u2019t for the mouse in our first room, and the rooms were updated, we would have had a great visit!! I guess it all depends on what room you get placed in.

The location is EXCELLENT, right in the middle of the Boardwalk. The rooms are decent sized and very comfortable, although not exceptionally roomy or spacious. Having a full sized refrigerator and fully stocked kitchenette was extremely convenient, and money saving as well. I was duly impressed by how quiet and efficient the AC was also, after hearing/reading some other complaints -- which, in my opinion, are completely unfounded. The beds were comfortable, with firm mattresses and fluffly pillows. But I and my family are used to queen beds, and these were only full size beds. While the difference is only 6 inches (60 inches for a queen, 54 inches for a full), it was still a little annoying. The pull out sofa bed would have been torture for an adult to sleep on, but probably would be okay for a small child. Put an air matress on it, though, and you're good to go irrespective of your age and size. The room service was very good. Plenty of clean fresh towels daily, which was critical, as the towels were rather flimsy and small. Our chamber maid did a nice job of cleaning the room and removing trash everyday. We were impressed and pleased with the lack of sand in the hotel room, in spite of it being peak tourist season. The shower drained very slowly, but not enough for us to complain to maintenance. Definite plusses include the indoor pool and hot tub, well equipped exercise room, two outdoor pools, and a very nice grill right next to one of the outdoor pools. All of these amenities were much enjoyed and appreciated. The restaurant in the hotel was also pretty good. The breakfast buffet is worth it, but the dinner menu was lackluster -- not bad, mind you -- just not particularly good. We had a balcony with an oceanfront view. Of course that also meant we had to deal with the Boardwalk noise, as we were only on the second floor. The balcony was small, but very private and comfortable, with a splendid view of the ocean. One con was that the sun always beamed into our room through the balcony window early every morning, since the ocean was east of the hotel, and our room darkening curtains did not close all the way. This was annoying if you wanted to sleep in. Moreover, the balcony doors made a HORRIBLE grating and creaking noise whenever anyone in the adjoining units opened or closed them. At first we thought it was thunder. That is literally how loud it was. Then we figured it was people moving furniture around. It took us a day or two to figure out what was making the racket, but there was nada we could do about it. A couple other beefs: The TV was only 25 inches, and the old-fashioned CRT with a bubble screen. Since we had gotten a \"recently renovated PREMUIM\" room, I was surprised that this was not updated to a larger flat panel. Also, the bathroom HAD NO FAN. That's right... NO FAN. This is the only hotel I have EVER stayed in where this was the case. Odor and humidity accumulated quickly in the small bathroom. Of course there was a window you could open, but then anyone walking by the room could just look in and see the entire lavatory. Lastly, the high speed internet is a joke. In order to get it in your room, you need an I-Bridge. There is no WiFi or ethernet port in the rooms. Apparently the hotel does not have many of these I-Bridges. I put my name on a list for one. My family was there for 5 nights and 4 days, and I never got one. If you can get one, however, I was told that in-room high speed internet access would be free. There was free WiFi in the lobby, but this was very limited. For the most part, both speed and signal strength were low. It did get the job done, but very very S_L_O_W_L_Y. I was not the only one to comment on this. A couple of other guests also tried utilizing the free WiFi in the lobby, with similar results. Then again, I suppose one cannot expect much if the service is gratis. Still, I would have thought that high speed internet in the guest rooms (without needing an I-Bridge) would be a given, as it is nearly 2010. All that having been said, the overall experience was a positive one. I would give this hotel a rating of good/better than average -- about 3-1/2 stars. Unfortunately, there is no such rating on Trip Advisor. Since the people at the front desk, the chamber maids, and the concierge were all very friendly and helpful, I am being magnanimous and rounding up to a 4-star experience. That is NOT to say the hotel is a 4-star facility -- only that I and my family had an overall positive experience, would probably stay there again, and we would recommend the place to others (with the above caveats).", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!\u201d", "Author": "OCtraveler_9", "ReviewID": "UR36519918", "Content": "We will definitely stay there again.

I am very disappointed in what they are turning Ocean City into. Now where is the average middle income person supposed to go. Now for my review. We had a premium OF efficiency supposedly remodeled last 3-4 years. Of course there were check in problems. The person who had the room before us they had never checked out so we could not check in until they were checked out. Of course no managers on site to help with the issue. Waited about 20 minutes til a manager finally showed up. Like I said before, I believe these managers are just waiting for an offer on properties. We had to call maintenance fo fix the sliding screen door. Well that was useless. Every time we opened/close it went off track. Someone started peeling the wall paper on the one wall. From our floor you could see sand in the pools. They did not vacuum the pools the one day. Yeah they have cabinets in the kitchen but they are filled with dishes & glassess. There is one cabinet you could use to put stuff in but its above the frige and you have to be 7 feet tall to reach into it. But the best part was finding someone else's shoes in our room from a previous stay. They really could use some new cleaning people. I was afraid to look under the beds before we checked out.

Check-in was smooth, we arrived late (around 6pm) and got up to our room. I booked an Oceanfront Efficiency with two double beds. The exterior of the hotel did have a little wear and tear, which is usual for a beachfront property, salt water air tears through paint. It definetely could use a touch up of paint and hole patch up. Our front door looked a little weak, they could use new doors on the exterior access rooms. When I got inside the room I was pleasantly surprised, it was NOT a total disaster. Full sized refrigerator, 4 burner stove/oven, dish washer, sink, cabinets with utensils, plates, pots and pants were there and clean. There was a table and chairs, toaster and coffee maker. The beds were comfortable, sheets nice and soft. The carpet is UGLY and the curtains were UGLY but hey, i don't care about that. There was a pullout couch and a table in the sitting area. The TV was old, so you can't hookup a portable DVD player to it so that was kinda a let down. The bathroom was very small and the drop ceiling needs to be replaced. The water pressure in the toilet the first day was very low but after talking with a few locals sometimes the water pressure in Ocean City isn't that great. So if you stay here, don't do the multiple flush right away -- flush once. Didn't work? WAIT 2-3 minutes and then try again. After the first night, the pressue was normal and we didn't have to deal with multiple flushing. The balcony door could use some WD-40 but there was a small table outside with two chairs and a towel bar on the wall. There was a great ocean view, also a great view of the two pools. The outdoor pools were awesome (indoor pool was ugly and over chlorinated, stay outside), the poolbar is great, they had awesome happy hour specials and a friendly staff. This bar is popular at night as people walking down the boardwalk will stop here for a drink. It is a LOOOONG walk to the Pier -- take the tram. We had a great housekeeper (Erika) who kept our room immaculate!! So overall it was not dirty, smelly or roach infested. It was clean and comfortable with basic amenities. The staff is super friendly, at least to me they were! We didn't have a problem with parking or anything.

We had read the reviews on this website prior to leaving for our trip and were worried about what our room was going to look like since it was too late to cancel without being charged. Once we arrived, the first glance of our room was wonderful. A little warm in the room, but we found a window that was left open and this trip was during a heat wave. It cooled off to a comfortable level once the window was shut. There was no lock on this window. We had a room with a partial view of the ocean, which was beautiful and access to our room was only from the outside of the hotel. This was a non renovated room. The beds were comfortable and there was more than enough room for all 4 of us. We had two tv's, a curtain to seperate the sleeping quarters if needed, which was broken, a sink, microwave, dishes & utensils and fridge/freezer, two double beds and a sofa bed. There were no bugs. After closer scrutiny however, I found that the room wasn't cleaned very well. But still found no signs of any bugs. Under the beds we found food that was there from someone else's stay. There was some bottle caps in the corners by the trash can and we even found a football behind the sofa-bed. I'm glad I found this mess upon leaving the hotel the next day, or I wouldn't have been able to sleep there. The bathroom was clean, however we only had HOT water. So only the first person in the shower had a comfortable one. The water would get too hot to stand under after that, unless we waited for it to cool off between showers. The outdoor pools were nice, but so chlorinated that my girls' eyes were burning. My older daughter had to wear her goggles in the pool, and my youngest, well she just didn't go under the water. We didn't try out the indoor pool. The staff was nice and courteous. After we checked in they helped us unload the car and placed everything in our room for us. We didn't stop at the restaurant to eat during our stay, but did notice that it's next to the indoor pool area, which made the restaurant very warm. I would actually stay again, but this time I would check everything out first and have the room cleaned again if needed. There's no reason for a room of that size to NOT be clean. Finding sand in the carpeting is understandable, considering the location of this hotel, but someone else's left overs is not. If the non renovated was set up so nicely, I can only imagine how wonderful the new rooms are, as long as they're clean! We're planning on another weekend trip this year, hopefully we'll get a clean room with some cold water, renovated or not. Being this a touristy place, I believe some of the other comments about this hotel didn't keep that in mind, but only concentrated on the cost of the room instead of the location. It is a beautiful location on the boardwalk. The ocean is a wonderful sight and there's a trolly the goes up & down the boardwalk which will stop anywhere along the way for you.

That's what you get with the Boardwalk Quality Inn. It's steps from the beach and boardwalk at Ocean City, MD. If you have kids or teenagers that get easily distracted there's lots for them to do close by. They can walk on the boardwalk, get a bite to eat, swim in the pool or go to the beach easily without you having to drive them all around. The Boardwalk Quality Inn has three pools, two outdoor and one indoor, and a pool bar that serves cocktails, sodas, burgers, chicken fingers and hotdogs. The hotel staff is friendly and efficient and willing to help in any way they can. There is a newer section and a much older section of the hotel. If you ask for the AAA rate or get a discount of some kind, you may end up in the older part of the hotel. However, the rooms are clean and neat. They are stocked with plenty of towels and free stuff like shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shower caps, etc. Our room was fairly large with a sleeper sofa and two TV's with cable service, but the sleeper sofa was old and uncomfortable. Wireless internet service is available in the lobby. The air conditioning worked great which is more than I can say for the new Holiday Inn next door which seemed to have people complaining about their air conditioning every time we walked in there. The Quality Inn could invest in newer sheets and blankets as some were very worn. The exercise room was basic with a universal gym, plus a couple of bikes and a couple of treadmills. There was no arcade for the kids even though some internet sites said they had one. The hotel does have a tanning salon, hot tub, changing room, laundry room and sauna. The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner. It is closed for lunch, but there is a Subway on the corner and tons of other places to eat nearby. The Quality Inn rate at $220 plus was more reasonable compared to the newer hotels like the Holiday Inn and the brand new Hilton, both of which range from $300-$430 a night, before taxes, during peak season. Be prepared for sticker shock in Ocean City, Maryland as even the older hotels on the boardwalk are around $175-$299 a night range during peak season. Given the reasonable rates, amenities and closeness to the beach, I would recommend the Boardwalk Quality Inn. It was booked solid every night we were there with families and people of all ages.

Sure, it may be nice to see all the bikes passing by in the morning, but later in the day it become riff-raff and touristy. The beds were okay in my room, but the sheets were sort of stiff. One of the things that I hated was that our television lacked a remote control. We have asked the manager countless times for a remote for the television, but appearently they said that tourists must have stole it on their vacation and they do not have back-ups. The outdoor pools were very poorly made; no lifeguards were hired and children could easily unattach pool dividers and play around with them. The tourists are very rude there, too. Every morning, they would lay their beach towels out on the chairs near the pool so then they can \"reserve\" their spot. DO NOT GO INTO THE INDOOR POOL. Sure, it does look sort of nice with the fake greenery placed around it, but the clorine horribly damages the hair. The food at the little mini cabana bar was very pricy for very little.

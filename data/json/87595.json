Don't expect the same experience if you are not willing to pay for it! Is the Congress old? Yes! Is its quality less than the Hilton down the street? Yes again! Is it a heck of a lot cheaper? Yes! Keep things in perspective and you will probably find your experience to be better than those who are giving low reviews. I have stayed at the Congress several times, mostly for business. This last trip, however, was with my family during a short vacation. I will admit I was nervous about bringing my wife and kids to the Congress. It is not as fancy as other local options and I have had my share of 'interesting' experiences there. Price considerations won out in the end and we booked our room. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a two bedroom corner suite (without asking!) that offered a wonderful view of the city. It was quiet and clean even if dated. The linens were nice and the usual hotel room fare was present-coffee maker, iron, flat screen tvs (one in each room). There was also a large walk-in closet with a safe. There were ample electric outlets for all our gadgets. Among the best things about the Congress are the price and the location. We had the valet park our car and never used it during the length of our stay. We walked or used a public transportation pass for everything we did. The location of the hotel allowed us to walk to several of the museums and there are bus stops everywhere. Navigation from the Congress is no problem. The lower price of the room compared to the other similarly located hotels was great. Is the Congress worthy of 5 stars? Not by a long shot. Service can be spotty. The decor and upkeep is sub par. Dining options are limited and overpriced. They have an unfriendly internet access policy ($10 plus tax per day for wired access in the room and another $7.50 plus tax for wireless in the lobby). What they do offer in price, location, and a clean place to sleep is worth 3 stars, however. If you are considering the Congress you should determine what you are willing to sacrifice for the lower cost. If you want the best accommodations in Chicago then go somewhere else. If you want a decent, affordable place to sleep while you explore the city then the Congress may well be for you.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cPoor old hotel\u201d", "Author": "Shasta M", "ReviewID": "UR126304310", "Content": "I wanted to surprise my wife with a trip to Chicago for St. Patrick's Day. I wanted to stay downtown near all the festivities, so I looked at The Congress Plaza Hotel. I love history and old buildings. Their website said it was built in 1895, and was once owned by Al Capone. The pictures were very nice, so I booked it, thinking I was getting a classy old hotel. What I really got was an old hotel! When we got to the hotel, I went to the front desk and the woman seemed annoyed that I had the nerve to want to check in at 2:45, as check in isn't until 3:00. After she gave us our room, we hauled our luggage past no less than 5 bellmen, never once were we even asked if we needed assistance. When we found our room, we walked in to a smell that can only be described as dirty. The carpet was filthy and looked like it belonged in a mid70's mobile home! The door on the bathroom had to be the original door from 1895, which would have been ok, except it was cracked the length of it from top to bottom, and had to have at least a quarter inch of paint on it. I pulled out the chair at the small table, sat down, and immediately fell to the floor, hitting the a/c unit on the way down. The chair had been broken before and someone had glued it back together and put it back in the room! My wife called the front desk to tell them of the situation, and while she was on the phone, she sat on the bed and the bed fell through!!! They sent a maintenance man to retrieve the broken chair. When we told him about the bed, he pulled the mattress back and to my surprise there was no boxspring only wooden slats that were held to the sides of what looked like a waterbed frame, with small screws. We checked in and back out in less than an hour! The front desk manager was very polite and understanding, as I'm sure that we were not the first guests to leave as soon as they get to their room. This hotel could be a beautiful old hotel, ala The Peabody. It's too bad that it looks like they gave up on it in the 80's.

At first I was put off by the fact that the rooms are so dated - they have no mini fridges, no iPod docks, no fancy bathrooms. They paint is peeling, the carpets are old. But the ceilings are high, maybe 18 feet. The windows are tall, and they open to let air in, which is a treat, honestly. This is not the place you want to take your mother-in-law, not the place you want to take your young kids. But if you're there to goof around with your friends, this may be coolest place in town. It's a little like the hotel in The Shining. There may be weird dead twins on some floors. We went exploring. The stairs are marble, with cast iron rails. Down down you go, and you pop out on a floor that is totally uninhabited, and left to decay. It's surreal. A housekeeping cart is in the hall, as if it were about to be cleaned, or just had been, but not on this floor. One more flight down, and you are deposited into a second floor mezzanine, with unmoving escalators that lead to the main floor. The mezzanine is long abandoned. The lights are out, the mirrors reflecting into infinity. We ran around here like children. No one cared, no security came to usher us out. We took many photos. The hotel is in the heart of the loop. It's easy walking to everything, including all public transportation. It has a really lively bar, with a mixed crowd. Pool tables, lots of cozy seating areas, a digital jukebox. Overall we really enjoyed the creepy mix of old and new, abandoned and occupied. If you think of the rooms as really deluxe youth hostel rooms, rather than mediocre hotel lodgings, you'll have the right frame of mind to enjoy what the Congress Plaza has to offer.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cFelt bad for this hotel\u201d", "Author": "etrayn1979", "ReviewID": "UR125865234", "Content": "I checked out of the Congress Plaza today and honestly upon entering the building I felt so sad for the building. I am a minor history buff and LOVED the history of the building and the character and thought is was horrible that the building was not kept up like it should have been. I agree with previous raters in that the moulding needed work, the carpet needs to be taken out, the bed wasn't all that comfortable but honestly it was decent for the price (the bed that is, I've had worse beds in more expensive hotels). I actually wanted to go and get some chemicals to peel off all the paint on my antique bathroom door. I wanted to shine up the doorknob and take all the cracking/peeling paint off of the moulding. The wallpaper needs to be removed and replaced with something similar, something that can maintain the historic character of the building, but something updated. All in all, it was a decent stay. The staff were friendly. Even the picketers were friendly LOL. The lobby was beautiful but could use different lounge chairs/sofas, bright red pleather doesn't do the lobby justice. The mosaics in the building are just beautiful. Even the staircases with wrought iron rails were beautiful and I wanted to take the paint off of them too. If you want a cheaper-ish hotel in a great location this is place. Want to warn those like me though who have asthma/allergy problems that you may not be best situated in this location. The old carpet really messed with my allergies and sinuses. There is a perfumy/musty sort of smell. Luckily there was nice weather so I could open the windows and get some relief. Also the walls are super thin like other people mentioned.

This unlocked door opens into a shaft used for plumbing and other infrastructure, however, one, especially, a child, could easily fall down to the lower floors and be seriously injured or killed. It shocks me that the hotel can remain in operation with such serious safety hazards. At approximately 11:20 p.m., we discovered a BED BUG in the bed in one of our rooms! We immediately gathered the evidence, took pictures, and called the front desk. The front desk did not seem surprised by our discovery and acted as if we were inconveniencing them! The front desk sent a security officer to the room at approximately 11:40 p.m., who also did not act surprised. The officer had us fill out a security report and took pictures of the bug. The security officer advised us that the manager will move one room. Since we had three rooms on the floor, two of which were adjoining rooms, we went to the front desk, with the bug, to request that all of our rooms are moved. Again, the night manager acted as if we were inconveniencing him. He first advised us that the hotel was almost to capacity and that we would not get three rooms together on another floor. Like magic, however, the new rooms that we received were all in the same hallway, on the same floor, two of which were again adjoining! We checked our new rooms thouroughly for any bed bugs and did not find any. We then went to bed, but did not get much sleep with the thought that bed bugs could be just feet away. What a way to spend New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve! The next morning, I called American Express Travel to report the issue. After an hour of busy signals and getting disconnected, I eventually spoke with a supervisor, explained the issue, and requested a full refund for our three rooms. The AmEx supervisor called the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager on duty, Francine, on a three-way call. Francine said that she would call me back shortly with more information. She never called me back and I went to the front desk to follow-up. She said that she was authorized by the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general manager, Shakeel Siddiqu to refund one room and I reported that it was unacceptable. We asked her to call Shakeel back and explain the situation again. She went into the office and supposedly called him back, however, I do not believe that she did. She again said that they would refund one room and would need to call American Express Travel to discuss the issue further. I then asked for a copy of the security report that was filed the night before. She told me that the security office would not give her a copy, but they would give me a copy. I proceeded to the security office in the basement of the hotel and was told that they would not give me a copy of the report until it was reviewed by the director of security. The security personnel is a total joke and more concerned with pointing out wrongs in their colleagues than helping customers. They provided the report number only and said that they would fax the report later. I called American Express Travel and spoke with another supervisor, who, again called the hotel and spoke with Francine. He was advised that the hotel would refund one room and it was policy to follow the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refund policy. I explained bed bugs in our room was completely unacceptable, however, the supervisor proved incompetent and did not understand the situation at all. I hope that American Express Travel and Travelocity performs its own investigation into the Congress Plaza Hotel and removes it from their sites so that others do not have to experience what we did. Ultimately, it is obvious that the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of concern for its guests stems directly from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shady owners and all the way through the incompetent management. I do not think a single member of their staff has any idea was customer service is. I also doubt they know they are working in a service industry! After checking out of the hotel, I performed some due dilligence on the hotel. I wish I would have done so before our stay, rather than trusting American Express Travel. I found that our story is not by any means new or isolated. Members of UNITE HERE Local 1 working at the Congress Hotel have been on strike since 2003 after the hotel decided to freeze wages and slash benefit. The Congress Plaza Hotel simply does not care about its guests or employees. The hotel, its owners, and its management are a disgrace to Chicago, the State of Illinois, and those that choose to run ethical businesses across the United States. This is evidenced by the unwillingness to put an end to the strike and the abundance of other reviews on the Internet.

I am never one to complain and I usually make the best of any mediocre or sub par situation, i think trips are what you make them with your attitude, but this hotel was awful for the price. Long story, but we got 2 nights at the hotel from a friend who couldn't make the trip. That being said it was ok since we paid half of what he paid for it. At $170 a night for two people (before taxes/fees), I was appalled by the experience. I have stayed at nicer hotels on Michigan Ave. for cheaper and with better amenities for the price. I can't believe what hotels think they can get away with. We had a double room on the top floor, it was tiny and felt like a dorm. The view was an interior room of the other side of the north tower we were in. There were two beds when clearly in the past this room was made for one bed. The bathroom door wouldn't even open all the way from the bed being in the way. Our room was so hot, it was unbearably uncomfortable. Maybe it is common, but I have been in hundreds of hotels and have never had a room where you couldn't choose between having AC or heat. I realize this hotel is old (it definitely needs updates) but the entire hotel was set for heat. Our window only opened 2 inches and we had to keep the room door open whenever we were in the room just so we wouldn't be smothered by the temperature. For the cost you think you could get something nice out of it. Asking for a fridge was extra. Internet was $11 a day. Room service was average and overpriced, not available late at night, and are subject to 11% tax, added gratuity, and a delivery charge! I just hate added fees. One elevator was broken. The other was slow and fit 6 people max. It took forever waiting to get from the 12th floor to the lobby or vice versa. The mattress and bedding was the cheapest I've experienced at any hotel. You could feel every spring and the linens were scratchy and thin (not that you needed them to stay warm). The official website for this hotel is EXTREMELY deceiving!!! It looks like the pictures for this hotel were taken 30 yrs ago. The same could be said about the pictures the hotel features on its postcards, in room service binders, and room keycards. The furniture is not the same even in the lobby. The furnishings and decor do not match the styling or updates made decades ago. Parking was $28 a day not included in the nightly rate. Nuff said.

We stayed at the Congress because of the proximity to Grant Park and the Chicago Marathon. We basically had to only walk approximately 1/4 of mile to reach the start and finish of the race. Also, it's on Michigan Avenue which is close to the Chicago Art Museum, Millennium Park and many restaurants. Here's why I consider the Congress Hotel a poor option-it's old and needs a serious makeover. We stayed in the North tower and I felt like I was staying in a decrepit weekly motel. Everything from the old floor boards, rotting door trim, the musty hallway carpeting to the wires hanging out from the flat screen TV, all screamed \"shabby.\" Also the service was below par, other than the maids and door men. Many of the employees seemed to have an attitude, i.e. one front desk clerk appeared annoyed that we asked for change for a $20 bill. A bartender didn't even bother look up when asked a simple question about where the vending machines were in the hotel. When he did so, he had a sarcastic reply. Sadly, the Congress could be an awesome hotel with its history and location. However, it appears that its ownership/management is underperforming. Again, this place would be suitable for a 1 night stay if you are running the marathon. It is quiet in the evening.

All the poorly-done details stood out so much it was hard to overlook the room's many faults: loud fan in the heater/AC unit, chipped paint throughout, bathroom door wouldn't shut, poorly-fitted ceramic tile \"fixed\" by wide grout lines and globby caulk to fill in the gaps, wallpaper seams lifting, cheap uncomfortable pillows, etc etc. The room was really stuffy, and it took a major effort to get the windows raised. The halls and room stunk of cheap-smelling disinfectant. The tub was a cheap fiberglass model. Detail after detail just plain disappointed us. For breakfast we went to the hotel's restaurant. The food was so-so, and the staff seemed dejected. The bathroom down the hall from the restaurant was creepy: used paper towels were strewn on the floor and even on the sink counters. I can't imagine a staff person had looked at the bathroom in the last day! Finally, we never would have stayed had we not already paid: a large group carrying picket signs circled around the front entry. When I mentioned the labor dispute on checking in, we were told \"don't worry, the hotel is fully-staffed.\" Maybe they should settle the labor issue and bring them back!

I travel for a living and stay in a lot of hotels in every class from Comfort Inns up to Hyatt Regency. I feel obligated to TripAdvisor to help with meaningful reviews since the reviews on this site have helped me so much. Regarding the Congress Plaza Hotel in Chicago. My advice is to know upfront what you are getting. The hotel was originally built in the late 1800s and enlarged in the early 1900s and it shows. The rooms are fairly large and the ceiling very high. The property in general is in need of a full renovation. It is relatively clean but the condition of the rugs, wall paper etc. is tawdry. My two biggest complaints relative to the rooms is that they do not have AC rather the cold water and fan approach to cooling the space. This is not comfortable at all. My next complaint relates to may age (65 by the way) and the bathrooms. The lack grab handles for support and the toilets are the lowest of any hotel I have been at. With an ever aging population it is difficult to say the least to stoop so low and then get up with any sense of balance. This will not matter to younger people but anyone over 55 will know how much this means. The staff is okay but nothing special in terms of customer service. On the plus side, the location is outstanding and right on Michigan Ave. I was so displeased with the experience that I left a night early even though the room and parking had been paid for in advance by one of my clients. If you like really old properties and the limitations do not resonate with you then be my (their) guest but if you are over 55 do not come back and say I did not warn you my brothers and sisters for TripAdvisor.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Royal Oak, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAWESOME Lakefront view\u201d", "Author": "Dragonslayer48073", "ReviewID": "UR119002931", "Content": "I grew up in Chicago and joined the Army on my 18th Birthday.

The location is decent, directly across from Millenium Park and on the south end of Michigan Ave. On a nice day, great shopping, restaurants, and sight-seeing are within walking distance. Directly adjacent to the hotel is another story. The check in process is fine if you don't use the check in kiosk. I went through five minutes of prompts before the machine informed me it was not able to make my key and I would need to see someone at the front desk. At the front desk I was again asked to show my ID and credit card (this time they also made a manual rubbing of my card, which I thought was redundant and outdated). After we received the key we went up to the room to set down the luggage. The room has high ceiling giving it an open feeling. However, some negatives are, the closet door squeaked badly when opened, the bathroom door would not latch and lock into place, the toilet ran constantly making a loud flushing-like noise every twenty minutes or so, when the toilet was flushed it rarely ever completed the flush, the air conditioner remained on hi the entire time during our three days there and the room never went below 70 degrees, and both mornings there was no hot water available for a shower. Furthermore the main doors had no peepholes, and only one locking option a pitiful chain that was hardly secured into the door frame. One morning we kept the \"do not disturb\" sign in the lock so that the maid wouldn't come in. When we had returned we noticed the sign gone and that the maid had been in the room. When we used the bathroom we discovered that during her cleaning she had dropped a bar of soap in the toilet and it had become stuck to the side. The room also had only one accessible plug. If one needed to iron and charge a phone at the same time it required unplugging on of the three table lamps that lit the entire room. If you reserve a lake view room do it for floor 6 and up.

He went the hotel website and paid for the reservation online. At this point I feel the matter has been resolved. I leave my hotel room to take breakfast. After breakfast, I return to my room and discover that I cannot open the door to the room. I go down to the front desk and tell them that I cannot get into my room. I was told by the clerk that the hotel canceled the online payment because it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paid with my personal credit card. ME: You got to be kidding me?! CLERK: Sorry. You need to talk to my manager.MANAGER: We cannot accept payment if we don't have the CC holder information. (This explanation makes no sense, because hotel reservations are made online all the time.) ME: The payment was accepted and then you canceled it? How would you like me to pay for the room?MANAGER: You can call your friend and ask him to fax a copy of the back and front of his CC, driver license, and a letter stating that he authorizes the payment.ME: Fine. Call to my friend: Hey buddy, they canceled your payment. I explained what the manager is requesting. FRIEND: OMG\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I have my kids and we entering the movie theater and the kids are crying for no reason. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that right now.ME: Okay, don't worry; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll call someone else. I finally reach another friend, explain the situation, and ask him for help with this ridiculous situation. He agrees to help me, but has to drive to his office for a fax machine. After 45 minutes, my friend calls me and says that all the necessary documentation has been faxed to the hotel. I return to the front desk to speak with the manager and ask, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Did you receive the fax from my friend?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MANAGER: Yes. I called my friend and thanked him for helping me out of this ridiculous situation. My friend leaves the office. Five 5 minutes later, the manager returns and tells me that he needs another faxed copy of the CC, because it is not signed on the back of the card. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very frustrated now and say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You couldn't tell me that when I asked you if you received the fax? My friend has left his office. I called my friend back, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sorry my man! You need to fill out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel authorization form\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and sign the back of your CC. FRIEND: I left the office! @#* &*!!!!!!!!!. Why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they tell you this before..?ME : I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so sorry but they just told me and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re threatening to kick me out of the hotel, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have my wallet, my cash is running out\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I truly need your help here.FRIEND: Ok\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I wait for the manager and finally he comes out... MANAGER: I received the letter but it didn't note the precise amount for full payment of the hotel stay. [This is ridiculous, because the final invoice for any hotel reservation is not calculated until check-out due to internet fees, phone charges, snack charges, etc.] With complete embarrassment, I call my friend again and try to explain the nonsense of what the manager is claiming he needs. My friend drives back to his office (2nd time) and re-faxes the letter to the hotel. My friend calls me back to see if everything has been received and is good to go? The clerk is standing in front of me with all the faxes in her hand and says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, I don't have the fax with signature.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ME TO MY FRIEND: The clerk says she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the fax with your signature.FRIEND: I sent it. The clerk was misspoke about not receiving the letter with my friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signature, and the manager comes out and says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have the signed letter, but the signature on the CC and on the letter isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly the same. At this point, I lose my temper and started to scream. I said to the manager \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Put yourself in my situation. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve proposed several different payment options, none of which you accepted; I have contacted two friends, both of whom made payment for this reservation, and you canceled both payments\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and you expect me be calm?! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been down here for two hours trying to resolve this issue!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MANAGER: Sir, you are making a scene. Now you are not staying in the hotel. Hotel Security will escort you out of the hotel. I proceeded to the hotel lobby to research alternative hotel arrangements with the small amount of cash I had left in my pocket. HOTEL SECURITY: Sir, you have to leave. ME: Ok, give 5 minutes. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just looking on my i-pad for another hotel, and then I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll leave. The Chicago Police arrive. POLICE OFFICER: Do we need to arrest him?HOTEL SECURITY: No. ME: Thank you. I try to explain the situation to the police officer.POLICE OFFICER: You need to leave, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lucky that we are not taking you to jail.2ND POLICE OFFICER: Don't talk. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go and see the management and know what they are saying. I walked out of The Congress Plaza Hotel, escorted by FOUR Chicago police officers, while the hotel security agent went to retrieve all my belongings and put them outside on the sidewalk! 2ND POLICE OFFICER: Did you pay $50 for the 1 night? Never argue with people of authority; they have power in this country.ME: The room was paid for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the $50 was a deposit last night until I could find another form of payment after I discovered that I forgot my wallet at home. This entire situation was not only humiliating but I also felt I was being discriminated against - I am a foreigner with a heavy accent (French, not that hotel staff could distinguish one accent from another). The Congress Plaza Hotel handled my dilemma from the get go as if I was a criminal. The management made no effort to resolve the issue in a respectful, peaceful, and amenable manner. Instead, the hotel security agent brought my belongings in a trash bag along with my suitcase and dumped it on the sidewalk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in front of a \u00e2\u20ac\u01534-star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with FOUR Chicago police officers.

Check-in was very fast (ess than a minute)and when I was shown to my \"Lake View\" room on level 6 I found that there was no sight of the lake because the trees of Grant Park completely occluded the view.

To get wireless connectivity (vailable only in the foyer) required an additional payment of $7 per device - what a rip off! The room was comfortable with a massive bed and the Michigan Avenue outside was not too noisy to sleep. Breakfast was a disaster with a fairly good buffet available only on days when there was a high occupancy. I was required to buy pre-paid breakfast vouchers for $16 per day to use the buffet but on the days when this was not available I was forced to use the voucher for an \"All American Breakfast\" which was just two eggs, Toast, Hash Brownes and bacon. My wife being a vegetarian requested a salad bowl and toast but was told that the American Breakfast was all that was available despite there being a wide choice of vegtarian alternatives on the menu for less than $16. An argument ensued and the hotel maintained their stance that the prepaid breakfast vouchers eliminated all choice of other types of food.

I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights and when we arrived I was excited since it was an older hotel and I have stayed and many older hotels in Chicago and was always satisfied but this hotel is showing its age and the management doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be doing anything to make it better. First there is a strange/musty? odor to the hotel and it lingers in the hallways all the way into the rooms. The rooms appear to be clean but the odor can make you think otherwise. The room itself has scratched/peeled furniture, the bed is something out of the Stone Age, the bathroom had cracks and holes everywhere, and the carpet just looks wet and musty. Also, the bathroom was horrible, besides the cracks and holes, first it took 2 hands to flush the toilet, it took 15 minutes for the shower to go from ice cold water to lukewarm water and then the tub would not drain! It was over half full by the time I got out of my shower and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drain for 30 minutes and the only reason why it drained was because my husband had to mess with the drain. I did tell the front desk about it and they did seem to want to help but it was figured out by the time they got there. They forgot to clean the 2nd room I had booked for family and forgot to give us towels when they cleaned. Many say that this place has character and is beautiful and maybe the suites there don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the odor or the cracks that my room had and I believe it would have more character if management kept up the building. Also, if you want to grab dessert do not go to the restaurant at the hotel. We ordered coffee and pie and when we got it, the coffee was cold and the pie looked like it was dropped on the plate and the waiter said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how we serve it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

I did talk to the front desk about all the issues I was experiencing along with the other guest I came with in the 2nd room and all she could tell me was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is nothing we can do since you pre-paid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She then goes on to say that she can check to see if there is another room available, but wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure since they were sold out, and if there were other rooms available they would not be next to each other. I thought when you book two rooms; they are to be next to each other or as close as possible. The woman, manager, at the front desk wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rude but it just seemed like she had heard these stories before and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. Also, which I did not see this when I booked online through hotels.com, there are workers picketing the hotel. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the story and they were not violent or yelling anything to those walking in and out of the hotels but it was uncomfortable.

In regards to the strike and the haunting, we almost always entered the building off of Congress Parkway and never saw picketers there. The one time we did enter from Michigan Ave., we saw about five picketers, but had no problems walking around them. As far as haunting, dont know if this has anything to do with that, but at around 1 in the morning, there were 2 VERY loud, forceful knocks either on the wall or the front door.

No. But did the imperfections affect the rest that I got or the fact that I could clean up each morning and be ready to enjoy myself. Big NO. I was in Chicago to really enjoy what Chicago had to offer, and enjoy Chicago I did. And the Congress Plaza played a part in that enjoyment because of it's location. That was perfect! I've stayed in very few places where I didn't have to adjust to something about the place that wasn't perfect. Those things never spoiled what I was in town for, to have a good time! For example, the Congress is a huge property. Hot water heaters aren't a few feet from your room like they are at your house. In such a large facility, hot water has to come from a ways away. OK, adjust. Let the cold water run for a few minutes and you'll get scalding water if you want it. The only thing that I might agree on with those people who gave 1's is that there's no excuse for the desk personnel to be anything but cheerful and accomodating. That doesn't cost anything, and it goes a long way to mitigating complaints and making people feel better about their experience. But those 1's are way out of line. At worst this place is a 2. Those people who gave 1's must not have stayed in a place that was a real 1. I actually would give the Congress a 3.5 if I could. That would include a 5 for location!! Is it OK to stay here?

Near broke, without our rental cars, and desperate (with three kids in tow), we used the last of our laptop battery charge to search for a reasonable place to stay that would be within waking distance to Union Station so we could catch a train the following day and avoid yet another taxi (we had so much luggage that even taxi vans had trouble carrying all our stuff!). Seeing as how this was literally last minute and we were downtown, we were afraid everything would be pricey. We lucked out and scored a room at the Congress Plaza for all five of us for under $100! We checked in within the hour. I must be honest and share that none of us have ever stayed in an older downtown hotel; we are used to Quality Inn and other budget chains. Never anywhere with a bellhop or room service even. So we were very impressed upon first glance of the lobby and building overall and the \"fancy'\" elevators and such. The overall effect, however, once we got to our room, was that of a little girl dressed up in a rich old lady's finery. The room had so much potential but aesthetically failed with weird mismatched tile, peeling paint, and just an overall weird decor that wasn't working. Whatever, I can deal with slightly ugly. Pros: the beds were comfortable, shower functioned well, bath tub was even deep enough for a soak. The flat screen functioned just fine and we ordered pizza for a reasonable price from the menus we found in the room (kids were not opposed to yet ANOTHER deep dish pizza!). The room was roomy enough with 2 beds, didn't feel cramped. The big CON for us was the room temp. It would not cool off. We thought maybe we were not understanding the AC system as the controls were weird, so we finally called someone to come up and check. We were assured it was indeed \"on\" and in the coolest position, but it never cooled off. This was in late March and it snowed the next day; temps were LOW, so I don't know why this room was so unreasonably warm but we were all uncomfortable. Being on a higher floor means no opening the windows either. And, being from Texas one thing we expect (demand) is ice cold AC so this was a major frustration. In the end we were too exhausted to care and we all managed to sleep. If we'd been staying for more than one night it would have been an issue though and we would have made more noise about it. Aside from that there was an issue of the bedside table lamp being broken. Someone came and retrieved it but never brought another. Again, too tired to care. Overall our stay was novel and not horrible considering the good rate we got on such short notice and so close to where we needed to be. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the EXCELLENT attention and service we received from the bellhop staff and supervisor. In the end we ended up not taking the train back to Texas due to a crazy fare increase, and we chose to rent a car instead. My spouse went to retrieve the car and was given a different size than we'd expected. Remember our huge ton of luggage? Well you guessed it, when we started packing up the rental we realized it wasn't all going to fit. The bellhop spent a good 20 minutes out there with us trying to make everything fit into this rental car and was good-natured about it to boot, even in freezing windy weather. We ended up having to unpack one of our suitcases, choosing one that had seen better days anyway, and he offered to toss it for us; that was the only way to get all our stuff into that car, but the good humor and \"can do\" attitude from certain staff members was something we won't soon forget.

Here's my honest experience: Upon arrival (around 2pm) there were no picketers, check-in went quickly and smoothly, with pleasant staff. Room was spacious and clean, and smelled great. We didn't have a great view, but I don't judge a room by the view. Bathroom was clean, large, nice big mirror with long glass shelf spanning almost the entire wall, nice pedestal sink. Regarding some claims about hot water: it did take a minute or so to warm up, but it really wasn't a big deal, and the water did get very hot, and shower had excellent water pressure. I did take one bath - tub is small but nice. The bed was comfortable. All linens (sheets, curtains, towels, shower curtain) were custom with the hotel's emblem. TV was flat panel, wall mounted, and worked well. There is no wireless internet in rooms, but I didn't even bring a computer, just used 3G on my phone, so it didn't bother me. If you want to use internet, there is a wire at the desk in the bedroom. Room was quiet, barely any outside noise, and no noise from other hotel guests. All staff encountered were pleasant and helpful. I ate in the restaurant, and the food was good. The only negative thing that I'd have to say is that the menu was more upscale (did have less expensive options such as sandwiches and burgers too) but the environment didn't match the menu - the kitchen was visible and I heard \"order up\" several times. Regardless, the food and waitstaff were great. I was not bothered by housekeeping (an issue I've experienced in other hotels, and I never allow housekeeping in my room until I check out because I had items stolen at a Courtyard Marriot once). Bottom line - the hotel is older, but has great charm. Room was nice and clean, not dilapidated as others have described. Staff was nice. I did see picketers twice, but they are in front, and once you're checked in, you can use a side entrances by scanning your room key card, and it's a non-issue. Proximity to points of interest, train stations, etc is excellent, and considering other hotel prices in the area, it was an excellent value.

We had rooms in the North Tower (the original part of the hotel, I believe) and overlooked Congress Parkway but we could also see the park and lake from the side windows.

The only negative point about our stay was that we were woken by workmen starting digging up the road at 6.30 a.m. but that wasn't the fault of the hotel. We did see a few of the pickets outside the front door but we always used the entrance on Congress Parkway where there weren't any and only used the front door once - the pickets didn't even glance at us, so there wasn't a problem. It was very cold and wet, so they have to be admired for sticking it out in such awful weather!! We only had one breakfast in the hotel on our last morning and that was fine, so can't comment on the other restaurants.

I have backpacked when needed and I have also stayed at 5-star resorts. That said, I was still worried about the reviews here on TA about the hotel which had already been booked by a colleague. The famous picket line was there when we arrived and throughout our stay but they were just there and the only \"hassle\" would be having to walk around them to your cab. It's not at all like some strikes I know where people going in and out of the building are harassed. The staff at the front desk as well as the bellmen were very friendly and readily answered any of our questions. We did not get a lakeview room. I don't know if there are more modern rooms available but ours does not seem to have been renovated for several decades. Our room was right beside the stairway and elevator and so the \"dark creepy halls\" described in other reviews did not bother us too much. We had an extremely chilly first night. The heater was giving off air so we thought that maybe it was just cold. Come morning though, we requested help adjusting the heater. Assistance was very, very prompt but something must have been wrong (or maybe to do with age) with the heater because the engineer helped us out by giving as an additional portable heater which was enough to make the rest of our stay comfortable. We did not eat at the restaurant, deciding to try out Chicago's more famous eateries and restaurants instead. One great tip I got from a local I had met was to try out Mercat, a tapas place, a few meters down the road at the Blackstone hotel. A bit pricey but it was very good food and worth it. There are a lot of reasonably priced coffee shops and eateries in the area, likely because of students from the nearby colleges. Location was good because it is along Michigan Ave. and seemed to be in between McCormick Place/museums and the Magnificent Mile. The only other hotel I have stayed in in Chicago is the Westin Michigan Avenue. I have to confess that I did not pay for either of these hotel stays (this trip was for work and the other was a Christmas gift). Given the difference in price between these two hotels, then a stay at the Congress is quite manageable. This hotel must have been wonderful in its prime, you can still see signs of grandeur in the intricacy of the woodwork. It could be wonderful again but someone mentioned that the owner's children are all overseas and don't really personally bother with the hotel so it is highly unlikely that any major improvement can be expected in the future.

The windows were stuck and it took tremendous effort to open them to get fresh air. I called the operator and they said it was the same air refreshener they use in each room, so smell would be the same. Plus, the hotel was full due to the event. Otherwise the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. But it was very noisy due to nearby train route. The next night, I used the toilet in the middle of the night and the flush got stuck. I didn't call anybody since it was 2 am and I didn't want anybody in my room at that hour. So I tried to take care of it myself. I also noticed there was no hot water late at night, it was warm only. The room was poorly decorated and everything was very old except the TV. The towels felt clean but they had a strong bleach smell. I will never ever stay at this hotel again and will cancel my trip if it's the only hotel available in the whole city. I am glad my husband couldn't come with me and the kids didn't have to stay at such a horrible hotel.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cconsidering the good price - o.k.\u201d", "Author": "carolinebg13", "ReviewID": "UR89181348", "Content": "Considering the price I paid, I did not expected more.

The wall paper and curtains were a custom pattern of the Congress Plaza hotel, but also looked like it hadn't been changed in decades. My room had a strange door/window for the fire escape exit and it was very drafty near it, so I slept in the bed further from the wall.

We chose this hotel because we knew the location was perfect for getting back and forth to the festival quickly. So let me start by getting the one positive aspect out of the way:great location. It is situated right across from the entrance to Grant Park as well as being close to shops,food, museums,\"el\"train etc. Now,before I get to ripping this hotel,let me qualify by stating that I do realize that this is probably the busiest weekend of the year for the hotels in this area. There were an estimated 240,000 people who attended Lolla this year and the Congress was very full and very busy all weekend. So I kind of had it in mind that some of the usual services might be lacking. Anyway, the hotel is very old and it shows,but not in a charming way. There is a dank,musty,old smell that just breathes from the hallways and floors themselves. Our room was very disappointing, starting from the entrance door which had to be opened by ramming your shoulder into it, and nearly pulling your arm out of the socket to close it because the frame was so warped. The bed comfort was average,as were the sheets and pillows,nothing special. The room itself needed a paint job and the carpets were just plain worn. The toilet flushes twice when you only pushed the handle once and then if we didn't jiggle the chain it would continue running. Actually, the toilet was running when we came in. It was very hot this weekend so we looked forward to a nice A/C room. Guess what? The air was pre-set on what I would call a \"low\" setting and the knobs were broken off. Oh well,off we went to enjoy the music. Looking forward to a nice shower when we got back that night,why wasn't I shocked when the water started filling up inch by inch up to my ankles. Yep,clogged drain,unbelievable. We called the front desk...Nobody ever showed up. Housekeeping cleaned the room the first morning,never again after that. Also, this is something that may not be important to many people but it is to me and I think it should be to you as well. I am a member of a labor union and I was shocked when I got there and realized the Congress is being picketed (7 years running) for unfair labor practices. Believe me if there were rooms to be had somewhere else I would not have stayed there,everything was booked solid elsewhere because of Lollapalooza. Also my fault for not researching better.

I booked this hotel based on location as the Chicago food festival was being held at Grant Park and we had originaly planned to see U2 perform at Soldier Field. The hotel is a easy and safe walking distance from Soldier Field. You can easily walk the Musuem Campus ( Field, Shedd) from the hotel. It is also a easy walk to The Art Institute and Millenium Park. The Chicago Trolley Hop On/Hop Off tour bus stop is close to the hotel. You can pick it up in Front of the Hilton or Millinium Park. Okay, First the hotel is old, it was built in the early 1900\"s........so if some chipping paint (honestly how many times do you think it has been painted) and antique furniture is not your thing....well the Hitlon is next door. The bathroom was modern and we had a towel rack, but we noticed our friends did not in their room. The also had a walk in closet and we did not. Our room was very spacious with high ceilings. It was very clean......no odors at all. Very Clean. We had plenty of room in the closet and the dresser to store our clothes. Lots of room to walk around. It was not cramped at all. We had no problem staying here. The door was old......reminded me of my Grandmothers house. I found it charming as did the other couple traveling with us. They had no complaints about their room. The hallway was quiet, so noise except for occasional city noise, which the A/C drowned out. Room service responded promptly when we called down for extra pillows. The Iron was broken,but we just borrowed the one from our friends. We loved the view of Grant Park, and the Shedd Aquarium. The hotel had a restuarant but we did not eat there, but did have a drink in the bar. It was quiet crowded in the bar. There is a Dunkin Donuts and a Corner Bakery down the street, along with some other eateries. We had good service at a place called the Artist Cafe the first visit, but left from poor service the second day. We did eat at a great Pizza place called Pizano's Pizza and Pasta. Highly recommend them......they are located at 864 N. State St......number is [-----] We had a nice Bartender named Kat from Indiana.......the food was great as was the service. I would also recommend the Chicago Trolley Tours. We walked a lot and it was nice to have the trolley to pick you up when the feet started to get tired. Also their is a blues club behind the Hilton which is next to the Congress Plaza.........Oh, the beds are firm. I am not a fan of real firm mattresses, but geez I was exhausted by the end of the day, by all the walking that I did not care and easily fell asleep. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Oh, you have free wifi in the room, but have to pay for internet service downstairs. But they do have one computer that only acess the airlines, so you can check in and get your boardin pass printed.......for no charge.

I took the train from the airport and walked the few blocks to the hotel. However, I was greated by picketers. Apparently there has been a strike here for years. I walked into a very formal grand lobby, but while it truly is spectactular, the furniture is old, red leather couches. The bar/lounge feels straight out of the 50's. There are ballrooms that are jaw dropping but then you get the feeling that this place is a beautiful, wealthy woman dressed in rags. It's a strange mix. The rooms are from the thirty's. The bed stands, the dressers, etc. seem newer but the style reminds me of '30s style. There are very tall doors with huge curved plastered ceilings. The walls, curtains, and sheets all have monograms of the hotel which is kind of cool. There is a small flat screened tv with a remote. However the carpet is industrial red and the bathroom is a mess. It was clean enough, but the tiles are not real and this was evident because the edges were not sealed. There were no towel racks either to hang towels. I slept well and felt the room was clean. One other oddity was that I was cold when I walked in. I looked for a thermostat to turn off the air or add a little heat. I couldn't find one. There was a register under the window with air coming out of it. I figured out how to open it and could turn the fan off. However, I never found heat. The coffee maker worked well and it was better than most in room coffee as were the shampoos. As to recomending this? I'm on the fence. I love history and was drawn in to all the really impressive old elements that you never see in hotels now. Kind of like the Grand Hotel in Macinack Island, but not as kept up. It's a good price, Near everything you'd need in Chicago, but a feeling of disappointment at the aging of a beautiful piece of history. I might go back if price were a big factor.

So, I would not recommend this to anyone who can't walk a ways or afford to take a cab. The lobby is lovely and I checked in in mere minutes. Then I headed to my room......yikes. First of all my room was miles away from the lobby. I had to take an elevator and then travel through 3 different long hallways. The hallways are shabby and smell. The doors to get through these hallways are beaten up and scary looking. The room was adequate to accomodate the four of us but it was a dump. It needs a major update. There were two flat screen tvs but one of them didn't work. Someone did come and fix it luckily. The bathroom door only had a door knob on one side, I have no idea what happened to the other half.

I did not notice any unpleasant smells, in hallways or in our room, and whilst a lick of paint may well be needed, the place certainly doesn't look dowdy!

Buckingham Fountain and Grant Park are directly in front. The staff in the lobby, and bar were friendly but courteous.

Some saying it is awful. Some saying great. Some saying scary. Who knew what the truth was. Well, I got a good deal for 3 adults and decided to take my chances. Personally, I was hoping the hotel was a little 'ghostly' as some reviews seemed to indicate. That idea actually intrigued me. Also, keep in mind as you read this review that I'm not the kind of person who is into a meticulous, sterile, hotel-chain experience devoid of any kind of personality. I'm not opposed to that, but I do prefer a unique and unusual experience. So on with the review now.... We arrived at the hotel (easy to find) and found the lobby to be very stately, attractive, and clean. Somebody mentioned the ugly red chairs/sofas. I thought they looked just fine and fit the look of the hotel. Also at this location there are several restaurants nearby, drug-stores, and every half-block or so you'll find a Dunkin-Donuts -- they're everywhere! I arrived at 10:00am (check-in is at 3:00pm) and asked if I could store my bags until 3:00pm. At that point the clerk said if there was a room available right now, then we could check-in in advance. Sure enough a room was available. I noticed a sign on the counter offering a lake-view room upgrade for $25/night. She had some available and so I went with that. I thought it would be worth it. The entire check-in process went very smoothly and the clerk was extremely polite and friendly. I encountered the same friendly and helpful service from the concierge and bellman throughout my stay. Still looking good. We went up to the room and were delighted with the view and the room was just fine. Two double beds and an average-sized room. Then I walked into the bathroom to check it out and I stepped into water on the floor. It covered a good deal of the floor, but thank goodness it was clean water. Not sure where it came from, but I immediately went back to the checkout counter to explain the situation. They apologized profusely and offered to put me into another room for same cost. This time it was on the 12th floor North tower (old room was 5th floor South tower). All of this was taken care of in just a few minutes and I was completely satisfied with the way they handled it. I went back up to get my friends and luggage and seek out the new room. We headed up the elevators -- yes they are old, but I actually loved them. They are smallish perhaps, but perfectly functional and relatively quick and smooth, and just have and old, grand feel to them. No complaints there. We got to the room and opened the door and we fell in love immediately. The view was breath-taking. Several HUGE energy-efficent windows (which also opened partially) with an incredible view onto Buckingham fountain and Lake Michigan, the Navy Pier and Field Museum areas. The room was huge and had 2 king size beds that faced each other. It was an unusual arrangement but I really like it. It had a flat panel tv, coffee-maker, hair-dryer, iron, etc (but no fridge). It was perfecly clean (as the previous room was also). The bed linens and pillows were very nice and upscale/soft. We couldn't have been happier. The room did not smell funny as some people mentioned in other reviews. Honestly there was nothing to complain about. High ceilings, lots of natural light, incredible views, tons of space to walk, huge comfortable beds, two desks, a table, etc. The only thing I'd really say was marginal about the room was the bathroom. Understand that I was just fine with the bathroom, as it was perfectly functional. However, I must say whoever picked out the tile was either color blind or just plain blind. And the tile job must've been done by somebody's uncle. But honestly, none of that affects the usefulness of the bathroom. To give you an idea of what it looked like -- The floor was done in a beige fake-cobblestone tile (home depot cheapo tile). The walls were fake gray/white marble, with a trim tile that had a weird pattern in blue that matched nothing (also cheapo tiles). And none of the tile edges were finished properly. It was like and ugly puppy though, you still had to love it. The bathtub was quite nice -- fairly new and quite deep. It drained just fine as well. The toilet and sink were nothing to write home about, but again, both functioned fine. So close your eyes if your senses are offended -- but seriously, it was just fine and it gives you something to chuckle about. Now some people said the hallways were creepy and smelly, etc. I wandered a couple hallways, including the 12th floor. Yeah, maybe a bit of a musty smell at times, but honestly, the carpet was clean, the walls were clean, and it just smelled maybe a bit old, but nothing unhealthy at all. It didn't bother me. I did not find the hallways to be creepy or haunted feeling either. All in all, everything seemed just fine. Just don't expect a 4-5 star experience. Also, others mentioned the lack of control over heat/cold in the rooms and lack of hot water in bathroom. I had none of those problems. I could heat & cool the room just fine (it had two heat/ac units in it) and the hot water arrived in the shower very quickly. Finally, check-out time arrived. The bill was quietly slipped under the door and all the charges added up exactly as expected. I didn't use room service, or internet, or eat at the hotel, so I had no added charges. You can check-out from your room or at the front desk and it was very efficeint. Now why was my stay so differnt from some others on here? I don't know. Maybe they keep improving rooms. Maybe I got a really nice upgrade. I believe there are probably some bad rooms in the hotel and somebody gets stuck in those eventually. If you do, then just ask for another room. I tend to think maybe the lake view rooms may be nicer, since they go for more money, but not sure about that. I would definitely recommend you checkout this hotel if you fit the following criteria: a) you like a good deal; b) you like a good location (Grant Park); c) you are not an anal-retentive, everything-must-be-perfect kind of person who demands the finest of everything; d) you don't mind taking a chance and actually prefer things that are a bit unique or unusual.

Margarita sent us to room 1381 wich was PERFECT!!!!

The ceilings, floors, fixtures, elevators, furniture all are what you would expect out of a place whose heyday was in the 1930's / 40's. Don't miss the opportunity to stay in a hotel like this. Soon they will all be gone - replaced by trendy boutiques, chains with no individual charm, and B&B's. Sure it is an old place but it was spotlessly clean with helpful, friendly staff. Room furniture is ok and bed is not as comfortable as my own but not terrible either. Nice but smallish soaking tub in the bath (in fact bath seemed to be entirely new).

Now that I have been there, I really do think that a lot of the negative reviews are coming from the union folk. I just can't see how the experiences could be so discrepant. Anyway, stay here. Get a Lake View room (otherwise what is the point and I do think that the train noise would be loud on the other side of the hotel). Soak up the atmosphere. Enjoy the hotel crest on everything - I mean everything. Go to a blues club. Eat a Chicago dog (who puts tomato slices on hot dogs...but very yummy). Get some beer and sushi (great place a block or so up the street) and shoot pool in the lounge. Revel in the coolness of the place.

The hotel lobby looks a little out of place. The furniture(red leather couches) are a bit too modern but it is full of charm. The hotel hallways seem a bit creepy and dreary. Obviously carpet needs to be replaced, the lights are dim, and the wall paper looks like its been there since the hotel opened in the 1890s. The rooms sure are a sight to see! They are old but I believe this is part of the experience of staying here. The ceilings first of all are the highest I have ever seen in a hotel room. At least 18 ft. high. Everything seemed very clean and you have to understand that this hotel is old. Paint is chipping off the closet door, the bath tub is short but this is nothing that should ruin your trip. The view from our room was to die for. We had a lake view room and was the most amazing view we had ever had from a chicago hotel. Straight ahead was Grant Park and the beautiful lake. To the left was the city and navy pier and to the right was the museum campus. Just gorgeous! However at night you could hear a little bit of city traffic but was not bad at all! Overall we had an excellent time over our one night stay. The only complaints from my family was that my mom and sister complained their king bed wasn't very comfortable, however my double was just fine. The people who park your car are a little rude and pushy but I guess they can get away with it since it is the only place to park. Lastly the hotel seems a little creepy and haunted.

Cons: the room and decor was extremely dated and not really pleasant to be in, the bed was like someone draped a sheet over asphalt, not just firm/hard - we could also feel individual springs, we were provided with only 2 cheap pillows total, so propping yourself up in bed to watch TV at night was uncomfortable, and the pillows were about 6 inches high with no give, so they were uncomfortable to sleep on, the radiator/heater in the room sounded like two squirrels were fighting all night (loud thunking noises) we were placed in the \"Buckingham\" wing on the second floor, so we heard EVERYTHING- including a fight that broke out between two cabbies, constantly honking horns, the train, and the best was at 12:30 a.m. the night before the marathon, the picketers mentioned in other reviews who came through banging buckets, tooting whistles, blowing air horns and shouting/chanting. This lasted for about an hour. Between the uncomfortable bed, heater/radiatior and picketers, I didn't sleep well any of the 3 nights we stayed there. To be fair, friends who stayed there at the same time for the marathon in other rooms didn't have the same noise issues I did.

I have stayed there two other times, the first time in March of 2007. I chose this hotel because it was within a block of the campus of a college my son wanted to attend the following semester and I had never been to Chicago. Having lived in a large city and overseas in the past, I knew that driving and walking in unknown territory can be unwise when unfamiliar, I chose to be situated nearby to reduce the need for transportation as much as possible. I chose the Congress Plaza based on ratings, price, and location. My first stay was very favorable. The room was much nicer than I had expected. The staff was kind, friendly and very helpful. I found Chicago to be one of the most pleasant cities I have ever visited and I was delighted with the college that my son and his current undergraduate university had recommended. My first stay was a 3 night stay. I returned again in August, 2007 with my son and this time, my husband in tow. I was excited to show my husband not only the wonderful school his son would be attending but also the marvelous vistas of the lake and Grant Park with it's many museums, statues, and beautiful landscaping. When we arrived, we were assigned to a room at the most remote end of this enormous building, next to what I was told was the \"smoking\" annex of the hotel. Our \"view\" was a narrow alley that spanned approximately 15 feet to a windowless brick wall of another building. Over the course of the next three days, we endured our air conditioning malfunctioning with no apparent concern from hotel management to having a Chicago policeman knock on our door and demand that we pay 75 dollar per night because he was told we were smoking in the room. My final stay was in October of 2008 and while things weren't as bad, the room was still awful. Next time, I'm going to stay farther out. I'm used to Chicago now. I know where things are and am used to the mass transit system there. Staying on the Magnificant Mile is convenient and beautiful, but is either extraordinarily expensive or downright shoddy.

By no means am I a 'high-maintenance' person but there were many key things that I did not agree with. 1) Our Lake view room was renovated only in the bathroom. Everything except the LCD TV seemed to be at least 30 years old and run-down. There was a musty smell in the air and unfortunately the windows were painted shut. From the 12th floor we could hear the street noise below, this was not the worst of our problems. 2) The water in the bathroom did not get hot. We called the front desk after 30 minutes of waiting for hot water and we were assured that a maintenance person would come. After 1 hour of waiting for him my wife took a cold shower and we went to bed. 3) At midnight people started talking, it turned out that they were from next door and the rooms are not insulated for noise at all very well. We heard EVERYTHING that was being discussed. 4) Although I asked them to quiet down, our neighbors ignored us. It turns out that we were next door to Honeymooners and the bride was bickering with her bridesmaid. Believe me when I say that the content of their discussion should not have fallen on other people's ears. 5) At 2:30 am I stormed to the Front Desk to complain about the previous 4 points. We were assured that we would be moved the next morning. One great thing was that the night-manager was very accomodating and apologetic. 6) The new room - We were moved to the South Tower in a room that was possibly the 18 or 19th floor. We were so furious that we had so little sleep that we dumped our bags and left to see Chicago. The room was similarly appointed as the first room and was very warm, there was no thermostat available however the widnow did open. The musty smell was quite a bit stronger in this room and we thought that it would be a good idea to air out the room a bit. 7) 9PM We got back to our room only to see that the musty air did not escape the room and although the window was open for all of a November's day, it made little difference with the room's heat. I'd have preferred to have slept with loud neighbors than be surrounded by a warm musk. 8) Check out - We waited quite a while to check out, the front staff rushed us out and was not at all acomodating. I asked about compensation for the terrible rooms and got nothing but a \"Sorry you did not enjoy your stay\". My only thought was to warn others on tripadvisor.com Overall - If you are looking for just a cheap place to lay your head, I would still not recommend this hotel. The rooms were old, musty and I would not at all recommend going to get ice at anytime in the evening. The walk to the ice machine was a maze of dark corridors truly showing the hotels age and unkept assets. I am not exaggerating when I say that 2 minute walk to the ice machine creeped me out. The good side of this hotel is that the bellhops were as friendly as can be. The location is great and the price was right. For my future trips to Chicago I would definately spend a few more dollars and stay elsewhere. It is clear that this hotel was likely one of great prestige and honour however it is obvious that those days are long gone.

The employee's were on strike, so that made me a little cautious. Once we got passed the picketing and entered the Hotel I had no complaints, the lobby was gorgeous and quite busy with patrons (Good sign, so I thought). As we proceeded to check-in I noticed a dirty, rotten smell. I have allergies so the slightest smell sets my sinuses off ( I should have realized this was a sign of things to come). Checked-In, proceeded to our room, which appeared to be in Egypt. Opened the door and to our surprise the room was horrible!!! It looked like something out of the TV Series \"Good Times\". The drapes were supposed to be white but were a dingy yellow color, the carpet had no padding under it, and the beds were calf high. The television set was not modern at all, it was something out of the early 1970's. Looked outside our 27th story window and we were enclosed by buildings with no fire escape. The room was hot, and stayed hot (It was the middle of August). The air conditioner did not work and the windows did not open. The bathroom was not too bad, (I would have rather slept in the bathroom in comparison to our bed's). The room came with a microwave, there was food left over from whomever stayed there previously.

Upon entering the hotel I was in awe of the fancy lobby. We stayed in the Buckingham Wing. Our room was on a smoking floor. The smell was a little overwhelming, but mangeable. Upon entering the room I was pleased to see a flat screen TV on the wall and an updated bathroom. All our linens were clean and fresh smelling. When asked for additonal pillows and towels they were promptly delivered to our room. As a traveler, the 2 previous reviews were not at all what I experienced. Granted it depends on the type of traveler and what their expectations are. If your room was so bad, ask to be moved to another room. If you are looking for a nice place to rest your head after a long day in Chicago this is great for location and price. In the future may I suggest asking for the Buckingham Wing.

Finally, there was a knock at the door. The man told me he had come by before but hadn't knocked because I had the \"do not disturb\" sign on. Ok, that means everyone BUT emergency maintenance!

The reason I booked the hotel is because of its location right across the road from Grant Park where the festival was held. A few days before our departure I went on line and read some of the dreadful reviews that this hotel received and I was extremely nervous as a result even going so far as to try and change my hotel plans but obviously I could not because all of the hotels were full because of Lollapalooza. With a great deal of trepidation I made my way to this hotel. The first thing that I noticed was the beautifully appointed lobby and the way that the lobby smelled....so clean. Next my interaction with the front desk staff when checking in which was extremely smoothe and without any problems at all. I told them that I had heard that the rooms in the Buckingham wing were not so good (I don't know if this is true or not) and that I wanted a room in one of the towers. They accommodated my request as well as the friends who had accompanied me. I took the elevator up to the 9th floor of the North Tower and opened the door of the room to find an immaculately clean room. Still being nervous I pulled down the bedcovers thinking that I was going to discover bugs or stains on the sheets as some reviewers had described......nothing. Nothing but perfectly clean sheets. I looked around the bed and the carpet was clean, fresh smelling and had just been vacuumed. I thought, this is too good to be true, I bet that there is a problem with the bathroom then. I went into the bathroom to find an immaculate, clean and new bathroom and I did not have to climb over the toilet to get to the bathtub as one of your other reviewers had stated. The bath was clean, the toilet flushed making no noise at all, it did not run and there was a brand new basin as well in this bathroom. There were fresh towels neatly folded and small cakes of soap and other sundries neatly placed in al ittle dish. There was a clean shower curtain with an insignia on it which matched that on the pillow slips and the sheets for the Congress Plaza Hotel. The air conditioning system worked perfectly as did the flat screen TV. In point of fact there were no problems whatsoever with this hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful at all times. The only complaint I may have is that the housekeeping staff seemed to be too eager to do their job. One morning they knocked a bit early and then there was a second woman who came around to check on what the housekeeper had done to make sure that the room was cleaned properly All I can say is that I have already decided to stay in this hotel next year when I go up to Lollapalooza again and would stay there any day of the week. I really don't know where those terrible reviewers were coming from as the hotel was great, the food in the restaurant (we just ate breakfast there) was great, the restaurant staff and the staff in the bar were excellent, the rooms were clean, everything worked just fine and no we did not hear the moise of the EL train either.

In May 2008 I went for a week for a nursing convention. Our reservation was booked through the nursing organization sponsoring the event and the hospital I work for, so I didn't get to pick my hotel this time. I think I would rather eat a roach than ever go back there! If you go to the website, you will see a hotel with class and charm and pictures of rooms....only some of which have been renovated. The common areas of the hotel are beautiful. However the rooms leave alot to be desired. We stayed in an economy room with 2 double beds. For 2 people staying one week, there was 1 small dresser, a desk, and a closet with 5 hangers. The outlets were just above the baseboards and were painted over with several coats of paint making them difficult to use. The wallpaper was at least 20 years old. The ONLY amenities were an old iron, hairdryer in the bathroom, and a safe. You could rent a fridge for $10 per night if you wanted. The bathroom was fair in size but because of the placement of the toilet and the slanted back of the tub, you had to practically step over the toilet to get into the shower. You could only enter the shower after the water had run a bit and wasn't brownish anymore. The shelf over the sink was so wide, it covered 1/2 of the sink....I almost knocked myself out spiting out toothpaste! The ceiling fan was hanging at least 4 inches from the ceiling and went on everytime the light went on. Thank goodness we had brought a night light or the fan would have woken us up at night if we used the bathroom. You also couldn't have the light/fan on and have the door open or you couldn't hear anything else in the room. The bathroom had been updated but very poorly. The tiles were not aligned and the caulk around the tub was a mess. The paint was also peeling in spots! The TV was a flat screen and was mounted on the wall. No HD or high quality cable in this hotel...the picture had alot of static. So because we couldn't drink the water in the room, we tried to buy a bottle in the store...they wanted $5.25 for a bottle of water!!! We wanted to go to a Brazilian Steakhouse and the concierge sent us to one he recommended. It was closed...not closed as in it was going to open later, closed as in accepting application for it's Grand Opening in another month! When you walk into this hotel the first thing you notice is that you have to cross a picket line...of the housekeeping staff!! The ones that did work, didn't speak any English. We didn't have much tempertaure control in the room The fan was high, low, or off so we had the windows open to cool off the room. The housekeepers would come in and clean and shut the windows. We would return to a very warm/ humid room. Because of the temp problems and needing to keep the windows open we didn't sleep at night because of the noise. Now when you go to a city, you expect noise. However, the elevated train ran behind the hotel and made sleeping very difficult. The location isn't great especially if you want to go to Navy Pier, American Girl, or the fancy Michigan Ave stores. It is located on South Michigan and is about 12 blocks from the \"fun areas\" and the majority of good restaurtants. It is located within walking distance to the Planetarium, Shedd Aquarium, and Museum of Science and Industry....all of which are great day activities. Because of 3 large conventions going on in the city we were unable to find another hotel room until our last night. We were switched to the Wyndham and not only was it beautiful, clean, updated, and centrally located, the staff was friendly. Everyone we came in contact with at the Wyndham said hello.

My husband's company had chosen this hotel for a national convention and we didn't have a choice. I went in with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. The building is old and shows some wear and tear, but was very clean. The halls smelled extremely fresh and clean every time we entered. Our room was clean and well stocked. The cleaning staff was excellent and very attentive. The room service for breakfast was fast and very good. The negative things we found were that if you used your own hair dryer and tried to plug anything in somewhere else in the room, the power would go out. This happened to us twice and was frustrating,but the staff sent the electrician to trip the breaker each time. Also, the water took a long time to reach a hot temperature. Once it did, it was fine. When we checked in the first night, we did have a flat screen tv, but it didn't work. They immediately gave us another room--also facing the water--without any hesitation. The bellhop even came back to take our luggage. There were picketers. But I will be very upfront and honest....these people (approx. 10) did nothing but walk back and forth in front of the hotel with their signs. They were no interference with anyone and said nothing to us ever. I don't think any of them had anything better to do with their days. Just my opinion. The bathroom was not moldy or leaking. The shower had good water pressure and I found it hard to get out each day because it was so refreshing. The room was very large and had a large closet. It was overlooking the water which made it extra nice. It was noisy from traffic but we expected that and were okay with it. We did not hear any noise from surrounding guests. So, overall, I would rate this hotel very good for the price. Not a get-what-you-pay-for kind of thing. It's more like, this hotel was very good for the value of the price and being downtown within walking distance to Michigan Ave. shopping and State Street. I would stay here again. I don't want to forget to mention that one morning we awoke to the filming of ER right outside our window!!! It was an incredible thing to add to our trip to be able to watch them all morning. And neither of us will forget the exploding ambulance that scared us half to death--but was all part of the fiming. It was great!!!!!!!", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Congress Plaza Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d87595-Reviews-Congress_Plaza_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html", "Price": "$127 - $246*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">520 S Michigan Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Chicago</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">60605</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "87595", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/76/e0/d1/congress-plaza-hotel.jpg"}}

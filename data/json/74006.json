{"Reviews": [{"Content": "What a dump! My husband and I stayed for only one night during the Christmas Holiday Season last year! We arrived in the evening and the night attendant was more interested in watching what was on television, than checking us in. Walking to our room, we passed a blood stained mattress out in the hallway, propped up against the wall. It was so nasty and gross, and not a small stain (I might add!)We did stay the one night, but I had to phone Expedia the next day to make arrangements to get a refund, for the nights we wouldn't be staying. We couldn't check out of that hotel fast enough! I have nothing positive to say regarding this experience, and I will not forget the bloody mattress. Have the decency to cover it up, or turn the mattress so the guests aren't seeing it! We chose this hotel because it was located fairly close to Metro Center, but not an especially good choice for us when hotel staff have no taste or common decency!", "Date": "Oct 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR148034193", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "travelbugMN03"}, {"Content": "Nicer Than Expected We booked a room at this hotel on a Friday night when our AC went out at our house. The price of our free wireless internet room was decent. The hotel was nicer than expected and a good value for the money. Check-in and check-out were very quick, no wait, and the staff were pleasant and gave us a map to show us where to park so we'd be close to our room.The room was extra spacious, very clean, with a huge desk area, nice big TV, and a chair. Would be an excellent choice for business travelers. The king bed was comfortable with lots of pillows and the room decor was attractive and modern. The only negative: The AC unit was VERY loud and did not run efficiently--the room was either very warm when it was off, and then would get too cold while the unit was running. We had to get up a few times during the night to adjust the temperature and we'd occasionally wake up when it would kick on because of the noise. Other than that, the room exceeded our expectations and we'd definitely stay here again in a pinch.", "Date": "Apr 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR309032636", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kmsollom"}, {"Content": "OK stayed there for one night last weekend - OK place - room clean, fairly quiet - one thing to remember is when booking through the Radisson website is that they offer you a room with breakfast for two for another 20 bucks - breakfast is OK, very nice hostess, but only has sausage patties for meat (OK with me) and plain omlettes you get from a buffet along with B and G - they have muffins, pastries, cereals, juice, etc. - I guess if you get two breakfasts for 20 bucks then it's worth it not to have to drive around and try and find a place to eat - I would rank this place just OK -", "Date": "Mar 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR207385743", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "podoho"}, {"Content": "Had a great Super Bowl weekend!

Our room was nice, almost suite-like based on the set up (a desk divided the bed area from the balcony). Very nice pool, restaurant, lobby. The room was clean and pleasant. I can't see how it could be rated below a 3 though I'd be mad too if I had been put in a smoking room being a non-smoker. Another plus is it was located near a bunch of restaurants and shops (one more exit up 17). A warning though, use your do not disturb cards, the housekeeping staff was great, but energetic (i.e. ready to start early).", "Date": "Apr 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR944843983", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bizh"}, {"Content": "What a dump, I will never stay at one of their properties again Cigarette burns, put in a smoking room (we don't smoke) and we reserved two months ahead. They closed the bar over the weekendshort staffed, who does that? The entire property was a one star, how they got a 3 star rating is beyond me. People were rowdy, running up and down halls at 3:00 AM and they did nothing. The smoke smell was overwhelming, we could hardly breath at night.

Sleep in your car instead! I will never stay there again. We upgraded from another hotel because we thought it would be safer and classier. We were wrong. The first night as my wife and I slept we were awoken by somebody trying to get in the room. Apparently, the front desk forgot that we were there. After that the next morning as we went out to our car we found that the rear window was busted out. When i called the front desk and reported it they apologized. I asked if they had cameras they said no. They said that they had A person walking around. Obviously, if they did the person would of saw all of the shattered glass that was on the pavement. They then questioned me, Why did you park in the back? I responded because that was where they told me to park. They offered no help no servicesetc. Not even breakfast (Since they do no provide a continental breakfast only a $9.95 per person breakfast.They advertise that they have room service, they don't. Very poor service. Although the room was nice, they should be dropped to a one star hotel.", "Date": "Oct 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR592325952", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Victor42"}, {"Content": "Good room, bad service The room was nicer than expected but the service was terrible. First, they apparently don't do room service but still had it advertised in the room. The front desk girl was very abrupt when I called down to order it, as well. You have to go downstairs to the restaurant (which is oddly inconvenient) to order and then wait for it and carry it back upstairs.Their menu wasn't the same as the one advertised. It wasn't even open at 6pm so you have to find someone to call the waitress. Food wasn't very good either. Second, my mother was looking forward to the advertised free USA Today dropped by your door but we didn't get one. Thats not a huge deal in itself, but when we asked the front desk, they were completely disinterested in helping and just said um, there are some papers over there on the table which were a small stack of the local tribune. Not what we were asking for.Third, we have a do not disturb sign on our door. They completely ignored it. Fourth, there was a big staff fight outside our door in the morning with loud f-bombs and what-not. Kinda scary.Room was great.

Separate work and sleep areas are nice. The lack of a table (i.e. for room service) is bad. The bathroom is ok for a hotel of this category. There is free wireless Internet. The hotel does not have any vending machines (the two they have are out of order) so if you need a coke or a snack after 10pm you'll have to go to the store across the street.Chack-in / check-out processes were good.Got it on Priceline for $46 during the weekend.

Our unit was clean on arrival and very nicely decorated with generous supply of towels, etc. I would recommend Club de Soleil without hesitation! The management is really aiming to please!

We were visiting Las Vegas during the New Years peak. The strip was packed. Example - All of the buffets on the strip and off the strip in Redrock hotel and M's Hotel had over a hour wait. The check-in was a little slow we tried a early checkin about noon, but we finally got a room at 5:30pm. We rented a van so we could wait and therefore we visited family and friends who were vacationing on the strip. I had to feel for the Hotel receptionist, I believe her name was Sandra. Sandra had a great attitude with high energy, she was like an octopus she had to greet people in person and man 3 telephones. Checkout was easy peasy call operator and tell them that you're leaving the room keys on the table. The Unit - through Interval we were able to exchange for a one room unit and had to rent a connecting studio for a low $30/night for the week. I say low, because the normal rates on Newyears day weekend Friday and Saturday was quadruple the room rates everywhere. We had an extended family of 6, grandparents, my wife and I and 2 kids. I'm not sure if all of the units in Club de Soleil are refurbish, but initially I exchanged for a unrefurbished one bedroom room, but I got a very clean and nice room, which I believe it was refurbished because we had 3 flat screen tvs. The grandparents slept in the studio, while the four of us slept in the other bedroom kids are 5 & 8 and we were able to sleep decently on a King size bed. The living room with a dining table, full size refrigerator and washer/dryer is great and the fact that there was ample parking next to the units is great even though we were on the 3rd floor. We didn't take advantage of shuttle service, but seen it often. Or swim in the pools....we're not crazy with 50 degree weather.

We were there to participate in the Rock and Roll Marathon. We had a two bedroom suite; 3 flat screen TVs between us; large bathrooms and comfortable king size beds. The kitchen was adequately appointed although we had to ask to have a kettle and a few other things supplied to us, which they did without hesitation. We liked being away from the strip; it was a good place to decompress. The pool and hot tub looked well maintained but we didn't have a chance to use it as the weather turned quite cold shortly after we arrived and it remained that way. You do need a car but parking was not ever an issue. What I would say it that the venue is probably showing its age; our suite certainly was in need of a paint job and some updating. However, for what we wanted, it was adequate and it was relatively clean. We did not appreciate having to pay $9.95 for internet access in the suite; although there is access in the lobby areas, we found that it was spotty at best. I think that is something that could be addressed and changed to the satisfy guests; I can't imagine that most people enjoy paying for it. The hotel does offer shuttle service although we found it never seemed to be leaving when we needed to be going somewhere so relied on the car and/or taxis which seemed easy to get.

We exchanged a week of time-share through Interval International (although it seems their new affiliation is with Resort Quest) and stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with full kitchen. It was very comfortable and convenient for my wife, my two adult children, and me. After reading the reviews here and elsewhere, there were no surprises. This is what we found and how it met our expectations: --Club de Soleil has two locations separated by another complex. It is on the south side of West Tropicana and surrounded by a largely residential area. There is a sister property, Tahiti, a few blocks to the east. There was also a Wyndham timeshare close. We stayed on the 3rd floor at Club 1, which actually has a physical address of 5499 West Tropicana (I found this out after a couple of deliveries that went to the Club 2 location and necessitated delivery by the bellman). We didn't look at Club 2, but it seemed that that may have been a busier part of the property and the one most frequented. We also understand we could have used any of Club 2 facilities (our swimming pool and hot tub were closed the greatest part of the week, but given 30 and 40 degree nights, we were not inconvenienced). --This property is just under a mile from the nearest casino (The Orleans) and a couple of miles from the strip. This was not an issue for us as we had a rental car for the week and rather enjoyed being able to come and go (especially when the strip was shut down for New Years Eve). Ample parking was provided all week even with the place fully booked. Although we didn't need it, there was a shuttle schedule that carried guests to and from Club de Soleil, the Tahiti, and The Orleans and New York, New York casinos. From the latter one could access the strip. We took in a movie one afternoon at the movie theater at The Orleans and made a day trip to the Hoover Dam. --Accommodations were fresh and clean. The units are accessible from an open hallway. We were next to a stairway that allowed us to come and go to our rental car conveniently. We were more distant from the elevator. We understand we were in one of the newly renovated units (still working on some of the unit renovations at Club 2 we were told). It was adequate, not luxurious. On the order of a Town Place Suites or Residents Inn. Full kitchen provided gas range and full refrigerator. We had all the dishes and utensils we needed (except for a cookie sheet...which we never requested, just made do with the baking dish instead). The unit included a small washer/dryer unit. The living area had a sleeper sofa, chair, television, and non-vented gas log fireplace with fixed closed glass doors. The fireplace was mostly for ambiance, but did provide some heat for the room. The dining table had 3 chairs (4 would have been nice, but we were able to bring over the chair from the living area when we ate). The mattress (in question by a previous reviewer) was firm and comfortable (my wife commented specifically on how much she preferred it to ours at home). A glass door from the living room opened onto a balcony that overlooked the parking lot and with a view of the swimming pool and hot tub. Bathroom was accessible from the living area and bedroom and included a whirlpool tub, which we appreciated after a long day walking the strip, with a cloth shower curtain (not the glass doors as depicted in some of the photos). Maid service was provided mid-week given we had a 7 day stay, but is not provided for shorter stays. However, fresh towels, soaps, and detergents were always available on request throughout the week. --The common facilities and grounds seemed very nice. The clubhouse housed the check-in desk and a separate desk for the \"concierge\" (who was mostly charged with sales the best we could tell). A hallway substituted for the makeshift breakfast area each morning where coffee, bagels, and cream cheese was served. One suggestion would be to provide a better indoor seating area for those wanting to stay and eat. The clubhouse also housed an elevator, to access all levels, and a fitness room with 2 treadmills, 1 stationary bike, and a weight machine. Outside, on one side of the club house, was a tennis court (racquets and balls provided), and grill area and on the other side the swimming pool and hot tub. The common areas were well maintained. --We were pleased with the friendly atmosphere and helpful attitude of all the employees we encountered. From check-in, where we were well versed on checkout times and policy, to working out deliveries, to requesting extra dishwashing detergent, to printing boarding passes, to check-out, staff could not have been more pleasant. --As mentioned in a previous review, internet connection is not included in the price (or exchange) for the stay. We would join others in requesting this be included in the overall costs. Free internet is available in the lobby area (with a code the front desk priovides). After purchasing internet for our room, we had a momentary difficulty connecting that was resolved by calling the number provided and getting an access code. I know that you pay extra for this service at the strip motels (a \"resort fee\"), but it would seem an off-strip site would be even more desirable were this included. Other things that would have been useful to know. There are several grocery stores (Albertson's, Smiths, etc.) less than a half mile west on Tropicana. A Walgreens about 1/4 mile east on Tropicana and a Walmart about 2-3 miles away on South Rainbow. All were accessed at some point during the week. So, in summary, we were very happy with our week at Club de Soleil. We did not need constant access to the strip and had alternate transportation. The room and facilities met our needs and we would be very happy to stay at this property again in the future.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hacienda Heights", "Title": "\u201cTravel Agency Owner's Review\u201d", "Author": "Johanna Z", "ReviewID": "UR121251654", "Content": "Property is just too far from the Las Vegas Strip.

The resort is lucky to have her. She was always smiling, friendly and eager to help in any way she could. We were a party of four women staying in Vegas to relax, shop, and enjoy the area. I admit I was apprehensible after reading some of the reviews. However, we had a very enjoyable stay at this resort. My sister exchanged with Interval International. If you are expecting a 5 star accommodation, look elsewhere. Club de\u2019 Soleil is a 3 to 4 star resort. However, they do that rating very well. In my travels I have stayed at better places, and worse. Club de\u2019 Soleil is reminds me of a beautiful women that has aged with grace. I would not hesitate to stay there again. Upon our arrival, we requested a ground floor near the pool. They booked us in one of their two Villas. This was a detached, single story, 2BR unit at the end of the pool. There is another one at the end of the tennis courts. It was like being in a patio home. The villa wasn\u2019t lavish, but it was pleasant and clean. The beds are very comfortable and the linens were nice. Both bedrooms, as well as the living room, had large flat screen TV\u2019s. The kitchen had average appliances, coffee maker, and a microwave. It was well equipped. Housekeeping gave us additional supplies (toilet paper, paper towels, shampoo, cream, etc) as the week progressed. If you are an owner, they do a mid-week cleaning free of charge. As for as the negatives . . . a few scuff marks on the walls and doors, grout on tile floors could be cleaner and some peeling paint on the baseboards. The furniture was nicked and scratched a little, the carpet so-so, and the chair in the living room wasn\u2019t comfortable for long term resting. The outside of the buildings need pressure washing. It isn\u2019t \u201cdirty\u201d; just needs a little face lift. But, you must remember it is in the desert and dirt and sand blow all the time. One review I read stated they had a view of the strip. How much of a view can you have from three miles away? Check out pictures I posted on flickr.com (ID: travelcrazy1). You will see this \u201cview\u201d and I took it with the zoom set at 20x. I did not see a trailer park. Nor did I see prostitutes walking the neighborhood. Not saying they were not there, I just did not see any. There was an area closer to the strip that wasn\u2019t quite as nice as the area of the resort. The neighborhood of the resort wasn\u2019t ritzy, but it wasn\u2019t bad. We talked to a few guests that walked the area at night to visit the two local restaurants and they said they felt very safe. P. S. - order delivery from Payless Pizza. It was very good. We don\u2019t have that chain in North Carolina. I have been to Vegas seven other times and always stayed on the strip. I must admit, it is more convenient. However, the resort offers their quest a shuttle to and from the strip every hour on the hour (see resort for hours). We only used a taxi once ($17). The shuttle goes to the grocery store on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8:00am. It goes to Red Rock Canyon on Thursday ($7 per person). If you have the time, you should do this. Red Rock is very pretty and just a few miles out of Vegas. The Orleans Casino is about one mile from Club de\u2019 Soleil. We ate at their buffet one day ($14). Again, you get what you pay for. Spend $45 for a buffet on the strip at least once. It is much better food. The shuttle makes a stop at The Orleans, and Club de\u2019 Soleil Phase II, on its way to and from the strip. It drops off and picks up on the strip at New York \u2013 New York. One of the best things we did was purchase unlimited usages, 3 day passes for the bus ($20).

There were lots of good parts and a few bad parts. Club de Soleil and the other 2 sister resorts do not recipicate so that you can visit them and use their facilities. We were hoping to use the lazy river at Tahiti Village. The club was built in 2 phases. Both are on Tropicana Blvd. We had (2) 1br suites in phase 1. There is an apartment development that is between these two phases. It is not very large but you cannot cut through to walk from one phase to the other. You must use the sidewalk on Tropicana to reach the other phase. This can be a little nerve racking as there is heavy traffic at 45mph on this street and there is no protection between you and the cars. My advice would be to call in advance to see what phase you are going to be located in. If you arrive by cab at the wrong phase you will have to tote your baggage over to the other phase. If you\u2019re renting a car then this is not a problem. All the units in phase 1 have been updated with granite counter tops in 4 different places in each 1br suite. Not sure about phase 2. There are new flat screen TVs in both the living room and the bedroom. Not fancy but all new appliances including gas stove, refridge, micro wave, dish washer, disposal, washer and dryer. All the other standard kitchen equipment was included like a coffee maker, blender, toaster, and a full compliment of dishes. Other cooking pots and pans left a little bit to be desired. Each suite had a small balcony with a wrought iron table and 2 chairs. Our view overlooked the parking lot towards Vegas and you could see the strip especially at night when it was lit up. There were also some units that overlooked the pool. The parking lot even had covered areas where you could park you car in the shade as the avg high temp there was 106f and low was 88-92f. The bedroom had a king size bed with a dresser and 2 nightstands with lamps. The bed was quite comfortable but the pillows left a little bit to be desired. A large double closet with full length mirrors. The bathroom had 2 entrances one from the bedroom and the other from the kitchen. Jacuzzi type bathtub with shower and a double vanity (all new). Both units were recently painted. There was a fold out couch in the living room but I never opened it up. There also was one upholstered chair which was moderately comfortable. Also there was a coffee table and small entertainment center under the hanging flat screen. A Sony stereo system that accepted an Ipod. A DVD player was also installed. A kitchen table with 4 chairs. All this furniture was of a mediocre quality wood and was almost new. Check in for timeshare people was on Tue. and I got the feeling rentals and other were checked in on Sat. So this kept check ins under control for the two employees behind the desk. We had arrived early around noon. One suite was ready for us and the other was being cleaned. We were checked in, in about 10 minutes. Both women at the front desk were both exceptionally nice and easy to talk to. They told us they noticed that both our reservations were under the same name so they made sure our 2 suites were side by side. I thought this showed some thinking ahead and they actually wanted to keep us happy right from the beginning of our vacation. An unexpected thing we found was there was a free maid service in the middle of the week. New sheets and towels and a general cleaning of the whole suite. When I asked about pool towels she told us there should be four in the room but then gave us two more just in case. She told us they were always available in this office 24hr. She also told us if we needed other items like dish washer soap or coffee for the coffee maker they were available without an extra charge. We did use both of these items and once we even called and someone ran them up to our suite. With a map of both phases she explained the layout of each. Phase one had a very nice tennis court completely fenced in and a timer which operated the lights for night play. Each phase had its own heated pool and extra large hot tub. All the buildings had three floors with stairs as well as an elevator. I don\u2019t think the elevator had AC but for some reason it was always moderately cool not like other resorts where they are hotter than the outside temperature. Also next to the tennis court and the phase 2 pool there were two new gas Stainless Steel barbecues (very clean but used) built into a pedestal with a granite work surface on each side. Underneath was a complete set of barbecue tools that were used but very clean. We did steaks one night which was very convenient for us to as our suites were located next to elevator on the second floor. Twice during the week, once at each phase for lunch they have an outside caterer come in and use the barbecues and sell complete Hamburger or Hot Dog dinners with all the trimmings and also with potato salad and a drink choice for seven dollars each. There is free Wi Fi available in about 3 locations in each phase. There is a charge if you want Wi Fi in your suite. They also had two computers in the office in phase 1 one which were free to use. There were daily activities each day if you looking for more to do. The shuttle service was explained to us and we were given a time schedule so you knew exactly when they were running. One took you to The Orleans casino which was just down the street towards the strip. The other stop was at New York New York which is on the corner of Tropicana and the start of the Vegas strip. We didn\u2019t use the shuttles but we always seemed to see one either loading or unloading. They also use the same shuttles to service the Tahiti resort which is just down the street. Since we had a rental car we never used the shuttle. Really in all the heat you should consider renting a car especially if you don\u2019t enjoy a lot of walking. All the casinos have FREE self parking garages as well as valet parking. Back to the resort. The whole resort has been setup to be very energy efficient. All the lights have been converted to the CFL type, the fluorescent spiral ones. Even all the outside lights were converted. We thought our AC was not working very well and we could see the filter which was behind a vent in the ceiling was very dirty. We also were showing a wrench icon on our thermostat which meant it needed attention. We called the front desk and within 15 min a maintenance man was at our door. He explained he just had to reset the thermostat but the filter change might be little dusty so he asked if he could come back that evening while we were gone which was fine with us. He had a temperature radar gun and took several readings around the unit and said we should be ok once the filter was changed. Our other unit also needed a filter change which he took care of also. The next day the wrench was back on so we called again and immediately a different maintenance man came to the room. Even though we had these problems the AC kept the unit very cool. After he looked he told us we needed a new thermostat and also he noticed we had a fuse blown which operated the cooling fan in the large AC unit which was located on the ground under our balcony. He thanked us for calling because without the fuse replacement the whole ac compressor would have been damaged which would have been a major problem. Within 5 minutes he came back with a new thermostat and installed it in 2 minutes. He explained there were two automatic eye systems installed in the bedroom. One which controlled the lights if there was no activity in the room and one that controlled the AC where it would raise the temp if there was no activity. Very efficient I thought. Both pools were a little different than the usual pool you would find at a small resort. They both were over 7ft. deep at one end. They were both open 24hr with a quiet time from 10pm to 6am. The next day I saw the maint. man at the pool with his radar temp gun, so I asked him what the temp of the pool was. He told me they always are between 85-87F. Also a large Hot tub had extra Jets at the one end. Pool furniture was in very good shape but could have used a good cleaning. There were also several shady areas where one could lounge out of the sun. Very easy to relax and read a book or just take a nap. Both pools were very quiet except once or twice there were a few kids using it. You should bring a pair of sandals unless you really like walking on very hot concrete. It was so hot you could not grab the stainless steel railing on the ladder when climbing out. The concierge was quite helpful as she got us tickets to two shows for less than half price after we spent 1hr doing their time share presentation for a new place they were building in Fla. I\u2019ve done this many times before and am very good at saying no as soon as the presentation is done. So giving up an hour of our time was no big deal. We had decided to rent a car in advance from home since there were going to be 4 adults. Pricing with several low end car rentals for a full size car was about $267 which we were about to accept. Than I did something I had never done before. I went on priceline.com and started looking at car rentals. The $267 price I had figured out to be over $20 a day. Priceline only uses the big name brand rental agencies which I thought would be more trust worthy, so I decided to put in a bid for $15/day and it immediately rejected my bid. So I put in $17/day and low and behold it accepted my bid. The grand total for the car was $214 for the whole 7 day week. It was to be full size car Impala or Taurus from Hertz. When we got there we went around the large line that was waiting and used a kiosk which allowed us to use our confirmation number and in less than 5 min we were on our way to the garage to find our car. To our surprise when we got to the designated parking spot and there was a brand new Ford Crown Vic with only 3 miles on it. Im not a Ford person but I must say we really enjoyed this large roomy car for the whole week. The cost of the cab fare alone to and from the resort probably would have been around $100 for 4 adults and all our baggage. So it cost each couple a little over $50 for the week for the car. We brought a GPS with us and we were able to travel around Vegas with hardly a hitch. Vegas traffic is very hectic but it does move slowly on the strip so you have plenty of time to decide where you are going and which lane you need to be in. In the evening for about half our dinners we found restaurants out of town maybe 15-20 minutes. They were away from the tourists but they were some of the local chain restaurants just like we have at home. We love Mexican food and found many good places to choose from. Returning the car was even easier than getting it. Just drove in the Hertz gate and a girl quickly checked the car over for damage and issued us our return certificate and we were on our way to the airport shuttle. Well we did play the slots each night at a different casino, the wife won a pot over $200 I lost about $50 for the week. If you are of the younger crowd and like the latest loud rap music than you need to visit the Voodoo Room at the RIO on the 52nd floor. This lounge has an inside and an outside area each with its own DJ. There is an excellent view of the whole strip especially after dark. If you ask the concierge she can get you entry passes so you don\u2019t have to pay the $20 admission charge. This was a fun trip but a little bit to hot for my liking. We have been doing timesharing for the last 15 years so we do have some experience with all different types of places.

The staff was always very friendly and super-helpful - when our toaster stopped working, a new one arrived within minutes, and when we were a little late to check-out due to a discrepancy on the door sign, the staff was very accomodating and did not attempt to charge us for the delay.

This property seems to have been recently updated a bit. The other property about 100 yards away seems older. I would equate this place to a Fairfield Inn, Marriott Courtyard or Hampton Inn in terms of look and feel. If you are wanting a luxurious place with a lot of amenities this is NO THE PLACE. However if you are looking for a clean place off the strip with easy access to the strip this might be the place for you. Our room was clean and the staff is very helpful. All the appliances worked fine although the coffee makers in the units are worthless. We went to Starbucks 1/2 mile away after futile attempts to make a decent cup of coffee in the room. A few recommendation would be to stay in a room away from Tropicana Ave. Tropicana is heavily traveled and at night it can be a drag strip for passing cars. The sirens from police and emergency response vehicles can also be annoying. Our suite had very sensitive smoke alarm when went off when we used the oven. We were forces to open windows and the patio door to get more cold air into the room. The thermometer was still at 74 degrees. We used the outside grill to bar-b-que one night. The grill are in excellent condition and very clean (better than my home grill). They provide shuttle service to the strip which is helpful however a car gives you optimum flexibility and all the hotels and casinos have free parking.

The weekend of my travel, most of the hotels I frequent at were outrageously priced. So, searching online, I chanced upon Club de Soleil which offers a good rate. I was hesitant in booking the room though because of very mixed review (from another site, more than 50% says it is not a good place to stay at because it is dated; unfriendly staff; etc.) ... I took my chance ... and I am glad I did! STAFF: Lyndia and Sandra at the Front Desk were very courteous and friendly. Very accommodating in answering every bit of questions I have about the hotel. ROOM: Furniture and TV definitely needs an upgrade. They could use a higher linen thread count too for a softer feel. What they have are doable especially if one does not intend to stay inside the room for a whole day anyway. I like the fact that they have microwave, coffee maker, and refrigerator. Provision of china, glass and silver wares are definitely a plus. POOL/SPA: Considerable size. Clean. Other plus factors: Continental breakfast that I did not know were provided (in the lobby). A putting green. A shuttle that brings guests to other time share places (e.g., Tahiti) and nearby grocery. Location- away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip but close enough that one could get a cab ride to go to different areas of the Strip's entertainment center. This place is highly recommended for people who intend to travel in groups or with family. Also good for those who would spend more than a day, a week, or longer stay in Las Vegas.

The walls need painted, the carpets need updated, and the furniture in the rooms is outdated. Our biggest complaint however is with the management and staff. On the second morning of our stay I realized my cell phone was missing. I immediately called the front desk to ask if anyone had turned in a cell phone. I was told no, but I left my name and number in case one was turned in. I called the front desk again that afternoon and was told again that a phone had not beed turned in. The next morning I logged into Verizon.com and found out that someone had made a phone call from my phone the previous afternoon. It turns out that another guest found my phone on the shuttle bus and called one of my contacts. The guest left a message stating that she turned my phone into the driver who took it to the front desk of Tahiti , a partner of Club de Soleil. We immediately drove to Tahiti and was told that the phone was locked in the safe and we would have to return later in the day when a manager was on duty. We returned later and were told they didn't have a phone, it was at Tahiti Village, yet another partner. We asked the staff to call over to Tahiti Village and confirm that it was there. They called and assured us that everyone working at the front desk knew about my phone and could retrieve it for me. So, we drove to Tahiti Village which was not close by any means. When we got there, we had to wait in line 45 minutes just to speak to someone. They had apparentlly overbooked and every customer was extrememly angry because they couldn't get their room. When we finally got to talk to someone, nobody knew what we were talking about. They finally told us that my phone had been returned to our hotel. But of course, it wasn't there either. We got an employee to admit that she did indeed turn our phone into the Club de Soleil front desk, but from there it disappeared. We had several conversations with Mimi, the manager, and also the head of security. Mimi would not tell us anything except that she \"did a full investigation\". The head of security justified it by saying \"it's Las Vegas, people steal things\"! It's very obvious to us that one of the employees stole my phone. This phone was precious to me because it had over 100 pics and videos of our 1 year old daughter on it. I can't get those back. Not once were we offered any kind of compensation for our loss, even after we told them we were filing a police report. We asked for the manager's boss's number but he still won't return any of our calls.

Honestly, I fall back asleep easily and rise early, so it wasn't a huge deal, but if you're a light sleeper, this could be a deal-breaker for you. Other than that, the TVs are big, cable worked great, internet (at additional cost) was fine, beds were comfy and came with 4 pillows each. Towels were plentiful, thirsty, and soft, soap was so nice I took some home, and lotion worked very well for dry, dry Vegas skin. We were on the ground floor, which my hockey friends said was preferable over toting their gear up & down stairs. Oh, the lower score on \"service\" is from my friend asking for later checkout (10AM! I ask you!), and being told \"Not now, we're too busy! Talk to us tomorrow\" rather gruffly. Apparently, they have plain (only) bagels in the lobby with plain (only) cream cheese and coffee in the mornings. Much nicer to have coffee in your room (with the coffee maker, which made nice tea water for me) and bagels in your pjs. (There's a toaster, too!)

However, it did the job, the staff was absolutely excellant to us and the Pool and Jacuzzi were very nice. We stayed in Building 2 and had no problems. I feel like the room did it's job. When we walked in it was clean and big. The Hotel does charge a resort fee, so we put the do not disturb sign up (we stayed from October 1 until the 6th) when we needed new towels we brought them to housekeeping and asked for new towels, and brought extra small bags for garbage (from home) and threw it in the dumpster. The room was sufficient, it had a blow dryer, iron and ironing board, toaster, coffee machine, refigerator, microwave, and utensils, plates, and glasses. It also had dish wash cloth's and soap. There was 3 of us and we had a 2 person room. So there was no couch, but we did bring an air mattress, sheets and blankets. Ok Food wise. We didn't want to spend so much money on the strip every night so we went to Taco bell (which was 5 minutes walking distance), also a little spanish deli and got some Breakfast Burritos ($3.50 each) , There was also an AMAZING pizza place in the little center next to the hotel. It was called Payless Pizza (looks can be decieving, people a little grungy) But honestly very good pizza and salads. We mostly ate off the strip and went to Cesars Palace Buffet the last night. it was about $28.00 and offered king crab legs and shrimp cocktail (unlike other buffets). Activities and Shuttles: The Shuttle ran every 30 minutes. Once to drop off at Tropicana the other to drop off by Treasure Island. Ok we were really on a tight budget when we came to Vegas but we found out the Tropicana Hotel offers a free pull on a big slot machine outside. If you go to the promotion desk they give you $10 free, no money necessary. You put it in the slot machine and just play until your money is up or unless you hit big, which we did, and we cashed out. And other than walking aroung hotel to hotel to view how georgous they are that was preety much it. The Clubs were cool and also casinos were all the same. We did go to the Grand Canyon tours one day, But make sure you don't just buy a ticket, everywhere you go there are coupons to pay less for the trip. It is a long ride and my suggestion to you is that if you got on the tour bus DON'T go on the top deck. Get the table seats on the lower Deck. You have a long ride and comfort is key!!! Bring Snacks, a small blanket and be comfy. Ok so that's all my advice that i can think of.

Upon arrival to the Club, we began check-in. We were traveling with another couple so we wanted our rooms near each other, not in separate phases (there are two building phases here and they are across the street from each other). Before arrival we did make requests through Consolidated Resorts but I guess they never made it to the hotel. After about 1.5 hours (they originally had us in the two separate phases), we finally made it into our connecting rooms in Phase 1 (the older phase). The rooms were better than expected. We had the Lock off and our friends had the connecting 1 bedroom. Both were very nice rooms/suites. The one bedroom had a full kitchen, small dining table with 4 chairs, living room with pull out couch, chair and TV, nice big bathroom and bedroom. Our lock off unit had a normal hotel sized bathroom, small kitchenette (no stove or oven) small table with two chairs for eating, and I believe a king sized bed (although the length felt more like a queen). As for the noise, we never heard anything from above, below, or on either side. The bed was very comfy, the towels were plush, and the room smelled clean. It was a very pleasant stay.

We had both the standard suite and the lock-off room and we had requested Club 2 because others had indicated on this site that it was staffed 24 hours a day and was about a year younger than Club 1. Anyhow, we arrived at 2 p.m., ahead of my parents, but since they had our name on the reservation, they let us check-in, EARLY. We did not get the thrid floor we had requested, but only because we were early. **Ask for the third floor if you are susceptible to noise. You can definitely hear people above you and no matter how quiet I tried to be on the second floor, my footsteps echoed quite a bit!** Negatives: Location: The drive down Tropicana is a nightmare, especially at rush hour, which seems to be all the time in Vegas. It took us about 15 minutes to get from the 15 Fwy to the property. Also, the people that live in that area drive like maniacs. Now, I drive fast, but I was really worried about my parents pulling in and out of that lot. VERY precarious. This place is quite a ways from the Strip, but since we had our kids it really was not a problem for us. The Orleans is a great, nearby choice. Amenities: With no restaurant on-site, you will have to go out to find food. Noise: We could hear the people above us around bedtime and a crying baby down the hall in the middle of the night, so these rooms are not soundproof by any means. Being on a busy roadway also made it \"noisy\" but only if we left the windows or sliding glass door to the patio open. All in all, it was a quiet place, but there was some minor noise from other patrons. My BIGGEST complaint was the lack of places to hang towels to dry after use!! There were only two hooks on the back of our bathroom doors and that was it! Nowhere to dry wet bathing suits, wet bath towels, or wet pool towels. I reverted to using the clothes dryer, which by the way was so loud it drove me nuts! I think it was broken because it sounded horrible! My second biggest complaint would be the fact that there were NO handles on the inside of the shower doors. They were so heavy and with wet hands, trying to open those bad-boys was next to impossible! They really should look into handles. Also, my Mom has mobility issues and while the beds are very low to the ground, the leap up into the shower/tub was almost impossible for her. Even I struggled to get into (and out of!) the shower! Also, we had to make up the sofabed each and every night. Minor, but at a hotel you would likely not have to do this. CLEANLINESS: I am a clean FANATIC, so no place is ever, ever, ever clean enough for me, but I have to say, with the exception of a few surfaces, this place was pretty clean. I brought my own Clorox wipes, that's how bad I am, and I see dirt and \"stuff\" on everything, so when I say it was pretty clean, I need to clarify because I pretty much check out a room from top to bottom before I move in: the walls in this place are in desperate need of paint. Lots of smudges on them and also on the granite counters, fridge handles, etc. One \"stain\" that bothered me the most was a little brown smudge right next to the toilet paper holder on the wall. Yes, I know what it was. No, I did not call and complain or ask to get it cleaned. I have vowed to become less neurotic about cleaning and this was my cross for the week. But, if I saw that I can only imagine what else was lurking. Ugh. The shower and sinks seemed to be clean and the carpets looked clean. So, the room was pretty clean, but not clean enough, if you know what I mean. I warned you, I am a clean freak! Positives: The beds were VERY comfortable and the sheets actually stayed on the bed the whole time we were there! Extra pool towels, dishes, sample detergents, brand new sponges, etc. all made this a great spot. We made coffee, eggs and toast almost every morning and even baked cookies on our last day. The clean freak in me washed everything by hand first! The towles were nice and soft and the appliances (toaster, coffeemaker, full-size fridge, microwave, oven, etc.) were all in good shape, except for that clothes dryer! We were glad to partake in the use of the pool and jacuzzi, and although a few people said the pool was too cold, I have to disagree. It wasn't warm, by any means, but it was just fine. I would not have wanted a room over the pool and was quite glad ours was about 3 suites away. I think 201 to 215 would be the range I would stay in if on the second floor. The odd # rooms face the pool/putting greens in Club 2 and the evens face the parking lot. But, the pool was virtually always empty, so I guess it depends on the crowd. This is a GREAT place if you don't mind the drive to the Strip. We ventured out to the Hoover Dam, Ethel M Chocolates (rip off), bowling at South Point, NY NY, Fremont Street, etc. and this was a great jumping off point. Highly recommended for families or couples wanting to save a ton of money but still get an AMAZING place to stay. We go to Vegas about 6 times a year and usually stay on the Strip, but with prices climbing and payouts waning, I would definitely stay here again to save some money for the tables!!!", "Date": "October 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, MD", "Title": "\u201cGreat Rooms, Mediocre Features\u201d", "Author": "stayshbomb", "ReviewID": "UR10124912", "Content": "We arrived in Las Vegas at around 10am. Check in at the Club wasn't until 4pm. They gladly checked our bags for us which was an excellent plus. We were also able to use the shuttle which was great, also. They told us that they would call us when our room was ready, so we took off to explore the strip. Unfortunately, we never received a call so I suppose our room wasn't ready before four. Upon checking in, we were immediately pleased with the room. We stayed in a two bedroom suite. It was very roomy. One side was a lock-off bedroom, with a bathroom and a kitchenette. The larger side was a bedroom, bathroom, full kitchen and a living room, which included a fireplace and a balcony. There were five of us, so the living room with a pull out couch really became a third bedroom. The room was immaculately cleaned and we were very happy with it. One of the jetted tubs did not work, which we didn't discover until nearly the last night of the trip. But, that was the only room downfall. The hotel had a pool area (it was way too cold to swim) that, fortunately, also had a hot tub. The area was open 24 hours, which originally we thought was great. However, it turned out to be overrated. The pool area was literally in the middle of a bunch of other suites. They were behind and right next to other suites. One night, after a long day of walking the strip, we decided to go down and enjoy the hot tub. I wouldn't have even mentioned this had it been true, however, about 10 minutes into our \"hot tub experience,\" a security guard came out from the lobby and told us he had received complaints (as in multiple) of noise and if it continued, he would have to ask us to leave. There had been little to no conversation between the four of us at all so we just decided to pack it in. It would have been impossible for us to have been any quieter. I would suggest that, being that there are other patrons staying so close to the area that the sounds of people moving around in a hot tub would disturb them, they should attach hours to the privileges of the pool. The only other downfall of the hotel was that, although you're given a paper schedule of shuttle departure times, they aren't always necessarily accurate. I would suggest arriving to the pick up spot about 10 minutes prior to the listed time. Upon exiting the door of the Riviera, we saw the shuttle leaving, 10 minutes early, and were left to wait another hour for a returning shuttle. We discovered cabs were a little more convenient for the five of us, resulting in about a $10 - $15 fare from most places on the strip. Also, on the weekdays, the last shuttle leaves at 11pm, so if you're night owls, you'll also find this inconvenient. The hotel also offers a free trip to Fremont Street on Wednesdays, but if you want to go, make sure you schedule your spots with the front desk early. By Monday morning, all two shuttles were completely booked. The Deuce also runs to Fremont Street and offers a 24 hour bus pass for $5, you can catch it at the Riviera but it tends to be stuffed to the brim and, for the most part, uncomfortable. Overall, the hotel is really nice. The staff was, mostly, friendly and they gave us a welcome packet that included free passes to nightclubs and show coupons. We were never once pressured into a sales pitch (it is a time share, after all). I will probably never stay at this hotel again, but merely for the reason that I prefer the hustle and bustle of the strip and this was just a bit too far away from the strip for me. The closest casino was The Orleans and it was about a 15 minute walk (we did it many times). It was nice to have everyone in our group stay together (where else can you book a two bedroom suite for a good price?) so I would recommend this for families who enjoy a laid back vacation.", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cSo Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "LIGirl1", "ReviewID": "UR10031206", "Content": "My husband andI traveled with friends, and all 4 of us had a great time.

I do not like traffic noise and so this worked out well. It was also in the shade all afternoon so that is certainly better in my book when the temperature was over 107 degrees. The room itself was extremely clean - and I am very fussy about that. It was not lavish, but nicely furnished and comfortable. The kitchen was immaculate. It could have benefited from a few more utencils and pots, but it was adequate. There is a great and clean BBQ (actually 2) with granite counters around them outside in the courtyard. We enjoyed great steaks one evening. The bed was comfortable and we slept well except for some idiot's car alarm went off 2 mornings in a row. Same car, don't know why it happened. The one thing that I want to really comment on was the high level of service that they provided. Whatever I asked for was immediatley attended to. One evening I forgot to ask for extra linens before we went out for the night. I called the front desk at around 11PM not thinking it would be possible to get some, but it was no problem. They had the night security guard bring them up to me. I was so astounded. Also, we were not bothered by the concierge about a time share sales pitch. It was offered, I declined and that was that. She was very helpful about providing us other info that we asked for. The pool was not big, but it was well maintained and wonderfully warm. My daughter and I spent hours lounging in the water. The spa was great too. I loved the shade cabanas they had as well as numerous trees around the perimiter that provided much needed shade from the heat and sun. Yes, some of the leaves blew into the pool in the afternoon wind, but an attendant came around to clean them out. Believe me, I would rather have the shade and put up with a few leaves in the pool!! The pool was NEVER crowded while we were there. Maybe 10 people max and many times we were the only ones there. Loved it!!! Also there are no posted hours. The pool is open 24/7 for those of you night owls who might want to take a spa. I am sure you would have it entirely to yourselves. We felt that the facility was well maintained, staff friendly and rooms comfortable. We did not use their shuttle as we had a car, but I noticed one frequently out front. We loved that it was quiet (really only heard noise from above a few times and none from next door during the entire week we were there) and away from the strip. We left feeling very relaxed and would definately return again.", "Date": "July 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cA Good Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "cdth", "ReviewID": "UR8126520", "Content": "In spite of several of the photos and minor criticisms I will include, in honesty I would stay here again in a heartbeat. We were fortunate enough to get a \"Strip View\" room (there are very few, so request early if you want one) and virtually every part of our stay was positive. The room was clean, spacious, quiet, and well-appointed: deck/patio with table and two chairs, full kitchen, large bathroom with jetted tub, washer and dryer, iron and ironing board, fireplace (not needed as Vegas temps reached 116!), tv in the living room and bedroom, DVD player in living room, as well as a small stereo. With the exception of one concierge who was brusque, everyone was friendly and helpful. Parking is plentiful, covered, and patrolled by a security guard Complimentary waffles and sausages were served for breakfast Saturday, Sunday, and Thursday. The shuttle to the strip is a great service, and, not to be missed, for $2.00 per person (cheaper than if you take your own car): the guided trip to Red Rocks on an air conditioned bus, by the knowlegeable and amiable driver/guide, Norm. The minor criticisms: A surpising number of things seemed out of order and were not dealt with during the week we stayed. In fairness, none of these bothered me, as I wasn't interested in using any of them, but it seems like these should be addressed more quickly. All not working: one excercise machine, the lobby computer for guest usage, the DVD rental machine, and the water fountain at the pool. Also, as it was windy, the pool collected a lot of leaves and other tree debris, and by afternoon, the pool surface needed cleaning. The pool is not supervised (no life guard), but it is open 24/7, which is convenient, especially on warm or hot nights. At The Orleans, by contrast, the pool closes at 8:00 pm, which seems awfully early, and that is true at many of the strip casinos also. In all, we enjoyed staying off the strip. You are only 2 miles from NY, NY / Excalibur / MGM Grand etc., 20 minutes from Red Rocks, and less than an hour from Mt. Charleston. Top flight? No. Perfect? No. But we liked it very well and it made our stay in Las Vegas all the more enjoyable.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Texas", "Title": "\u201cComfortable but with caution\u201d", "Author": "Married20yrs", "ReviewID": "UR8051860", "Content": "My wife and I stayed in the small side. The room was comfortable and clean. The bed was soft. However, the doors dividing us from the main room made our first 2 nights difficult.

We had to request a move to room without guests in the next room. The doors need to be sealed better. The guests in the other side were not overly loud, but you can hear everything they are saying especially if they stand next to the doors. I have stayed in other places with the dividing door and not had problems with privacy. If you are staying in both sides with family or other guests, treat it like an extra bedroom. However, if you are paying for some privacy you will be disappointed. We felt like our kids were babies again when we tried to keep our voices low all the time so the adjoining guests would not hear our conversations. Additionally, we stayed in section 1 which I thought would have the main lobby. If you need anything you have to go to section 2 a short walk away. Not a big problem but inconvenient. There was rarely someone in section 1 that could answer any questions or handle our problems with the dividing doors. Note to Ownership: This has the potential to be a really nice place to stay, but spend some money to improve the dividing doors. It is not a difficult fix, but will cost some investment.

It has a kitchen with a full size fridge, microwave and dishwasher. The living room area has a sofa sleeper, chair, fireplace, and a dining table with 4 chairs. The unit we stayed in had a small balcony that faced the parking lot, we never went out there cause it was too hot, but other units had the balcony facing the pool. The bedroom was large and clean, the only complaint I had was that the air conditioning didn't seem to cool the bedroom very well but froze you in the living room. The bathroom was large also very clean with a jacuzzi tub and doors to enter from bedroom or hallway. They give you plenty of towels for 4 people and 4 pool towels. In the hallway is a washer and dryer that I used every night. I hate the cigarette smells from the casinos. The pool was a good size, heated, the jacuzzi was a little too hot but we were in there at 2am. The pools r 24 hours. The complex was very quiet and no one bothered us. It also has a tennis court and BBQ's but we did not use them. If you r staying for more than a couple of days I suggest you stop at the grocery store down the street and pick up some munchies, they have a shuttle to the store and casinos if you don't rent a car. If it is your first time in Vegas I suggest you rent a car, it's usually to hot and tiring to walk around. There are also plenty of Taxi's and limos but that can add up quick.

I can only think of 2 complaints: 1- The shower pressure was not very good, which is very frustrating for girls who have a lot of hair to wash! 2- The hot tub was filthy. I never saw anyone clean it while we were there and it was always full of bugs/leaves/etc. The water was so cloudy you couldn't see your hand more than 3 inches below the surface.

Nice pool area, & most of the hotel workers were very friendly. We stayed in a lock off unit, which was probably a mistake. If available I would recommend the entire unit. We did read that on a previous review that the wall were thin, which is very true, this is why I recommend the entire unit, & not just the lock off. The shuttles to the strip were great, even though we did rent a car. We took the shuttle to the strip if at all possible, becuase of the traffic. The one thing that really annoyed me was the fact that as soon as we were complete checking in, we were subjected to the timeshare pitch. We were basicly signed up for the presentation even though we told them we already owned. Of course the NO OBLIGATION came up we chose that route. Overall not a bad place, but don't let the Interval International book convince you that it is 5stars.

The only draw back to the whole room was the lack of working power outlets in the kitchen, 5 in the kitchen and 1 worked. That didn't cause a problem until you were trying to make coffee, toast and iron something (closest plug to the iron was in the kitchen). But that being said it was very minor in the whole trip. The pool is kept very clean, and at most times during the day you are pool side by yourself. Also on site is a tennis court, and again it is clean and the surface looks to be tended to. Because of the location off the strip they have several shuttles that will pick you up on the hour and drop you off at one of 4 hotels. They also shuttle you to the grocery in the morning. It seems like every shuttle we took was driven by Eddie. Now what a character, his stories and conversation sure made the rides fun. We rented a car on our trip and they had plenty of parking available, I would recommend if you stay here to try to rent a car. If you want to go somewhere other than the strip you would need to cab it every time if you don't have a car, and consider that you are 3-4 miles off the strip.

We just needed a place to sleep and shower since we were gone about 14-16 hours each day. This hotel is about 5 miles from Disney, which we thought wouldn't be a big deal, but my goodness that drive is a long 5 miles! There's a lot of CLOSER 1 star hotels that advertise the same low price we got our week booked for. I was unable to find them ONLINE though, when doing my research before booking this place. The room was...acceptable since it filled our main needs. We couldn't change rooms since they were completely booked and we pre-paid for our week there. The resort fee was cheap, but not even worth it since none of the extra stuff really worked. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. The AC worked and made the room nice and cold on a hot, sunny day. The bathroom's toilet and tub worked, but looked kind of gross as well. It had a bad odor. There was mold forming on the ceiling above one of the beds. The safe didn't work. So that was pointless. The fridge door kept opening, so all of our food got spoiled. I thought it was an error on my part for not paying attention when I shut the fridge's door...but then by the 3rd or 4th day I finally remembered to make sure it's SHUT before we left for 16 hours...yeah came back and the door was open again. Had to throw everything out since most of it was dairy. The ice machine was BROKEN. We managed to get about 10 ice cubes the first morning, but after that nothing ever came out. So we had to buy our own ice at a nearby store ($2 a bag) for the cooler box. I left my husband in charge of the ice, I went to inspect it after a few days and saw that someone had been throwing trash and questionable things in the drain of the ice machine, so that looked VERY gross. We didn't get to use the swimming pool. The one night we considered it, a couple looked like they were getting a little too close for the public eye, so we opted out of that. So in the end, yes we got what we mainly wanted, a place to sleep and shower...but in the end I wish we could of afforded something better...and CLOSER. WAY CLOSER. It's annoying that there's so many other cheap hotels that are more near Disney, but not easy to find online!!", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chislehurst", "Title": "\u201cAwful experience\u201d", "Author": "Nicky W", "ReviewID": "UR126866740", "Content": "Not a joyful experience.

My wife and I stayed there Feb 21-25. We planned to split time netween the Orlando attractions and the Kennedy Space Center/see the shuttle take off. On our 2nd day I became very sick with food poisoning I think I got from oysters at a restaurant. Upon returning to our room I went straight to bed hoping to feel better the next morning. At 5:00 am I made my 7th or 8th trip to the bathroom in 24 hours to expunge the illness (nice way to put it). Approx 2 minutes after sitting down ...the ceiling above me drenched me with cold water in a steady stream directly on my head and back and down my body . I was unable to leave the bathroom for 7-10 more minutes due to the food poisoning. I got completely drenched by water I have no idea what it contained. After calling the front desk, the only person on duty (who was not a manager) came to the room. It was 6:00 am before we got to the new room and 7:30 am before we fell back asleep (the a/c had not been running and it was 80 degrees in the room). As a result, in addition to the totally disgusting experience our time schedule was totally disrupted. We had planned to go to Disney's Animal Kingdom that day but we ended up sleeping til 11:00 am. Then we had to retrieve all our belongings (3 unpacked suitcases and a fridge full of water) from the old room and take it to the new room. Not fun. Over the next 3 days I asked 3 times to speak with a manager and was never given a name , phone number or option to do so. The only worker I ever saw was a young 20 something man named Mr. Patel. On the 4th day we planned to see the Space Shuttle take off in Titusville. So I went to the office to use the \"business center\".....1 old and dirty computer that did not work. Three times it said it was \"logging off\" and Mr. Patel was unable to fix it. 20 more minutes of my time wasted. The hotel was dirty, there was no manager available and it was a horrible experience. I would caution anyone to NEVER STAY HERE.

Well this hotel from the moment I arrived at the front door on my room I knew it would be a bad week. The lock on the door appeared to have been previously broken into the metal cover plate covering it was pryed back (investigating furthur found quite a few other room doors that had this) The room itself looked somewhat clean when we walked in. Small but I expected that. On the plus side the microwave and fridge appeared brand new which doing some grocery shopping at wal-mart superstores for some food in which we made our own quick lunches and breakfasts saved us a few bucks. But back to the room the toilet was like a amusement ride in itself reminded me of a teeter totter when u sat on it. The bath shower area had lost of mildew and the shower head was so rusted I think I saw it in a scrap yard a few weeks ago. The beds had the basic paper thin sheets on up and were very uncofomfortable I didnt have a single good night sleep..... or maybe cause it was the constant sirens from police cars and firetrucks going by considering you basically are on a highway. The general area itself didnt appear to recieve much cleaning either. When I arrived I saw a mixed drink glass sitting on the floor a few doors down from us with a number of beer caps around it. Guess what yup a week later they were all still there. The pictures are terribly misleading probably taken when hotel was brand new. A fellow inmate I was talking to in the hot tub mentioned if I saw the so called game room I hadn't yet so I took a walk over. It was pathetic 3 video games 1 pinball machine and 1 stuffed toy machine of those only 1 video game the pinball machine and stuffed toy machine were the only ones working and I think I played the same games in the 80's. The only complaint I didnt have was the pool area. The pool was clean everyday not terribly warm but kids enjoyed it. Hot tub was extremly hot but after walking all day at Disney beggers couldnt be choosers when you needed to unwind.

The outside of the hotel looked okay, its NO FOUR STAR - I'm not to sure about the India restaurant that was inside the hotel. It had diarrhea written all over it. We never set foot in the restaurant - I'm not sure if any other guest did too. I asked the front desk clerk if we could check in early if there were rooms available. Unfortunately, there were no rooms available and check in was not until 4 pm. The front desk clerk suggested to check back around 12:30 pm and there may be rooms available. We explored our surroundings and then came back around 1:30 pm. BUT still no rooms were available. The front desk clerk suggested while we waited, he can give us towels to hang out by the POOL. Of course we didn't pass up the chance to go swimming on a hot day. By the time we got our bathsuits and floaters out of the car, the front desk clerk said he has a room available for us. We checked in around 2:30 pm. We were given a room on the first level, towards the back of the building. VERY LIMITED PARKING AND NOT MUCH OF A VIEW. There were no working vending machines or ice machines in our area. The only working machines were near the pool & bar area. The pool & hot tub was a descent size. The bar had happy hour from 1-7 pm with a handful of appetizers. Our room consist of the standard furniture & bedding with a few extras; iron w/ironing board, frig and microwave. The bathroom was small and needed upgrades. First, the bathtub was stained - it needed a good scrubbing and a splash of bleach. Second, the bottom of the door was swollen - when trying to close the door, it would stick and leave pieces of the pressed wood behind. Third, the walls could use a brand new coat of white paint - the walls had black markings and faded paint. Fourth, I'm not sure if house keeping vaccumed the floors - that was well needed. House keeping did a great job cleaning the room & bathroom, taking out the trash and making the beds. I'll give them credit for that.

The best thing about it is its location; it's an easy hop to Disney World and there's a good Bob Evans restaurant within walking distance. Give the hotel management a little credit, too, for taking the time to mail back (COD) some items we left behind.

Don't waste your time, you are on vacation and you have precious few time to spend on it! Oh, I forgot to mention the big wolf spider that surprised me in the bathroom the day we left.

The staff was really nice and accommodating, offering free short term garage parking for our visiting guests.

However, the biggest problem was the noise of the room (107). I checked in and was told what the room number was. By the time my wife and I and our dogs were in the room and settled in, we realized how noisy it was going to be (being right next to I-5). It didn't help that other hotel guests above us were somewhat noisy and that we could hear a decent amount of noise coming from the pool area. It was nice that someone (I'm guessing one of the hotel front-desk workers) called us that evening to see how things were going. We mentioned the noise, and she nicely said she was sorry, noting that we could have been given a different room \"If we (the hotel) just would have known\" (that the noise of that room was going to bother us so much). Again, she was very nice, and I'm not sure what else I would have said in that situation if I had been her. However, I'm not sure what type of guest would be fine with a room like that--I don't think anyone would be able to sleep very well in that room. I realize that there is not much that can be done about the noise of those rooms, short of a full-scale overhaul. However, I will mention two smaller things that I think could be improved: 1) The TV was not very good. It's not that it has to be some newer, flat screen or something. But, the sound was distorted at times, and the remote was hard to use to control the volume. When we would hit \"Volume Up\" or \"Volume Down\", the volume would change by 5 or so notches each way, making it difficult to keep the TV at a volume that we were able to hear from bed, but that didn't hurt our ears. (We eventually just got up and changed the volume by hand.) 2) The bedding smelled very strongly of chlorine or something like that. I stay at a lot of mid-level hotels (like La Quinta), and I haven't experienced a smell that strong. So, sorry to be picking on so many things, but that's an honest review. Again, the hotel personnel were great, so I can't fault them at all. And, there was no pet fee, which was a huge plus for us. I wouldn't stay here again, though, purely because of the noise level.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft Leonard Wood", "Title": "\u201c10 dollars to park\u201d", "Author": "Professional99", "ReviewID": "UR125577839", "Content": "I respect that the hotel recommends you use their parking due to the low light street parking and the concern of crime, but 10 dollars seems excessive.

We made last minute reservations through Hotwire for 2 adults and 2 children. When we showed up, the lady told us that she would give us a room with a king bed. When we told her that we have children, she coldly said that's what we reserved that that's what we'd get via Hotwire. I showed her the Hotwire reservation which clearly stated 2 adults and 2 children, and the note which guarantees accommodating the number of guests reserved. She was a robot, and repeated that she could only give us a King Bed and next to the freeway (now by adding comment I take it that she aimed to make us even unhappier). She offered to upgrade us to a room for 4 if we would pay $10 extra. I showed her that in fact, the amount we got off Hotwire was only $4 less than their REGULAR rate for a room for 4 people! So that if we paid an extra $10, we would be paying MORE than the regular price and all this hassle to boot. She refused to budge and moved on to new customers. I called Hotwire immediately, and they confirmed with the hotel and found out that indeed we would not be accommodated, then offered for us to upgrade ourselves and they to reimburse us the $10. At this point, I refused to stay at the hotel with the nasty service (and extremely noisy next to the freeway) so I refused and exceptionally Hotwire gave us a refund because the hotel refused to accommodate the number of guests reserved as per their guarantee. The lady at the front desk was quite pregnant, so I give her some slack for her nasty behavior, but it was totally unreasonable that she refused to accommodate us even after Hotwire insisted that it was all part of the agreement.

Due to several reviews that said it was less than La Quinta standards I was somewhat nervous about the quality we would get. But I found it to be a very nice hotel. It is an easy hotel to find and access due to its location on an on/off ramp of I-5 and near the junction of I-8. Plus it is very close to the Old Town Transit Center so buses and trolleys are readily available to take you almost anywhere in town. Also Old Town is right there and is a great place to visit for an afternoon. With plenty of restaurant choices handy we didn't feel the need to travel anywhere to eat. The checkin was easy and friendly. The hotel was clean and looked in good repair. The hotel surrounded the courtyard pool. Our room was on the freeway side, but we were not disturbed by any noise from it. The beds were great, good sheets. The bathroom was clean. About the only negative was the limited amount of shampoo. Sometimes I bring my own, but didn't this time. There really wasn't enough for both of us. The first night there seemed to be a lot of marine groups, parents and their sons and recruiters. The second night was a group of bicyclists. Which is just saying I felt comfortable with my fellow guests. The neighborhood was good enough that we felt comfortable walking to the hotel. Next door is the Courtyard by Marriott and on the other corner was a gas station and small store. Another plus is the breakfast in the morning. One day for protein there were hard boiled eggs and then next there was yogurt. Instant oatmeal, make your own waffles, a variety of sweet rolls and bread and cold cereal, along with coffee, tea, a variety of juices and milk were also offered. The breakfast room was a little small, and some people took it out to the courtyard area. There was free wifi. I also noticed a computer in the lobby which appeared to be for guest use. Parking was available, but tight. We didn't have a chance to try the pool, but I got the feeling it was not heated.

They ask you to reuse the towels to save water which is not a problem but what do they do with the soap? Each day we opened a pack because the one we had the day before disappeared is there a soap mountain somewhere or are they selling the used bits to the soap shop in town?

We stayed three nights. Overall it was clean, although the carpets could have used a good shampooing. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was clean and our girls loved the pool. The breakfast offered many options, and our girls got such a kick out of making their own waffles. The seating area is a bit small, and we ended up just taking our food back to our room each morning... if we would have just gotten our bust our of bed a bit earlier, that would not have been an issue. A major plus, Old Town is just a short walk away. Tons of restaurant options, unique little shops and things to see. Again, our 5 and 6 year old girls had a blast wondering around and letting out some pent up energy. Other major dining chains are in the area, only a few minutes driving time away, and a mall too. Immediate freeway access and you are off to where you need to be. We loved our stay there. The price was right, and the atmosphere was just right for our family. We will most definitely be back to this property on our next jaunt to San Diego. It was quiet and homey. We loved it! The only cons I can come up with are as follows.... but they are hardly anything. Parking: it's not plentiful in this general area. Go ahead and take the underground parking at this property... but be forewarned: it is tight! Smaller vehicles only! Eeek! LOL The carpets were on the dirty side, and I would not have let a baby crawl on it. It could have used a good shampooing. And finally, the breakfast area had limited seating. You still had access to the food, but we ended up going back to our room with breakfast each morning because we got up on the late side. Hardly anything to not consider this property over.

It is right off the highway. The area is pretty isolated from the rest of the city being that it's very near the airport.

I certainly wouldn't walk around as there's nothing really close to it that I can remember. Reception was very friendly. We got to our room - it was in great shape was neat and clean - didn't look rundown. There was a slight musty smell at the writing desk - probably whatever rag they used to clean it. The rest of the room was okay. The safe was not working so we had to hide any of our electronics when we went out for dinner. This hotel is great if you need a place to stay for one night. It's very close to the airport so if you're arriving late and leaving the next day, it works out well. Parking was not free but only cost $8 for the night. The continental breakfast that was available in the morning was more than what I had expected. I was expecting to just see some cold muffins, some bread and stale coffee that's been standing around. Instead, there is a room with tables and chairs in it where you can sit down to eat. There is a waffle station where you make your own waffles using a special machine complete with a measuring cup for batter, breads, bagels (there's a toaster), danishes, muffins, coffee and tea.

People were sitting out by the pool, even on the wall. The queues for the bagel toaster and waffle maker were ridiculous. One morning there was at least 15 waiting. The pool is small and only has 4 loungers. Was fine the first day we got there, only us there, but busy after that. It was supposed to close at 10.30pm but doesnt.

I was alone so I got a decent rate ($79) on a smaller room with a queen. It was in a corner so it had a different layout than others here.

The room was next to the freeway, and the road noise was troublesome at times. But my biggest complaint was the small size of the breakfast area. There was about 4-5 tables, and they were all taken, with no place left to sit. I ate in my room which luckily wasn't far away. The parking garage is a little tight as others mentioned, but it's ok, I felt my car was safe there, and it kept the car off the street and out of the hot sun. But there were also good things here. The price was a fair value for the area, the pool was clean and inviting. The spa was clean and warm, and the bed was very comfortable. The room was clean and looked just fine.

The customer service was fine, no problems there.. so I would probably stay again if just for a night or two ... but I would ask for a larger room away from the freeway side, and pay the extra.

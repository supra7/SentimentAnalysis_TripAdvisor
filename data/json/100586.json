The hotel staff is exceptional, the room was great, and location is perfect--right in the heard of downtown. The service really stood out to me--for example, I was checking in with a friend and we inquired if our rooms were near each other (didn't expect this as we booked separately) the hotel staff said no--but would you like them to be? We said yes, and immediately re-booked us to adjoining rooms! Also, after I left, I realized I had left something in my room. A manager e-mailed me letting me know they found it and asked for my mailing address so he could mail to to me (or also said I could pick it up if it would be easier). The room was really cozy, yet still very stylish and hip! I just had a standard room with a King bed but it came with a wall long couch too. The room also came with a place to plug in your ipod and play music, TV, and a DVD player (which is nice for longer stays as it seems silly to pay so much for the pay per view movies). I love all the Bliss products in the bathroom and the bathroom was very chic and modern. Oh, and the hotel bar/restaurant Trace was excellent. Very yummy drinks and a good late night happy hour!

Had I known, I probably wouldn't have chosen to stay here. Not the fault of the hotel but of the conference organisers who booked the W as part of their package. So with this caveat..... Very friendly staff, mostly helpful but not so much when I asked them why the bar was closed at 10pm. They had a makeshift bar and restaurant in the hotel. They made a great fuss about handing out this schedule on check in. In my room they had left a message for me to contact the front desk to ensure that I had received the schedule. But it was worthless. The bar closing time was midnight on the schedule but in reality, they were closing it whenever they wanted. What's was the point of the schedule? Anyway....the room was good, nice smellies in the bathroom. Terrible view but it was away from the street and so relatively quiet.

We had never stayed in a W, and we both loved it! We thought the price was very fair for a great city location within walking distance of many restaurants and two Starbucks. My daughter and I loved the cool, hip atmosphere and special touches such as flavored water & morning coffee in the lobby. I'm not sure why others have complained about the rooms. Our room with double beds was very clean, spacious, and stocked with spa-like robes and Bliss bath products/shampoos. Everything looked pretty new, with upscale trendy decor. The Westin Heavenly Beds were plush and very comfortable. Parking is expensive in a nearby garage, but that's typical for all downtown hotels. Once we parked, we never needed to drive our car since we were able to walk whereever we wanted to go. It's located in the bus \"free zone\" so you can hop on a free bus and get closer to many popular destinations such as Westlake & Pacific Place shopping centers. Walking to Pike Place Market is possible (about 6 city blocks away), or shorten your walk by riding the free bus for a couple blocks and get off near Pike Street. (Unless you know what you're doing, be careful not to take one of the long \"express\" buses, since they don't make as many stops). I highly recommend the Purple Cafe & Wine Bar which is only a block away. The food was great and the ample selection of wine flights which is a fun way to try several good wines. The W is definitely not for everyone, especially not for young children, not for elderly, and not for anyone wanting lots of amenities and pampering. I highly recommend the W Seattle if you are wanting a great central city location and a unique hotel experience.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cSeattle does W best\u201d", "Author": "lisa m", "ReviewID": "UR125489098", "Content": "Best W I have stayed in by far.

To me this W seems like a renovation of a previous, traditional hotel. We did get the fabulous corner room on a top floor, 22nd. I love the floor to ceiling windows on the corner and sat in the chaise looking out at the buildings, park and traffic for glorious hours. That's what I do when I leave my small town home. We did have a view of the beautiful city library but not the water unfortunately. We stayed five days and got to know many of the staff. They were good to great. One that stood out was Micheal who floated around the front desk. He introduced himself. Got to know us but didn't linger. He always asked if I wanted juice for our baby, water and even made sure I had a bag to carry it all in. Every time we saw him. He jumped to it. I call it the W hustle and he had it. The lobby had coffee and donuts every morning and beautiful cookies every afternoon. Maybe because of the reno's. Wifi was also free in our rooms because of it. That pleased me. I hate when they still charge you for everything even though the services are limited. It was the lobby and restaurant that were being renovated. They had a temporary restaurant which I also appreciated. My husband needed it in the morning when the baby was still getting up too early for me. The location is nice, near the water, Pike Place market and shopping. I tried a lot of the local restaurants and had some amazing food. Shuckers next door is good for a cocktail and oysters. Nice old, wood bar with atmosphere in the old Olympia hotel, now the Fairmont. Also in this hotel is the amazing Belle Epoque (I think) a french bakery. This is a must. Coffee and pastries are amazing. I also had a Croque Mousier for breakfast and might say it was the best thing I ate in Seattle. We went to Spur Gastropub for Valentines day and though it was tasty, they didn't serve enough food or drink in the set menu and at $85 for food and $40 for wine it was just too much for what it was. Cool place and atmosphere and maybe the regular menu is great. I would try again. I would stay here again, I just can't wait to be able to use the restaurant and bar.

Here's a quote from the room service menu (when public options are all under construction).... \"...Please note a 23% service charge and a $4.00 delivery charge is added to the bill.

From SEA-TAC airport a cab will run you about $45 dollars depending on the time of day. I walked in to the Hotel and was greeted promptly by a very freindly staff. Check in went smooth and quickly, although I guess one of thier machines was broken so they had to call someone else to type my card number into the machine. I was given my room keys and was off to my room. The room was very nice and the views were great. There are a lot of windows and they have the blinds open for you when you arrive. Closing them is a chore, but it is a pleasant one. On my desk there was also a small bottle of wine and a fruit and cheese plate with a letter welcoming me. I did not know whether or not this was complimentary or not so I did not endulge right away. The bathroom was quite large and the necessary bathroom amenities were there as well as some extra ones like face-wash that I notices was available. My search of the room continued as I found a small cupboard by the television contained some snacks such as snickers, almonds, M&Ms and other snacks. I looked around for the costs of these things but did not find any information. This becomes a reoccurring theme. Then I unlocked the mini bar to take a peek and again it was full of great items, but there was no information regarding a cost. Not wanting to pay an exorbitant amount for some M&Ms I simply closed the cupboard. I had arrived late in the evening and was hungry, again not wanting to pay for snacks I proceeded to look for the hotel guide to see if there were any restaurants in the area. I looked around the TV...nothing. I looked on the Desk, in the desk, in all of the night-stands and flat surfaces...nothing. The only thing I found was an art book and a \"W\" shopping magazine (apparently this hotel also sells clothes for some reason). Fed up with searching and my hunger growing I went to the front desk to ask. Again the front desk was very helpful when I asked about a sandwich place or a place to get something quick to eat, they pointed me to the subway. I got lost but it was not the fault of the hotel it was just my own curiosity. I found a Rock Bottom Brewery and then saw the subway on the way back. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. The following morning I woke up at 3 am because I had flowin in form the East Coast. I waited until 7 and then remembered that I had heard the employee mention to the guest checking in in front of me something about breakfast. I was starving by this point so I called the front desk to cancel my wake-up call and asked about breakfast. They told me it was on the 2nd floor. I went down to breakfast and was greeted by a buffet of eggs and fruit and other meats. I though this was quite a good complimentary breakfast until the waiter dropped off the bill. It was only $22 bucks, but when you think it is complimentary, that is quite a shock. Maybe I would have known this if they had a hotel guide. We used the facilities for a conference and aside from the construction, which I knew about before attending, the facilities were amazing. The staff was quick to react to any request, and the water glasses were always filled with delicious water. I cannot mention enough how great the staff was. Check out was a breeze. My bill was under my door the morning I woke up and all I had to do was use the check-out feature on the TV and then leave my keys in the room. I did not get a chance to use the Acura experience by a fellow meeting attendee did and he had nothing but good things to say about it. Aside from the hotel guide that I wish they had, everything about this hotel was great, and I wish I could see it when the renovations are complete. I saw pictures and am sure it will be amazing.

I called the hotel directly and was able to get a decent discount. If you plan on using their valet know that it's pretty pricey($40) and that it's kind of confusing to find. The valet entrance was so small and packed with cars that they told me to park on the sidewalk. It makes it kind of difficult to unpack your car, and then haul your luggage up stairs to get to the lobby. The lobby is pretty small but contemporary and well appointed. Check-in was easy and they upgraded us to a nicer room. The spectacular room was well furnished with a nice view. Nice couch near window. Bathroom was nice but looked a little tired. Cracking tile, dirty grout, and a shower that didn't drain properly. Bath towels were horribly scratchy and old. Bath products were Bliss brand which are very nice. The room had a nice ipod dock, but it did not work. I later found out that you had to have the T.V. on in order for it to work. It would have been nice if they had some directions explaining that in the room. The bed was extremely comfortable. Climate control worked well, except it was run by a sensor so if you left the room when you came back it was hot and stuffy because the system shuts off. Also, no coffee maker which I found interesting especially in a city like Seattle. Overall, a comfortable room but definitely in need of a face lift. As far as the rest of the hotel, there is a bar that is in the lobby that had a D.J. at night time. It was a lot of fun, drinks were good, appetizers were okay. In conclusion, I would recommend the W. It is in a great location. The price is reasonable if you can get a discount. The bar is nice, and the public areas are trendy and cool.

This is a business-oriented hotel situated within the downtown financial district, within easy walking distance to Pike Place Market, numerous restaurants, and shopping. What impressed us most during our stay at the W were the staff. Often times, staff attitudes to guests can make or break the experience but every staff member with who we interacted was incredibly professional, efficient, friendly, and welcoming (other hotels could learn a thing or two from the W Seattle about guest relations)! We had opted to upgrade to a Spectacular Room (room category) on the 20th floor and were happy to have done so, given the traffic sounds from below. Having researched this property earlier, I was already aware of the advertised room rates but as this was our conference venue we were fortunate enough to obtain a corporate rate. While the room was spacious and the bed was comfortable, the accommodations overall were still slightly underwhelming (definitely not \"Spectacular\"). The room easily showed signs of wear and tear-----scuffed walls, worn furniture and upholstery----that truly should have been corrected to help justify the pricey room rates and to stay within standards one would expect of the W Hotel brand. Other practical suggestions on areas to improve are: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Improve the lighting in the room, particularly the bathroom----there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing worse than trying to apply makeup using lighting that gives everyone and everything a jaundiced cast. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Install a towel hook on the back of the bathroom door----the current hook is impractically placed on the VERY narrow strip of wall between the bathroom door and the start of the shower tiles, so hanging anything on it will prevent the door from closing unless the object is first moved. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Provide a recycling bin to help reduce waste. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Provide a plastic bag/liner for the ice bucket----this is much more hygienic, given that one simply cannot be certain of how well the bucket is washed out between guests. The lounge/bar was quite busy. Also be warned that only valet parking is available at this hotel, at the cost of $45.00 per day.

The room was ok, it was large and comfy but I was indifferent to the space. My room (711) had a view of the parking lot that everyone could look into, fine turn the venetian blinds well no matter what I tried the light still seeped in, this did not bother me but I know it would bother many. There was a card on the night table that said because of the view I get free internet, I confirmed this but it was still on my bill, it was removed. (Why does any hotel charge for internet these days?). There was good free coffee in the lobby in the morning and a nice refreshing drink in the afternoon (hint to tourists not staying there but walking by). As for environmentally friendly??? None not even a note requesting you to reuse your towel. I turned off all my lights but when I came back all were on, including the bathroom, this was part of the turn down service.

I did not find this W hotel very special. As a supposed hip hotel targeted to younger guests I still do not understand why they do not offer free WiFi in the rooms. $14.95/day is kind of ridiculous. Rooms are nice but obviously a bit worn with some worn-out furniture, acceptably clean but not 4-star clean, and rusted/chipped/cracked fixtures in the bathroom. Not terrible but not 4-star. My visit: Arrived by Amtrak from Portland and walked the approximately 1 mile from King Street Station (not a bad walk but it is uphill). Check in was quick and staff very pleasant. I am a SPG Gold member but did not receive an upgraded room. They did offer one free \"small\" (and it is small, like 300mL) bottle of Fiji water free per day from the minibar. Pretty ridiculous benefit but whatever... Room is adequate size. Room was clean but not exactly 4-star clean. Some dust on the TV and night stand. Rust and peeling chrome in the bathroom. King bed and linens were very comfortable. Nice seating area by the window. I did not have much of a view in a \"Wonderful\" room. Some of the \"Spectacular\" rooms I saw did have view of the Space Needle which was nice. Air conditioning worked adequately but in the summer I tend to like to keep my room cold and it never really got cold. Not too hot, just not cold. Bathroom was large with nice hot shower but measly water pressure. Again, not four-star here. Typical W amenities of a variety of high quality Bliss products. Strangely there were 3 bath towels but each was a different material. (I don't know if this is like the \"choose your own pillow\" thing that W and other hotels have going on nowadays but I thought it was odd). Two terry robes are available but again these have seen better days. There is a small desk area. There is a flat screen TV (on the smaller side of things...maybe 35\") with the typical obnoxious hotel slow channel-changing remote. HBO is free. There is a DVD player. The front desk has about 35 old DVDs to checkout (and I do mean old...the newest movie on the list is probably from maybe 2000, if that). But there is an IGA supermarket nearby with a RedBox if staying in and watching a movie is your thing. No in-room coffee (something I wish W would start offering). They do have decent coffee in the lobby. No newspaper delivery to the room but there were a couple of newspapers by the elevator...if you weren't quick enough though, they would all be gone. The ice machine on my floor was broken. I'm sure had I called the desk they would have brought ice. But, maybe when the ice machine on a floor is broken, they should just keep the ice buckets full in the rooms on that floor. This is what I expect from four star hotel which this W is obviously not. I did not spend much time in the evening at the hotel itself so I can't comment on nightlife there but it seemed even returning late in the evening there was still quite a crowd in the lobby/bar. I did get the complimentary 4:00pm checkout as a SPG Gold without a problem. Again staff was pleasant and efficient at checkout. Hotel is in a good location. There are a lot of restaurants and bars nearby. It's is easy walking distance to Pike Place Market, the modern glass & steel public library, and Bank of America/Columbia Center Tower (the tallest building in Seattle with an observation deck). If you head a bit far south it does get a bit sketchy at night so just be aware...overall Seattle is relatively safe. It's about 1-1/2 mile walk to SafeCo field and Qwest (now named something even dumber) field or a quick bus ride if you are going to an event. Public transportation in Seattle is excellent so if you are wondering if you should rent a car or not for a short visit I would not bother...as long as you are staying in the Seattle area. You could always rent a car for one day if you wanted to make a day trip to sites farther afield and there are plenty of rental car places around the hotel area. I would not stay at the W Seattle again. Nothing particularly bad about the hotel but I think you could do better at this price point. They need to fix the bathrooms and clean the rooms a bit better. W should offer free internet. Although the other big chains at this price point don't, all the independent boutique hotels do; and these boutique hotels are really the main competition for W hotels, in my opinion.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery convienent!\u201d", "Author": "Travelboom99", "ReviewID": "UR116858526", "Content": "Great place to stay.

We are SPG gold members and this was one of several options we had to redeem points for a pre-cruise stay. The reception area is very nice with a large bowl of apples available for snacks.

The heavenly bed that each room comes with always ensures me that I will be sleeping well. The bathroom was decent sized too. Accessibility was the main plus for this hotel. Getting to the hotel was super easy. We like taking public transportation that is easy to use and Seattle is a great city for using buses and trains. We took the light rail from the airport to the hotel as we were not in any hurry. It was so cheap, about $3 per person and we got off one block from the hotel. Our main problem is that we travel very heavy and had to haul 250 pounds of luggage up the hill one block to the hotel. Even that wasn't too bad. In comparison, we could have taken a taxi for about $50. The hotel offered the Acura test drive experience where you could get a free ride around town within 5 miles of the hotel. We arranged for a ride to the cruise ship the next day which saved about $15 in taxi fares. All our saved transportation fees covered our extra baggage fees for the airline! Location was good although there seemed to be a Westin closer to the big mall in the center of town that had the monorail to the Space Needle. However, the W was located in an area where you could get on any public bus and travel. We enjoyed a nice walk both mornings of our stay to the first Starbucks at Pike Place to get coffee although there was another Starbucks just across the street from the hotel (and practically every corner in between). A big plus was that after the cruise, the W held our luggage for us until we were ready to travel to the airport. We took a taxi back from the cruise ship, checked in our luggage, and walked around town.

The bed was uncomfortable and there were no extra blankets (with a lighter weight than duvet) or pillows to use. Also $11 for a room service milkshake? Give me a break! If the hotel was fancy enough to warrant a milkshake that expensive that would be a wholly different story. Do yourself a favor and stay at the hyatt or Monaco for a much better experience.

The room was small, lacked all hope for trendy and upscale, and was layed out like a Best Western. Valet parking was awful. I understand it is Seattle and parking is like oil, expensive. However, to bleed your paying guests out of $45 (including tax) a day to park, you should look at some other options. Another fee to add to the fun, use of the fitness center! The only bright spot was location. It was easy to walk to any place we wanted. Unfortunately at their concierge, the girl giving directions was off on one of our locations by six blocks. Another time we asked for the nearest US Bank and were sent to the convention center (several bloacks away). Later that weekend we walked one block down from the hotel and surprise there was a US Bank. - Once again, lacking in \"spectacular\". To summarize I would say you would be better off spending your $725.97 where you can get a good night sleep, better parking, a nicer room, and real \"whenver, wherever\" (their signature phrase) treatment.

I Called down 3 times at 2 am one night to complain about the drunk kids running around and yelling obcenities in the hallways. The person answering the phone appeared to be amused. Perhaps so, but I think it is reasonable to expect some sleep at a hotel and ask security to take care of it. On two consecutive mornings requests for follow up wakeup calls were ignored.

Scratches and sticky goopy material on wall (like coke or tobacco tried not to look to closely). Bathrooms dated and showers dripping and worn.

My first stay was at the W Chicago City Center in 2009. I loved that stay, as the hotel was beautiful, modern, but very comfortable! The W Seattle, however fell short by the standards set by the W Chicago. My understanding is that the W Seattle is one of the earliest W's built and opened, and that it's the least ostentatious of the properties. Indeed, the room didn't feel very 4 star. The wood decor was chipping and pealing, the bathroom was dirty with a broken showerhead, and there was little of the whimsical enhancements from my previous W stay, just a bed, TV, and bathroom. The bed, was comfortable, as was to be expected from a Starwood property. The Valet park took quite a bit of time, and I had to park on the street for 20 minutes with my hazards on - it was the middle of December, and the sign said full except for guests, so I'm not faulting them. Check in was easy, and I was upgraded to a Spectacular room. The desk clerk noted my previous W visit and assured me that they had added a coffee maker to my room. I'm used to having one in my room, and the Chicago W made sure to round one up for me, and promised that there would always be one when I returned t other hotel. I was expecting this in Seattle, however, there was no coffee maker in my room. A call to the whatever, whenever service revealed a person who said frankly, 'the W doesn't have coffeemakers, but let me see what I can do.\" She never called back. Positives included the restaurant, which did a custom vegan tasting meal for my friend. The staff was exceptional, and the food was seasonal, inspired, and delicious. I highly recommend Earth and Ocean whether you stay at the W or not. In all, I can't see the value in the W compared to the Westin (the original Starwood Westin flagship hotel) or the newly renovated Sheraton, or the Westin Bellevue. Seattle has some nice modern boutique hotels which have the polish, trip, and service down 100%, the W doesn't. The hotel is showing it's age (ironic for a hip hotel brand only a decade + in age). Particularly with the premium you pay for the W, I don't see why it should be a must-stay in Seattle. I didn't appreciate being promised something, and then when it didn't happen, I never got a response back from the staff.

For the most part, some of us are very widely traveled. The W was recommended to me by my son who travels to Seattle on business periodically, and he stays at the W. Pros: The location was wonderful. We took the light rail from the airport ($2.50) and the University station was one block away at 3rd and Seneca. The hotel is at 4th and Seneca.

It feels like they are trying to be hip, but we all felt like it was too much. Trying to see the room numbers in the hallway was fun. We asked for 2 beds in each room, and they were double beds. Most hotels provide two Queens. Sharing with sisters was okay, but it would have been more comfortable with queen beds. I mean -who uses doubles anymore?

I booked a room online & requested a king size bed in my reservation. When I got to my room I was given 2 queen size beds. Side note - unless queen size beds in the US are smaller, which I doubt, I would consider these beds double beds at best. When I called down to the front desk to voice my concerns & see if I could get a room as per my booking request, I was curtly told that there were no other rooms available, that I wasn't the only person who was not getting the King Size bed as requested, and that there was nothing he could do. No solutions, options or compensation offered for my dissatisfaction. 10 minutes after checking in to the Hotel, my key card wasn't working in the elevator. When i went to the front desk to get a new card, I observed the same front desk clerk issuing complimentary drinks at the hotel lounge to a few guests who were looking for something to do. REALLY - you're going to offer complimentary drinks to people who are bored but to your guests who are unsatisfied, nothing? I was given a new key card but each time I went in the elevator is took about 5-6 times before it actually worked & let me up the elevator (frustrating & embarrassing). The hotel building itself has incredibly bad insulation/sound proofing & I could hear my neighbours at all hours of the night & day. The room doors weren't properly aligned (or something) & extremely hard to close - you basically had to slam the door to close it. So again, loud noises as everyone around me was slamming their doors. And the final complaint - $15 for internet access? For the nightly rate @ the W, internet should be free!

The W hotel is a nice hotel and the rooms are of adequate size with nice appointments, but everything else is average at best. Things I would expect from a true luxury hotel: free internet (not just in the lobby); free coffee in room; free bottle of water in room. The W Seattle doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any of these. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Acura Experience,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd what is supposed to be a kind of personal shuttle that can take you to anywhere within a few miles of the hotel only runs until 5 or 6 pm. To us, the only helpful time to use this amenity would be for going to dinner somewhere. Unless you were eating with seniors for the early bird special, it was done operating by the time you were ready. The location of the hotel is wonderful, but there are many other hotels within the downtown area that my be a better overall place to stay. The concierge was helpful for things around the city, mostly restaurants, but when we asked him a question about our Mt. Rainier trip that we were planning, he said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any idea. I know the park and mountain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t within the city limits, but an attraction of that size with such proximity to the city is something a hotel concierge should know about and be able to inform its guests. Also, when we asked him what there was to do in a particular neighborhood, most of the time the only advice he could provide us with was a place to eat; which is not what we were looking for. In my opinion, you can get the same comfort and quality for less at a place like the Westin or the Four Points Sheraton, or pay a little bit more each night and stay at a true luxury hotel like the Fairmont. At the W, all you are paying for is the name and unfortunately, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth it.

We've stayed at almost all of the major hotels (and some great B&B's) in Seattle and we looked forward to trying the W. As a loyal TA user we had read the wide range of reviews and were keeping our fingers crossed. We were not unhappy :) To begin with the staff were all very keen to please. They were incredible especially the concierge (Jay?) My one suggestion for all of Seattle's concierge is to \"Get outta the box\" and try some local restaurants outside of downtown. Seattle has an amazing culinary scene but it's not all downtown. The hotel location is fabulous and as long as you like the \"COOL' style they are going for you will like it. Dark hallways took some getting used to and I never did feel quite \"Mod\" enough but I wasn't uncomfortable. They offer towncar service but not at night(?), There aren't any coffee makers in the rooms but there are urns of Starbucks in the lobby in the AM and urns of lemon water in the afternoon. Our King room (1911?) was comfy although it smelled a lil stale on check in. The housekeepers either need more time or a kick in the butt as there was a lot of dust (look at the wine bottles) and the grout in the shower/tub could use a good bleaching. I'd suggest that the housekeepers lie down in the tub and see what it looks like under the taps. Don't get me wrong its not really dirty its just not top notch. Towels and Robe (why just 1?) were really nice and the bed and bedding were fabulous. The drapes are not black out. I liked the touch of having a DVD player in the room but ours was flaky. Maintenance was fast to respond to this issue when called. I also liked the window seat. Parking is the same nasty thing here as every hotel in Seattle. $37 a night. Why?

The location is great for seeing Seattle or fo downtown business. If my business needs did not necessitate a car, I would have jumped the light rail from SeaTac and then had the Acura service take me around. I had to have a rental car and parking is an arm and a leg, but there is free street parking after 6 PM and all day Sunday. The bar is active with a nice mix of people and ages. They have a great happy hour early and then again late with a nice bar bites menu and drink specials. As a solo business traveler I ordered from the Restaurant Menu at the bar. The duck breast was outstanding and well priced. The rooms are still great. Not huge, but very well designed and appointed. The bed is absolutely a dream. The bathroom very nicely done in Ivory tile and polished Chrome fittings. Finally the Bliss products are out of this world. A couple of nit pics.

I also feel that I'm almost outgrowing the W's 'hip' style. There was a party (or after party) every night in the Lobby and the restaurant in the ground floor. The late night parties weren't much of a bother except running into drunk people in the Elevator. True to W's style, the hallways are dimly lit, my companion even commented it might be because they were trying to save on lighting. The room itself were quite fine. We had a higher floor so no noise travelled up, and we weren't disturbed in anyway. The W also offers a free car service to places nearby with their Acura SUV service. The staff for the most part was polite. We checked in late at night and the concierge was helpful in directing us where to go for food, mostly to popular cafe style places. However, we ended up across the street at the Fairmont, they've got a brilliant restaurant, Shuckers. Out of all the staff, there was probably just one single front desk person that was a bit dismissive when we wanted more info (We wanted to get a half day rate since we were going to check out late, I mean, c'mon, we're trying to pay more, so a little service please). Overall, it was a standard stay, I'd recommend it to younger couples and to those that aren't bothered by late nigh social gatherings and occasional drunkard in the elevator (We were there for three nights, and ran into an inebriated person every night). Personally, I felt I was over the age limit of the W.

You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve chosen the best hotel in Seattle! Over the years I have become spoiled with the service and amenities provided by W Hotels all over the world, but the W Seattle is at the top of my list. My Dad and I live just east in Coeur D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Alene Idaho, so Seattle is a manageable drive giving us a great opportunity to relax, eat, drink and be merry. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at the W Seattle five times now from Christmas through the baseball season. I realized I have been remiss in not providing a review for other travelers, as well as to show our appreciation for the fine service we always receive at the W Seattle. Initially, I contacted the W to inquire as to whether they were pet friendly and happily discovered that not only are they pet accepting but are pet LOVERS, a huge benefit as my Dad refuses to leave his small dog. We arrived at the W, greeted straight away by the very friendly and helpful valet attendants who whisked our bags into the hotel. The Valets gave incredible service, bountiful information and greeted us by name the whole weekend. They do charge for parking but having lived in metropolitan cities for many years this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make me flinch. They do offer quick and courteous unlimited entry and exit, which many hotels do not. Check-in in the chic and modern lobby, complete with smooth music and original art, was flawless and efficient. The staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friendliness and professionalism continued with our front desk attendant Mary who checked us in and also provided much valuable information. Tasty, fruit infused, chilled water was offered in the reception area of which we gladly accepted, being parched from our five hour drive. The lobby and lower \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Living Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have a very cool jazz/Ibiza Lounge feel, coated with hip accents. At night Living Room turns into the place to see and be seen as the bar is just to the left, complete with a DJ spinning etherial music. The Living Room is also where I would take my morning cup of coffee and utilize the free wireless internet. I usually just pay for internet in the room but not wanting to disturb my pop who sleeps late these days, the Living Room is very comfortable and a good way to socialize with other early risers. Additionally, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a Starbuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s addict there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a location directly across the street from the Living Room. Our room was incredible. Upon entering we discovered another amazing W touch of class with the doggy bed, complete with personal food and water bowls and a name placard with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lilly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd written on it. I believe there was even a toy of some sort for her. Both beds with incredible linens and comfort kept us sleeping like babies. To the far end of the room was a great window couch affording an incredible view of the Seattle skyline and an amazing place to sit and read, as well as enjoy our 4:30 cocktails before the ball game. The bathroom continued the flow of comfort and sophistication complete with Bliss Spa soaps, shampoo and lotion. I loved the Bliss products so much I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m ordering them for home. The W Seattle is located perfectly just up and away from the hustle and bustle of Pike Market but close enough to walk. Shopping, dinning, museums, live entertainment, bars, and the waterfront are all easily accessible from the W. Because of my dad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age and replaced knees we usually walk DOWN and take a cab back from wherever we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone. A cab ride from the W too all the cool spots is $5 - $15, roughly. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve eaten in Earth and Ocean, the in house dining option, on several occasions and have never been disappointed. The fare is good, the service friendly and attentive and price point is reasonable for a hotel restaurant. I will say I prefer breakfast there, great omelets and incredible seasoned new potatoes. In all fairness I must say that as a bit of a foodie I find it difficult to dine anywhere more than once, this is certainly true of hotel restaurants as well. So our not eating at Earth and Ocean every evening is more from my need to explore and discover new dining spots. Bottom line, the W Seattle is excellent, and we anxiously look forward to returning at every departure. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that for too many things in life, especially hotels. So, book the room, enjoy the city and look for Mike and Ron, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bacon Boys\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sitting in the Living Room or the bar and join us for a cocktail.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockwall, Texas", "Title": "\u201cI've stayed at many Starwood hotels and...\u201d", "Author": "Drroady", "ReviewID": "UR63663276", "Content": "I've stayed at many Starwood hotels and this one is truly one of the best.

We told him - casual mexican. He hailed us a cab and off we went. The cab driver couldn't find the place - cost us $20 cab fare and then he dropped us off at some wierd, freaky tequila bar in the middle of nowwhere. Not a mexican restaurant.

Ambiance, rooms & restaurants: W Seattle has a boutique feel to it and you feel chic the moment you step inside. I am particularly fond of the lounge in the evening, when local or not, beautiful people come for drinks (and sometimes food). The rooms are fine, nothing extraordinary but definitely won't dissapoint. I don't have the same complaints as many others do about the dark hallways and elevators. It's nice in a way but I find the dimmed lighting more Vegas than luxe. It's a colour preference perhaps. The restaurant is expensive and the food subpar. I've only eaten brunch there and try not to do that if I don't have to. Service: Don't expect great service from the front desk, concierge, lounge servers or at the restaurant. Room service is also slow and so is housekeeping. The staff seem to have received no training in customer service. Distance to shops: It's a bit of a walk but all downhill. If you want proximity to Nordstrom, Hyatt is your hotel but I prefer W and just walk 5 min. to Nordstrom. Overall: If your stay is a short one which wouldn't give rise to too many interactions with the hotel staff, then W is a great place to stay. It's definitely worth a try for you to form your own opinion.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "weatherford, oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cfamily and work trip\u201d", "Author": "thetravelinggrandma", "ReviewID": "UR47924012", "Content": "Visited family in Seattle that I hadn't seen for yrs. The hotel was the one chosen for my husband with his business travel. The beds were very comfortable, though the scenery for us wasn't the best, as we had the view of a parking garage. This sits only about four blocks from the Harbor, though walking there was hard for us, as the hills are so steep. We had a nice restaurant at the hotel, but they had blaring music at the bar next to it and so it wasn't the easiest place to relax in. The food was excellent, (prime rib), but the cost for the meals were a bit pricey. It was in the hub of all the best shopping places that you could find! They had numerous high designer shops all the way down to Ross for Less. They had a nice German Restaurant, called Gordon Biersch at a mall a few blocks away in a wonderful three or four story mall. Great taxi drivers in the area and all seemed hospitable and those in Seattle just seemed laid back and relaxed sort of folks. Would love to go back again. Only negative is the loud, blaring music in the bar, but if you like trendy music, then you would like that too. Saw the Seattle Space Needle, which is a must for Seattle travlers. Must have their lunch or dinner package when you are there, which is pricey, at about 100 dollars for two people, but the Space Needle rotates and you get a complete view of the Seattle horizon. One of the prettiest skylines at night that I have ever seen!!! Had to pay for internet use in room, but the package was about forty dollars for a few days. Great fish meals at the harbor!

The bed was great, too, although I wish there was more choice of pillows. Maybe a firmer one or a foam one? The office/business furniture in the room looked a little worse for wear, though, and for a place this pricey, internet access should be free, and the business center should expand its business hours; 9am-7pm doesn't really work for non-business travelers. Instead, I went down the street and used the public library's computers for free (your local tax dollars at work!). Check-in went smoothly, and the young woman at the front desk was very helpful and positive. Not quite what I expected at all. But the concierge--ugh. Both men that I interacted with were snooty and not very helpful. Maybe it's because I mainly asked about public transit, but I was told that both of them knew nothing about it or how to get a transit map. They could, though, look up a specific route online for me. That may have been helpful for dinner, but with a day full of sightseeing, I wanted more information while I was out and about. The barrista (barristo? it was a guy...) down by the Sculpture Park was way more helpful, pointing me in the right direction of the bus tunnel (transit center) as well as giving me a number to call Metro for bus times, directions, and lines. Really, W Seattle, you need to hire that guy! All in all, the hotel was fine.

At the front desk, the woman who checked us in was really unfriendly, the lobby was a total mess (pillows everyone, empty glasses, an empty water pitcher and no sign of anyone replacing the water). I thought at least the rooms would be great, but we walked in and it looked like a Holiday Inn had been refaced with a plasma TV and some black and white photography. It was tiny, incredibly loud, the carpets weren't very clean, there were blinds instead of blackout shades, and the bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on in a \"4 star\" hotel in my life.

There's also no coffee/tea in the room, and no microwave/ coffee pot so that you can make your own. So if you want some morning caffeine, which seems like a pretty basic amenity, you either have to pay about $12 for room service ($6 for the drink, plus $4 delivery, and other charges) or get dressed and head out to the Starbucks across the street. Also, the bar/restaurant downstairs is a total scene, which, depending on your point of view, is probably either really cool or kind of depressing. And the lighting in the hallways is so dark you can't even see your room number. Like another reviewer said, it's eerie, not cool. All in all, there's a lot to like at the W, but I'm not in a hurry to go back there. With the wifi/coffee situation, I felt like I was getting gouged; with the scene going on downstairs, I felt like I had to get through a club to get to my room.

Apparently, the cruise ships take off on Sundays and most hotels are booked on Saturday nights in the summer. So we decided to try a W for the first time. Never again. First off, the rate was ridiculous. We paid $264/night and the parking was $43 a night! When we first checked in, we had to ask twice for help with our luggage. The check-in staff were not especially friendly either. The concierge was very rude and it felt like we were a bother when asking questions. Not only that, but the guy gave us false information saying that it takes a good 3.5 to 4 hours to drive to Mt. Ranier and discouraged us from going. We went anyway, and it took only 2 hours to get there! The room was ok, albeit very small. Nothing spectacular here. The lobby was dimly lit and cramped. There was barely any room to move around when there were a large number of guests checking in. We were traveling with our 2 young kids (9 and 4). The entire time we were there we got looks from the other guests. It really felt like kids were not welcome there. This was very discouraging. Our youngest child has a lot of food allergies, mainly peanuts and eggs. My wife had called a week in advance and talked to the front desk manager and the chef at the restaurant and told them about the allergies and what he can and can't have. They assured us that they would purchase the necessary items so that he could enjoy eating breakfast with the rest of us. When we got there, they had no clue about his allergies and had done nothing to prepare in advance! They offered him a bowl of fruit for breakfast. My wife was furious! They were told a week in advance about the allergies and still were clueless. I will never stay at the W Seattle again and probably not another W period.

We had a room on the 16th floor with a so-so view of the next door building and a bit of downtown. The rooms are a bit dark, even with all of the lights on.

It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need to be said that it is an amazing property. The rooms were incredibly decadent, very modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor, lovely furniture. Our room had a chaise lounge in it overlooking the corner windows which though it said floor to ceiling, the rooms are pretty short in height so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as incredible as I thought it would be. However, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong it was still beautiful. The bed was incredibly luxurious and comfortable. The room was actually pretty big with a beautiful desk and the bathroom was quite swanky, though it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a soaking tub or jet tub which I had tried everywhere to find out and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the website. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your basic tub with shower set up. Now I know. We were on the 12th floor so it was just city views, in fact we looked at the back of the Four Seasons. But city streets otherwise. Higher floors may have more impressive views. It was quite a luxurious experience. My husband had bought me roses and so we called down and asked if they could bring us up a vase and within 2 minutes we had a knock on the door and a couple of options of vases. The location is great, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little more in the business area of town, but only a couple blocks from some great shopping. The bar is actually in the lobby of the hotel, as in, it sort of is the lobby of the hotel so you can just sit by the fire or anywhere on the sofas or chairs and they will come and get your order. We did not eat in the bar or the restaurant so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak to that experience, though it looked lovely. It was a little full of itself. Check-in was a little frosty, and the bar as well seemed a bit pretentious. But if you just overlook all of that and enjoy the hotel for it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beauty and comfort, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perfect! We had room service in the morning which was amazing. The presentation was incredible and the food was tastey. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rather pricey hotel, I found a great rate online the week of our plans so it was nice to get it all at a bit of a deal, but even so, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely a splurge. I would stay here again if I found a deal, but otherwise, I am not sure full price would have been worth it.

We felt as though they didn't want to be bothered by a hotel guest. The workout facility at the hotel, in short, was downright awful. A hotel of this caliber cannot have such poor equipment in such a cramped, depressing space and expect people to believe this is a luxury hotel. Imagine a guest room with the furniture removed and then replaced with broken, out dated exercise equipment. Thankfully we had a friend in town who gave us passes to the Washington Athletic Club -- which was AMAZING. We were also disappointed to discover that the W does not provide an in-room coffee pot. This seems like such a standard thing these days. Why don't they have one at this hotel? Another thing that bothered us was the lack of lighting in the hallways. We actually laughed when we tried to get into our room b/c we couldn't see the card reader on our door. There is hip, and then there is just plain stupid.

I had never been to Seattle, and decided to come a bit early to see the sights. I left my husband at home, and this was my first solo trip in quite some time. I chose the W for the location and the price, and the reputation of W hotels in general--I had never stayed at one before. Let's start with the positives. The room was excellent--great decor, comfy bed, nice flat screen TV, great quality toiletries (although i question the scent combo of lemon and sage... too cleaning-product-y for me). The darkness and loudness in the common areas took some getting used to, but it certainly makes for a cool, chic vibe in the hotel. Very different from the average Marriott or Sheraton I typically stay in. I also enjoyed the free Wi-Fi in the lobby one evening with a great apple martini. Oh, and the location was excellent. Very quick and FLAT walks to the \"main attractions.\" And now, the negatives. As a married woman traveling alone, it took me a little while to be at ease with being on my own, especially dining solo and such. I went to the concierge desk on the first evening, having just arrived in Seattle an hour or so ago, and was hoping for a little encouragement and some great recommendations from them. Uh, no. Granted, partially my fault for wanting to be babied, but this desire came from previous experiences with concierges in other cities--usually they're excited to tell you where to go, what to do, and to introduce you to their city. Not so much with this guy. He acted totally put off and aloof and I felt like I wasn't cool enough or something. The next day, I tried again with a different concierge. He was more helpful, but definitely not at the level I'm used to. I was inquiring about the ferry to Bainbridge Island, and he told me all about it but didn't bother to provide a schedule. When I asked specifically where I could get a schedule, he said, \"Oh, I have one right here.\" Um, wouldn't it seem the natural thing to do to hand that to me when you're telling me how to get there and how often it leaves?? While the concierge service is really my only complaint about the W Seattle, it was poor enough for me to knock the rating down to a 3 because, to me, if you're going to present yourself as a luxury hotel, you need luxury service to earn an above average rating.

He relied that all the restaurants in the vicinity were serving dinner and that \"in my 6 years here, I have never had anyone ask for breakfast at this hour.\" He eventually called the kitchen to see if they could prepare breakfast at that hour.

For instance, I requested the conierge make an arrangement with a taxi for the end of our dinner. We were headed to the space needle afterwards.

You should probably try calling them yourselves.\" We had already called, and I don't fault the guy for failing (although, having bus schedules on hand seems like a prudent alternative), but of course I want him to call!

I had already called the places, and all said they were slow for the Fourth and thus had plenty of room. Bear in mind that I had never even been to Seattle before that weekend. In fact, at the time of the conversation, I had barely been there 24 hours. I also have to mention that I did all of this research through my mobile phone because the W Seattle does not provide free WiFi.

I am not going to go into details, but I can honestly state that I have never been so upset that I demanded to leave a hotel early. I don't even have a replacement hotel, but I am very happy to leave this place. The room was OK, the location great... but the SERVICE.... I think the staff here are still waiting for the training from corporate. I am still upset that they could not do anything right. Especially since we were paying full rates to stay here over the 4th.

As does general noise from the street as traffic gets going. +Excellent decor and fantastic Bliss branded products. Loads and loads of towels. -Room was worn (scuffed, chipped paint), bathtub/shower was only so-so, pillows were uncomfortable and cheesy plastic cups in bathroom. +Allows dogs -$25 a night fee, and nothing extraordinary in return; same dog amenities as the Seattle Sheraton or Westin. The Bar +Great happy hour specials -TERRIBLE service on one occasion (forgotten food orders, difficulty in getting her attention. . .) +Fun Environment on the weekend -Limited seating We also overheard the host for the bar telling a couple with a small service dog that the dog was not permitted. This is in direct violation of the law and the host did not seem to care. Location Location is nice being near some shopping areas, and it's an easy walk to Pike's Place Market, but again, the road in front of the hotel is VERY VERY busy. You really have to hike to find nice outdoor dining, and you are aways away from what I consider the central area (Nordstrom, et. al). Dog owners, the Library is one block up and has plenty of grass, so it's a great place for doggy bathroom breaks. Overall: If I got a screaming deal on this hotel, as I did this time, I would stay again. But the location is not where I prefer to be and the street noise is out of control for weekday stays. I would request a higher floor to see if the steet noise was any less up higher.

Loved the cool vibe of the hotel once you come through the doors, from the lighting to the decor, very hip and sexy - just makes you feel more stylin' to be there. Yes the lighting in the halls was dark, but i must say i loved it even though i got turned around almost every time i stepped off the elevator - oh well i was on vacation. That was another plus, hip elevator music - refreshing. Lot's of activity in the Lobby at night, DJ spinning..etc very cool. Staff all young, so much so i wasn't sure i could count on getting my wakeup call, but it came right on time. Room service was fine, cereal not covered up with anything which i found odd - for sanitary reasons it should have been. a few minor glitches with service, but always attended to promptly so no complaints.

This was after we paid in full, at the time of booking, and we were told to let them know if there was anything they could do to make our stay better, to let them know. I parked in the hotel parking lot for $35.00! What a rip-off! 2 people actually tried to open our door! And they were sucessful! The few things we needed were not dealt with, and when my husband brought a bag to the front desk before our dinner reservation , he was told they would send it to our room. We made it back to find a huge crowd, listening to some techno beat music in the bar. The bartender was a rude young kid, and thought he was Tom Cruise in \" Cocktail\". When we made up to our room, the bag was no where in site! I went down to the front desk, where I was basically told, that we made it up . The bag was no where to be found , with brand new clothes from Macys in it. I waited until morning to talk to the manager, who was at least friendly, and after awhile, he found the missing bag!! Wow, imagine that! You would assume that everyone employed by a 5 star hotel, would have to meet the requirement of overly friendly , but not here. I had better service and a nicer hotel, just a few streets away at the Warwick! The room was dusty, and don't even think about drinking the water. I know its cool to be classy, but even with my status , I refuse to pay $8.00 for a bottle of water that should be in my room for free.

I am a SPG Plat member and \"W The Card holder. Lately when in Seattle on business I have been staying at the HYATT downtown, but because of a convention at that property I was back at my old stomping grounds THE W. Once a flagship of THE W chain, she is showing a little bit of wear and tear here and there. The Staff was great as expected except the concierge, who was was a bit too impressed with himself. The hallways/elevators are very dimly lit, with a sexy ambiance, this hotel is for the movers and shakers, the style makers, or people who think they have style! I personally love it. Once inside the rooms you have the wonderful signature W Beds which are quite simply amazing. One of the most comfortable beds you will experience. Mod decor abounds in the rooms with great flat screen TVs and a well appointed bathroom. All of the Bathroom products are provided by BLISS Spa's and you will want to take home the face wash and body lotion, they are that good! My only complaint (and to some this may be a plus) is that it is difficult to get the rooms dark. When I am in Seattle I work late and sleep in, I am usually upgraded to a Corner King room which has amazing views but is difficult to darken, especially when I want to sleep in. The blinds are a so-so at best shutters that just don't block sunlight (reason why I have been over at The Hyatt lately instead). The restaurant /room service is amazing and the bar is great. Last year Quentin Tarantino was at the bar with a lady friend having a drink on a Thursday night! (I don't spot too many celebrities in my hotel travels) No coffee makers in the rooms (urghh pet peeve!) I like to make a cup of coffee without having to go downstairs for the free coffee or order a $16 small pot from room service. Overall though it is a wonderful property with a great location and good staff, on the trendy, high-end side of things so if you are stuffy and grumpy or like to get to bed very early, try the Fairmont next door (which has the best Oysters and Salmon in Seattle at the restaurant \"Shucker's\" on their ground floor.)

For the first time traveler, it's bewildering. Once you realize the \"Welcome Desk\" is up the grand flight of stairs to your left, the staff is professional and helpful, and they have your keys at the ready. The elevator is smooth and fast, taking you up the two dozen floors without effort. The hallways are shockingly dim in comparison to most hotels, but not enough to impede vision, and I believe it helps with keeping the noise down at night. The room is expertly designed New York anal-retentive, and I mean that in the best possible way. Absolutely nothing is out of place, from the tub mat to the pillows on the bed. There are no visible drawers, those are in the closet, along with real hangers and a second bathrobe. The hotel information binder has been replaced by a stack of cards bound on a large brad, which keeps the size down. There's no phone book, because that would require a drawer, though there is a flat panel television with high-definition content. The finishings are not exactly luxurious in the traditional sense but they are attractive, and everything in the room matches just so. The bed, sheets, and towels are all top quality. You would not be at all ashamed to have this as your guest room, even if you lived in a much nicer house than I do. The prices are high. $36 to park, $15 for Internet in the room, $20+3.50 for delivery and a 22% service fee for an omelette can quickly turn a W stay into an extremely expensive proposition. Thankfully the staff recommended the excellent pastry shop across the street where there were Parisian-quality croissants and good coffee. The location is right in the center of downtown, though the proximity to the convention center means there are not many of the smaller restaurants that one might find in another city. In summary, the W is a beautiful, expensive hotel with great service that is perhaps not the most practical, especially if you've got a family with you.

Hotel management did not respond to numerous complaints saying that was the normal \"lavender musk\" smell of the W. Right... I just made sure the air never came on when I was in the room.

However, this W is just average. POSITIVES: 1. Location. Its right in the heart of downtown. 2. The bed. This is a given in a W which, I believe, all use the \"Hevenly Bed.\" I love this bed, it is pillowed topped and has nice linens and a huge (and heavy) down comforter. It is so confortable. I was so impressed with this bed the first time I stayed at a W in 2002 that I actually bought one. So its nice to have the same bed in the hotel that I enjoy every night at home. NEUTRALS: 1. The room. It was nicely appointed and had a nice window seat with lots of funky pillows.

Its tiny as compared to many Ws I've stayed in and the bar, while nice is TINY and often too crowded to even get a seat. One thing I've always enjoyed about Ws is the club-like feel of their lobbies and the cool bar scene. This W has neither. 2. The elevator and hallways. They are extremely dark!! It is bizzare how dark they are. Maybe its to hide the fact that this hotel is an older hotel that's been renovated to become a W and so they darker down the hallways so that you can't see the age of it.

This is not a happening part of town in the evening. It has business district shutdown. Either stick to the lobby area or venture out into the farther neighborhoods. Walking down the dark halls to the blue-lit room numbers, I did feel like I was in \"Barton Fink\" or another Coen Bros. movie. Definitely a hotel for the post-hipster or the proto-wannabe.

I will start with the positives: The concierge was fabulous, my husband needed a haircut and they recommended Rudy's Barber Shop which did a great job at a very reasonable $10! The rooms were spacious and the beds wonderfully comfortable. The nightime lobby bar was not as 'happening' as in some other cities, however, it was comfortably crowded with beautiful people for a Saturday night and the drinks came quickly and were well-mixed. Some negatives: They charged a friend of ours for a full day of parking when he was only there two hours - we mentioned it to the front desk staff and they promptly corrected this on our bill. Also, we stopped by the front desk at about midnight and asked for a wake-up call for the next morning as we had an international flight to catch, but the call never came, and our 'backup' alarm never went off - so we missed our flight. We were fortunate enough to get on another flight at a minor cost which delayed us approximately half a day. I wrote a letter to the Starwood Customer service center and copied the general manager of the W Seattle. Within 3 days I received a letter from the G.M. stating that they would refund our one night stay in full due to their error.

Depending on your personal point of view, you may find this refreshing, surprising, and wonder why there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t more people doing this sort of thing. Or, you may feel that these are just trashy gimmicks directed at the hi-tech minded and geeky. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different? First thing is that instead of the gushing and verbose service that many concierges and reception staff employ, this luxury hotel employs people who give the impression that everything is no big deal, easily accomplished and in fact hardly worth a mention. In fact, they are often smiling but very direct and to the point in the delivery of their message. Some could mistake this for coolness and disinterest. Throughout the hotel alternative language abounds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Concierge desk is titled: Whatever, Whenever. The sign for your door to ensure privacy says: Not Quite Yet! The second thing is d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The reception area is minimalist meets gothic, with a touch of modern art, all dimly lit. At night the lights are even lower and the fireplace surrounded by candles is a centrepiece. Low coloured lights in corridors and hallways combined with vibrant carpets extend the effect of being in some kind of club. Music is the third thing: ambient techno and jazz will accompany you everywhere except in your room. It all combines with the d\u00c3\u00a9cor and the attitude to impress upon you that you are part of a hip and cool experience. Rooms are also minimalist, although spacious. Our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cool Corner Room was exactly that, affording a great view of the city on from two aspects at fifteen floors elevation. Everything works, and works well in this hotel, especially technology. Your Flat Screen TV, DVD, Internet are all there, and the lobby if full of laptop users, also enjoying a cocktail. These are the sort of people that feel that a computer is an integral part of life, not just a machine with which you work. On Saturdays the reception and bar area becomes a disco \u00e2\u20ac\u201c still in the techno theme, and is obviously a cool Saturday evening rendezvous for locals and visitors alike. But, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this hotel is exclusively for the young; its more that its designed to make you feel young, whatever your age. We say everyone from 18 to 80 in evidence, and most seemed to be enjoying the experience. We noted several Brides in their gowns arriving after their happy day, en route to a memorable night. So, if you are the sort that might like your hotel experience to be something new and different try a W \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Seattle W is a great one to try, both for quality and location. If you prefer leather sofas, marble floors and tradition, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wonderful Fairmont around the corner, but why not give the W a try just one time?

If coming from the airport Greyline does an airporter service, get it to the Fairmont and it leaves you across the road from the W $10.25 single, $17 return. The W has low lighting with candles and so gives the impression of a nightclub 24/7. This takes a little getting used to, you have to be pretty much standing at your room door before you can see the number. The lobby also has funky music all day, chill out in the morning and more upbeat in the evening. I liked it but I can see how some older people may not. The living room lobby is comfy but it is constantly used during the day by business people having meetings and working All staff were really friendly and helpful although when I did use the concierge I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that impressed. I asked him for information about Mt St Helens \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest tourist attraction in the state of Washington- and he could barely produce driving directions.

The flat screen TV is above the desk which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like as if one person is working at the desk and the other is watching TV it can prove very distracting. Also the W doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to provide too much for the business user. There is no Wi-Fi in the rooms and internet is $14.95 per day. The business centre also closes early and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open on a Sunday. The bathroom is spacious and very well lit for applying make up, the toiletries are provided by bliss and are really nice. Like all expensive hotels are you are charged for everything you use, the bottle of water in the room is $10 and of course there is a mini bar. Room service is available but a chicken sandwich is $18 and pancakes are $15, then there is a 2% added on, $3.50 delivery charge as well as the regular tax, so it can prove really expensive There is a gym present but it is nothing fancy, just a room with a few cardio machines and loose weights but is functional. The restaurant is nice and the waiting staff are fantastic. Food is very good. I recommend the steak frites. The restaurant is closed on a Sunday though.

My wife had expressed an interest in staying at the W so I booked a stay there as part of a Mother's Day weekend celebration. Shortly after booking the room through the Starwood website, I received an email offer to upgrade to a \"Spectacular\" room for $30, which I accepted. I also requested to have a special music CD playing when we entered our room. Via email I was connected with Adam Sinding who was my \"Insider\" for this request. I arranged to drop off the CD the day before our arrival. Adam was not there when I arrived for the drop-off and I was referred to the young concierge. She struck me immediately as affected and pretentious. I believe she had been trained that \"putting on airs\" somehow enhances the status of an establishment. I just find it off-putting. Be prepared for awkwardness on arrival at the W. The drive-up entrance is extremely poorly laid out. You basically are in the street when you pull up and configuration of car/pedestrian access to the check-in area is convoluted and congested. To simplify our arrival we just parked in the adjacent (to the east) Olympic Hotel parking garage and walked the 100 feet or so to the entry. Check-in went very nicely with the staff at the desk very friendly and helpful. (A quick note about staff, they seem to be uniformly amazingly young. This means that you should not expect a great breadth of experience in the hospitality industry.) Guests observed in the lobby area seemed mostly the t-shirt, grungy blue jean, running shoe crowd. This seemed a bit odd giving that the W is not really a cheap place to stay. One of the most striking aspects of the Seattle W is its decor and darkness. Lighting in the halls, elevators and other public spaces without windows is incredibly low and techno. For instance, one needs to be quite close (within a foot or two) of a room door to discern the room number. My wife called the decor \"urban zen\" and I think this is probably as good as any moniker. Our room was extremely nice and spacious. And yes, the CD was playing at an appropriate volume when we walked in. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room had very large windows with peek-a-boo views of Puget Sound. A full size chaise was along one wall next to a very nicely equipped desk. The bath was large and had more towels than anyone could use. The faucet handle on the tub/shower was close to breaking so controlling water temperature and pressure was quite difficult. When our car and driver arrived to take us to our evening activities we again were reminded of the extremely poor layout of access to the hotel. The combination of arriving and departing guests, aggressive taxi drivers whipping about and traffic wizzing by make entering and exiting more than an adventure. The Earth and Ocean Restaurant on-site again is very much on the trendy side. We found the staff extremely warm, friendly and professional. The menu selection could only be characterized as super-trendy. Fortunately, the W is in the heart of downtown so there are dozens of super dining options for those not in an adventurous culinary mood. One minor annoyance is that I still don't have a breakdown of what this little adventure cost. Apparently, the W billing system is not capable of providing an up-to-date itemization of charges upon check-out.", "Date": "May 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kennewick, Washington", "Title": "\u201cHip Hotel Fails to Please\u201d", "Author": "juliebug52", "ReviewID": "UR7432190", "Content": "Ok I am a Starwood member and have wanted to stay at the W.

There is a time and place for these things and the morning did not feel like that time. Another strange thing that happened during our stay is that 20-30 young people were staying at the hotel (in their teens) and all the hallways reeked of pot.

There were some really nice features of the hotel, like the cozy lobby with big fireplace, free hot chocolate, a tiny gym, and a great bar. This hotel is also well-located, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square, and literally next door to shopping. Service was friendly and helpful. My only complaint was the exorbitantly high cost of extras--including the internet, valet parking, and food. There was free Wi-Fi in the lobby, but this is less than ideal for business travellers.

This was also my first time staying at a W Hotel. After reading reviews on this hotel, I was skeptical as to whether or not the service and ambience of this hotel would render a pleasant stay or not. My skepticisms, however, were put to rest shortly after arrival at the W. I booked a 'Wonderful Room' (i.e. basic room) at the W for 2 nights in mid-February '07. Here's an overview of my stay: Pro's: -Service: Speedy & Friendly. Staff aimed to please. Upon check-in, I received a complimentary room upgrade! I was even given a complimentary toothbrush/tube of toothpaste when I informed the front desk that I had forgotten mine at home. -Ambience: Everything at this hotel is modern and very cool. There was a DJ playing in the lobby Saturday night! -Rooms: Functional and Beautiful. Comfy beds and nice sized LCD TV. Housekeeping also supplied new toiletries/towels etc. each morning! -Location: No need for a car or anything! Everything in downtown Seattle worth doing is in walking distance. Con's: -Pricing: The room is worth the price if you have a view or get some sort of discount. Room service and amenities, however, like most hotels of this calibre, are outrageously overpriced. -Bathroom: Cool sink! Great toiletries! But the tub is very average and drab. -Hallways: Woulden't hurt if they were brighter. -Restaurant Servers: 50/50. Staff are attentive and efficient, but not always warm and inviting.

This was a hit and miss affair as sometimes it would be perfect and other times the service would let it down.

Drinks were steep as were food prices for dinner etc. We used the wireless internet access (which is free on floors 1 > 3) and it was quick and easy. The hotel was overpriced for water and the mini bar. You even had a menu in your room to purchase bits like bath robes, towels etc, all which were stupidly expensive.

The downtown area is brimming with fabulous restaurants, cafes and other nightlife. Every member of staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The concierge was very knowledgable and was always kept busy. The hotel had lots of sitting areas. So, rather than being restricted to your room if you wanted to surf on your laptop or do some work, you could be part of the action and enjoy the fireplace and couches in the lobby or couches in the quieter section on the second floor. They played the best music all the time - like dance/house. Loved it! They had W candles burning all over, emanating a wonderful aroma/atmosphere. There was free Starbucks coffee in the bar area in the mornings. This little tidbit alas, we did not discover until the day we were leaving. The info was on a small card in the room but we missed it. There is a full service Starbucks right across the street. Being Seattle, there is a coffee shop on EVERY corner it seemed. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant the first morning. The decor was impressive but the service and food was lacking - especially for the price. This was our only disappointment. We would recommend that you grab your free Starbucks, walk a couple of blocks towards Pikes Place and enjoy breakfast in one of Seattle's great cafes. The Crumpet Shop for one is well worth a visit. The hotel bar was well stocked and the atmosphere pleasant in the evenings when it seemed to attract the high-flyers of the city. The location cannot be beat.

As I was there on business I can't comment too much on the overall hotel itself as I left at 7.30am without breakfast and got back after dinner each night after 10pm to go straight to bed! However, I can understand why people might think that the hotel is stingy with extras as the bottle of still water that is normally provided free of charge in hotels like the Hilton was $8.00 (albeit the bottle was large)! The price marked on it was so tiny that I didn't notice it until I had opened it after waking up in the night with a thirst. The reception of the hotel was very trendily decorated and was very dark. I loved the little touches like the door mat at the front of the hotel saying 'Good Evening' 'Good Afternoon' and 'Good morning' depending on the time of day. The valet staff were great too - they literally ran into the road each morning to flag down a taxi for me. My colleague stayed at the Hilton around the corner and was very envious when he dropped by the hotel to see me one day - considering he had paid a much higher price for his room, he would much rather have stayed at the W. Finally, I was quite surprised to walk in on my last evening (Thursday) and find a DJ playing music and lots of people who were not guests sitting in the lobby bar drinking and dancing - the hotel felt like it had suddenly turned into a nightclub and was packed out. I certainly couldn't have sat there and had a quiet drink, so went straight to my room. I think it's a 'novel' idea but not really what I want or expect from a hotel........

On our 2nd phone call which was 45 minutes after we requested the blanket, the assistant manager with whom we spoke said that she would follow up on the blanket and call us right back. She did not. In the middle of the night our message light started blinking (although we were not on the phone and did not receive any phone calls). In the morning my husband called to retrieve the message, and was told that we did not have one. The message light continued to blink. Later, at about 9am, I called to try to retrieve the message, but after 30 rings with no answer, I gave up. I called the manager on duty to express my dissatisfaction with the service. He was apologetic, but did not offer to compensate us in any way, for example by waiving the $31 parking fee. Since our return home, we received an automatic email asking for our comments on our stay. I replied with the information herein. I have received no response from either this hotel or the W chain.

In the mood for an in-town get-away, I decided to surprise the Sig Other with a surprise night in a W Hotel suite. Upon checking room availability online, I saw no suites were available, so I called the hotel and learned that all their suites were being renovated. Fair enough, so i decided to reserve a corner room on a high floor. I arrived at the hotel 30 minutes after check-in time to process the check-in and get my room keys so that later I could return with the SO and go right to the room. Upon arrival, I was met with huge lines at the check-in desk...it took me 20 minutes to get to the front desk. Now that it was nearly 4:00pm, and having waited in the very slow line, I was stunned to learn my room was not yet ready. I had to be home within an hour to meet my SO and still had to secretly pack a bag with extra toothbrushes, PJs, etc. I was told they would work as hard as they could to get me a room quickly. In the meantime, I decided to arrange for a bottle of Champagne to be in my room upon arrival. I was ushered to the Conceirge, who basically could not have been less interested. When I asked her if she was certain they could have the bottle on ice in the room at 5:30pm, she looked at me as if I were from outer space. I should have known this was only a hint of things to come... Well, I was driving home to frantically pack, and then drive back to do the room key, then drive home to meet my SO -- yeah, I really like him so I go to this kind of trouble LOL -- when the guy at the desk called and said the room was ready. So I threw a few things in a bag and drove back downtown to get the key. Surprise! Another epic line. And people were yelling at the desk clerks and general mayhem was ensuing. Apparently, there was only ONE single bellhop for the entire hotel on a busy Saturday. Genius. Well, while waiting in line I told several people about tripadvisor.com so hopefully they will post here, too. I got to the desk, got my keys, and was running back out the door and said, \"You won't forget the Champagne, right?\" And they all smiled and said it was all set. One hour later, I arrived and told the SO that some friends had invited us up to their room for a pre-dinner drink. I entered room 2120 to find...no Champagne. I called downstairs in a wee bit of a rage and was told \"We knocked on the door but no one answered so we didn't want to come in and disturb anyone.\" I replied that no one had answered the door, because I wasn't in the room and since there was no Do Not Disturb sign on the door and since I had requested the bottle be waiting for my arrival, I was dismayed, mystified and peeved that they had blown the one most important element of the surprise overnight. Completely unacceptable at any price, but at $300+ it was ridiculous! They said they would have the bottle right up there and I said they were welcome to send it up if they would give me a break on the price, otherwise, forget it. She said she would do what she could. Which was, in a word, nothing. The bottle was delivered with a full price bill. I was insulted. I told the man that I was refusing the bottle and to take it back (it was unopened). He mumbled something and left the room without removing the bottle! I had to call down and ask for the bottle to be collected which it was. We ended up drinking the half-bottle from the mini-bar. After taking showers, we discovered there was only one bathrobe. I called down for one, and it was delivered quickly (albeit on a wire hanger...all the hangers in the closet were wood, so this looked tacky.) The room is nice, in fine shape, and the view was spectacular. I can say that much. At check-out the next day, the clerk was very apologetic and comped the half-bottle of Champagne when I told her of how completely unpleasant the experience had been. The W is very much form over function. I guess Seattle still doesn't have an interesting, cutting edge, non-dowdy, non-business-drone hotel. I would never return to the W and plan to share this opinion with my friends and fellow frequent business travelers.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cDid Dieter stay here?\u201d", "Author": "tcwan001", "ReviewID": "UR5498476", "Content": "Remember SNL's Dieter (Mike Myers)?

We did notice that the W Seattle has slipped slightly. A little tired. Perhaps a management change? Perhaps it was the weekend? Not exactly sure - but they certainly were not quite on their \"game\" for our visit. Maybe they are doing better catering to the business crowd during the week. Still four stars, but missed in several areas. My complaints -- Front desk staff - indifferent at best. Gave us a low floor, dark room with parking lot view. When we asked to change, they indicated they were only 63% full, so changing was not a problem. Hmmm...why didn't they give us a decent room to begin with? Rooms - why can't the W provide wireless connection (at no charge) in the guest rooms? We love the technical ammenities the W offers, and my husband had free wireless connection in the W's meeting rooms. But the guest rooms only have wireless for a fee ($17 or so/day). The $8 bottle of water so high priced. Nice that it was bedside, but really $8 for water? Concierge- openly complained about another guest in front of me. Tacky. We scheduled a couple things with the front desk/concierge, not sure who made the mistake, but after several calls to confirm, we learned that our appointment was scheduled on the wrong date (a date we weren't even in the hotel!)

No response. Called again to talk to the technical folks. No luck. Asked again at check-out. Blank stare. My raves - The car valets (\"wheels\") are awesome! Grabbed a jacket for us. Always pleasant.

However, when we went down to the lobby in the evening, we were surprised how much the hotel/resturaunt transformed into a posh party place. I thought we would fit in but not so. I am in my mid forty's and felt out of place. This hotel is great for the younger croud but I would feel more comfortable at the Fairmont across the street. We ate at the resturaunt for breakfast and was surprised at the prices. However, after visiting a couple other hotels in the area, we found the prices were only a little higher than average. I was very surprissed at this as we travel to Hawaii often, where prices are very high, but these were even higher! When we checked out, I was surprised to see we were charged a $60 early check in fee. I didn't mind paying the rate but was upset, as I was never told we would be charged for this service. To sum it up, the hotel is very nice and trendy for the 20's and 30's couples. The service as advertised leaves a bit to be desired but overall a good stay.

Sure the halls may be a little dark and beetlejuice-esque, but this all adds to making the place different and special.

First, I can't believe how low of a rating this hotel has received from reviewers on this site. I honestly think what may be happening is that this hotel is a little to hip for certain travelers. The W hotel is very nice. The staff is very professional and responsive to requests. At times I've even seen them walking the dogs of hotel guests. The bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. It has very high thread count sheets, a goose down comforter, a feather bed, and goose down pillows. Well I don't know how, but someone on this site managed to complain about that! The decor is definitely trendy. At all times there is house music playing in the lobby and bar area so if you like that genre then you will be right at home. During the evening they have candles burning and the bar area comes alive with people from all over Seattle. This is why you might want to stay there. To be honest, if I was staying at the Hilton I would probably go to the W just to hang out and mingle. It is definitely a cool spot to meet people. I'd say the age range is early thirties to late forties. For the guy complaining about the hotel charging for internet access, most hotels do charge a fee for that service. But if you are truly frugal, and it sounds like you are, then you should have used the FREE internet access in the lobby and bar area. That's what I did because I didn't want to pay either. The food at the hotel is a little expensive. An omelet delivered was $25 including service charges. Oatmeal costs about $13 delivered. Both were very good but I just couldn't justify the price, especially when there are so many restaurants nearby. To be sure, if you are more of a conservative person I would recommend you stay at the Hilton or Hyatt. Those hotels are more traditional. I'm actually a Hilton honors diamond member but after staying at the W, I will remain there for the rest of the month while I'm in Seattle. If you do decide to stay at the W, make sure you check out the great restaurant nearby called Jasmine. The food there is excellent and they also have a very nice vibe in their bar area.

Minuses - It is decidedly hip - almost painfully so. The music in the lobby along with a busy check in made is almost hard to hear the desk staff. The dark hallways were cool at first, but when I walked past the ice machine room twice because I couldn't see the sign, I felt like a fool. However, the pluses are much greater.... We booked on-line about 4-weeks prior to the stay and got an on-line pre-pay special and got a rate that was close to or lower than many other big-chain hotels. We wanted to check out the hype about the W so booked here. What we got was a room similar to those we have paid much more for in places like Chicago Service is top-notch from the valet to the baggage staff - everyone worked hard to live up to their \"whatever/whenever\" promise. The Concierge helped us explore the city in our short stay with lots of suggestions for dining and shopping and a suggested walking tour. The W is located very centrally in the city - walking distance to Pikes Market and the Piers. The room was a corner room with a long entrance hallway that led to a huge (the booking said 430 sq. ft.) corner room that was beautifully appointed. We didn't hear a sound from any other room or the hall but did get a bit of street noise on the 6th floor. A wonderful king-size pillow-top mattress with soft, silky linens piled with 6(!) down pillows (no calls for extra pillows here!) A large work desk similar to a photo in an earlier review. The carpet was a super-soft dark chocolate brown. The honor-bar was stocked with the usual items along with the more unusual like a small travel umbrella (great idea for Seattle), computer cords, postcards and a CD - all at very reasonable prices for an honor bar. The room had a great corner view with lots of natural light, a small stereo with a great mix CD and a listing of local radio stations. We stayed as late as possible lounging in the plush robes, taking long showers using the Bliss products (face wash, too!) and snuggling in the comfy bed before check-out at noon. I would do the W in Seattle or any other city again if I got such a great rate. This is a great concept for a chain and the price was great. Next time maybe we'll go to one within driving distance so we can take our dog because I understand the pet service is outstanding.", "Date": "August 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Magnolia, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel bed ever!\u201d", "Author": "nrh", "ReviewID": "UR3722708", "Content": "We had two nights at the W before embarking on an Alaskan cruise.

I'm still using the Bliss products they had in the bathroom and plan to order more (a rare find for hotel soap!). I've read a lot of reviews where people complain about the lighting. It is a little dark in the hallways, but we didn't find it to be scary or incapacitating in any way. My recommendation to the W would be to consider backlighting the room numbers somehow....neon maybe?... to keep with the \"cool\" theme and make it easier to find your doorway.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my favorite place to stay in Seattle. I like the Sheraton, have a bit of love-hate with the Westin, but the W is my first choice. Upgrades: There are only about 8 suites here, half of which are smoking and one of which is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaccessible\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 so there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot of suite upgrade opportunities. But a Kool Korner room on a high floor has never been a problem. When I stayed in May 2005 there was a large conference booked over several days staying at the hotel, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d wrapped up a bunch of the small number of suites that the hotel had. Plus Snoop Dogg was staying there. So I was in a Kool Korner room. I did notice a few areas of the room where form overtakes function. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough drawers. 1/3 of the chest is taken up by the safe and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only about half the size of the usual hotel chest. (Regular rooms seem to have more chest space, oddly enough.) Our first night at the hotel we had dinner at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant, Earth & Ocean. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much improved over two years ago. The chef is very creative with presentation and they offer very high quality meat and fish. The sweetbreads were a nice size with no sinew whatsoever. Despite the food, though, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great restaurant, at least it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on this occasion. Service lacked. Several times they dropped silverware by the table. I cringed when someone in the party asked for a Miller Lite and the waiter said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think so. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll check.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a roll of the eyes. He never returned to the subject (such as to followup and apologize for not having the first choice, and perhaps offer a suggested alternative). Ordered room service breakfast around 6:30, it arrived in 14 minutes. I had an excellent avocado, bacon, and cheese omellette. Truly delicious. The food at the W, from the restaurant to room service to banquet, is good across the board. For folks who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been there, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a typical W: lighting is dark, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 music plays in the lobby. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a funky \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliving room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the lobby to relax in. The bar scene is trendy. Rooms are comfortable. The hotel aspires to be high-end in service, touting its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWherever/Whenever\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd line (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll handle any need you have) but this is no Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton. Hotel employees are mostly attractive twenty-somethings dressed in black, and not as well-trained in service as are staff at the high-end chains. If you want refined service, stay across the street at the Fairmont. The W is funky, fun, and for me comfortable. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sometimes surprisingly inexpensive. TravelZoo sometimes promotes great deals, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it for as little as $139 there. It occasionally participates in Starwood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash & points award program, which this year means 4000 Starwood points and $60 for a night. But without deals it can run $230 or more, even $289.

One's pupils need not dilate in the W reception area....dark, dark, dark. At 2:00 p.m., all you see are candles and the reflection of the computer screens off the faces of the staff. Hmmm, interesting, I thought. Friendly folks - great \"welcome\" by the guys at the door, and in no time we were up to our room.

Room - they call it \"spectacular\" but I might call it peculiar. Not very large by any stretch, a cool sofa in the window, some IKEA-looking furniture and there you have it. Did we feel a warmth from the room? No. Was the bed \"heavenly?\" Not if you compare it to the Westin down the road... Overall, the W is a cool place. Yuppies will love it.

The W is a new hotel & that's why I chose it. The surrounding hotels are very old. I didn't eat here but the lounge and restaurant looked \"cool\". One BIG issue that I had was the valet parking. When you park, you're not allowed to self-park. Upon receiving my car when I was checking out, there was a large scratch. Ok, I filled out the claim form but I was visibly upset. The valet people kept telling me it would be ok, they'll take responsibility, and for me to \"go home\" and wait for their call.

The only glitch that I can speak of occurred on our first night. We hung out in the bar and ordered an appetizer to snack on. Something in the kitchen got screwed up and our order (which was pretty simple) ended up taking over 30 mins to get to us. The bar staff was really apologetic about it.

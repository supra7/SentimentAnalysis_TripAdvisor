The room was clean and internet was solid . However staff in this hotel seem have no sense of service. I took a shower before going to bed in the night. There was only 1/4 water came from shower and the rest kept flowing through the tap. Thinking that I only spent overnight and it was late, I finished my shower with a kind of high temperature due to less water came out. Then I heard the alarm in my room ringing loudly. I asked help from receptionist and she said it was because of too much vapor that the smoke alarm detected. The hotel engineer came to fix it. I asked why only my alarm rang but not others , the female superivsor with long hair said probably only I used such high water temperature for shower. Seemed that I brought her a lot of trouble. If the shower system works well, will the alarm ring? By the way, breakfast in this hotel was horrible and no staff replenish if no guest asked. Will stay away from this E. 21 st.

We had the king suite (rm 201) reserved. When we got there about 1/2 hour before check-in, the room wasn't ready, so we ate at Red Lobster. I have to tell you, as I told the front desk person, I almost bolted on the reservation right then! The building is run-down looking, and I just got a bad vibe. That being said, because of the state fair, a triathalon, and this huge multi-state swim meet, rooms were in short supply in the city, so we checked in. Our suite was very nice, no smells, clean, spacious and well laid out. It is conveniently located to restaurants and a shopping mall (Washington Square). You also have access to the amenities at the Marriott next door, which has a nice pool area and patio. The breakfast was good, too.

Walls are paper thin. Entire place smells like cigarette smoke, even the \"non-smoking\" rooms. We had to check out after one day because the smoke smell made my husband's asthma act up. Then to top it off, they charged us for the 2nd day, even though we checked out before noon which we were told by the front desk staff we wouldn't be charged because we had checked out before noon.

Desk attendant apologized and promptly changed rooms for me. So thanks, lady! The hallways smelled of smoke. The second room I got was fine. No problems.

The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the staff very friendly. The location is out of the way for downtown Indianapolis, but it is also cheaper than hotels downtown. There is construction being done to one of the interstate access routes to the hotel (I-70), so getting to and from there could get a little bit complicated initially. But the hotel has useful leaflets explaining alternative routes, and these made travelling much easier. The pool was murky, and the external grounds looked like it needed a pick-me-up. The Marriott next door is building some new facilities, and the construction work added to the dodgy look of the surrounding area. However, a note from La Quinta said that once the Marriott facility is up and running, La Quinta guests would be able to access and use it, so things could look rather different in a years' time. The breakfast was so-so, but there is an inexpensive restaurant on the grounds of the hotel. It serves all day breakfasts, in addition to a dinner menu. The food is not bad, so we found ourselves eating there quite a bit. Overall, we didn't have problems with the hotel and had a comfortable stay.

Honestly speaking this hotel needs to start up fresh again!!! air out the rooms, rip the carpets and replace them, and do a hotel makeover. I am not a smoker and hate the smell of such, however, this time I had to either put up with it or sleep in my car!! so I chose option 1, now.. If I can help it... I would not, would not, stay in this hotel again, I did because of the circumstances.

Since I had no dinner on the plane, I asked about nearby restaurants. Restaurant in hotel was closed. The nearest was Wendy's - 10 mins in the pouring rain. I was grateful when the front desk clerk gave me a menu of a local take-away and told me to call him and he would order for me; thus, I would avoid the 85 cent local phone call charge. No mention on the menu of delivery charges. I order a $6.70 sandwich. When delivered, I had to go to the front lobby to pick it up and pay $12. Went through hallways that reeked of smoke to my room which, although officially non-smoking, still had a lingering smell of smoke. Rather cheap decor. I put my laptop on the desk only to find that the nearest plug-in was half-way across the room. I went to the bathroom - found a small bottle of shampoo (no conditioner or lotion) available. The next morning, I checked out - included among the charges was a $2 per night, plus tax, room safe charge - which I never used.

There was no breakfast - which for the price we paid, I thought there surely must be a donut or something - and no coffee. The only benefit was the free shuttle to and from the airport. This hotel is next to a salsa bar/nightclub, which had some scantily-clad women entering at the time we were checking in, certainly not something I would want my young children to be around or see.

I booked this hotel for several reasons. The first being that it offered free shuttles from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the Port of Miami. It was also close to the airport, and due to the time of our arriving flight, we would not have far to travel. We knew this hotel was not supposed to be fancy, but figured it could be a place for us to sleep the night before out cruise. Therefore, at $130, we thought the shuttles alone would make up for the slightly high price. Our flight was scheduled to arrive in Miami at midnight and I confirmed with the hotel that their airport shuttles run until 1AM. Due to a delay departing, we did not arrive in Miami until 12:30AM. The first thing we did was call the hotel and inform them that our flight was slightly delayed and we were on our way to our luggage. They informed us that it was not a problem and to simply call back once we had our luggage in hand. By 12:45AM we had our luggage and once again called the hotel only to find out that their driver had just left to go home. We were forced to take a cab ($17 I believe) which the hotel refused to reimburse us for. Check-in went painlessly enough and before too long, we were in our room. The room was old, dark, and just simply depressing looking. However, since all we wanted to do was sleep, we really didn't care about its appearance. Unforunatelly, we were unable to sleep throughout the night undisturbed. When the night club crowd poured out after 2AM, they simply did not go home. They continued to party out in the parking lot until well after 3AM. Between the thumping music, squeeling tires, and Spanish dialog, it was difficult to continue sleeping. Only upside was my wife was nice enough to translate some of the more colorful things being said. Eventually the crowd dispersed and we were able to fall back asleep... until roughly 7AM when the hillbillies in the room across from us woke us up with all the noise they were making. They had left their door open so that their brats, who were running up and down the hall, could come in and out of the room as they pleased. Needless to say, we knew we were not getting any more sleep this morning. We decided to get up, get dressed, and grab some breakfast. We soon learned that the breakfast being served in the restaurant/night-club was a cold breakfast and no hot breakfast was available. It also didn't help that the restaurant still smelled like urine from the night before (you have to walk by the bathrooms when you enter the restaurant to get to the seating area). Front desk informed us that the closest place nearby that serves warm breakfast (that would be open) was a Wendy's about a mile away. Not too bad of a walk but there is really nothing else around the hotel. After our breakfast, we grabbed our luggage and headed down to grab the shuttle to the port. We were informed that the shuttle leaves on the hour and of the 3 time slots available, the first 2 were already full. The lobby was also completely full as 2 wedding parties appeared to be checking out at the same time. Deciding we had had enough of this hell hole, we asked the hotel to call us a cab. Thankfully one arrived within minutes and we never looked back (btw, cab fare to the port was roughly $40). Whatever your reason's are for needing a hotel, stay clear of this place! I can't think of any reason why I would ever recommend it to anyone. If the rest of the hotels are sold out for a given night, you would still be better off sleeping in the airport!", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin", "Title": "\u201cGreat Airport Hotel ... makes you wanna leave as soon as possible\u201d", "Author": "lplusk", "ReviewID": "UR58726676", "Content": "We read the reviews before, and we didn't want to stay there.

It is located at the SW end of the airport and you get to hear planes 24/7. All there is around here are warehouses and half of them are empty. The so called restaurant on premises is actually some kind of bar/disco that gets cranking late at night. It wasn't open when it said it was so I didn't check it out. I had a car and could get out to eat. Nothing close. The desk clerk when I checked in was friendly and gave me excellent directions for the places I wanted to go. However, that was the only high point of this stay. The parking lot has a chain link fence but apparently it never gets closed. You drive around back to get to the elevators. There is a key operated door, but it doesn't close properly, so it's never locked. When you enter through this door you get the distinct aroma of dirty sneakers. It's stinky & moldy. No air conditioners on in the hallways, yet it is over 90 degrees outside. The only ice machine is on the first floor, but there is nothing saying that, you have to figure it out. When I got to my room I was surprised that it was clean although dated. I was under the impression I would have a fridge & micro, but the clerk informed me I would need to \"upgrade to a suite\" for that. Forget it. There was a safe with an alarm sounding. I called the front desk, but never got an answer, so I finally went downstairs and he did tell me how to turn it off. Apparently when he is checking someone in, he doesn't answer the phone. At all. Nice touch. There were unsavory characters hanging around the parking lot all the time. I would close the door behind me (so you would need a key) but every time I used the door, it was left open again. I was concerned for my safety as a woman traveling alone, but nothing happened. Still, I was nervous just going to my vehicle to get things. The crowning blow came about 2:45 AM. I had a dry mouth and woke up. I could feel the walls vibrating. At first I thought the room next to me had a loud radio or TV. But then I went to the window, which was also vibrating. Looked outside and all I can say is \"Holy Cow!\" The parking lot and the lot of the next property were PACKED with people, there was music going, food vendors set up, I kid you not! It was unreal! Some kind of street party right outside the hotel with HUNDREDS of people milling around. There were even cops supervising (not arresting or bothering people). I have never seen anything like this in a hotel parking lot in my life. I had trouble getting back to sleep. At 3:30, they were still going strong. The next morning when I went to check out two people were at the front desk speaking Spanish to each other and couldn't care less that I was standing there. I finally got some attention, got checked out (bill was wrong, that took another 10 minutes to fix). So after all was settled, I asked the woman at the desk what the party was last night and she said \"I didn't work last night. I wouldn't have any idea.\" BS, is what I thought. So I asked the guy at the desk and he said \"probably something with the disco.\" Oh Christ, they are playing dumb and you KNOW that they know. This place sucks! To top it off, the hotel website says this location has THE CHAIRMAN'S AWARD. What a joke. I have been to other Days Inns with the Chairman's Award and they were all first rate.

My wife and I stayed here for one night on a layover to the Turks & Caicos Islands. First, I only gave it one star because it couldn't give it less than one. This was such a horrible experience, I will never stay at a Days Inn again. We chose this hotel because it was listed as being only 2.1 miles from the Miami airport... Yeah, if you drive across the runway! We also picked this hotel because it advertised a free airport shuttle. I called using the courtesy phone and the person who answered said he would send the driver over immediately. After 30 minutes of stand out in the heat and humidity, we called again. This time the driver was there in about 15 minutes. The ride took about 10 minutes, but driving distance I would say it was about 5 miles and it was near the end of the runway, so we got to listen to planes taking off all night. After checking in we walked to our room past several smoking rooms (each room had a sign smoking or non-smoking), the entire hallway wreaked of cigarettes. Our room was small and smelled really bad... like mold. The furniture looked really old and worn out. So bad that I didn't want to set any of my clothing on it. The same goes for the carpet, I wouldn't even walk around in socks, I put shoes on to go to the bathroom. Hell, I wouldn't let my dog (if I had one) do the \"butt scoot\" on this carpet! The restaurant attached to the hotel was a ghost town, and looked like they offered over priced burgers and similar stuff. We decided to see what was around the hotel. The only thing in reasonable walking distance was a gas station with a small convenience mart attached. We bought a six pack of beer and went back to the room. Through the evening flyers for various take out places kept appearing under the door (about 5 total). We elected to call Domino's Pizza whose phone number was on the room key!

That should have been my sign to go elsewhere, because when I finally got to this place (after having to drive round and round through some seriously dodgy neighborhoods to get there in horrible Miami rush hour traffic) it reeked of smoke from the restaurant/nightclub just off the lobby. The building was filthy, the patrons were constantly in and out of the rooms, slamming doors at all hours of the night, and honestly saran wrap would have been more soundproof than the windows in the room. Then, when I finally checked out and fled the premises on the first shuttle to the airport at 5am, the parking lot was full of working girls and their special friends who were just leaving the still-busy nightclub. (That explained the constant traffic and door slamming in the hallway.) The front desk staff was pleasant enough, the room was clean enough, and the bed was comfortable and bedbug free (I checked), but the incessant noise and sense of danger kept me from getting more than about 45 minutes of sleep all night (in spite of the furniture that i piled in front of the door).

The fraudulent charges on both cards all originated from the same Miami area district and all occurred around the same time. We informed the credit card company of this coincidence, but based on the other reviewer's recent experience it appears that using your credit card here is still very risky.

After finding this site I was scared to death to stay here, but I did find some of the info very helpful. I hope to pass some advise on to others. The hotel is not near as bad as some people have written, though it isn't great by any stretch of the imagination. We arrived to the Miami airport at 6:30 Saturday night and called the hotel for a pick-up they said it would be an 1 1/2 hours so we took a a cab/van. We had four people with a lot of luggage, so that was our best bet. The ride was $9.00 which was good price. As soon as you get to the hotel request that your name is put on the list for the cruise shuttle. There were many people taking a shuttle so the hotel hired a Greyhound bus. Our bus was scheduled to leave at 12:30 in the morning. Checkout is 11:00 but they will let you stay in the room longer. The hotel is on the airline takeoff path so request a room on the east side, it makes a world of difference. The beds are comfortable. Rooms could be a lot cleaner, a few bugs, but the staff was helpful. The hotel is not near any restaurants which is a problem, to take a taxi will will cost you around $20.00-$25.00 each way to go anywhere. We took a cab to Monte's Shrimp Bar in Coconut Grove and ate outside on the water (the weather was perfect) it was nice. The hotel does have a restaurant but it is is more of a lounge, the morning we left to catch our plane they had a party that didn't end until 5:00 in the morning. What ever you do don't get a room by the restaurant, you will hear music all night long. In the morning they serve a buffet breakfast for $7.50, or continental for $4.00. (cash only) It isn't great, but you don't have many options. They don't start serving until around 9:00 and they serve until it is gone, maybe 9:45. When we returned from the cruise we took a cab to the hotel and it was $26.00. That night we at at Joe's in South Beach, cab fare was $30.00 both ways. Be sure to sign up early for transportation to the airport and be down stairs waiting 15-20 early if you have an early flight. The shuttle starts running at 5:00a.m. and the van only takes as many people as he can hold. Over all the hotel wasn't bad.

After arriving to the hotel we were given a smokin room and as I went back and asked for a new one I was given a new room but again smoking! The reception personnel simply wasn't listening anything, two persons just gossiped their own matters and didn't even look at the customers. Finally, got a non-smoking room, which wasn't too good either. Dirty and outworn, smelled bad and the noice from highway just behind the window was unimaginable!! When we checked in I asked the receptionist how early should we arrive to the lobby in order to make it to the shuttle to get us to the airport in the morning. He told us to be there anytime we wanted and in ten minutes the shuttle would arrive. As we arrived in the morning to the lobby and checked out now the other receptionist (who was there at the same time with the evening shift while I was asking in the evening before) told us that the shuttle had already left and there would be no other until after an hour and thus we wouldn't make it to the flight! She didn't offer any help, didn't apologise, even insisted first that she didn't know the guy who was working there with her last evening!!! She was very very rude, and the most unbeliveable thing: while we were standing there the shuttle arrived from it's tour to the airport, but the driver refused to take us to the airport before the next \"shift\" (in an hour)!! The receptionist didn't make anything for this matter either - infact she took a personal phone call to her mother and started gossiping! We insisted for the taxi, which she (seemed to) order and which never arrived. After 20 minutes I ordered taxi again and thistaxi arrived in five minutes. We made it to the airport barely in time, paid 12 $ for taxi drive even though we selected this hotel partly because of free shuttle service.

We chose this hotel because it was cheap (62.00 AFTER taxes...we got a good deal online) and also because it offered a free shuttle to the port. We flew in from Ft. Lauderdale, so we didn't use their shuttle service to get to the hotel. We just took a taxi. I actually didn't know they offered a shuttle from the airport. Maybe they only do from the Miami one, I'm not sure. So I can't really comment on their shuttle from the airport. But the shuttle to the port was on-time and went smoothly. If you're staying at this hotel for cruise reasons, it's a good hotel because of the free shuttle to the port. But if you're staying here because you're on vacation in Miami, I wouldn't suggest it. Miami airport is very close nearby and the planes flying overhead are very loud. The highway is also right behind it. Also, the walls are very thin and you can hear everything. Anytime someone closed their door or walked down the hall or even took a shower above you, we could hear it. This didn't bother us, because again, we were only there for a room for the night before our real trip. But it might have bothered us if we were staying there a few days. The hotel does have a bit of a musty smell, and if you get a room on the side that the parking lot is on, you can hear the cars and valet people all night. Course, if you're on the other side, you will be by the highway, and I'm not sure if that would be just as noisey. The room itself was clean, and the king bed was very comfortable. They have a restaurant downstairs. The food was good (we're not too picky when it comes to food, some people might not like it), but it was expensive. We got burgers and fries and it was 9 bucks! They also have a pool, but we didn't go in it. It looked clean though. The staff was nice. The guy at the counter was very friendly. And when we took the shuttle the next day to the airport, our driver was very nice and gave us lots of nice tips for our cruise. One tip about the shuttle to the port: Most cruises let you board their ships at noon. So make sure you get down to the lobby early so that you can board your cruise early. We got down to the lobby at 10:30 for the 11:00 shuttle, and there were already 10 other people there. It was a good thing we already had reservations! If you tell them you want to take the shuttle right when you check in, they will put your name down so you are guaranteed a spot in the morning (as long as you're there on-time). But if you don't put your name down, and get there when 12 people have already put their name down, you have to wait for the next one. And I don't think they do it every hour. I think they have a shuttle at 11, and then the next at 3. But I'm not too sure on that either, it was just something I heard when I booked the room. But better to be safe then sorry, so put your name down right when you check-in.

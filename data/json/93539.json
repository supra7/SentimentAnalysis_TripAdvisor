I came across reviews for Riverside Tower which were to put it mildly, mixed! I was a bit apprehensive about staying there but my experience turned out to be very good! My first impression was - yes - it is small. But it was also very clean and smelled fresh. The bathroom had been renovated and was bright, immaculate and had lots of fresh crisp towels. There is also a window you could open in the bathroom so it is very bright and made all the difference. The shower is very cramped and the sink is very small but what more does one person need? It was clean and fresh plus there was plenty of hot water 24 hours. The room itself is tiny but heck, this was New York! I had places to go and memories to make. The bed linen was crisp and fresh. The bed itself was very firm and comfortable. I slept well in my little room. I was on the twelfth floor and though I did not have a view of the river, I did have view to the back high-rises and during the morning, sunlight filtered into my room. Also, I was able to open the window for some fresh air. Another thing I noticed was that I didn't smell one hint of cigarette smoke which is an instant turn-off for me. My room had a huge wardrobe to hang clothes in with an open shelf at the top. I also had two drawers to keep my belongings in. All rooms come with a mini-fridge and microwave which was so handy to have. There was also a flat screened tv in my room with 5 channels. It is an old building. The lobby and sitting room are dated, quite grimy. Its rather uninviting at first and to be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect. The elevator which seems ancient makes all kinds of strange noises and takes a bit of time to get you to your destination. I was on the 12th floor so it felt like forever to get up to that level of the building. But my room made up for it! As did the staff. The staff members are so friendly and helpful. Many times they went out of their way for me. Mike, the night shift person, offered me use of his laptop as I was without a computer. He also helped me get my bearings after arriving close to midnight on the first day. I hadn't had dinner and wanted a snack so he directed me to the perfect spot for a quick, healthy bite. He ensured me I would be safe and insisted I take his number should I run into trouble. Another staff person, Samantha, gave me such helpful information and directions even giving me her subway ticket which still had time left on it to use. The hotel is close to some of the finest gems NY has to offer. It's a 15 minute walk to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and 10 minute walk to Central Park. It's literally a block and a half away from Zabar's, one of New York's famous food emporiums. All sorts of restaurants and cafes are within a 5 minute walk. I am a solo female traveller and even after 1 am coming off the subway, I felt very safe in the neighborhood. It really is a great place to stay; affordable, superb location (right next to Broadway & a good subway line) clean rooms and the staff are just great! I will stay here again when I return.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockville, Maryland, United States", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for...\u201d", "Author": "Merrill L", "ReviewID": "UR124920735", "Content": "We stayed two nights in February 2012.

The surrounding neighbourhood boasts vibrant bars, shops caf\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and restaurants.

Simple rooms with simple d\u00c3\u00a9cor and furniture. I visited NYC with my brother, and we opted for the suite. This consisted of 2 rooms, both doubles. The layout is odd, but nice as the 2 rooms are separated in the middle by the bathroom. The bathrooms consists of a decent shower with good water pressure and constant hot water, and a toilet. There are sinks in both rooms, with plenty of soap and towels provided which were changed each day, along with all bedding. One room consists of a double bed, and the other one has a single which converts in to a double when expanded via a slide out bed which is tucked underneath. There is a TV in each room, and an air con unit which has both hot and cold settings which worked just fine. In one room there is also a refrigerator and microwave and a table and chairs for eating on. The hotel casts great views over the Hudson river if high enough, so when booking I would certainly make a request to be in a high room looking over the Hudson as you can see New Jersey from here, and there are some lovely sunsets if you are lucky enough to get good weather.

We return for to play tourist at least annually and prefer to stay in the upper west side area. For many years we rent an apartment, other times we stayed in the Amsterdam Inn on 76th and Amsterdam. This year when the Amsterdam Inn was no longer available for short term stays due to a change in New York City regulations we were slightly panicked. Having hunted down reasonably priced accomodations in this area for the past twenty years we felt we had exhausted our options. We had read the reviews of the Riverside Towers (RT) and were put off. My wife and I travel frequently and know that there is a fine line between \"worn around the edges\" and downright depressing. Fearing the later we avoided staying at the RT for years. However, this trip to the city was going to be a two nighter and the alternatives to the RT are difficult to justify the cost. Our needs are simple: convenient, clean and quiet. Especially in a city like New York, a hotel room for us serves as only a place to sleep and securely store our belongings. So here is what we experienced in no particular order: The location is marvelous! Being across the street from Riverside Park is wonderful. Lots of green and open spaces. Looking beyond the park is the Hudson and then New Jersey. The view changes throughout the day. I found myself sitting at our little dining table just looking out of the window and enjoying the view both day and night. Entering the lobby I was impressed at how nice it is. \"No so dumpy,\" I thought. The staff was very cheerful when we checked in (and throughout our visit). Our two room suite was located on the 13th floor so we turned to the elevators. Here is a word of caution. The elevators are very small and slow. The air is stale, so if you are claustrophobic be forewarned. As I mentioned I grew up in an apartment in Manhattan. Elevators and hallways have a unique feel in the city. Note quite confined institutional but not hospitable hotel either. Quite, drab spaces with the sole purpose of giving you a way to get to your usually nondescript door. When the elevator opened on the 13th floor, in a real deja vu way, I was home again. Now here is the key to understanding the RT...know this before you open the door to your room...this building was originally constructed as a dorm for Columbia University! Knowing this will solicit a understanding nod of the head when you first set eyes on the room interior. It explains the room size and configuration. For me, it allowed me to relax in the space and accept it for what it was and is now. True our room had seen better times. A broken bathroom door was heavily spackled over rather than replaced. Closet rods had years of painting that was scrapped away where the hanger moves back and forth. Air conditioners are old but functional. Hey, sounds like the typical vintage apartment in New York to me! So, two short thumbs up from us. We'll definately stay there in the future for our short fun trips.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beaver Dam, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cA Good Price and No Bugs!\u201d", "Author": "Hilltraveler", "ReviewID": "UR117053009", "Content": "Expectations for lodging are different in NYC than other places. If you don't alter your expectations, you will either pay much, much more or be very disappointed. Personally, my needs include a comfortable bed with clean sheets, a shower, toilet and air conditioner that work well, a safe and convenient neighborhood, and NO BED BUGS, or, preferably no bugs of any kind. Also, I want a private bathroom, and I try not to pay more than $150/night. So, knowing that those are my parameters will help you understand why I am giving this hotel a good rating. The neighborhood on the upper west side is a favorite of mine. I enjoy being somewhat away from the craziness of midtown and the Times Square area, and since 9/11/01, I really prefer being well away from the Wall Street financial area, too - at least to sleep. The upper west side is still a lot of fun, lots of really good restaurants, great subway stops, Central Park just a few blocks away - and Zabar's. We love going to Zabar's; it's a grocery unlike anything in Wisconsin, for sure. They also have an attached cafe with great bagels and coffee you can eat in the shop or take back to the hotel. I recommend a toasted sesame seed bagel with cream cheese for anyone wanting a real New York breakfast. Zabar's is two blocks from this hotel, a big plus in my book. Second plus: we were able to park for free on the street. This, however, is not easy. The first night, after arriving around 5 p.m. and driving around and around the hectic NYC streets looking for a parking space, we miraculously found one in front of a church! Take note: in New York City, you may NOT park in front of a church. I have no idea why. We did not read the signs correctly, and we got a $65 ticket. However, the next day we found a legal spot and were able to park for free the rest of the five nights we were there. Since parking in a lot will cost $35 - $50/night, this was a big savings even with the ticket. When we first entered the hotel, the desk staff had difficulty finding our reservation, but he did come up with it finally, thank goodness. He was very nice, but he had us worried for a minute. We took the tiny elevator - four people max - to our third floor room. Upon first seeing the room, my first thought was, \"I don't believe this place does not have bugs.\" The lobby, elevator, and hallways look very old, not very clean, and rather dilapidated. The room, however, was clean - if you don't count dust in the corners and streaks of dirt on the wall pictures, and hairs in the dresser drawers. The important parts were adequately cleaned. The bathroom fixtures were clean and worked well. The sheets, though thin, were clean. The beds were quite comfortable. Our room turned out to be two adjoining rooms with a single bed in each room and a bathroom in between the rooms. We had reserved a double, and I do not think this was what they call a double. The young man at the desk said, falsely, that we had not reserved a double. But it worked out ok. Each single bed has a trundle underneath it, so you could actually have four people sleeping in two adjoining rooms. However, when you pull out the trundle, creating a double bed, the door to the room is blocked. (In the case of a fire, you would have to put the trundle away before getting out the door. Don't know how safe that is, and I wonder if it is even legal.) One of the single rooms had a small table with two chairs and a refrigerator and microwave. Each had a closet, very small sink, and dresser and tv. The air conditioners worked well, as did everything else. After settling in, we were really quite comfortable.

And there are signs of more recent inattention, such as mysterious smears on a chair in my room and (most disgustingly) gum stuck under the ledge of my sink. Just for an encore, when I first turned on the hot water tap in that sink it ran brown. About the best things I can say about the room are that the sheets and towels seemed to be clean, and I finally figured out that the profoundly unpleasant smell was probably industrial cleaner. Oh, and the air conditioner worked, although the air it blew in smelled like hot dog grease. I will say that the desk staff was very pleasant and helpful, including allowing us to leave our bags in their storage room on the day we checked out. The storage room door was filthy, the room itself was filled with mounds of random dusty crap, and the door was open when we came back. But none of that was really a surprise at that point. We were willing to try this hotel because of a lack of bed bug reports, and admittedly we didn't see any insect activity. The probable reason for this is the plastic sheet on the bed, which makes sleeping a very sweaty affair.

We tolerated the stained carpets and the walls that haven't been painted in a million years, because it seemed like they at least made the effort to keep the place clean, and we didn't see any critters. We stayed again in October, and that time we killed a half dozen bugs over the course of two nights. I was freaked out, but since I hadn't seen any the first time I thought maybe they were just due for an extermination. I mentioned it to the desk clerk when we checked out. She apologized and that was that. I decided to give it one more try in Nov. It was such a great location, I really hoped they had done an extermination and all would be well. Well, no such luck. When we entered the room in the late afternoon, we immediately killed several bugs. I went right down and spoke to the desk clerk and asked if they had other rooms available. Since both bug experiences were in the corner rooms, and the non-bug experience was in the middle rooms, I hoped it might help. In fact, she told me she did have a complaint the week before from the same room but on a different floor. So, for that first night she offered rooms that had only single beds, which was not initially appealing to me and my husband, but after killing a bunch more roaches in the span of 5 minutes, we opted for the change of room. Single beds were better than bugs. We were told we'd have to change again the next night, which would have been fine, but we wanted some compensation for the inconvenience of having to move 3 times and for the overall ick factor. We slept uncomfortably in the single beds the first night, but at least we didn't see any bugs in that room, just peeling walls, broken tiles in the bathtub, and stained carpets. The next day I checked back in with the desk clerk. The manager offered us a paltry $50 reduction. We were appalled, so we opted not to stay the second night. We go to NYC almost once a month, and we stay at a lot of budget hotels. I know that roaches are everywhere, but when you start to see them hanging around your room, while the lights are on and you are present, it is a really bad sign.

Great restaurants all around here up and down a few blocks on Broadway. One word of caution: the rooms are not secured with deadbolts. They really need to install those. One night we woke up to hearing someone screaming at the top of their lungs in the hallway that they had been robbed. Needless to say we did NOT open the door for anything after we turned in for the night. Another morning, I went out one set of doors to go downstairs to use the ironing board and iron. There was a man, dirty, belly hanging out passed out on the stairway floor. I figured I could make a break for it if I walked fast. And I did. Asked the hotel staff to get him out of there as there seemed to be a homeless man on the stairs. They said he was living there and probably drunk. They did chase him away and told him he could not continue to sleep there. Would I go back? Sure, but I'd be very cautious about asking to stay on one of the upper floors. Probably not as many problems the farther up you go. I would not consider going unless I could rent a suite again. There were 3 of us in one room. The room was split into 2 sides.

We booked a suite with two single beds (which we found out were only available on 6th floor and lower). I was pleased to see a nice view of the Hudson through the trees of Riverside Park. The suite had two small rooms adjoined by a bathroom with a marble floor. We each had our own room which had it's own sink, dresser, and TV. One room had a table and two chairs as well as a refrigerator and microwave. The other room had the telephone. Although the rooms were small, there was enough room for us to walk around comfortably and set out our luggage. And there were NO bugs: everything was very clean, including the shower. The suite definitely had the feel of a dorm room: some peeling plaster, some writing on one of the doors, and a rainbow sticker on one of the mirrors. Also the rooms had old time heaters with a knob to adjust the level, but you could also open the window if you preferred. The rooms felt warm and comfortable for a cold March day. The beds were also comfortable and I was very impressed with the insulation between our suite and the other rooms next to ours. I have paid $300 a night for a room in NYC where I could clearly hear talking in the next room. We did not experiance that. We could hear the traffic out of the open window, but not to the point of annoyance. The location overall was wonderful, expecially since my girlfriend used to live very close to were this hotel is located. This hotel holds an exceptional track record of no crime in all it's years and I believe it! We were just two blocks away from Zabars and their cafe was a great place to grab a meal. Also, down Broadway towards 76th Street is a place called Nick's Burger Joint & Pizza Joint where all the \"locals\" go for good food at a reasonable price. They have almost any food/beverage imaginable including ostrich burgers, fresh squeezed orange juice, and gyro sandwiches. We went back three times.

The rooms were variably climate controlled by either adjusting the knobs on the steam radiators or opening a window (in December).

I spent a week in NYC for Christmas 2002 and stayed here, and didn't have any problems with cleanliness, plumbing, or rudeness, and I'm sorry to see that some customers have had those problems. Maybe I got lucky. My philosophy of a hotel depends on why I am staying somewhere away from home. If I'm in Europe or a big city in the US for pleasure travel, the purpose of the hotel is to sleep and shower in; I don't need a big room to entertain, to get out a notebook, or even to watch TV. The closer your thoughts about hotels are to that, the more you will like the Riverside Towers. While I was there, the clientele was markedly foreign; for example, a group of Japanese women who we decided were college kids on a trip stayed there, along with several European couples. The rooms are small, and so are the bathrooms (if you get a suite, the bathroom is between the two bedrooms). There are some pictures in the \"candid traveler\" section of this hotel's reviews that look right. Our rooms were clean. I don't think they changed the bedlinens every day but they probably would have if we'd asked for it; the beds were made and we had fresh towels. What I don't see mentioned a lot here is the location of the hotel. You're on 80th Street, about a block and change west of Broadway (and these are the short blocks). Once you hit Broadway, voila, there is Xabar's! Cheap, fantastic breakfast, and good coffee; you can also get gourmet food at the market. (The stray cats in this neighborhood are so lucky because of all the empty caviar tins they leave out after closing.) With regard to the subway, the closest station is, well, very close; I'm trying to remember but I think it's 78th Street but there's a stairwell just at 79th. This gets you to the red lines downtown; it's perhaps 10 minutes to Times Square, for example. I also felt that this motel was safe, and was honestly run.

The only complaint we had was upon check in, on one of the hottest weekends yet, we did not have ant air conditioning in the rooms.

We overcame and bought fans, which we left with our son, and discovered on the 2nd day the AC was installed for us. Ala in all, a good experience.

Still, I've stayed at really great hotels that have been severely panned by other people, so I know to take these reviews with a grain of salt. That being said, I was extremely disappointed when we were shown our suite (which was apparently the last one available as the hotel was completely booked for the night). It was badly run-down, with an ancient red carpet, peeling paint everywhere and red/brown smudges on the walls (where insects had been smashed?) Still, the bedding was clean, as were the towels and the bathroom, and since the rest of my group (all being extensive budget travelers in our thirties) was okay with it, I reluctantly agreed to stay. The neighbourhood is excellent, with beautiful, upscale apartments/townhouses all around and fantastic places to eat, as well as quiet and extremely safe-feeling, so for those reasons--and the cheap price--I'm happy we chose to stay at this hotel. However, when we came back to the room on the second night, we found three cockroaches in our in-room sink and one in the bathroom. Later, as I was bedding down for the night, one crawled out of a pillowcase that had been stored in the closet. The thing is, I believe the reviews on this site that say their rooms were in great condition (i.e. no peeling paint). I have a feeling it really depends on what room you get. And as far as \"gang grafitti\" on the walls (which I read in one of the reviews), I highly doubt that, as the rest of the people staying at the hotel all looked completely respectable. Still, I would only recommend this hotel to people who are used to really roughing it. As someone who's roughed it in the past, I still had a pretty hard time with the cockroaches, and the owner really ought to be ashamed about the peeling paint and overall appearance of the rooms (at least ours).", "Date": "May 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, NY", "Title": "\u201cIgnore all the other reviews\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4692284", "Content": "I just spent two nights in this hotel and was terrified before arriving and desperately tried [but failed]to book other accomodations after reading reviews on this site.

Our rooms were freshly painted and there was no sight of peeling paint anywhere. I slept like a baby with the window open. The second night I asked the desk for another blanket and it was on my bed upon my return. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The subway is two short blocks away, and cabs were easily caught on West End Avenue, a block away. If your plan is to find inexpensive accomodations and are travelling with a friend or with children, the suite at $109/night is unbeatable.

Our trip to NYC was not planned that far in advance, so we decided since most places were booked or pretty expensive since it was November, we would opt for a cheaper place. Then we came across Riverside Tower, which i was a little leary about, but figured it couldnt be that bad! I even read reviews on this website and just like many others thought..\"well we arent going to ever be in our rooms so who cares!\" I couldnt have been more wrong! I went with my fiancee, my sister, and her fiancee. We are all between 23-25 and we collectivly thought, heck, we have lived through college dorms, crappy apartments and in their case \"bachelor pads\" it couldnt be any worse than that. Well The rooms are smaller than dorms...they were a little bigger than our bed that was in there. There were holes in the walls, bugs, and paint peeling off. Carpet was RED and filthy. The sinks were the wierdest thing i had ever seen! They were an oval shape with the faucet on the left side and it was so small i could not wash my face in it at night...mainly because there was a medcine cabinet directly above the sink so i couldnt get my face over the sink, water went all over me and the floor. We were short 2 pillows and on our way out we asked for two, the incredibly rude lady (which all employess were there) said she would send some up. So of course when we returned there were no pillows and (no surprise here) they were out. So half of us didnt have pillows. The shower was filthy, i wore my flip flops in there and the worst part of all was that there was nothing but a HANDLE LOCK on the door..and its a flimsy door. I can tell you honestly, this place isnt worth another thought. One night it was too cold so we had to stay in the room after about 7pm...we couldnt even all sit in the same room, it was too cramped. Just spend a little bit more and go to hotel pennsylvania, thats were we went to after 3 nights because no one wanted to take anymore showers there or sleep in that nasty place.

I read all the reviews and tried to sift out the bogus ones (probably placed by competing hotels) from the real ones. On the whole, it seemed like most people were saying that this hotel was a real bargain, but the rooms were small and the furnishings sparse and worn. But I still couldn't help but wonder if I had made a big mistake (e.g., maybe I was just believing what I wanted to believe). The truth is that upon arrival and settling in, I was greatly relieved. No, there was not any graffiti on the walls. No, there were not bums passed out in the hallways. No, there were not any bed bugs. No, there were not any cockroaches. No, the carpets and bathroom floors were not filthy and did not need to be covered with towels to be safely walked upon. No, the rooms were not the sizes of small closets. All of those statements, I believe, are bogus posts meant to scare potential customers away to the competition. So what was the hotel really like? I think the average assessment that you get from most of the rest of the posts on tripadvisor is correct. In other words, as I said above, you can expect a small room with sparse furnishings in a well-worn building. Those would be the negatives. The positives include the great price (we paid $99 for a suite, which is two small rooms connected by a bathroom) and a great neighborhood (AKA the Upper Westside). I would have to say that my biggest tip for others would be to definitely ask for a suite. The individual rooms are small. Just having two different spaces made a big deal to me psychologically. And I could be in one room quietly watching TV while my wife was napping in the other. I definitely would have felt cooped up otherwise. I also want to reiterate how great is the neighborhood. There are all kinds of great restaurants and stores within easy walking distance, not to mention Central Park as well as the subway. I live smack in the middle of urban Los Angeles, but even I did not want to be staying in the hustle-bustle of Time Square. The Upper Westside is dense, but it's filled with brownstone homes/apartments, where \"normal\" people live with their children and dogs, etc. It felt good to walk around the neighborhood, which, by the way, is quite safe. And you can even get away from this quite quickly, if that's still too much hustle and bustle for you, by strolling over into Central Park which is just a couple of blocks away. I'll stop here. If you're like me, you'll probably still have some trepidation because you never really know until you get there and see things with your own eyes. But I would recommend the Riverside Tower Hotel as a great bargain in a decent, livable space.", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel was fine. Neighborhood great.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4123284", "Content": "Despite the nasty reviews, we thought we'd take a risk and stay at the Riverside Tower. We'd taken the precaution of bringing a list of some other hotels to retreat to if necessary. But really, while a little on the dumpy side, this hotel was fine and our stay was mostly uneventful. We had a suite--two small rooms with a bathroom in between. One room had a single bed with a trundle, an old TV, a chest of drawers, small closet, a dining table and two chairs, sink w/medicine chest, microwave and small fridge. The other had a double bed with chest of drawers, an old TV, smaller closet, and sink w/medicine cabinet. All of this was perfectly fine for our needs, and our daughter had plenty of space to toddle between the rooms. Though one of the elevators smelled like bug spray, the suite was clean enough, not a cockroach in sight. The rug had seen better days and the paint was peeling slightly by the sink. Whatever. We paid $99 and it's an old building--that was one of its charms. There were some problems. The microwave wouldn't come on until I jiggled the electrical cord, and then it heated up items super fast, as though something was desperately wrong with it. I unplugged it when not in use. You can hear the hot water pipes tapping at times, but it wasn't loud enough to impede our sleep. We just kept getting up to check our daughter until we figured out what it was. While this has nothing to do with our room, I thought I'd point out that there was a couple in the lobby who had arrived thinking they had a reservation, but when they got there, the hotel was completely booked. I overheard the staff lamenting someone who \"kept doing this no matter what we say.\" I wondered if it was someone on their reservation staff until my husband pointed out that it was probably an Internet booking service. We don't know who it was but we were glad we'd called three times before departing for NYC to check on our room, probably annoying the staff, but assuring our peace of mind. Food for thought. Back to the room, the biggest problem was the bathroom. It was miniscule with a dreadful, dingy shower--water kept changing temperature--and a low toilet. My husband burned his hand when he, out of curiousity, touched a pipe by the toilet. This was disturbing, especially given the fact that we had our 20 month old with us. They really should label that thing, and with how much McDonald's had to pay out after a woman spilled coffee on her lap, they really ought to consider it. Front desk staff were nice but order your own cab. We ended up paying $60 for a trip to JFK and, I could be wrong, but I think it was because the company they'd found for us rolled up in a Mercedes. Also, do your own research on restaurants. We stepped up to the desk dressed all bummy in jeans and asked to be directed to the best pizza in NYC. We were sent to a frou-frou restaurant where dinner jackets were required. Maybe there was pizza on the menu, but we didn't see it at first glance. But then we were in a hurry to get away from there. We quickly retreated to a pizza joint a few blocks down from the hotel. Speaking of which, the neighborhood was great. Central Park, a great kids's playground, museums and fine shopping were in walking distance and we jumped on the nearby subway to visit Times Square and Harlem. We were at Zabar's, which is a short two-block walk away, at least once a day; they have an incredible selection of groceries and ready-to-eat meals and the prices were reasonable. We weren't disappointed with anything we purchased there, and I wished we were in town longer so we could try more of their offerings. There was a church very close to the hotel that offers a Wed night worship time that we'll check out next time. Overall, we were happy with our stay at the Riverside Tower, and would choose it again.

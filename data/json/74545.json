The location is a bit far away from the center of downtown but it is easily accessible by the Light Rail. The rail is about 1/2 mile walk straight down the street from the hotel. When the shuttle was available the hotel offered to drop me off and pick me up from the rail station. The shuttle also dropped me off and picked me up from the airport, the zoo and the local walmart. All I had to do was call the desk and see if the driver was free or out on airport runs. They saved me a lot of cab fares! The rooms a little less updated than other Residence Inns I have stayed at but they were well stocked and clean. The breakfast was fine but not spectacular. The manger's receptions were a bit disappointing because the two receptions I was at were basically inedible except for the cookies and the beer and wine. The best part of the hotel was the staff.

I was very satisfied with this stay especially as a mini home-away-from home. Plus: *Very clean rooms, great housekeeping. *Well equipped with everything you need. *Very safe and secure building, you have to have a key to get in any section where rooms are. *Free airport shuttle which will also take you to places in the near-by area. *Free grocery shopping service (no mark-up or delivery charges). *Good daily breakfasts with lots of choices. *Light snacks and drinks provided in evenings (although I wish they would offer it at least M-TH vs. just M-W) and the selections were rather limited but for a free snack, not bad. These days many of the other hotels who offer evening socials have more to offer but the fact they offer at all, why complain? *Free daily popcorn in room (microwave, all properties do this but I enjoy it). *2 Bedrooms have a fireplace (although you will need to get wood or a log for it). *Studios are very spacious (we started in a studio and moved to a 2 bedroom but the studio would be fine for most singles or couples, consider a 1 or 2 bedroom with family). *Nice heated pool and spa. *Decent gym (small but new equip and clean and bright) *Service (best thing about this hotel), the staff is awesome! *Pet friendly/accommodating. Even provide an area in which to relieve your pet that is well maintained. Great for us who needed this but something to consider for others who may not like staying at hotels that take pets. *Easy access to all major freeways, downtown, Tempe, Scottsdale, etc. The neighborhood is really not bad considering it\u2019s near the airport (which can be iffy) but since it\u2019s in a section with other hotels, restaurants and office buildings, it\u2019s not bad. We walked out to eat a couple nights and felt safe but as in any city, use caution. *Large building but plenty of entrances (stairs and elevators) and they have large carts available to carry /wheel your things. *Windows that open (I love this in hotels). Things to Consider: *This property has not undergone the remodel several of the others have so the rooms are not as modern as other properties; however, Residence Inn tells me they will be starting their remodel in 2012. To me this was not a big deal, the rooms were still comfortable\u2019 clean and everything was in working order. *Nice common areas, however only 1 shared PC for boarding passes, etc. so sometimes in the morning it gets busy but people were fairly courteous of this and front desk staff will offer to print your pass if needed. *Wireless Internet was so/so. In our first room it was iffy but the second was strong. Might depend on where the access points are. *Offers Dish Network, probably the base line up but fine for what we needed and flat screens in the rooms. Includes HBO. *If you stay in the back of the hotel (which seemed quieter in general) you face a parking lot and you sometimes hear the garbage trucks early (around 4 or 4:30am) dumping the bins. Same thing with you can hear trains in the distance (might be any room), however, this is not a huge deal but if a light sleeper, it might wake you. Otherwise, fairly quiet overall. In Conclusion: If you need some space, like the pluses of having a breakfast, and staying in a well run hotel, pick this.

Nice parking lot with a nice sampling of cacti near the front of the building. Check-in was prompt, yet relaxed which was fine by me. My first problem was after checking in, I had to constantly use my room card. Within 30 feet, you'll need your card out for the back of the lobby, the pool, and the door to enter the building which has your room. I'd hate to see anyone with more than one bag deal with those doors. The room had everything I needed plus a good little kitchen. When I stay longer than two nights, I love to have more than just a little dorm-size fridge for some groceries. I found the role of housekeeping - in regards to the kitchen - to be confusing. Everything was nicely organized, but some stuff was half-washed and the rest was stuff I was going to wash and dry myself. Nonetheless, I made great use of my kitchen! The room had two big drawbacks. I probably would've found a better quality deal and the television looked like it was at the end of its depreciation. The nice part is that Marriott has always been good to me when it comes to comfortable beds and showers. That's usually why I'll choose Marriott first if I don't know the area well. The outdoor pool is surprisingly comfortable and provides the option of having your own little cookout. While the breakfast buffet food is average, it is well run. All in all, it was OK. Next time, I'll just stay downtown or in Scottsdale.", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenville SC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Airport Hoetl\u201d", "Author": "travelgrl1", "ReviewID": "UR13148968", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this property as we had an early morning flight. I have to say the staff was excellent. They are very well trained in service which I truly appreciate these days. The rooms were excellent as always- comfortable and well equipped. The only thing to be aware of is to be sure to bring your room key if you are walking from your room to the front desk since they will be in separate buildings and you must have your key to get back in your building. I left mine in the room with my husband while I went to the desk and could not get back into the building and had to knock on the window so he could let me back in . (Good thing we had a 1st floor room) The shuttle was right on time to the airport and even though breakfast did not start until 6am and our shuttle left at 530am- they still had hot coffee and juice out and fresh fruit so we could grab something before going to the airport. I would definitely stay here again.

The buffet breakfast was a touch bigger and tastier than I've had at recent other Residence Inn stays. The Internet service in the common area was well-equipped and sufficient for efficiently printing out boarding passes, checking the news, and the like. The front desk staff was efficient and helpful, but one or two of the staff were somewhat aloof and impolite, while another manager was very friendly. The free airport shuttle was on time, convenient and speedy, although the front desk mumbled something about possibly competing for shuttle space with hotel employees on certain shuttles during the week. I didn't have the time to use the other amenities, but others seemed to enjoy the hot tub, the fitness center is advertised as 24 hours, and several other typical Residence services are available.

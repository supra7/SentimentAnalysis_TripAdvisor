The service staff was wonderful, especially Tracee at the front desk (so personable and went above and beyond for us even when she was very busy) and Brandon at the entrance in the evenings. Every need attended to quickly and without any fuss. Even a door closure problem was promptly and efficiently handled by the hotel repairman right after we reported it. Their free breakfast was also remarkable with so many items, including fresh fruit, sectioned grapefruit, mixed fruit, yogurt, belgian waffles, eggs, breakfast potatoes, biscuits and gravy----too many things to mention here. The breakfast table seating area was very large and attendants were present to assist with anything we needed as well as keep items well stocked. I did not find the downtown noise to cause any sleep problem but 2 others in our group did use the free earplugs which worked well for them. We had good advice from the service staff on a great pizza restaurant plus a coupon for a free dessert there. Our suite was cleaned well each morning---they even washed our dirty dishes. We will definitely stay again when in Chicago.

Also, there were signs about the noise from the surrounding streets and the hotel offered free earplugs which were very useful.

The central location was great...close to great eating places, and great Chicago attractions. Did I mention the staff? Amazing, wonderful, kind, and all kinds of helpful. We had gotten a taxi over the the Hancock building (which the hotel staff graciously got for us)...well it's not so easy to get a van taxi so we started walking back and were going to hail a taxo on our way back if we found one. We got lost and I called the hotel for directions...the directions were great, although we found a taxi and skipped the walking. We asked for reccomendations as to were to eat and were given a great place to get some great deep dish Chicago pizza that wsa within walking distance of the hotel. I just can't say enough about the staff and how great they were. The breakfast was great both morning that we were there, and the fact that \"breakfast room\" was open 24 hours to sit and \"hang out\" in with free coffee was great.

We ended up staying at the Hampton Inn by default, since we try to stay at Hilton properties and the Chicago Hilton and Embassy Suites were booked. We got a great deal for a huge, one bedroom family suite with full-size fridge, microwave and dining room table. Although it was no-frills, it was very clean, spacious and comfortable for our family with little ones. The kids loved the pool (which was a little heavily chlorinated-which is good and bad for various reasons) and the adults were able to sit and relax and watch the kids swim without it being too crowded. The service was really excellent and all of the staff members were more than friendly and helpful. From the front desk to the bellmen to the servers at the (free) breakfast-everyone had a big smile and a kind word to share. We ate at Rosebud's, which is attached to the hotel, and it was very nice and the food was delicious (almost a little fancier than we expected, tho.) As mentioned by many, the hotel is right next to the fire station (somehow I missed that when I was reading previous reviews) so there were lots of sirens at all hours of the day...however, it didn't really impact our stay/sleep because we were expecting city-noise, and it was more of a drone. The kids actually thought it was cool \"city experience\" to see all of the trucks and hear the sirens:) Another \"good to know\" is that the hotel is a few blocks from Michigan Avenue, so although you probably could walk, we opted for a cab since it was cold and we had children with us. A $7 cab ride took us back and forth to American Girl/Water Tower. Overall, a great stay. Would definitely return.

I do want to mention on our last stay that one of the desk clerks (Brandon) provided service to us that is usually found in a five star hotel. I spoke to him on the phone the night before I arrived and was surprised that he remembered me when I checked in. Every evening upon return to the hotel he greeted my friend and I by name. He assisted us with our take out order for our first dinner in town (late arrival) and with some other small tasks which made our visit that much smoother.

The room was large, even had small kitchen area. It was very nice. The bathroom area was separated (which I prefer) so the toilet/shower closed off from the vanity/mirror area which helps when you have several women getting ready in the morning. The free breakfast buffet was fantastic! It was huge and had everything you could imagine. The only downside was it was very crowded so there was no place to sit, even with them opening up a conference room for overflow. They had trays so we just took up to our room. While not perfect scenario, it was by no means a deal breaker and it was a Saturday morning of Thanksgiving weekend. Location seemed to be pretty good. (I had never been to Chicago) It was about a 10 min taxi ride from the train station and we walked everywhere else. Didn't seem like that far of a walk to the Water Tower area or Millenium Park and we even walked to Rainforest Cafe. Some walks were longer than others but we expected that and at no time did we feel unsafe, etc. Hotel staff was pleasant and they held our bags for us upon arrival as it was early morning and our room was not ready yet. (which turned into all day as we didn't get back to hotel until evening) They also held them for us all day on Saturday as our train was not until later in the evening.

Absolutely outstanding modern Mexican. See my review under restaurants. Also the Italian Rosebud Trattoria restaurant located off the hotel lobby is terrific. Wonderful staff and large portions you can share. Highly recommended. The only negatives for us was the overcrowding of the breakfast room with large families and unruly children. The Hampton Inns do cater to families so if loud noise and children grabbing food (not using the tongs provided), coughing on the food, etc. concerns you this might not be the place for you. We found if we visited the breakfast room between 6-730 am took our choices to our room it worked better. Families need a nice hotel to stay at as well so I'm not begrudging them the experience but the hotel might be wise to post signs instructing parents to assist their small children with food choices rather than letting them grab at will.

I asked if coffee would be replenished as all of the pots were empty, including hot water. The desk clerk was polite and offered to check. A gentleman unloading boxes in the gift shop, angrily told us that he had just filled the coffee. He went on angrily telling me that all I had to do was check.

I was there in early May 2011 and stayed in one of the smaller king size bed rooms. We were on the outside part of the building. The Hampton Inn, as many others have mentioned, is right next to the Chicago Fire Department District 1 Headquarters. It's a very active fire station, and the windows at the Hampton Inn are not thick enough to muffle the sound of the sirens, squawks, and other nioses of the District 1 Headquarters. During my stay even though the bed was comfortable, I did not get a good nights sleep due to the noise factor. I was woken up 3 or more times each night as the fire department left their station. In fact, even noisy people on the street and traffic can easily be heard from my 7th floor room. They do provide ear plugs near the elevators and that should have been the tip off how noisy the rooms do get. The breakfast provided by the hotel was quite good. They had a nice variety, making it easy to find something to eat. I also appreciated that coffee and tea are available all day. We used their conference space, which was quite comfortable. The hotel did a nice job providing water, soda, and afternoon snacks. The room was spacious and worked great for the training I was part of. It was nice to actually have windows in the room as so many conference rooms are completely windowless. The best part about this hotel is the location.

Searching multiple hotels online, the Hampton Inn & Suites offered a great rate package that included Free Parking. In addition, the hotel also offers Free Breakfast, Free Internet, and a nice pool, hot tub and sauna! That all adds up to a lot of value in the heart of downtown. Our room was very nice and stylish, clean and featured a single cup coffee maker. Our room didn't have a microwave or refrigerator, but I wasn't expecting either. I'm not sure if this is true of all rooms. The bathroom was modern and fresh and Hampton Inn (this is my 2nd stay) have really soft bath towels! The softest of any chain actually. The only 'miss' for the hotel is the valet didn't understand our reservation, and instead directed us to self park. His directions included making a left turn which required breaking the law in order to do so. Upon check-in, we were advised that the valet should have parked the car. The front desk agent at check-in was exceptional, and apologized repeatedly. She really did her best to make up for the mistake, and was extremely professional. In the end however, I had to ride with the valet, to the ramp to locate my car so they could park it properly. Not the best solution. We indulged in the pool, hot tub and sauna, which were all very lovely on a rainy Sunday. Like any hotel, the only downside in this area are parents who are too busy texting to watch their young children run around. One nice feature is the hotel is connected through interior access to two restaurants, including Ruth Chris Steakhouse. Granted, Chicago is home to great restaurants on every corner, but this was a nice amenity. As was the complimentary umbrella, which we scored before they ran out. Complimentary breakfast was as expected, and as always, very busy in a family friendly hotel on a holiday weekend. The staff managed this chaos well, keeping most food well stocked. If I was on business, this would have proved less than pleasant. At check-out, we were genuinely asked how our stay was, and with the exception of the parking dilemma, everything was excellent.

The maintenance man came and turned the furnace on after our first night without heat.

Thankfully, Ronnie was very helpful and straightened our charges out. The cleaning staff did a great job of cleaning our room over our three day stay. The complimentary breakfast was good. The hot tub was a warm tub our first night, but on the second night, it finally did get hot. The sauna did not work. The pool was clean and had plenty of towels for guests.

The rooms were typical of a Hampton Inn which is reasonably sized, comfortable beds, fairly well-appointed, clean with everything working, but still kind of boring. The breakfast was a little better than most Hampton Inns with a better selection of bread and fresh fruit and a daily hot item. I personally can't stomach any kind of pre-cooked buffet style eggs, but my son must have downed 6 of the mini-cheese omelets they had one morning, so can't be too bad. The breakfast area really excelled in that it is very nice location on the 2nd floor. Even though it was somewhat of a zoo with all the people in the morning, the staff did an outstanding job of keeping the area well stocked and clean and there were always tables available, all things that are common problems that I have experienced at other Hampton Inns. I think the biggest difference with this Hampton is the staff which was without exception friendly and helpful. One example was seeing another gentleman carrying a couple of drinks and some food from breakfast back to his room, as he was walking out a staff member grabbed a tray and caught up with him so that it would be easier to carry back to his room.

From the front desk staff offering travel advice, to the car valets, to the cleaning staff - wonderful! The room (1101) was terrific.

A relatively small kitchen, but their breakfast on the second floor certainly was what we used every day. A bit busy at 9:30am for finding a table, but the food and cleanliness was 100%. The pool is pretty good. Bring down the larger towels as the small ones are not the best. The spa was pretty hot, which some people may not find suitable. I enjoyed it. As for the person who gave a negative review because they allow kids in the spa, that person needs to learn how to travel and not sweat the small stuff. The parking is somewhat costly at $42, but that is the same price as every hotel. There is a lot down the street for $30. Attendants are friendly. It takes about 10 minutes to get your car. No issues. The location is perfect. Close to too many restaurants to mention, and about a mile walk to Michigan Avenue or $6 cab. The only negative: It is near a firestation as many other hotels in the area. So there were sirens on occasion. It did not bother us on the 11th floor. You may want to bring ear plugs. But that applies to the whole city with people honking horns. Just plan for it. But all in all, this hotel scores a 5/5 without a doubt. I will definitely return.

My wife and I were just taking a short get away to relax, check out Chicago, and do some shopping. Good price for its location. Although not right on the magnificant mile, it is only a couple blocks away, has a nearby stop for a free trolley to Navy Pier, and it is a short walk South to the Theatre district and associated shopping down there. We did not try the restaurant in the hotel, hor did it get high recommendations from the front desk staff. The \"free\" breakfast provided elsewhere in the hotel was fantastic.... fresh fruit, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereals, coffee, juice, etc. The front desk and bell staff were also very firendly and very helpful at all times. Now onto some of the minor issues we experienced. While the room we chose (king bed suite) was very large and spacious and was very tastefully decorated and realtively clean, there is a bit of lack of upkeep evident. Our closet door did not work properly, our shower curtain had a tear in it, the towel hook behind the door fell off when habning one towel on it, and the microwave looked like it hadn't been cleaned for weeks (and likely still hasn't). I probably could have brought all this \"nitpicky\" stuff to the front desk, but I really didn't want the hassle of having to explain it. To me, that is stuff that a hotel (especially a Hilton chain hotel) should be on the lookout on a daily basis and dealing with. The one big shortcoming of this hotel's location, as referenced by many other reviewers, is that it is across the street from a major downtown Chicago Fire and Ambulance Station. In my opinion, most normal large cities, this wouldn't be an issue, but for some reason in Chicago, there are ALOT of emergency calls. A it would appear from what we saw, they send a lot of emergency vehicles to even just minor fender benders. The only thing the Hampton Inn should be looking to spend money upgrading is in some noise proofing of thier North and West facing hotel room windows.

Many of the Hilton properties in Chicago had a lot of suites with King bed, but limited number of suites with 2 beds even though I was booking 4 months in advance.

After 3 nights ( I stayed a week total), a broken toilet handle, a slow shower drain (the engineer and I became friends), I got the asst. mgr., Ross involved.

Thank you for everything and more. After the ease of e-check-in prior to arrival around 7 PM, we were very properly greeted by Paul (?). Our double - double suite on the 10th floor was very well appointed, updated, modern, furnished, and contained two NICE surprises....three windows on a corner for two views and two large flat screen LCD TV's, one in each the sleeping room and the parlor. (Two TV's are NOT listed on the Hilton web site room description for this hotel.) After getting settled with the kitchenette including the mid-size refrigerator to chill the spouse's and my beverages, we attended the very clean and well designed indoor swimming pool, large hot tub, and hot sauna located on the second floor. The pool is located very close to the restrooms, business center with four large (working!!) monitors all with free printing capabilities, and the breakfast area / dining room. I then printed the needed dining certificate and menu with ease before preparing ourselves for dinner. And, again, it was a simple, easy, safe, and comfortable walk to the House of Blues, when we passed a number of acclaimed restaurants within just two blocks! (Rosebuds, Sullivan's, Harry Carry's, Mother Hubbards Sports Bar, and, of course, with St. Patricks Day being the next day, a number of quiant Irish Pubs and Cafes. After our short return, we settled into the very comfortable and well-appointed beds. The breakfast on a weekday, Thursday, is open from 6 AM to 10 AM, and offers a full array of hot and cold items with about four (yes, 4) servers / attendants clearing trays, replenishing food and beverages, and geberally keeping all happy. (Our family felt so good and comfortable on the St. Pats Day morning, we started sharing and giving away green beads / necklaces to the servers, guests, children, and adults, to lighten the mood and create an even happier climate.) The staff was already handing out complimentary little green boxes of mints! The staff was very appreciative and thankful for the green beads we gave to all. After another dip in the wonderful pool, walk on the outdoor patio, and walkout in the great fitness center, we packed, checked our bags, and walked just four blocks to the Rock n Roll McDonalds, Portellos, Hard Rock Cafe, and the Rain Forest Cafe!! What a wonderful stay and day in the city we had!! Thank you Andrew and the entire staff at this great and wonderful Hampton Inn for making our one night get-a-way for a birthday, St. Pats, and the opening of Body Worlds at the MSI so memorable!!

We received a good rate at $99 and it appeared to be located in a very convenient location to other activities in the city. My wife has a very serious food allergy and requires an in-room micro and fridge to prepare all meals. When I called to book this room I was connected to reservations and was told this room would have these amenities (leading me to believe that all rooms there had the same as a standard item). Since this was such a necessary item for our stay I called a second time, a day before the reservation, to confirm and once again was told there would definitely be a micro/fridge located in our room. (No need for a specialrequest) After driving four hours to arrive, we checked in and discovered no micro / no fridge. We called the desk and was told there were none available (even at a charge). We were offered an option to possibly work out a solution the following day ...but this was no help as we had to prepare and store meals beginning that evening. In their defense the offered to store her food in a fridge at the desk but her allergy is so severe that it is risky not to isolate her items. Initially they had mentioned a suite option (which had micro/fridge) but was told this would come at the increased price. I told them I would accept this solution but after checking was told it would not be available for my length of stay. After an hour conversation with someone from Hampton Inn guest services (1-800) we were left with no alternative but to check out and return home. There were no other alternatives offered by the Hampton Inn personnel. We had to make the four hour return home that night, missing the 3 day conference (pre-paid). My wife also lost pay for the 3 day conference which she was to receive. Guess that $99 special rate at Hampton Inn was not so good afer all. My main complaint here is that first of all ..when booking or checking a reservation at this location you are transferred to a general reservations person that apparently has erroneous information about this property since I spoke to different personnel each time I called and was given the same information. Also, I was never offered an alternative hotel, something I later thought about and wondered why this was never offered. Although not familiar with downtown Chicago they could have offered to help relocate us ..I would have thought anyway. A complaint has been filed in my behalf with Hampton/Hilton but as of yet no comment from their manangement staff.

After researching every hotel I could afford, I decided to book the Hampton Inn & Suites Downtown Chicago, and I sure don't regret that. Once I finally got through the crazy amounts of traffic, I arrived at the hotel. I was worried about where I would park (it's downtown Chicago, barely any parking), but they had a swerve in where we could park our car until the valet got it. We went into the lobby and checked in. The lobby is very nice and comforting, and you could tell just by the looks of it that the hotel was either recently built or recently renovated; it had a modern feel to it. The lady that checked us in was very friendly and even made some small talk with us. It was nice that the customer service there didn't act like robots, they made you feel welcome. After we got checked in, we were given a card with the access codes for the complimentary Wifi, and we were given a card for the valet service which we would need with us when we wanted to get our car obviously. The valet took our car and brought it to wherever the dedicated parking was, and we went up to our room. The room was very nice. It was $89 a night; the standard room with double queen beds. Very modern and cozy. I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a mini-fridge or a microwave, but they had complimentary breakfast so I guess we wouldn't have had much of a need for that. I guess I would've liked to see a bit more in it, but I guess that's what I get for picking a standard room, eh? Anyway, the beds were very comfortable, and the room was very clean. It had a nice flatscreen TV and a desk, chair, etc. The bathroom was clean and had a nice big shower. Getting to sleep wasn't difficult at all. Others have complained about the fire station nearby, but the sirens didn't go off during the night (if they did, then I slept right through them). The bedding was clean, but I slept on my own blanket and pillows anyway. Leaving the hotel and getting my car from the valet was painless. All you do is call down to the front desk about 15 minutes in advance of your departure of the hotel, then the valet will go and get your car and have it ready in the swerve in. The valet people were very careful and we didn't see a scratch on our car (yes, we carefully examined it after every time we got the car like the sign outside says). At first I was skeptical about the valet service. $42 a night? Seems like a lot, but it was well worth it. Not having to worry about finding a parking space and the risk of your car getting stolen was great. Because the hotel is right in downtown Chicago, you can basically go anywhere in just walking distance, and it was quite entertaining to walk around for a couple hours and just look at all of the buildings, skyscrapers, etc. There were plenty restaurants near the hotel, and a large variety too. There's an excellent restaurant that you can access from inside the Hampton Inn called the Rosebud Trattoria. It's an Italian restaurant, and the food was great. A little pricey, but I got Cheese Ravioli for $14 (I believe), and that was great. More than enough to fill me up. There were also several bars, BBQ places, even a McDonalds, all in walking distance. The hotel had many great features. They had a nice pool and hot tub which was nice to wind down in in the evening. The complimentary Wifi was great I was expecting to have to pay for it, so I was more than happy with it. The complimentary breakfast was also great too. Not your typical cold cereal breakfast. They had fresh omelets, hot meat, make-your-own-waffles, muffins, bagels, toast, various fresh pastries, cereal, milk, juice, coffee, and many other things which was delicious. I think I've covered about everything. If you're looking for an affordable yet modern hotel in Downtown Chicago, this is DEFINITELY for you.

The Hotel staff are amongst the friendliest I have come across, from (yaneli) at the front desk today, to Jennifer (who was working \"complimentary breakfast\"). Jennifer at breakfast today went out of her way to find the manufacturer of the drink in the drinks machine- which served my orange juice this morning. She was really helpful and polite and put a smile on my face at 8am, which can some times be hard to do. The hotel gives you complimentary wifi which is really fast, and of course available in room! The hotel has a pool (which I have not used) and gym (which I have not used) and available room service from the restaurant downstairs. I ate at the restaurant last week and the fish there was really delicious- you should try it. Over all, the reason I love the hamptons so much is by the far because of all the staff. Both times I have been the staff have been so so friendly and helpful. It really makes you feel at home, welcome. This place is spotless and hotel cleanliness is must to me. Near by is every thing you could want or need, including shops (the magnificent mile), stores, bars and restaurants. It is literally situated moments from shopping north of the river, and moments from crossing the river. If you are traveling for leisure, i would totally recommend the stay!

Bed was VERY comfortable with a sponge pillow and a down/feather one to suit all tastes. Hotel lobby is great, with afternoon freshly popped popcorn, all corridors are clean and very well kept.

Loud and several times during the day and night, coming from the fire station next door, which also dispatches ambulances so it's not just the occasional fire. We were in a king bed room.

But we use a sound machine (those things that make white noise) and it did a great job of drowning out the noise at night so we were never woken up. The hotel also offers free earplugs.

The checkin was extremely friendly, the location is better than I expected for the price. And, if the room were hygenic - it would have been a good value, with the free breakfast and all. Unfortunately, the entryway and bathroom are done in white tile. And it looked like they hadn't mopped in weeks. I called down that morning to ask them to mop the floor. Okay - perhaps a maid made a mistake, and the last folks in the room were messy. That would be forgivable. At that point, I would have been happy with a cleaned floor. Came back after an afternoon of museum-going and shopping - and the floor looked exactly the same. I called the manager, who said \"We've got new floor tiles - I've got 3 complaints about this so far today. It's part of the tile pattern, it's not dirty.\" (Do most people buy white tile that LOOKS dirty? Or skillfully installs so that bootprints line up on multiple tiles?) I asked her to come up. She wiped her dry finger against some of the stains, and pointed out that no dirt was on her finger - and that was \"proof\" to her. They told me that they'd try to mop it again - even though they kept saying that the floor was not filthy-dirty. I waited for a half hour, just to see what they did when they mopped the floor - but I had to leave. I never saw the maid again. She may have come when I was away - I don't know. But the floor looked the same when I returned. My first call to Hilton to complain was met with a telephone operator who insisted that, if the manager wouldn't help me, there's nothing she could do, and refused to register my complaint. I called the special \"Silver member\" line (which I am), who at least took my complaint seriously - but would not offer anything other than to email management. I really didn't feel like I could take a shower in the morning and touch that tile floor. So much for my weekend trip. I cut my weekend trip short and drove home that night. The funny thing?

The (wireless) free Internet connection worked great when few guests were in the hotel / off peak, and was pretty much unusable when many guests returned/were using it / on peak. I do networking and such for a living, and my read is that the connection capacity is insufficient. The hotel should really consider buying a bigger pipe, or even better - buying something burstable that would scale-up with the demand. In our case, we'd have MUCH rather paid for Internet service and had something consistently usable, as we had to complete some business remotely. Reagarding the noise - we were on the 12th floor, and the noise from the street and the fire station next door was substantial (it is downtown, after all). Additionally, the slamming of other guests room doors was a bit disturbing. That said, the hotel is fully aware of the noise issues and kindly offers earplugs (which made us laugh at first, but then we recognized the wisdom).

Toiletries (shampoo, conditioner and moisturizer) were replaced daily as needed - never had to ask. Nothing was lacking - we had a fridge which we used a lot, a microwave and coffee maker which we didn't use at all, a chair with ottoman for reading and a great T.V. The bed was so comfortable I slept through the night - most unusual for me. I loved the duvet and pillows.

We were even able to use the transit system to take the El from the Airport to the hotel by taking the blue line to Jackson, and then transferring to the red line to go north to Grand. It worked with no complications other than that I have to get a lighter suitcase for myself...a younger, stronger person would have no problems. We bought a weekly pass for the El and used it to go everywhere - Andersonville, Chinatown, Oak Park, Bucktown, etc. etc. The hotel is also an easy walk to the Magnificent Mile and the Loop.

The king rooms are on the main street where it is a bit noisier. We decided to give up our king room and take a double-double. It was a great decision for us and we appreciated that Yanelli gave us the choice. Every time we came to the front desk for guidance or information, we either saw Yanelli's happy face or the nice gentlemen that works with her. I can't forget to mention the staff working the room where the breakfast buffet is served. They took their job seriously, yet they were also very friendly, happy and accommodating. The complimentary breakfast was a nice treat that we had not expected and it really came in handy when we were in a hurry to eat and run. Oh, and speaking of food, the hotel is actually one block away from three of the restaurants run by Rick Bayless, from the Food Network.

The location of this hotel can not be beat. Many great restaurants surround the neighborhood of this hotel including Rosebud and Ruth's Chris adjacent to the hotel.

Our room was spotless when we arrived. Housekeeping as well as every staff member we encountered were polite, helpful and courteous. The indoor pool and outdoor sun deck were clean and well maintained. The breakfast was wonderful both mornings.

It turned out to be a great stay, they were able to get me a \"& Suites\" room that had the kitchen area and living room - so had plenty of space. Biggest +s: The location is fantastic... Everything downtown Chicago has to offer is well within walking distance. Harry Caray's, the Billy Goat (original), the CTA ORANGE (not Blue) line are all just a few blocks away. The Blue line is about a 5- to 6-block walk. The staff are all very accommodating and friendly - willing and eager to help. Also the breakfast area had plenty of seating and food both. They did a good job of keeping it stocked and clean. Biggest -s: The rooms themselves, while kept clean, were definitely showing their age; some rust around the door frames, a bit of peeling wallpaper, etc. but not at all a big impact to the stay quality/enjoyment. But it is there, and that's why I gave it a 3* cleanliness rating. Also, the fire station is right across the street (Dearborn), so rooms on that side of the hotel are closer to the noise, but I can't imagine it's that quiet anywhere in downtown Chicago. If the sirens are on, I would think all the buildings in the block would hear the noise. Didn't impact the quality of the stay either, but may bother some people. Overall, the hotel was actually very quiet - fire station noise notwithstanding. Other comments: The first two floors have all been redecorated and look really nice. Everything from the lobby to the breakfast area, meeting rooms, fitness center, pool area, etc. all looked up-to-date and well kept. The hotel is attached (doors into) two restaurants: The Rosebud Trattoria on the lobby level and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on the second level. That was really nice - although there are hundreds of restaurants within walking distance, if you didn't really want to go out (e.g., if the weather's bad, or you are just tired of walking) - it was great to have two really nice choices right there at the hotel. Also they have one of those \"Pantry\" areas right off the front desk with some snacks and sundries. The fitness center was good - 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 1 cycle, then free weights... There were always people there, but it was never overcrowded and never had to wait. It's all attached to an outdoor patio and the pool area - really nice. I didn't try the business center but it was right there on the 2nd floor as well, the standard with a couple of PCs a printer, office supplies, etc. Again, the location of the hotel is great, the prices are very competitive, the staff is very helpful (the bell captain arranged a \"limo\" ride back to the airport for me which was much better and cheaper than a cab), and the amenities are all there.

Some of the amenities included an indoor pool for the kids and indoor hot tub for adults with an adjoining outdoor deck on the hotel's second floor. There was a fitness room and business center, which we didn't use, but we did enjoy the free hot breakfast every day. The offerings changed from day to day, but included things like ham, sausage, eggs with cheese and ham, along with the usual cereal, hot cereal, bagels, toast, and warm biscuits (which my daughter loved!) Especially nice was the proximity to so much of downtown Chicago. We never took our car out of valet parking. (Incidentally, valet parking with in and out privileges at this hotel runs $38 a day; it's $25 without the in and out privileges. We opted for the higher price valet service, not realizing that we wouldn't need it.) We walked to Navy Pier (just a few blocks), Macy's (the old Marshall Fields), and even to Shedd Aquarium, although that was 2 - 3 miles away and we ended up riding the free trolleys back. We also walked to Gino's Pizza East (I highly recommend it if you have kids, but take a few extra dollars as it's pricey) and in heading this direction, discovered our hotel was also within just 3 or 4 blocks of the EL.

There is a review of my trip on the forum. I checked in around 3.45pm with no problems whatsoever. I noticed that there were free complimentary papers of the Wall Street Journal and USA Today to the left of the reception desk. I had room 1130. I opened the door and couldn't believe how big the suite was. The lounge was huge with a small but adequate kitchen with fridgefreezer, microwave, dishwasher and bar/table. The lounge had a sofa and a chair with footstool. The bed was fine as was the bathroom. The sink was outside of the bathroom and there was a wall hairdryer and toiletries. There was a tv in the lounge and in the bedroom. I received a note to say that the tv's were being replaced by 37\" LCDs over the next few weeks. Breakfast was great with a varied selection. It was great to have strawberries, chopped pineapples and oranges. The scones were lovely as was the chocolate muffin. There was two items of hot food which consisted of mini-omelettes and one other item which I didn't know. The juices (cranberry, guava) and coffee/tea were fine. On the 2nd floor, there was the swimming pool and the business center with the free internet and superb consumable facilities such as fax, printer and stationary equipment. You need your room card to gain entry. The location of the hotel was great. Turning right out of the hotel, there is a 7-Eleven across the road (30 yards away). I stocked up on bottled water and the odd chocolate bar. Right on the 7-Eleven is the free trolley bus which takes people to Navy Pier. This was excellent and really convenient. On the way back, I waited about 20 minutes and the queue was long. To get to Michigan Avenue, I walked up Dearborn until I hit Ohio and then turned right. This was because I avoided any stairs going up or down and in fact, apart from Nordstrom and the shops there, there wasn't much there. The main stores are from Ohio to Water Place. In terms of eating, there are a lot of decent eateries nearby. I eat quite reasonably though not necessarily healthily! I went to Boston Blackies (164 East Grand Avenue, between Michigan and St Clair), Gino's East (633 N. Wells St. (Ontario and Wells) and Cafe Iberico (737 N La Salle Dr (Chicago and La Salle). All three places were busy and there was a good atmosphere. The food was fine and reasonably-priced. As I left the hotel on Sunday, I turned left and walked around the corner to N.Clark St. There were some people preparing a film. I asked some people there and it was a film about John Dilinger starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale filming Public Enemies! There were going to be there on Monday. Initially, I was concerned about the distance between the River North and the Loop area but it was only about 15 minutes. I hardly caught any CTA trains and in fact, crossing the Chicago River was a great photo opportunity. I would definitely stay in the River North area compared to the Loop area mainly for the eateries and shopping.

Our suite featured a living area with desk, TV, and queen size sleeper sofa (perfect for our two kids at night!) and also had a fullsize refrigerator (trader joe's is only a few blocks away on Ontario), dishwasher, microwave and cooktop (no oven).

The breakfast room is very large, with plenty of seating (tables as well as couches) and the buffet itself featured two hot items daily (eggs, sausage, sausage gravy, etc.).

I called a few days before we arrived to ask about a roll-away bed for our youngest. I did not know one was available when I made the reservations. The first night was going to cost us $40 more than the second night, but the gentleman I talked to knocked off the $40 so both nights were at the lower rate. Needless to say I was glad I called back. Everyone at the hotel was extremely friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was great for us, and my only complaint about our entire stay was the eggs (or whatever they really were). They were awful! Otherise there was plenty to fill the kids up in the morning. The kids also liked the complimentary apples and cookies in the lobby. Our room was comfortable. We stayed in a room with two double beds and paid a little more for a roll-away so the kids could have separate beds. Our room, on the fourth floor, overlooked the pool area, and so the noise from the fire station was minimal. We also used a sound machine with the kids, so we did have a rather peaceful sleep. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. The room and bathroom were clean and sufficient for our needs. We bought two day M.T.A. passes at the Jewel 1 1/2 blocks north of the hotel on State. We used the bus stop on Illinois just east of State to get to Navy Pier. The free Navy Pier Trolley stops there too, but we did not use it since we had the passes. The red line stop is just one block north of the hotel on State/Grand. We used that to get to Shedd. Aquarium. You take the red line to Roosevelt and transfer to Bus #12. The hotel is in a great location for getting around via public transportation. We did not use valet parking but saved a little money by parking at the public parking lot just east of the hotel. It cost $25/night but make sure you have cash to pay the attendant. There are plenty of restaurants within a short walk of the hotel. We walked to the McDonalds and also to the Rainforest Cafe a few blocks north of the hotel on Ohio. We did not take advantage of the two restaurants mentioned on the hotel website. Lastly, the kids enjoyed the pool. We only went there on Saturday morning, but we pretty much had the pool and whirlpool to ourselves. I am sure that it is much busier in the evening.

It was up to date with mission style furniture and 1920s style stained glass light fixtures. Nothing looked worn or dirty. The carpet was in great condition.

A decent hot breakfast with a little something for everyone. Free internet in the room, but if you don't bring your laptop, free use of the hotel computer room (with internet, printers, faxes, etc). Nice pool and work-out room. Very friendly staff. Great location to all that downtown Chicago has to offer...all within walking distance. Lastly, we loved the sense of calm and quiet you get when you step into the hotel after being on the bustling city streets. Some hotels are as busy and crowded inside as the city is outside. But every time we stepped into the Hampton, it felt like a quiet, relaxed respite from all that was happening outside. It was warm and comfortable. We will definitely stay there again. With the AAA rate, we stayed for less than $150 a night with all taxes included. Parking is $30 for the day or $38 for valet (well worth it). Downtown Chicago hotels do not have to cost a lot.

They even addressed me by name when I come through the front door (stayed for 3 nights). In addition, the hotel had what nice hotels downtown should have, just without the inflated price. There is a little sundry room by the reception, a pool, a workout area, and a velet and bell stand. I have stayed here twice now and it is excellent. There is no reason you should compromise comfort, location and price especially when you can get the best of all these right here. This last time I did stay in a room with my window right above the fire station. It was quite a surprise and it seems that at 6 in the morning, they start running like every 15 minutes. I knew the station was there, but didn't even think of the noise (I did in the morning though, lol). Easy fix, I just turned the AC up to high and it was all good.

The Hampton Inn offered us a room at pretty much the going rate for a place in town, about $260-something. We are not from Chicago, nor have we ever been before, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak to the value of the actual street address, however, we did find our way around town pretty easily (all credit to the dynamic trio of Google maps, a Treo and my navagatrix wife). The hotel was typical of the properties one finds in a world-class city. The staff, much like virtually every human being we encountered in Chicago, was delightful. The parking at the hotel, again like most other properties, was steep; $38.00 a night! But there is a lot right next door for $20 and one a across the street for $25. In and out privileges are okay at the independent lots, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about that. The rooms at the Hampton were, again, right on par for the type of property they represent; handsomely furnished, modestly sized and nicely equipped with toiletries and little extras (a bottle of water and some cookies). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an Italian restaurant downstairs and a sky bridge connecting to a Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Steakhouse. The property offers a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which, sadly, leaves much to be desired, like perhaps a good breakfast. The coffee was nice (and is always available) but the selection of breads lacked any whole grains, the chafing dish of eggs tasted like a science experiment gone wrong and the orange juice formula used to be restricted to astronauts. Breakfast is not the best feature of this hotel! The city itself is just terrific! We enjoyed a pair of blues bands at the packed, raucous (but cool-vibed) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kingston Arms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd blues bar the night we arrived and the next day made the most of our late flight and rented car by touring the whole city. This included a slice of authentic deep-dish pizza (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a New Yorker, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a tough sell on pizza, but this a local tradition and it should at least be experienced) and a trip up the Sears Tower. I used to work at the top of the World Trade Center, so I was probably less thrilled than most, but it is quite a view! One thing to keep front of mind is the traffic! I live in Los Angeles and even I was freaked out by it. Give yourself an extra hour at least to get to the airport.

Also - I couldn`t praise the staff highly enough. Nothing was too much trouble. The front desk guys suggested restaurants, changed travellers cheques and allowed us an extra hour on check out day (prior to us flying back to the UK) all with cheery smiles.

Being on the 9th floor might have helped. The start of the free trolley route to Navy Pier is about half a block from the hotel. The signs say that it runs every 15 minutes, but it's more like every half hour, if that. We waited twice for 25+ minutes and ended up taking a cab. But that isn't the hotel's fault. The breakfasts were good. We didn't have time to use the swimming pool, but we checked it out, and it was tempting, especially the whirlpool after a day of being on our feet. The one drawback was that the wireless Internet access worked only for the computer we brought and not for the laptop. They didn't have a tech person on site and weren't able to help us with that. They have computers for use in their business center at no charge, but most of what I needed was on the laptop.

The hallways were very quiet at night--no wild partying going on. Our check-in was fast and error-free. The room had a bedroom with two full beds. In the living room there is a fold-out couch/bed, which was miserable and fit only for children. There is enough space in either room for a fold-out cot which were 10 dollars a night. The hotel is convenient to the free trolleys and to the buslines and many of the interesting restaurants (Ed Debevics, Gino's East, House of Blues, Harry Caray's etc). Yes, there is a fire station at Dearborn and Ilinois, but I don't think there would be any hotel around that wouldn't hear their runs. They have three ambulances and three fire apparatus, and they do go on a lot of runs. You can also go to the station and buy Chicago Fire Department t-shirts from one of the guys--just ask one of the guys sitting around outside. Nice shirts/reasonable price. Everybody wanted one. I was very impressed by the employees all the way around--they were polite and courteous and were always handing out cold water bottles! The room was clean and new enough. The beds and bedding were clean and in good condition. The bathroom lacks a powerful ceiling fan. The kitchen area was clean and it was so nice to have a fridge to keep our food in! The pool/jacuzzi/sundeck was clean and fairly underutilized while we were there. We never saw more than 8 other people anywhere around. The breakfasts were good--a different main course every day, from scrambled eggs to french toast sticks to biscuits and gravy. Add in the daily bagels, toast, fruit and juices and you easily had a meal for the family. If you have trouble getting a wireless signal on your laptop, the front desk will loan you a LAN gig, which you plug into your computer. It worked for us, although we had to keep the LAN antennas higher than the desk (on top of a lamp) to get a reliable signal. In summary, we had a very good experience at the Hampton Inn Suites.

The breakfast area was sufficiently large to accomodate all comers. We enjoyed the choice of pillows in our rooms and the new duvets. Everything was quite clean.

We ate at Boston Blackie's (huge burgers at reasonable prices) and Lalo's (Mexican with a great maharichi band - lots of fun for everyone). The concierge was more than willing to give advice on where to go and how to get there. Most of the attractions did require the use of some sort of transportation whether it be taxi, bus or subway. Taxis were readily available, the subway station was a block away and bus stops were nearby. Because there were a couple of negatives about this hotel I can not give it the highest rating, however. As previous reviewers have said, there is a fire station on the next block - you do hear the sirens if you are on the Dearborn Street (west) side. We were on the 4th floor - maybe if you were higher up (the hotel is 11 or 12 stories high) it would be quieter. Your best bet though for avoiding the noise is to stay on the Hubbard Street (south) side. My second complaint is that housekeeping would not show up until 5 PM each day. By that time, we had finished running around for the day and were returning to the hotel to relax before dinner. The hotel staff explained that housekeeping had until 5:30 to make up the rooms - an absolutely ridiculous policy - perhaps they were short handed but thats their problem, not mine.

The hotel is in a good location and has some nice restaurants nearby - we would recomend the Thai down the road and the Rock Bottom Tavern for a good feed very close by. Didn't hear the sirens that other reviews mention - although we had previously been in NYC were they never stop so maybe we just got used to them?!?! The breakfast had the best variety of food we saw in our whole 10 week trip and there were enough tables that you didn't feel that you had to fight for a seat - the breakfast staff were also very friendly. It was a bit of a walk to the Navy Pier - but do-able and a pick up for the Hop on - Hop off trolley was only about 2 blocks away.

Our family of five stayed in a two-room suite that was spacious and comfortable and clean. The beds and sofabed were all very comfortable. The suite had a kitchenette also. The location was great for using public transportation and touring Chicago. The staff was extremely helpful and answered all of our questions completely. There is a really good breakfast - besides the usual items on a continental breakfast, on one day, there were eggs scrambled with ham, and on another, sausage patties and french toast sticks. There is a very small store by the front desk if you want to buy cokes, snacks, etc., late at night - the front desk folks will open it for you. I got a good rate on Expedia (government rate).

Avenue and shopping. Unfortunately it is also one block from the fire station and we heard sirens all night long. The other thing that I was disappointed with is that I think the purpose of a suite is to have a separate bedroom. The design of this hotel is such that you have to go through the bedroom to get to the bathroom, and the wash area is not even closed off from the bedroom. So, there is really no private sleeping area, which is what I look for in a suite. If you don't care about sharing the bedroom with the bathroom/vanity area, then it won't bother you, and if that's the case you're probably a heavy sleeper and the sirens won't bother you, either.

The suites were clean, spacious and well equipped, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The breakfast offered a wide variety of hot and cold foods, and the breakfast room was large and pleasant. The decor was very attractive--an arts and crafts motif. The most outstanding aspect for me was the service.

Decided to take Amtrak to Union Station and 'walk' as much as we could to save $$. The walk from Union Station was only about 1.2 miles. Nothing if you're active -- also gives you a good idea of what downtown Chi-Town is like. Of all the 'continental breakfast' situations I've experienced, this is the best. Change-out for fresh is done constantly and immediately. The selection is great. The only limiting selection is the warm eggs/sausage/stuff. Well, that usually isn't included. They did a great job with supplying and keeping the breakfrast fresh. A large room for all to sit in with the buffet style breakfast. There's great coffee, tea available all day. Very centrally located - within 2 to 3 blocks from the mag mile. We walked to the Art Institute with no problem (for walkers). We taxi'd several places with no crimp in our wallet (6$ to 11$ w/o tip). Very central to Mag Mile, Hancock, Art Inst., Union Station. There is a big grocery store not more than 3-4 blocks away for those that want to skrimp on food and booze. Also a Subway sandwiche and other places w/in 2 blocks. The place is very centrally located for many many good restaurants. The hotel is connected to two.

The internet access was free and was quick and easy to connect any time day or night with fast speeds. Easy access to Michigan Avenue, and may eating places nearby, also the Red Line Chicago stop is only 1 block away.

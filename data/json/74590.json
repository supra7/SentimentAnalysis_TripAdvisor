It just sets everything off on the wrong foot. See my attached photo to understand just how painfully lacking the speed is at Courtyard Phoenix Airport. So Courtyard, here are a couple of tips. Stop embarrassing yourself by labeling anything under 1Mb/s as \"broadband\". Secondly, spend the money to provision REAL network infrastructure instead of trying to cheap-out by letting data ride piggy-back on your aging voice lines.

Courtyard has spent lots of money on upgrades to cater to business professionals, with such amenities as a nice free business center in the lobby. However, this location is a little average on the fundamentals, with the somewhat sickly lit shower rooms, substandard toilet paper and towels, and hasn't yet put in the curved shower curtain rod that most hotels are now offering. Courtyard also expects that you pay for your breakfast, while others in the price range offer at least a basic continental for free.

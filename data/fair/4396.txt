The hotel is quite nice in spite of the shabby looking entrance.Lobby charming. Nice beds and room. But when I came home I discovered bits of BEDBUGS! I have carried them home in my luggage. I have tried to clean our home thouroghly, but still after a month I discover big red marks on my body. I am now forced to contact an authorized compony to clean our home. Disapointed

We spent 5 days in Sept at the RC and were disappointed. We have visted Maui frequently in recent years and have stayed at various properties. The Ritz was just so-so. The room was standard hotel offering - no wow factor even with an upgrade ocean view room. The room smelled musty and had no character. The pools were nice, but Kapalua is very windy much of the time. The beach is nice as are the grounds, but nothing special. We heard that soon the RC will be converting to time shares. Our last morning was spoiled by loud drilling and having our room's water turned off at 9 am! With no notice! - didn't they know we were there??? Beware of the trade winds if you plan to play golf! We played the Plantation course or a non-windy day and the course defeated us! Good shots down the middle rolled off the fairway and were lost in the thick long "grassy" rough. Shots to the greens rolled off. Putts rolled fast or slow - we never knew what would happen. The restaurants are ok. Vinos is a tapas bar and tasty. The PIneapple Grille and Plantation House were nice. All in all we prefer the South properties - especially the beaches. Our last week we spent in a lovely condo at the Wailea Palms (non ResortQuest property). PS: Roy's Kihei is not to be missed!

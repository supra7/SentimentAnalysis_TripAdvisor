Beautiful rooms, good service - the water park was outstanding. A $40 (yes, FOURTY DOLLAR) resort fee that applies to every room is excessive. If it applies to every room - it's not a fee, it's part of the rate. They are only making it a fee so their rate looks better on the booking sites - then gouge you for $40/day at the hotel. I won't return.

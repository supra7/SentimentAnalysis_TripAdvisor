This was our second trip to New York City and we found The Time online and saw the good reviews it had. The location is great! Right across the street from the Chicago theater, around the corner from Times Square, and within walking distance of the subway, Rockefeller Center, etc. With that being said, our experience with the hotel was marginal, at best. Our room was very small and we had a double size bed! I didn't even know those were options in hotels anymore! There was paint peeling/chipping on the walls, the bathroom had mold on the ceiling, and the AC rattled and didn't actually cool the room off that much.,,much to our dismay in the 95* heat! Also, beware that on Saturday nights, the club downstairs gets very busy and the hotel staff seemed more interested in making sure those guests were taken care of than actual hotel guests. Overall, it's a good price for a great location...if you don't mind getting what you pay for.

Saving Money is not *this* important I have stayed in a dozen different Waikiki hotels, and I am really not a picky guest (I believe you get what you pay for). But, for my money, the Continental would be my very last choice. The bad: Dark dank rooms with dirty carpet and old finishes. No lanai (balcony) on any of the rooms. Poor ventilation. Non-working lobby facilities. Etc etc. And yes, there are many friendly and lovely ladies outside, just trying to make a living.On the bright side: The location is great, central Waikiki, on the busline, walking distance to the beach, the park, zoo, IMP. But, for an additional $20 you can do so much better. Never pay more than $75/nt for this property, and then only stay here as a last resort. Otherwise, be forewarned: e told you so?As always; I travel to Waikiki several times a year, I can advise that Waikiki is a nice tropical urban adventure. The city comes with the negatives of a big city, along with the overwhelming benefits of a beautiful beachfront resort. Generally, everything in Waikiki is  little tired?although there have been continuous improvements in the last few years. If you are traveling solo, take Roberts Hawaii from the airport for $10 (no rsvr rqd).Two or more people, take a taxi from the airport to the hotel (should be under $30). In Waikiki, nearly everything is walking distance or a short shuttle/bus away. If you need a car for the day, you can rent one in Waikiki.

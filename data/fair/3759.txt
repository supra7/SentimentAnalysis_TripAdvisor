The website for this hotel is very misleading. Maybe once thier remodeling is finished it will be nicer, but I felt it was really misleading. The hotel is not in the greatest neighborhood, I pulled up and a few intoxicated patrons from the bar next door were hanging out and "rough housing" in front of the hotel, I had computer equipment with me so I was reticent to get out of the car. I drove around the block until they left. The wireless internet was not available as advertised, there is no valet and the parking is a block and a half away, so if you are lugging heavy computer equipment, good luck. I finally found a spot on the street but when I parked I could not help but notice several men sitting and sleeping on the street right near where I parked. The gym is the Y which is 4 blocks away which is no big deal, except the streets were not well lit and again, it's not the greatest area, so I had to pass on my workout. Finally, the shower flooded the tiny bathroom, it had a shower curtain and that apparently wasn't enough. I used most of my towels cleaning up the mess. The cherry on the sunday was the jackhammer that woke me up at 4:35 am in the morning. There is alot of construction going on in this area, but 4:35 am?! I was a mess for my meeting the next day since I was operating on 3 hours sleep. I originally was booked for 3 nights, I checked out the next morning and moved to a hotel in Scottsdale. Further drive but OH so nice and quiet! I normally love historic hotels, but this did not make the grade at all.

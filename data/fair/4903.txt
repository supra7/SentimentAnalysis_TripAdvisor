I'm not one of those people who writes reviews about hotels, but I was so disgruntled during our stay that I feel compelled to tell the world. The Swissotel may have impressive views and a fancy address, but that's where it ends. When we arrived at the hotel there was a line approximately 40 people deep of travelers checking in. After waiting in the line for more than 30 minutes, we finally got to our room and were disappointed to see that it didn't look anything like the photos online. It looked like it hadn't been updated since the late 1980's. Later that night while trying to go to sleep we realized that you could hear the elevators traveling up and down all night from our room. The shower head couldn't be adjusted and because of the awkward bathroom layout you could not turn the shower on or adjust the temperature without the stream of water hitting you in the face. I slipped in the bathroom as I learned the hard way that the shower also leaked. After this incident we asked management to change us to a new room and found the second room to have identical issues as the first. On top of all of this, the concierge was so unhelpful and unknowledgeable that we called the W Hotel to use their services. I will give kudos to the Swissotel lobby bar. The bartender and staff were the only bright spots in the lackluster weekend. Not what you expect from an upscale hotel and certainly not worth $300/night. I would not stay at Swissotel again if it were the only hotel available in the area.

I stayed here for four days while attending a conference. I really like Marriott hotels and am nudging Gold status, so I was surprised when I got a cramped little room overlooking the Interstate. I complained and got a better room. Like so many hotels in Marriott's Renaissance chain, the Seattle Renaissance is old, tired and run down. The decor is early 1970s with carpeting that dates from that era. I noticed in the restaurant carpeting that was worn and stained. My room had dark wood and cabinetry that was cheap and ill fitting. I could not get my closet door to close properly. The lamp on my bedside table kept falling off. And as others have noted, each bed has a weird cloth headboard that is both unnecessary and probably unhygienic. I used the fitness center, but unless you got there before 5 am you were out of luck for a workout due to the limited number of machines. As I said, I am a huge fan of the Marriott chains. Why their Renaissance flagship brand is so consistently lousy, with the wonderful exception of the Mayflower in Washington, beats me.

The Arizona Grand is a sprawling "suites" hotel in which all the rooms are suites, much like an Embassy. The problem with this property is that it is heavily spread out. You need a golf cart to get from the lobby to the room, and getting a golf cart for the return is not easy. The rooms are nice, but not luxurious. They are very similar to an Embassy Suites, There are no frills. The TV's are old with no connections for DVD or computer. There are no bottles of water in the room. There are no restaurants in the resort. No place to eat breakfast. No bar. There are however, several restaurants on the "edge" of the resort, most of which are a significant walk or require a shuttle. The only breakfast place is a Denny's about 8 minutes walk down a very busy 6 lane street and across a major intersection. The biggest disappointment was the "resort fee." I was forced to pay a $25 per day resort fee above and beyond the advertised price when I booked the room. This fee supposedly covered my access to the water park, a daily newspaper, and internet access. The water park was closed, I got no paper, and the internet crawled a a snail's pace. I used my 3G card the entire stay. None-the-less, the manager refused to waive the fee for me or any of my colleagues. I'd avoid this resort and the 5 other people I was there with all felt the same.

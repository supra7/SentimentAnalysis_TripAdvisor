Booked at the Marrakech since it was the only hotel could find for under $600 a night for a last minute holiday weekend trip. For $200 it was not bad. Fine for the budget traveler looking for a inexpensive (by NYC standards) hotel but would not reccomend to families with small children or anyone who does not want to climb stairs with luggage or dislikes dark hallways and rooms. Pros - location is good, safe, very close to subway, decent size bedroom, clean, plasma tv and pleasant staff. Cons - no evelator and a flight of narrow stairs just to enter the small lobby, very dark in hallways and rooms, small bathroom, leaky and noisy shower, charge $2 a bag to keep your luggage after checkout and photos/website make hotel look much more luxurious than it is.

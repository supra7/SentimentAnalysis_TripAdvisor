This truly is a gorgeous property and the rooms are beautiful as well, however, the staff leaves something to be desired. The staff at this hotel came very close to ruining a good portion of my wedding day because of their lack of attention to detail. I had worked with a staff member to preview and book a suite in the hotel at the end of July for my wedding that was in early November. Two days before the wedding one of our family members called to pay for one of our nights at the hotel and NO RESERVATIONS! The person we worked with was less than helpful to fix the situation and the two other people we spoke with took a totally indifferent attitude, it was unbelievable. We had to resort to yelling at the person and requesting several times to speak to a manager, who has still yet to return my calls. In the end they gave us a room similar to the one I was supposed to have, but not without a whole bunch of unnecessary stress two days before my wedding. The suite that we had was beautiful, PNW ballet themed, and had a great view of the water. I found the front desk staff to be annoyed with any request we made, and we were not particularly high maintenance only asked for some extra pillows and blankets. I wish I could say that my husband and I would be back to celebrate our anniversary next year but I just cannot justify the price for lack luster service at best.

My husband and I were the party traveling with the previous poster (kjacklpn). We were the ones in the room with no air conditioning and no ceiling fan. When we arrived at the hotel (1 p.m., not 10 a.m.) were did store our luggage in the hotel office and were told that our rooms were not ready. We left and walked around the city until 3 p.m. (check-in). When we arrived back at the hotel at 3, we were then told that one of our rooms had no air conditioning and the air conditioning in the other room was leaking. We were also told that a repairman had been contacted and he would probably be there within an hour. We were aggravated because we were tired (after driving 8 hours) and very hot, and felt like since the room obviously had no a/c at check out that day, that someone should have already been there to repair it, and it was evident that no one had been called until in the afternoon. The repairman did show up. He haphazardly got our a/c running (run and then cut off, run and cut off), but with the Music Festival in town, and no other choice, it was better than nothing at all. Our room was very small, bathrooms much smaller. We didn't have a bathroom mirror on the wall. Not a big deal to a man, but to a woman, we kinda like to have a mirror when getting dressed. I asked the desk clerk if one could be found, he said he'd work on it, but never got back to me. Room was pretty clean, however, the floors hadn't been mopped in several days as evident by the bottoms of our socks. All in all, not very impressed by the Frenchmen Hotel. Probably wouldn't stay there again.

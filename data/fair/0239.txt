don't get me wrong. The location and price (group rate for Seattle Rock'n'Roll Marathon) for the hotel is not too bad but I know a few people (me included) chose this hotel because of its advertisement for hotel's amenities. This is what's on the hotel's website. Our hotel includes an array of amentities: * Shuttle to start of marathon When I checked in (around 4.30-5 p.m. and check-in time is 3 p.m.), I requested for a spot for the shuttle and was told that no spots available. It's on first come first serve basis. That's fine but if so, shouldn't the hotel put that in their ad. I heard a few other people that were checking in about the same time, told the hotel that that's why they chose this hotel. So if next year, you want to choose this hotel, make sure you get your spot. otherwise, stay at or near the official hotel or Qwestfield where the official shuttle buses depart.

We knew that the deal we got was was good so we were not expecting much. Trip Advisor reviews had said that the rooms were small but clean - that was acceptable and the rooms were small and clean. In fact the rooms had a fridge, a microwave, coffee facilities - but no bathroom. We did expect a bathroom! When we checked, we found that the small print on the booking form said that room type could not be guarenteed, but if a hotel has a 3 star rating, which it did, we presumed that a bathroom would be included in the room price - not so (in this day for goodness sake!). So it was a shared bathroom with who knows who. Then there was the smell. A huge amount of air freshner or something highly scented made it horrible to breath - for someone with asthma a real trigger for an attack. We had to leave the window wide open to deal with the smell (was it covering something up - this was hard to tell). Luckily the weather suited having the window open as it was not too hot or not too cold outside. There was also no air con that we could see, so the heat would be dreadful in the summer. Finally when we did venture into the bathroom to chance a shower there was no hot water. Calls to reception revealed that there would not be any for several hours .......

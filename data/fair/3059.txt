This resort is old and needs to be updated, the so called heavenly 10 beds as soon warn that you sleep in holes in the mattress and the pillows that are suppose to be down we had to stack 3 pillows just to sleep. Maid service is lacking everyday of our 19 days that we stayed at this resort we had one problem or another, towels not in room, air cond. not working, no coffee etc., etc., As far as friendlyness if it wasn't for the birds we would have never heard the word Aloha, bell men never greeted you or ask if we needs any kind of help. I could go on and on but am litited to 50 words. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY YOU WILL BE SORRY AS WE WERE.

What they don't tell you in your Internet search: No elevator. I had to lug my very heavy suitcase up to the 4th floor. The rooms are incredibly tiny. There's just enough room for the bed and a desk, not much else. I'm constantly tripping over my things because there's not enough room. The room is always too hot, so you have to leave the window open and endure the wailing of ambulances which constantly race by on the street. No tub and the shower height adjustment is currently held together with electrical tape. The shower is so tiny that even I, at 5'5" and 140 pounds felt like a giant. Large people will not be able to enter this shower, that's how small it is. There's no "Do Not Disturb" sign and despite telling the desk several times not to enter my room, they did anyway. There are no fire sprinklers or fire escape to get out of what would essentially become a barbeque pit in event of a fire. And finally, the Internet service was extremely poor because they have not engineered it to reach all of the rooms. If you are totally on leisure and want to save some money, this is the place to be, but if you like amenities or need to get business done, this is not for you. Oh, nearly forgot that the included breakfast is a joke consisting (when I went this morning) of toast and orange juice.

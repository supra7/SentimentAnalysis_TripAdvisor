Normally we stay outside of city to avoid expensive parking fees but decided we wanted to see city @ X-mas and go to Seahawks game so we decided on the Crone Plaza. I have to say besides the location - everything else was average or less. The room was small and had a musty-odor. They put us next to ice -machine (which didn't work) and just outside elevator which made our rest "noisy" .

For me, beds and bedding are important and at the Affinia the bedding was short. I mean literally short. I am just under 6' so not impressively tall but the sheets did not reach the end of the bed. They also use a practice I am unfond of, using a flat sheet for a fitted sheet. When untucking the top sheet the bottom sheet is also undone and before you know it you are sleeping directly on the matress. I don't like that. They advertise a rooftop bar. Good view but the place is shabby and the cocktails are strange and way overpriced for the venue. It could use a remodel of both the specialty drink menu an decor. By the way, what's with the metal coffee table in room 2806? Are you expecting people not to put their feet up? With the many choices in the area, they need to do a little better because it's the little things that keep me coming back.

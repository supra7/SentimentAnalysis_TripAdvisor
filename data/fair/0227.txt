I stayed at the Seattle Hilton during April 2011. Frankly I do not understand all these wonderful reviews on TripAdvisor. My tab came to roughly $300 a night for an "Executive Level" room with breakfast. Other than the location the Hilton really has nothing going for it. There are a slew of better hotels for the same rate within spitting distance. The bathrooms are tiny, the shower head was "free floating in the wall", meaning it was not affixed to anything other than the pipe in the wall and at 8:30 am housekeeping banged on the door even though we had put the do not disturb sign on the door the previous night. There was a huge water leak stain on the ceiling above the beds. I very often stay at Hilton hotels and book the Executive Floor rooms, because I like the Executive Lounge idea: complimentary hors d'oeuvres and drinks in the afternoon. Well, guess again. The Seattle Hilton must be the only Hilton I have ever stayed at that charges for this. And conveniently, for them at least, they will not tell you at booking time or when one shows up at the lounge that one is being charged for all this, until one leaves and is presented with this unexpected bill. Choose another hotel!

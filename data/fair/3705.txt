The hotel appeared to be very nice. The rooms were great with a beautiful view. We had 2 adjoining rooms. Our toddler grandson was with us and we noticed bites on him when we changed his diaper. We didn't give it much thought untill the next day when we found more bites on him and then his Dad complained of having bites. We then inspected the mattress, though it was clean we found bed bug feces, then to our horror a live bed bug! We were horrified. Here our little grandchild slept with his parents and had to get bit by these things. I realize they are not from dirt, but measures should be taken by the hotel to enclose all their mattress in plastic.....as that is the only way to get rid of them and prevent guests from being bitten.

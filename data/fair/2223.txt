I am not going to say that this hotel is horrible-it is not. My husband and I lived there in Boston for a few years and we are used to the "quaint" style of furnishings that Boston has to offer. You know, slanted floors and unstable steps! When we checked in, we were met with a very friendly reservation clerk and sent on our way. Believe me, I was very nervous about staying here because I had read some very bad reviews on this website. I had only found this wonderful website after I had booked our trip. We walked through a gorgeous front lobby and up very efficient elevators, but I had only to laugh when we opened up the door. (ps, what is with those panels on the doors? I felt like I was onboard ship) Yes, the room was tiny and impersonal and a little rough around the edges. But, what really got me was that the bed in the room was a twin bed!! The person at the Front Desk saw that we were two people, and not only that, my husband is 6'4", 220 lbs. When I went downstairs to ask if there was a different room I was told that because I had booked through discount booking (Expedia) that our room (twin bed) was what I had to get. I don't know if that is true, because I have had good luck with Expedia and always had at least a Queen sized bed. So, be sure to ask what the sleeping accomodations will be. The only other rooms available were smoking rooms and I felt that sleeping on a cot-which I ended up doing- was the lesser of two evils. Honestly, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone or even think about staying there again. But, if you are willing to fork over some big bucks and stay in a suite then by all means do. My husband and I made the mistake of peeking in a room across from ours and it was awesome! Bummer!

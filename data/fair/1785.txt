First off - I've stayed at a bunch of Courtyards over the years, and the mental image I had - a central courtyard area where the chefs cook the omelets, the plants, etc. - that's apparently not the deal anymore...this is not nearly as nice a place as those were. Whether those don't exist anymore, or whether Marriott is foolishly trying to extend their cachet to more profitable hotels, I don't know. Long story short - there is no courtyard at this Courtyard. Aside from that, we and some other guests had some problems with our keycards degaussing, there is no pay per view system in the room, and we had to debate for a while to get the free breakfast that was part of our package. Only time will tell whether that will show up on our credit card bill... What was solid was the decor, the breakfast itself, and the bed was quite comfortable. If my expectations had been for a Holiday Inn, this would be a three star review, but my expectations for a Courtyard were substantially higher.

When we arrived at Adamar hotel they had no room for us although we had two CONFIRMED double rooms booked well ahead!!! Adamar offered us nearby Hotel Noah's Ark instead and free dinner at Adamar as compensation. We inspected the rooms at Noah's Ark which were dark, smelly and old. As Istanbul was almost fully booked it was hard to find new rooms ourselves. We ended up staying at the Hilton Doubletree for double price. Be careful when booking Adamar, make sure you reconfirm before getting stranded. At least they gave us free transfer from the airport to the hotel but the disappointment, lost time and stress remained.

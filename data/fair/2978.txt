My husband and I stayed here with our daughter, son-in-law and their child- because I read previous reviews on this site a week before we arrived,I called the hotel then to request rooms without mildew (I have serious allergies) - I also requested a crib for one of the rooms. I was assured that my request would be entered into their reservations system. The day we left for Maui, since we were scheduled to arrive at the hotel about midnight, I called again to check on my earlier request. Guess what? We arrived exhausted and were rudely treated by a woman behind the desk who was wearing a parka - she clearly wasn't the usual desk clerk - our daugher and her family went to their room after they were assured it was set up with a crib - it wasn't. My husband and I went to check out our room and I couldn't barely breathe in it -- as I said to my husband, "Somebody just sprayed this room," a man appeared who asked if the room was okay. He told us he had just been told to spray it because of the mildew smell - the "desk clerk" had called him on her walkie-talkie while we were walking to the room. After much discussion back at the desk, the night manager grudgingly moved us - to a really faded room with stained carpet, promising to move us the next day. The next day the "only" room they had to move us to was directly above a play area and next to a convention party room, so we ended up staying 6 nights in this room. The pool area is pretty, the tennis shop was shut down, the spa area is tiny. There are better resorts on Maui, I'm sure, for the same price.

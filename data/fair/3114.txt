The rooms here do not compare with the landscaped grounds and lobby areas. Our room was cramped and dark. There was no closet, just eighteen inches of hanging space in an armoire that also held the tv. Bathroom light was so dim it was like a nightlight-when we asked for a better bulb we were told that actually they use even dimmer ones and we should be happy with what we had. The planters on our lanai were empty and had chipped black paint on the insides. Not an attractive place to spend time and relax. From the lanai we could see several bright orange tar cans that had been left there by the maintenance crew for several days. The main problem with this hotel is that they have tried to cram too many people onto what is actually a fairly small property. The lounge chairs around the pool are all touching each other, so to get on one you have to crawl up from the bottom and hold your drink the entire time because there are no side tables and you can't put your drink under your chair because the chairs are all firmly together. It's a bit like being in bed with strangers on either side of you. I'm trying somewhere else next time.

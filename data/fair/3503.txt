We stayed at The Time for three nights at the beginning of January. The location is great, the beds were comfortable, and the room was reasonably clean when we checked in and very quiet at night. However, the service was amiable but off-hand (the staff were mostly friendly, but we were overcharged by room service and there did not seem to be a way to fix it, and the daily cleaning was perfunctory at best), and the room and furniture were quite worn out. It seemed like there had been a cute and chic decorating scheme originally, but as everything is scuffed and torn the room was a little sad-looking. The bedside lamps would not stay up (they were worn out goosenecks), and there were a few bugs in the bathroom at night. It seemed like a lot of money for the shabbiness. I wouldn't stay there again unless they renovated the rooms or dropped the prices.

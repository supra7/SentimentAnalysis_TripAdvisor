Having used the Mariott brand for most of my business trips, the price I paid for this hotel was not worth what you get. It felt very old and run down. The service however was wonderful, I cant complain there, but the room itself made me uncomfortable. They had just steam cleaned the carpet so that may have accounted for the musty feel. I also found a bug crawling around on the floor which really freaked me out. And the location was very noisy. All night long I could hear the traffic on the streets. Next time I am in Philly on business, I will definitly look for a different hotel.

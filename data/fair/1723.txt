This is a themed hotel - think 'Austin Powers' meets 'Boogie Nights'. Apart from the appalling decor, the place was not in a good state of repair - the finish was very cheap and quite run-down. It is in a very 'local' area; China Town is within walking distance, but otherwise it is removed from the central tourist and business district (only about 5 minutes by car, but it was too far to walk given the surroundings - I attempted it once but didn't feel safe). The staff mean well, and were friendly and helpful, but getting anything accomplished was an ordeal. Every time I called for room service, my call would be held from person to person and placed on hold for so long that I would have to hang up and start all over again. One morning, they got my room service order wrong 3 times when all I wanted was 2 slices of brown toast with jam and a small plate of fruit - then they charged me S$27 for it. When I checked out, I was in a hurry to get to the airport and asked for a porter to help with my large suitcases. 3 calls and 15 minutes later, I gave up and took them down myself. Due to the nature of my business trip (Singapore-KL-Singapore), I had the misfortune of being booked in this hotel twice in one week. I tried to cancel my booking for the latter half of the stay, but agoda.com charged twice the nightly rate as a cancellation fee (don't get me started). Both times, I requested a double room but was placed in a twin room with 2 single beds which could not even be pushed together. What baffled me was that both rooms I stayed in each had a 40 inch flat-screen Panasonic TV - assuming this was the case in all the rooms, I wonder if the money could not have been better spent on refurbishing the whole place.

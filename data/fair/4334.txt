Not great at all While the location is fine , if you go expecting the same standard as the Fitzpatrick Hotel in Dublin , you will be very disappointed.We had a number of silly problems in our room like faulty heater , nosiy air con which prevented us sleeping.The lifts need a major overhaul as they are noisy in the extreme and can be heard from most rooms in the hotel. The bar area looks fine in the brouchure but it caters for a young crowd , playing loud music with people shouting to be heard . Not good as a spot to relax. Again its basic.Staff were a mixed bunch . Some very friendly others cold and awkward to deal .This was our first time in Big Apple , when we go back , I don't think we will be staying in the Grand Central unless there is some major renovations carried out.

Oh boy, I wish I had read the reviews first. They are on the mark. They charge for everything after the monster price for the room. We were promised king and we got double next to the elevator. Which do not stay within 100 ft. or stay awake, you choose. The rooms were nice but no coffe maker. Is it me or does anyone else need coffee without going all the way downstairs between 5 am to 7am for coffee. Well , I am not happy but some are. Just will not go back. In fairness, the hotel was very well kept and had a lot of things going on. Dan

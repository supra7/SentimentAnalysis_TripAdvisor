First of all the hotel is in a seedy part of town, second of all I was not given the price quoted to me on priceline. I guess the hotel manager saw fit to increase the nightly rate due to the Essence Festival that was in town and knowingly I could not choose another hotel to stay at. He proceeded to persuade me and tell me the price quoted was priceline's fault, which was not the case because I use priceline for all my vacation needs and they have yet to fail me.

Rooms are outdated. Rugs and furniture are stained. Rooms are dirty and small. There was a coffee stirrer on the floor when we arrived and it stayed there for 3 days even though the housekeeper came to "clean" the room daily. Night stand was full of dust. Lamp on nightstand was not working so had to call for repair. Television had only 4 channels. Called front desk and they sent someone to repair it. We were then able to get about 8 channels. Bathrooms don't have ventilation so after shower, mirror stays fogged for a while. Hotel has no heating system. Air conditioner was old and loud. Definitely not worth the $249 a night that we were charged. Called Hilton headquarters to complain and was told that the hotel manager would call me back---he never called. They seem to only be interested in taking your money and not providing appropriate customer service.

This place was the epitome of the french quarter, cute courtyard, unique rooms good location, etc. However, the place is old and you can hear EVERYTHING coming from the rooms next to you and above you. My friends and I heard clear conversations from other guests as if they were in our room. Additonally, the room was not cleaned on a daily basis (i swear they only had one housekeeper), they do not have safes in the rooms, and they did not refill things like the coffee or the shampoo/conditioners, etc. It is definitely not like staying at a chain hotel. Also, continental breakfast consisted of croissants and coffee only, not many options. The worst of all were the two woman who waited on us at the front desk. They were rude and unaccomodating, short with us, and just mean. The bell hop nathaniel was awesome though so make sure you tip him well. Would not recommend for a group of girls or guys on bachelorett/bachelor party...more for a couple if anything at all.

My husband and I stayed for business/pleasure for 3 nights. The location was great! But the hotel itself was not the best experience. We experienced the following problems: * Extremely SMALL rooms * Heating system was not working and had to be replaced * Wallpaper in bathroom was peeling * Caulking around toilet was yellow/brown * Lights in the bathroom were faulty * There were holes in the wall of the bedroom * The carpet was dirty When we checked out, we mentioned some of the problems we experienced and the front desk staff was not overly concerned. I have heard such good things about the W Hotels and was shocked at the quality of the room and the lack of interest by the staff. It is hard to justify how a hotel can charge over $500 a night for such poor quality.

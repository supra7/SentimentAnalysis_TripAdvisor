This property does not appear to be well maintained. It's in desperate need of a remodel. Bathtub had rust and black marks on the bottom. The bathroom had cracks and rust on the floor. If you're looking for a bed with a beach view, then this may work for you. But if you expect a nice clean room with modern amenities, you may want to look elsewhere. This was our 2nd stay in 2 years. We do not plan to return unless they remodel.

WE go to Hawaii twice a year (for the last 15 years). We have never had the check in problems that we had at this hotel. We stayed at The Maui Prince over the holidays. We had booked a room with a king bed, ocean view, non smoking. We were given a smoking room with 2 doubles. We complained and were told..too bad/there is nothing they could do. After 50 minutes..and saying we would leave the hotel..they magically had a room..but no view. We took it. After talking to other couples...all the couples that did not have the same last name were treated the same. We meet 3 other couples by the pool with the same complaint..and they were stuck with the smoking rooms and double beds. WE have never had this happen in Hawaii. I would suggest if you are not married or you have different last names to absolutely avoid this hotel. We are prince perferred members...it is outrageous that the room you book is not the room you get.

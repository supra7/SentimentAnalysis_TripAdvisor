You enter the lobby to find the smell of cigarette smoke choking you. Throughout the lobby area the smell was terrible. The rest of the lobby and casino smelled of a mixture of disenfectant and perfume. You enter your room to find the carpet with burn holes and stains. I was put up in this place by the City of Las Vegas while working for them. How cheap can you be Vegas. $45.00 a night and you wonder if they clean the place. Kept checking the bedding for bed bugs it is that bad. Do Not Stay Here.

The hotel although well located by the river is older and sometimes smells like it. The rooms are nicely furnished with old pine furniture with a fireplace. We had a room on the river side but closer to the road and were awakened by the sound of the train all during the night. The train came by the hotel about 50 yards away so it was pretty noisy. Housekeeping were extremeluy loud first thing in the morning as well. Not to mention that although we had the river view we were also facing a river loading dock. The food at the bar and restaurant was very good. I would suggest to stay somewhere else ~

Great if you want to stay in the neighborhood Do you like to be pampered in a downtown hotel close to Union Square's shops and the cable cars? If yes, the Becks Motor Lodge is not your place. A motel with free parking in the Upper Market area is for those that like to mingle with the locals. Across the street from Peet's Coffee. Take the F line historic trolleys down market street. If you are a budget traveller who like basics only, you might like the Becks.

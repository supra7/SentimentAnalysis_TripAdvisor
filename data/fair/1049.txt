Stayed at Central Park Hotel for 4 nights in September. When I arrived, the staff were very welcoming and offered luggage storage (I arrived a bit before 2pm), however once I checked in and got up to my room (tough with my large suitcase and no working lift!) I was bitterly dissapointed. I had paid for an Annex room (supposed to be a lot better and in the newer building) but when I got there was given a standard room (and no refund!) which was very tiny. The laminated floorboards were lifting off the ground, the TV barely worked (and not the flat screen promised!) and the bathroom was just a cupboard which had been converted! I did have a long chat with the manager though, who also agreed that the hotel is not up to standards! Decided to check out a day early just because I was over staying at this joke of a hotel. Will not recommend it to anyone who goes to London.

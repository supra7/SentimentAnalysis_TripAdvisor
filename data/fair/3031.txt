We are currently staying at the hotel. We are SPG Gold, however it is not even acknowledged by the staff. Staff at check in are just plain rude. Told us they would call us when ourroo. Was ready. Never did. Our 'prrsonal' concierge keeps calling and leaving messages about gifts and personalized service. I have bben here before so I know what that means - timeshare pitch. Rooms are dated and tired. I will not stay here again.

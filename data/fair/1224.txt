On checking in, I went to my room hoping to nap a few hours as my flight was rearranged and I arrived 7 AM. Whenever anyone ran the shower or flushed the toilet in the room next door or across the hall, the pipes were very loud (enough to wake me). Add to that the stain on the carpeting that was gigantic...I would not be inclined to stay here again.

First let me tell you that the hotel isnt bad as such. The rooms are nice, the SPA is very nice and everything is still looking quite new. But when we decided to book the most expensive hotel on the strip which only offered "Suites", we were thinking of something else. The rooms are by no means "Suites" as they call them. I have stayed at the Palms and the Venetian before and both have bigger regular rooms than the "Suites" at the Encore. Also there is an air condition in the mirror on the side of the room which cannot be turned off. The main AC can be turned off but this one not. And I even heard voices through this one, and no, I am not mental. lol Also the windows dont seem to be very well isolated. You can hear traffic outside, although we were in the 25th floor. What was especially bad was, that while checking in we had to pay another extra $20 per day (the room was prepaid already) for services such as internet and free long distance calls. I think such amenities should be included in the most expensive resort on the strip. As for the SPA, as I already said it is very nice with several pools, showers, steam bath and sauna. But for $40 extra per day it better be. I have stayed in many 5 Stars resorts around the globe and most of them had one thing in common. They were special. In a good way. Encore is not special. Its not better than any of the other resorts I have been in Vegas. So I dont think the higher price is justified and therefore cannot recommend it. I would not stay here again for the price they are asking. Its just not worth it.

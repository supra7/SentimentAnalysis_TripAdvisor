We've stayed at the Beekman many times over the years and have always overlooked its air of shabbiness because we liked the size of the rooms and the genteel feel of the hotel; it's always reminded us of a big but unfancy New York apartment. But our three-night stay in room 11D has persuaded us to give up on the tired old Beekman after all these years. We've never seen hotel furniture in such bad condition, scratched and scraped and looking as if it was found in a thrift shop. (That's no exaggeration.) The Beekman's carpet has always been a little threadbare, but in this room it was ripped and stained and at least 10 years past replacement. The bathroom blinds were bent and twisted as if someone had tried to rip them down. And the bathroom itself was frightening -- a moldy shower curtain, a toilet seat that was the wrong shape for the toilet, and grunge everywhere we looked. While the front desk folks were fine, the housekeeping was hit and miss. (Why clean someplace that will still look dirty when you're done?) All this for nearly $300 a night. It's a shame. The Beekman is a wonderful building in a good location, but until the owner, the Luxe Group, invests in critically needed renovations we won't be going back. It's a shame.

Well where do I begin. We ordered two rooms and requested that they be side by side and with each bedroom containing 2 seperate beds. There was 4 of us and we all wanted our own bed. However, we showed up at the hotel and they not only seperated us but they had us on seperate floors. However, asked if they could switch us around but they said they could not. Therefore, we decided to check out the rooms and to deal with it. However, upon entering our rooms we immediatly saw that there was one double bed. Again, we requested two beds in the room. We were extremely upset by this and contacted the manager. He admitted there were empty rooms in the hotel but it was against their policy to move or upgrade rooms for free. He said if we wanted two double beds in each room we would have to pay the cancelation fee and the room upgrade fee. I will have to say the staff is very nice but their policy is bogus. I work in customer service and have been taught to accomodate the customer in any way possible. This means going above and beyond. However, this hotel decided not to. And our last complaint was the air conditioning. The room upstairs did not work at all. The room was very unfortable. The room downstairs did have working AC. Having said all of this, the hotel is in a great location right next to the Hancock tower. The beach is 5 minute walk, Michigan Ave is 3 min, and the pier is a 15 minutes walk. The cleaning ladies were great. Everyday the room was cleaned! I hope this is an isolated incident because as you can see, there are some great things about this hotel.

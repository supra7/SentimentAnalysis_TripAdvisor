My husband and I had dreamed of staying there someday, and we finally had the time and some extra money. We were there for a romantic weekend getaway, and we almost turned around and went back home after we checked in. It was a very disappointing, very dirty, very run-down, and very cramped room. The staff was cold and brusk (valet was great at least). It was on par with the Holiday Inn, except that it was 2 or 3 times the cost. We will never stay there again. On the plus side, we were motivated to go out and enjoy Boston.

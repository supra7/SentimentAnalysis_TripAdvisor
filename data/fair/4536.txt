My husband and I both took advantage of the spa services at this hotel. My friend recommended it although she did not have a totally good experience either. I got a standard 80 min. massage. The environment is clean and very peaceful. However,the massage itself was just OK. The room was too cold & bright, and there was WAY too much talking. I feel for the top price I paid, the service was disappointing. I also felt the 5 min. intro conversation and the last 5 min of "laying of the hands" shouldn't have played into my 80 min. Overall I think I actually got 65 min.

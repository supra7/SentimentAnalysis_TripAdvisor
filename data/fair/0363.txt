First, there are no bathtubs in the bathrooms. Their website says nothing about this and, at a rate near $300 a night, in the United States (ie, not Europe), in a hotel (ie, not hostel), I don't think it's too much to ask for a bathtub. When I called down to see if any rooms had tubs, I was told I would have to pay a $75 upgrade per night. When I said they didn't let people know there were no tubs, that tubs were standard in nicer, American hotels, and asked if we couldn't work something out, stating that if we couldn't I would not remain for the rest of my stay, the lady flat said "no," told me I'd be charged for my first night whether I stayed or not, and hung up. Later I went down to meet a friend in the lobby and overheard a desk clerk talking to the second desk clerk about how much she hated Christians and that all church people were hypocrites, rude, and all the same. I felt this kind of conversation was not one that an employee should be having publicly and even if there weren't the previous issues, speaking negatively and stereotypically any group of people --regardless of the group attacked--religion, race, whatever--is highly unprofessional. The lobby was far from empty and who knows what guests in the lobby believe. When a male worker entered, she did quickly change the subject, but she shouldn't have been making the comments to begin with and the second employee should have done more than stood there and listened to it. Very uncool. The rooms are also very small and the halls smell like a men's freshman dormitory.

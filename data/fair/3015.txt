Positives: The hotel and location are beautiful. Our housekeepter, Lori F, was OUTSTANDING. She and the consierge, Sheryl Johnson, made our trip worth it. Negatives: the clerk at the check in desk mistakening ran our credit card 3 times and refused to release 2 of the unnecessary credit holds - substantially putting a "hold" on any futher expenses during our stay. The food prices are outrageous. We were charged $50 for a small bowl of yogurt, small bowl of granola, small bowl of berries and regular coffee. A female member of the check in desk staff was extremely rude during our whole stay. For example, when we asked why our $408 deposit was not credited to our room account here response was, "I don't see that here. Get a bank statement and prove it!" Not very professional, especially after we proved that we did, in fact, pay the $408. We also had a rude staff member, Kay K., who canceled our first room reservation without notifying us. After a member of the hotel mangement corrected this, she said some very mean things about us to other staff members. Also not very professional.

If you read the other reviews; they are all true. Unfortunately I read the reviews too late so it would have been extremely difficult to change to another hotel in the area due to convention attendees. Well, lets see....15.00 more a night IF you want a view of the water. Don't they advertise this hotel as being on the water to draw more customers - and you have to PAY extra? Thats just nuts. I have a beautiful view of a roof and shipping containers (well, someone has to stay on that side of the hotel, I suppose). The internet cost of 13.00 a day IS ridiculous. They left me a half bottle of used shampoo in the bathroom - can you believe it? There are enough hotels in the area to find one that actually does cater and care about their customers - hopefully you will read this before you travel to San Diego - please choose another hotel.

We stayed at the Rex a couple of weeks ago, just back from our trip to the States. I always believe you get what you pay for but if that was true with the Rex we would have paid a lot less than we did. At first we thought the room wasn't too bad, a bit tired and shabby but the staff seemed friendly enough and the location wasn't bad. Problems started the first night when the room was very stuffy and the air-con controls didn't seem to be doing much. We've stayed in a few hotels with terrible air-con over the years so pretty much just accepted that this must just be another. However on our second night we got back to the hotel - this was a typically cold San Francisco summer night. We walk into the hotel and the place is like an over, when we get back to thye room it's even worse. A pretty uncomfortable night followed and I then went to reception to complain about the heat and the air-con not working. The reply? 'Oh your room doesn't have air-con'. It turns out the controls we'd been playing with were for the heater! This staggers me so I ask why not and I'm told that there's one room on every floor with no air-con so they gave it to us! As we paid up front with Expedia this just smacked of getting rid of the worst room to someone who's already paid. So we got moved and now had air-con but an absolutely tiny room. Funny thing is on our last night we came back to the room at night and suddenly the temperature was fine so they'd obviously had trouble with the heating too. It seems plenty of people have stayed here and had a great time and that's fine - but we didn't and our experience is all we know! My advice would be that there are plenty of hotels in this area just as handy location-wise and probably not as tired and uncomfortable as the Hotel Rex.

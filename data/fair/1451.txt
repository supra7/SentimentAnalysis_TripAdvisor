What the pictures show is actually the office. The rooms were a typical old style motel, nothing rustic or cool just a regular all in one complex with the doors outside and a window. Inside our suite it had a very musty smell, our first reaction was it stinks in here. There were hairs on the floor of the bathroom, in the drawers, and between the sheets. Dirt in corners, just rather unclean. But that's just housekeeping. Maybe that was a fluke. But the real issue is how outdated, dark, and dreary it was. The dark colors just added to the feeling of it being unclean. I guess this place is just really getting old. And when the air was on it blew the curtains so we could see people pulling up in their cars and walking to their room. We fixed it with some careful situating but not before one man waved in at us. The price needs to be lowered or the place updated to stay competitive.

I made a last minute reservation at Marrakech. I looked at their website and it appeared to be a small yet attractive hotel. Upon arrival I realized it was quite the opposite. There were other guest already complaining about rooms and were trying to get the rooms switched; however, the place was sold out that night. The rooms are extremely small even for NYC standard and they need major renovations. As others guests have mentioned, there are no elevators (families with kids and elderly should avoid staying here at all cost). The other issue is the hotel has central heating, hence at times your room would hotter than a sauna and the only way to deal with it is to either open the window or turn the AC on. I have stayed at several hotels in NYC and the stay at Marrakech was the most disappointing of all. I would highly recommend to spend a few extra dollars and stay somewhere else.

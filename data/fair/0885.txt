Don't get me wrong - this is a nice resort with beautiful rooms and lots of great activities. However, this resort could be anywhere - Las Vegas, Orlando... You name it. There wasn't even any beach front to make you think you were in Hawaii. If that's what you are going for, this place is for you. Us, we checked out early and went somewhere else. Note that the hotel staff was accommodating, but unprofessional in areas other than the front desk or housekeeping. "Just walk around and find a guy in a red shirt" was a response from the towel desk when we were trying to sign up for paddle board lessons. Make activity reservations in nearby Lahaina instead of the concierge. Ray at the concierge desk sold us 2 Hyatt Luau tickets for $98 a piece. We canceled before we left, but saw the same tickets going for 2 for $19 on the main drag by the banyan tree in Lahaina. Talk about a rip off! Good thing we lucked out and weren't taken this time. It really is just a shame because with all of the on-site amenities and nice rooms, this is a nice resort, but nothing makes it Maui. If you do go, be careful about your activity bookings.

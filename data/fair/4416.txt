Cute but not safe! This is a budget hotel and the room and bathrooms were clean and sufficient. However a window fell out of the room and it took two hours to get a response from the hotel staff to get something down about repairs.They said the housemaid would sit in the room to look after my gear, as I had already missed one appointment while I waited for maintainance staff. I returned to my room to pick up something I needed to find the maid gone, the room not secure and still not repairs being done.Eventually the window was repaired but still not lockable.. and this was not a neighbourhood where I wanted to stay without security.The issue of security left a bad taste, as I was aware this was a budget hotel and given that was delighted with everything else.If you dop stay here.... check that the windows do lock!

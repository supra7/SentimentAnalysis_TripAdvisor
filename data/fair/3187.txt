Our first night was in a nice room on the second floor overlooking the vineyard. It was actually tough to see the vines due to the fact that the shrubbery was overgrown. At 6:00 AM the next morning we were awaken to the realization that our room was directly above the Breakfast Room. There was no point in trying to go back to sleep. We asked to be moved. They moved us to another lovely room on the first floor, right on the vineyard with a nice view. Upon returning to our room that night after dinner we realized we were right below an outrageously loud and obnoxious party. After many calls to the front desk, at 2:00 AM we finally gave up. The front desk did nothing to correct or to remedy the problem. In addition to the noise from within, the hotel is located on highway 29 which is extremely busy and bordered by another busy sidestreet. Plenty of additional road noise. We had a King Vineyard View room which with tax was about $600 per night. For that, you can do alot better somewhere else in the Valley.

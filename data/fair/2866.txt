Not business traveler friendly. Rooms need major upgrades from the carpet to beds to the drapes...etc. My room was on the second floor and faced the side parking lot. People getting out of their cars could totally see in my room as I'm resting on my bed unless I close the drapes! There was a dingy smell but I think the hotel is just old and dirty. I would not go back.

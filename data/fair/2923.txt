We had reserved 3 rooms...ocean views. The ocean could be seen only after going out onto the balcony and turning our heads towards the ocean...otherwise it overlooked a dirt lot (construction area which the hotel overlooked to mention). The staff at the front desk and concierge could have cared less who was their customer. The bell and housekeeping crew were the only helpful bunch. Not worth the money...we ended up spending a lot more to upgrade all three rooms to oceanview prime...if we would have known that we would have stayed at a 5 star hotel, since we ended up spending just as much anyway. The beach was secluded...nice. We travel as a family a lot, and will definitely stay elsewhere next time.

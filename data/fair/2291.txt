When we got to the hotel, we were thoroughly disappointed to find the pool was out of service. The rudely clerk responded it was posted on the Hyatt website; I then told her I had booked through Expedia, and she said it was posted on their site also. It was not. The clerk then said we could swim at another hotel--a car ride away! We went to the other hotel to swim, only to find the pool heater there broken. I had asked if there would be any compensation at the Hyatt, like free breakfast, but they said no, that the ability to swim at the other hotel was the compensation. The bathroom was also in great need of repair. The walls are paper thin; we heard every sound from the very active couple next door. If you use the refrigerator, you must pay a $25 cleaning charge.

Royal Hawaiian NOT worh the price My husband and I visited Hawaii for two weeks in July and decided to stay at the Royal Hawaiian on our anniversary night. Let me start by saying that this hotel is definitely not worth the price you have to pay. We stayed in a tower room with an ocean front view. The room itself looked like an average hotel room just covered in pink (which I expected). Check-in took about 30 minutes. We told them during our booking that we were celebrating our 1-year anniversary night expecting a Happy Anniversary upon check-in or maybe even some fruit in our room upon arrival---well, I guess we expected too much. There was nothing complimentary at this hotel besides the small bread loaf that comes with every room. You have to pay $5 for the bottled water they put in your room and we didn't even get a chocolate on our pillow. For the price we paid (over $400 for one night) I expected at least a call checking in on us or in the very least free water. The beach was extremely crowded (as Waikiki is), the pool was very small and the hotel was nothing spectacular. I will most definitely not be staying there again. On the bright side though...the Mai Tai bar is great and the staff there were fantastic.

The hotel looks real sophisticated on the outside and lobby. The staff are good. The room was a good size but everytime the person above you flushes or uses the bath/shower it sounds like a sonic boom in your room. Waking up at 5 am instead of 7 was not fun!! For HHonors members there is no executive lounge and they give you a continental b'fast coupon that can double as $8 off a meal. Probably will not stay here again. I ate in the restaurant (Spencer's I think) the food was good but expensive and the restaurant was empty.

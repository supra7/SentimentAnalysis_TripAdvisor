No soap in room. Robe delivered when requested, still damp from the washer. Broken air conditioner, unattended to. Not enough front desk staff to attend to check-in. Elevators too few and too small to accommodate parties of six...even fewer with luggage. Charges on credit card that were unauthorized. When one considers all the choices in Chicago, this place, though well-located, is a bad bet.

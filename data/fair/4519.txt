Well I had an emergency in NYC and had to stay for one night in the city (Back in June 2011)...So I booked Holiday Inn Times Square because it's was closed to Port Authority... I arrived early to the hotel and as a frequent traveler I know that early check in is based upon availability and I noticed that It was busy that day, a lot of people checking out..so; I told the lady at the front desk ( I barely remember her name..but it was something like Oksana or something like that) and I told her.."I know that I'm early and I would like to pre-check in my reservation"..and she told me that I couldn't do that..So, this sounded so weird for me because most of the hotel do this...and I told the lady " Well it will be easier for YOU and me if you take my info, swipe my credit card, do the paperwork and rush my room..I will leave my bags with you..will go out for a walk and come back later just to pick up the keys"..She gave me the EVIL look and pulled my credit card out of my hands and did what I asked to do it..she looked bothered..OK..So I came back around 5PM and everything was ready... The Room was so tiny that I can spread my legs and touch the chest that they have as a closet.. Anyway..after spend the night I went down to check out and I asked for a copy of my bill; well the agent at the desk( don't remember his name) told me that He won't be able to give me a copy of my bill because I made the reservation through third party company ( Priceline or Hotwire)..???...what the hell .. told him that's it's FALSE because I booked directly with the Hotel and I choose Advance Purchase Rate which means that you reserve the lower rate and paid in advance.. after this he gave me the copy of the bill... About Restaurant I did not see any thing that looks like restaurant... The Area is not kind of safe at Night..there are some bars in the corner and when it's gets busy you can see all this party people hanging out in the street...

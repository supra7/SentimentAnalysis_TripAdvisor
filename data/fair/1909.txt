Booked two nights for Girls Weekend based off online description of a "luxury" boutique hotel and rate of $112 a night. To make a long story short, room was clean but unusually tiny with a tv from the 80s, laptop size desk, and cute but tiny bathroom with no counter space and a hidden toilet paper roll holder (I dare you to try and find it). Tried to leave as soon as we saw room (BTW, some floors are smoking like the first one they tried to put us in so ask) but manager Mark refused to override cancellation policy (we did cancel our second night) and after asking for a blanket for our bed (you'd think it would be included), we spent the night and checked out the next morning. Check out was sneaky- they upped our price per night to $169 and tried to charge us for 2 days of valet for a 14 hour stay. Alexandra fixed it for us but only after being on the phone for 10 minutes getting directions and permission from someone in hotel. The couple behind us were checking out early too for same reason.

I stayed here for one night, and my experience wasn't great. As is usual with a lot of hotels, the public areas were nicer than the rooms, which in my view were not up to the usual Hilton standard. I checked in at around 12 midday, 4 hours early. I was told that they didnt have any regular rooms available until 4pm but that I could upgrade to an oceanfront room for $40. I guess they make sure they get these rooms ready first exactly so they can pull the upgrade stunt. Anyhow I was too tired to hang around until 4pm so took the offer. The view was nice, but I suppose being an oceanfront room the windows are difficult to keep clean and clear. They were dirty. The room was just ok, like other reviewers I found that not everything worked as it should - I just about had to punch the tv remote to get it to work - a couple of lamps didnt work, no hairdryer (though they did bring me one when I asked) etc. The tv started buzzing very loudly after 30 mins or so, but I let all this ride as I was only there for one night, slept for much of the day and then was out in the evening. The only saving grace for me (and the reason I chose the hotel) is it's proximity to the Bandshell - the outdoor concert venue that I was in town for, to see Blake Shelton who was great by the way! Overall I thought the hotel was overpriced for the standard, and I wont be going back

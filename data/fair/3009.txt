I made a reservation at this hotel via an agent and requested a king size bed with mountain view. My flight was delayed and checked in around 8 PM, When I check in I got double beds with parking view. The staff at the front desk said, "Starwood members can get their fovorable rooms but not from travel agency." Sounds like they treated us like not real guests. This was the original bait and switch, I say this because the answer sounded way too rehearsed. When I asked whty they don't let the agents know that to make sure the customer know that request will not be honored, I couldn't get a clear answer becuase one was not rehearsed. Also, an elavator was not woking in the morning. It was busy time for breakfast. Hotel staff should let customers know about a trouble with the elevator at least. NIce garden and pool, but a guest room ( probably worst room we got) was dusty and really small. I don'y think this room is worthy I would not come back this hotel again.

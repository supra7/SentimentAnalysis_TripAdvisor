After reading other reviews of the Hotel Villa Convento, I looked forward to our stay with much anticipation. The location was great and the price was right, so what could be so wrong? Our room was filthy! The floor in the sink area had a thick accumulation of dust and hair in the corners and the white light fixture over the sink was so caked with dust and dirt, the color was dark gray. In addition, the walls were filthy and stained, badly in need of a fresh coat of paint. Finally, to top it all off, the stench of stale cigarettes was so overwhelming, I got sick to my stomach. (Did I mention the flower pot FULL of cigarette butts just outside our door???) Our bedspread had several rips, as well, and the lamp shades were also caked with dust. I could go on... When I politely pointed this all out to the gal at the front desk, she said I would have to speak with the manager about the light fixture. What??? I tactfully mentioned the only thing needed was a wet rag treatment by the cleaning staff. She acted like I was asking for something unreasonable! So, when the light fixture was still filthy after they "cleaned" the room, I took one of their towels and cleaned it myself. (It only took ten second!) The bottom line is there appeared to be no pride of ownership. The common areas were dirty, too, so perhaps this hotel has gone down hill since the previous reviews were written. Advice: If you have dust allergies like I do, don't stay at this hotel; especially in room 105. Everything was dusty: the floor, lights, baseboards, lamps and lampshades, ETC.

It's been a few months but if I remember rightly we got room 126. It's at the very back corner of the hotel complex, on the ground floor. It was damp and dingy. My travel partner may have got bed bugs. We stayed there for 2 nights in this room and then insisted on being changed to another room. We got a balcony room on the first floor which was lovely. Should have asked for a change of room immedoately so be sure to do the same. As for breakfast, typical US style breakfast - cheap orange juice, bland croisants.

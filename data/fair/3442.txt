This hotel made an okay first impression with me - the lobby looks okay. Unfortunately our room smelt stale and lived-in, it seriously needed airing. We kept the window open whenever we went out to just get some fresh air in. Luckily there was an air-conditioner in the room that we could use when we came back; very hot weather. the corridor always stuck of cigarette smoke; it was obvious the somebody (either a hotel guest or one of their "permanent guests" was smoking inside, despite their smoke-free policy. (This may not bother others so much; I personally can't stand the smell of cigarette smoke). The first thing I did when I went in was check out the bed linen and towels which were snowy white - if not, I would have left. We basically walked in off the street out of desperation as we could not get to the hotel we had booked. There was a sink in the room which was also clean, there were two shared bathrooms for the entire floor, also clean. There was also a kitchen on our floor where we were able to keep food in the refrigerator. I called the desk for and iron and was told they didn't have one, but was informed of the whereabouts of the nearest drycleaner. I have stayed in cheap hotels before and have always had access to an iron. During the night, we could hear a LOT of noise in the hotel, also there was a lot of light let into the room around the door which was opposite the bed. A continental breakfast was included in the price, but unfortunately, if you're like me and don't have much of a sweet tooth, your only option is buttered or plain toast and coffee. Other options were jam, two types of juice and pastries. The good points about this hotel for me were that it looked clean, had an air-conditioner and free internet access in the lobby. However, the smell of the place was just disgusting and I would not stay there again.

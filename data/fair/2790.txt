We stayed there for a week. The room was average, however the AC was not working properly, called the tech he said nothing is wrong with it, so had to use the ceiling fan most of time. There was a sewage like smell so we couldnt leave the balcony door opened. We couldn't get any food after 11pm. They had a number of small pools, but really no swimming pool you couldnt do any swimming. The adult pool was more like walking around in a kids pool. Pools were dirty most of the time. Resort walkways were very narrow and slippery with little access and no clear directions to different areas of the resort. If you are a handicapped in a wheelchair, dont even think of going to the Grand Wailea; not sure if youll be able to get around. There were no ramps that I saw, in the lobby area, next to the stairs or near the access to pool area. There were really no shaded areas that you could sit in. If you needed a covered area around the adult pool you had to reserve a cabana >$70/day. The only place they provided umbrellas was on the beach. Overall the location is nice, the Lifeguards very unobservant; I saw many of them on numerous occasions texting or on their phones. Water elevator guard sat at least 20 of us, he didnt say one word, no directions, or what to expect. My wife had no place, she sat on my lap and I saw one lady slip on the step and hurt her knee. There was a non-visible deep step, because it was covered with water and the bottom is dark. Very unsafe especially for kids could easily fall backwards and get trapped in between the float and the wall. Food was very pricy and quality was very average, even below average in some resort restaurants. I was really looking forward to going to the Grand Wailea, especially after I viewed their website and saw some pictures; however, my experience was very poor due to the above noted.

We chose Petite Auberge based on the reviews. Those who reviewed the hotel before must not have stayed in Room 22. The room was very small, with the bathroom the size of a cruise ship bathroom. The view was that of an ugly brick building across a small courtyard. When we first checked in, I asked if we could be moved since the room was next to the elevator and stairs, and within 20 feet of the lobby door. I was told the hotel was fully booked. As suspected, we were kept awake most of the night with the sound of the banging front door and elevator. This is not something they are unaware of since they supply you with a white noise machine in the room. Even at full volume, it could not drown out the sound of guests coming and going. If we had paid $59 a night, this might have been acceptable, but we expected better given the room cost and reviews. We will stay away from this hotel and it's sister hotel The Swan since they appear to be under the same management. If the hotel management reads this -- do your guests a favor and make room 22 a storage space!

I've stayed here a couple of times and have been impressed - until out most recent stay in March 2009. The positives- fantastic location, beautiful lobby - good for meeting up with people before going out and small but stylish rooms. The negatives - over the past year, they haven't really kept up the rooms - they're starting to look a little worn. The largest problem is that the air conditioning unit in our room was not maintained. (our condo had a similar problem and it's something that happens over time but absolutely needs to be addressed before it reaches this extent of neglect.) The problem : we couldn't regulate the temperature within the room and it was making the most horrible screeching/ grinding sound. I was absolutely unable to sleep the entire night (I'm a city dweller and used to a lot of noise - so this noise was exceptionally loud. I was somewhat frustrated and called the front desk because the noise was so loud. I could barely communicate with the person at the front desk because the noise was so loud. The person answering the phone was not at all helpful and told me that sometimes the ac makes sounds. (seriously? you don't say, but when we can hardly hear each other over the phone, there is a HUGE problem with the unit). I then made the front desk aware at checkout that the AC in ROOM 1540 is extremely loud an needs attention - the woman at the check out desk didn't even bother to fake concern. She offered me 1/10 of a free hotel stay if I earn enough points by continuing to stay with their hotels- no thanks!!! I then followed up the the GM by writing a nice, succinct email. I received his out of office and after 4 days have yet to receive ANY response. So, in conclusion - this hotel is like a bimbo - beautiful to look at, no substance and you won't get any sleep.

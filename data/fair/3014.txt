My husband and I stayed here for two days as the first part of our honeymoon. This stay was actually our wedding gift from my aunt, so we were obviously very excited. The first day we were there, after getting our fill of sunshine, we went back to our room hoping to nap and relax on the first full day of our honeymoon. After about 5 minutes being back in the room- this obnoxious drilling noise started. After waiting about a half hour for it to stop - we finally called down to the frot desk to complain. They told us not to worry - it would be over in an hour. This made me pretty angry, but we decided to go down to the bar and make the best of a bad situation. The next day was our last morning at the hotel. We went to breakfast and returned to our room hoping to relax a little before our checkout. And can you even believe it - about 10 minutes after being in the room- the same drilling started again. This lasted for over an hour. It was 9:30am; I am sure many guests were still trying to sleep. We decided to check out early because we no longer wanted to be here. Before we left, I wanted to speak to a manager. Apparently, because of other similar complaints, the manager couldn't see us for another three hours. We waited. When we finally spoke to the manager, she apolOgized and said that it was a shame we hadn't asked to switch rooms since there was apparently "plenty of vacancy." She offered no other sort of anything to make up for our horrid experience- she just sent us on our way. When staying in a room that's $500 a night - as a guest- you would expect to actually be able to spend time in that room when you would like to. ... Especially in a place like Maui that is renowned for romance and honeymoons. This hotel was the least accommodating hotel that I have ever stayed at. While I would love to go back to Maui, I will never go back to this hotel. (The Westin's timeshare resorts, on the other hand, are lovely.)

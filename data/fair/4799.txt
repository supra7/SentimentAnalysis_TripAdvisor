My boyfriend and I come into Boston a lot for hockey games, special occasions, etc., and often stay at the Millennium Bostonian Hotel. Typically we have a pretty good experience until this past weekend. Within five minutes of being in our room we noticed a really strong cigarette smoke smell in our bathroom. We called the front desk to complain and they said they would send someone up immediately to check it out. No one came in the next hour that we were there. When we came back later that night and complained yet again, they acted like it was the first they had heard of it and would "look into it." We stayed two nights and the issue was never addressed and in fact got worse. By the time we left, the whole room smelled like cigarette smoke. While checking out, we mentioned it again and yet again they acted surprised. They apologized but offered nothing to alleviate the situation - they could have even done as little as remove the $5 water charge from the room. But they literally did nothing. It will definitely be our last stay at the hotel.

Spent two nights here. In a very prime position next to the station. Very noisey the first night/morning bar opened until 5am so lots of noise with people going back to their rooms. Will add that the second night was very quiet. Room 122 was very basic mirror was missing from the wall, there was a leak from a pipe at the back of the toilet. Must say bed was comfortable though plenty of towels, but not impressed with the cleanliness, washbasin hadn't been cleaned after the first morning, cups weren't cleaned or replaced and teabags were not replemished. Will not go back when visiting London

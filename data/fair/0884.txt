Since we saved on our airfare we decided to live it up and choose to stay at the Hyatt. In our 10 years visiting Maui it was one of the worst hotel experiences ever. We had a cockroach experience within 2 minutes of entering the room. Then slow to no wifi was a big issue as my husband needed it for work. While the main oceanfront room area was nicely appointed - a zen feel- only one person fit on the small balcony. The bathroom was dark and tiny with holes in the doors. The "snack bar" took up an entire counter space in the bath/dressing area and you couldn't move it. This is definitely not Hyatt quality - I've stayed in nicer rooms at the Hampton Inn! Our daughter did enjoy the lava tube slide but we found the pool much too noisy, crowded and expensive. After 2 nights we were grateful that West Jet Vacations was able to check us into the new resort in Kaanapali. Making our worst accommodation the best ever.

I just completed a four-night stay at this hotel. In general, it presented good value for the money. The problem was room noise. And, it was not the expected room noise. Surprisingly, street noise was not the problem, unlike in many NYC hotels. I was on the 6th floor and really could not hear any street noise. BUT: The walls are like paper; any conversation in the next room could be heard in mine. When the phone next door rang, it sounded like it was ringing in my room. My neighbors kept odd hours. Neighbor conversations could be heard---loudly---at 5am and at 2am. So, while the hotel offers good value, if you draw a neighbor that keeps odd hours, be prepared to "join" every conversation in the neighboring room. I would not return for these reasons.

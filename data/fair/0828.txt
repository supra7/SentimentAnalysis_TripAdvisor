My sister and I stayed at the London Visitors Hotel at the beginning and end of an 11 day trip. Our first room was nice, good sized, clean. Then we travelled. When we returned to London our second room was just a bit bigger than a closet. Two twin beds were stagerred in the room and the you could barely turn around in the bathroom. We paid the same price for both rooms. The breakfast was disappointing, corn flakes, bad scones and hot cross buns. The coffee/tea and OJ were good.

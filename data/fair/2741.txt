I guess no one goes to Vegas to sleep, and The Fremont rooms will not help you find sleep, either. Our room was on the side facing the Fremont Street Experience - a loud light show that ran for about ten minutes at the top of the hour until midnight. Also, the doors were paper-thin so that when someone knocked on the door across the hall at 5 a.m. to wake up the occupants, it woke us up, too. Non-smoking rooms were all taken, and our room reeked of the smoke from the previous occupant. On the plus side, the bed and pillows were comfortable enough, and the hotel has a good location for the downtown casinos. The stay was very inexpensive. The breakfast buffet was pretty good but not great: cook-to-order omelettes, scrambled eggs, a few kinds of meat, fresh fruit, pastries.

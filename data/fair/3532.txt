OK, first the full disclosure, this stay was part of a Friends and Family arrangement thru a relative who works for Starwood. Let me sum it up this way, with friends like this, who needs enemies. We were given the "cozy room." That means it is tiny with a queen bed. When I made the reservation I said I needed a rollaway for a child. When we arrive, they said the room was TOO SMALL to accommodate the bed. We had to go to Bed, Bath and Beyond to buy an inflatable mattress for $99 plus tax. Strike One...I had called reservations, that could look up my room on their system when they reserved the roll-away for me that the front desk subsequently said was too big for the room. Their solution, extra sheets so the child could sleep on the floor. Wife and child complained about headaches while in the room and finally realized they were allergic to the down comforter. We went to the concierge to ask for a hypoallergenic replacement who called housekeeping. The latter reported that the hotel was booked and they didn't have any. A hotel without a single extra blanket. Amazing. Strike Two. Housekeeping did come up by the way, and sure enough, they had a new, in the package, synthetic comforter. Strike Three for communication again. Why two stars? Failure to communicate, frayed scratchy towels, and a room size appropriate for a turn of the century Lower East Side tenement. So much for the W experience they seem to have spent so much marketing money on, perhaps they should divert some of it from foo-foo soap and shampoo to training staff on listening skills. Will I stay at a W again? No. Starwood property, yes (great rewards program). I heart New York, but I don't heart this stay.

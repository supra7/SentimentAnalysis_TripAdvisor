Our family of five stayed for three nights. Overall we had a good time. But if you want a well run, genuinely nice hotel, keep looking. The photos and ads make this place look like a beautiful resort. Remember beauty is whats inside! Upon arrival they treat you like royalty, but once in, you are another number among...thousands. "Pool side" = 5th floor with a slight view of pool. Be prepared to wear plastic band for your entire trip because that is your ticket into the Oasis. Even though you are a "guest" of the hotel, you may not bring any food or beverage into the Oasis. This wouldn't be a big deal if they had options other than cheap fried food, wilted fruit or overpriced beverages. And how about something other than soda pop for the kids? Their "fresh pastries" in the lobby marketplace are Starbucks pastries. Whats up with laying claim to something that doesn't belong to you?! And how about clearing out the empty tubes from the lazy river so it doesn't get jammed every 50 yards? The real impressive service came when we needed a taxi with a booster to get back to the airport. Even though we rode to the hotel in a taxi with a booster, they were "unable" to find one in all of Phoenix. BUT, they have a Suburban for twice the amount that is ready to go anytime... REALLY?! We are perfectly capable of calling taxi companies on our own. But the lady I spoke with prior to our trip said to just call them and they can help us out...Poorly done Arizona Grand!

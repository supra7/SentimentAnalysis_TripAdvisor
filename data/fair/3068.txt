While we loved Maui and plan to return we will never return to the Westin Maui . The rooms are very small (we stayed in the Beach Tower) and the service left much to be desired. Our first night we ordered coffee and dessert from room service. after a few sips of my coffee I looked down to see three segmented insects swimming in my coffee. After a call to room service the hotel manager called to say that he had removed the coffee from our bill! One of our children had an upset stomach and threw up on the carpet. After repeated requests to have it cleaned or something to absorb the odor we gave up. A few other notes: Mold in the shower, dirty carpet in the rooms , and the pool is uncomfortably cold.

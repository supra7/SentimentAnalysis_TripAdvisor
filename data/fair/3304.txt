While at a conference in NO, stayed at JW Marriott for 5 days this past week. Quick note - had a great time in New Orleans! It has been several years since last visit and that won't happen again. The Good: The staff is mostly topnotch and customer oriented. Location - the hotel is on Canal, which is easy for getting around. Quick check-in and check-out. Room furnishings were nice and room was kept very clean. Housekeeping staff was excellent! Room service was quick, but food was average at best. The Bad: The rooms have paper thin walls. Called front desk several times at 3, 4, 5 am to complain about this as I had no chance to sleep. Heard parties in several rooms just walking down the halls 24/7. You'll hear doors opening (loud clunk noise) and closing all day/night. The concierge was always busy and wait time was 15 - 30 minutes. The Verdict: Would not stay here again for free. Thankfully the Sheraton was a 30 second walk for Starbucks and several better choices are within a couple of blocks here for next visit.

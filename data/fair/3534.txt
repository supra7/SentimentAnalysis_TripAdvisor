I decided to stray from my usual W (Union Square) on my last trip to NYC in order to experience a new neighborhood. The designer thought more of 'modern' than efficient, pleasant, or accessible. You need to get to the fifth floor in order to get to check-in. After check-in, you need to go through the bar area to get to your room. The first room I had smelled bad - another, lesser room was provided and was ok. The hotel car was 'booked' when I called to request an appt - but my daughter was able to walk up and ask the driver and suddenly there was an opening. Take my advice. If you have the $$ (or SPG points) to stay at the W in NY, pick the one in Union Square!

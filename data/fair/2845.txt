My husband and I wanted to spend our 20th wedding anniversary at the Grand...the grounds, lobby, fountains, and pools are truly magnificent and opulent! It is full of flora and fauna everywhere...truly beautiful. Upon check in we asked for an upgrade due to 20th anniversary but to no avail. Our room was on the 7th floor on side of building where we can hear road construction Mon to Fri as well as a pump station on the property. It is very loud when you are sitting on the balcony. The room is nothing special...it also had a musty smell and nothing was done to fix it after reporting it. The balcony was a little dirty (some ants) but the bathroom was great however it needs a face lift...it has had its wear and tear. It had an enclosed glass shower large enough to fit 2 or 3 people as well as a large jacuzzi tub for 2 people. Both showed its wear and tear so it's time for a new shower and tub. Air conditioning was good but it gave off a musty smell when it's on ; advd mgr of problem but nothing was done about it. The glass elevator and slides and pools were exceptional...truly a paradise for the kids. There were many kids and teenagers while we were there 10aug to 17aug. Many of the teens had terrible snooty attitudes and we found the guests at the hotel UNFRIENDLY...I guess they think they are better than others because they can afford MONEY...would we go again? for that type of money and its value....NO...if only the rooms were updated and kept up more , then it would be worth it....

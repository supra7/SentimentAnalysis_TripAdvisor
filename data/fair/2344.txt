We checked in 2/6/2012, 1st the heater was not working and the "charged & high-speed" WiFi was still charged and slow to no service. 2nd night, heater started to make loud noise at closed to midnight, 2 space heaters werec used to heat this 5-star hotel room, and WiFi still very slow to no signal. 3rd night, we finally switched to a different room to had a room finally have heat but the WiFi don't even work. They believed the problems were the setting on our laptop, iPhones, ipad, We finally met the manager (Patrick) only got an offer to use the computer station in this so called 5-star plaza hotel. Manager Patrick told us this paticular room, we actually were the 1st guests stay in , they don't know all the problems, (did I mentiom toilet won't flush properly also. ) All I can say is it is not worth to spend lots of money on this Fairmont copley plaza Boston, when it has no service. Totally disappointment , , , , , ,

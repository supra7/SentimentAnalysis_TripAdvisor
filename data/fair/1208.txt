Great location,a minutes walk from tube etc, But Shower was cold to lukewarm on both days,no loo roll in the toilets,tiny room and dodgy tv reception,lots of banging doors,and banging about,guests climbing the stairs to the bathrooms, noisey cleaning of rooms at 9 am ,hoovers etc. free wifi only worked when it felt like it. dont bother going to the basement for you re-heated micro breakfast. ok for a drunk one nighter,as thats the only way you would get any kip!

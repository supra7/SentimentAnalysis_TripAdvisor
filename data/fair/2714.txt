Have stayed here once before in November 2007 and returned in February 2012. Friendly service at the reception desk. Seemed to be given the option of whether to stay in the older bit or the new Cabana suite and happily went for the latter as it's newer. The building was new and modern (with a useful iPhone/iPod bedside recharger) although the light for the bathroom is inbuilt into the wall at a surprisingly low level so I couldn't find it at first! The bedroom was fairly small and painted a slightly ugly green colour which was odd I felt given the newness of the building. White is cleaner and better, guys! The bed was comfortable but, dear me, the noise from a nearby nightclub kept me awake on or off until about 4.30am (I was awake for the last song). Not just distant noise, but window tubthumping. So if you're given a choice at reception - choose NOT to go for the Cabana suite!!

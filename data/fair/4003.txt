Ridiculously overpriced Stayed at Hotel Clift 2 nights. First, i had a very good impression: the lobby and decoration are really great. Then i saw my room. Small, basic, dull, no equipement in particular. I had cookies from the minibar that were stale for over 4 months. My laundry cost me half of the purchase price of my clothes and turned out poorly ironed. Breakfast is expensive and as limited as a few croissants and fruit juice. I never could speak to the reception without queuing 10 minutes. All in all, go there for drinks, not for staying!

If they could rob you they would. When we checked in and inquired about a microwave for the room which the website implies is a complementary service we were told there would be one time of $25 charge. We passed. The next day I asked again and it was $5 delivery +7/day. The next day my wife asked and it became $5 + 8/day :-). This Complementary service is getting more expensive with each passing day. The room is decent size but cutting 3 square feet from an old ugly tile in the bathroom and replacing the small areas with marble does not constitute renovation. The chairs on the balcony are so dirty that I am afraid to sit on them.

We stayed for 3 nights and here is what I gathered (see noted below). One of the taxi drivers told me that this place used to be a hostel so you can guess what this motel is like. Pro: - The location is ok (upper west side) and it is very close to a subway station. - Next to a Starbucks - Walking distance to the central park - Walking distance to a few small grocery stores - Housekeeping service daily - Cheap taxi rides from Time Square to the hotel, roughly $12 to $14. - A small but working air condition unit - Relatively clean, but you can tell the housekeeping folks do miss a few spots (or it may be the stains, etc). Con: - Very thin wall, you can hear what is going on outside, downstairs, upstairs, next doors, etc. - No heater (will be an issue if stay during the winter time) - No remote for the TV - No closet space, there is a rack right next to the door that has a few hangers. - Don't expect the typical stuff you get from a hotel (room service, ironer, TV remote) - Small bathroom (a few minor things - shower doesn't work really hard - hard to adjust water temperatures, a few tiles in the shower were replaced ( you can totally tell, it's a different color), one of the bath towels provided was torn and has a hole in it) My conclusion - It's a motel, not a hotel. Don't expect much. Note: After tax, I paid roughly $270 a night for 3 nights.

We recently returned from the Westin. While we had a good time we were both feeling like we had bad colds and had slight trouble breathing everytime we were in the room for any length of time. We also noticed that the room smelled very musty. We kept asking housekeeping to spray because the smell was so bad. When we would leave the room we would start to feel better. We woke up each morning with bad headaches and my husbands eyes ran constantly. Neither one of us has allergies. When we went to another part of the island and in a different hotel all our symptoms dissapered. Our shower curtain also had quite a bit of mold on the bottom, which housekeeping did change. The rugs in our room were also very dirty. We were there when they were brand new and the color was not brown then! The staff was wonderful and the service was great, but there were kids everywhere screaming and yelling every time we turned around. We have decided never to return at this time of year again. We had heard that they have had a lot of problems with water leaks. With the way that we felt while there we are really wondering if there is a mold problem with the hotel.

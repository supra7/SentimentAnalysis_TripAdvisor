The resort was in an excellent location in Maui. The entire hotel had beautiful environment. However, the $25 per night resort fee plus tax was a rip off, which included internet only as WiFi connection, otherwise they charged $10 per 30 minutes to use their computers. The air conditioning in room was not functioning properly and had to be reset as it kept shutting down. There was a bee in the room and complained to woman in reception, she replied "this is tropical place and should be expected." The worst part about it was the parking, the spots were very close together and if you were out past 9 pm you were out of luck and your car was parked by valet parking behind the other cars in lot. Therefore, you have expense each time to tip valet attendants. The parking lot is too small for the number of guests as October is the low season!

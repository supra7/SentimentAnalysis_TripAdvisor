It is like one of those old family run European hotels with lots of old stuff, quaint decor, tiny rooms, etc.... but there is no family there. In fact, there was no staff of any kind most of the day. The desk clerk/manager left at 5 pm (the sign says the desk is staffed from 11am to 7 pm... go figure). So there was nobody to ask questions of. Finding the included parking was like a treasure hunt without a map, and parking is about a block away. I made my reservation for the Ocean Front Room with Economy Car deal. First, there are no ocean front rooms... you go out on your balcony, look right, and the ocean is a block away. Second, there was a screwup between the hotel and Dollar Rent A Car (and I may have done something wrong... there wasn't anybody to ask), so I ended up paying twice for my car... once to the hotel and once to Dollar. The person who answers the phone at customer service did not understand (or refused to understand) that there was any problem with that. The hotel is in the heart of Lahaina, a plus. But that means it is noisy until quite late. The rooms are very small, no closet, just two hooks on the wall. The double bed, a big pot plant, and a tall dresser take up most of the space in the room, not even a chair to sit on. The little deck was nice for two people to sit. The bathroom has a small shower, toilet, and small sink. It was clean though worn, and the bed was comfortable.

The Commander Hotel is a low end Hotel with a coat of paint on it. The beds in the room were the worst beds anyone in my family has ever slept on, and we go camping in tents! The entire box springs collapses on the sides when you sit on the edge of the bed. The air conditioning is in serious need of upgrading, it does not reach the bedroom area of the long narrow room. The decor would be quaint and reminiscent of a by gone era hote, except the era is gone and all that has been upgraded is the paint in the room. The hotel was not dirty, but it was only superficially clean. The pool looks lovely in the pictures, but in reality the water was not clear and has some type of oil pooling on the surface and we never saw the fountain in working order. The one lovely feature was a very nice outside bar/grill area with very pleasant staff. There is a sweet restaurant on the property but it is only open for breakfast and then shifting evening hours at the bar. Overall would say the Hotel is OK, but definately not worth the Boardwalk prices. My family has stayed in Ocean City every year for 20 years and this is one of the few Hotels I would say that we would not return to for the value on the dollar. (Although it does explain why we were able to book a partial week during a holiday week.)

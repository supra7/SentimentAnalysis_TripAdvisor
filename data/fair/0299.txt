We arrived there and the front desk people were great, friendly, and had all the information we needed. However, on the second floor, we checked out where the restaurant was and the odor we got on that floor simply made us make the decision that perhaps we wouldn't eat there. In our room, the bathroom wasn't fully cleaned, possibly because the hotel is older, and it's difficult to do???? The stairway there literally had mold on the walls, the same around the windows on the outside of the building. Also there was a wire hanging from the ceiling... what that was doing there, we weren't sure! The beds, great, were made and looked exactly as you see on the internet, but perhaps that is why that's all you see!! The location of the hotel is great for Seattle. It just needs a major make-over! Clean-up! Would we ever stay there again. No way!

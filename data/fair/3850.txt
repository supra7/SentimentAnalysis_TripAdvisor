Was expecting better based on the reviews. #1 complaint was street noise -- specifically, a nearby street singer with amp till 1 AM on a Wednesday nite. Complained to desk & was informed that San Diego has no municipal noise ordinance so calling the police would do nothing. Also, bed was small, coke machine in basement broken, crappy breakfast, roof under repair. Heard another woman complain that she was given a room near the elevator which was very noisey. In room kitchenette was nice as was convenience to the Gaslamp & Balboa park.

The westin trys to get you to do a timeshare presentation at every turn. Stay away from the conciere desk. They hard sell you and the spiel goes over the 90 minutes they say it takes. In addition, they promote this 50% off cetificate that is a complete joke. When you try to use it at westin hotels, the rate they give you is more then the web site rates. What a scam.

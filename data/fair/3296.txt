I had guaranteed reservations for a Deluxe Corner room. The desk clerk sent us to a standard handicapped room without telling us a thing. When we called the desk she said the hotel was overbooked and no deluxe rooms were available. She offered to put us up at a nearby hotel. After we indicated this was not acceptable, they magically found a deluxe room. We shared the floor with a college basketball team that was in town for a tournament (not the most quiet place for a peaceful night sleep). After we got home we received a revised bill with $19 of minibar charges even though the minibar was sealed when we arrived and we left it that way. I've been a Marriott customer for over 30 years and they won't see me at this property ever again.

I reserved my room and paid for it weeks in advance. However, when I arrived, my room had already been given away. I was told that if I wanted a non-smoking king room like I had requested, I would have to pay an extra $50 a day to get a room on a higher floor. With taxes and fees, that added up to an extra $168 to my 3 day trip. I was told that my request for a non-smoking king was technically not a reservation but merely a "preference". That's right - a "preference" which can be simply dismissed. They even referred me to the fine print of my reservation confirmation. That's right! The Encore will not actually reserve the room you requested - even if you pre-pay for it weeks in advance. And I got no apology for this. In fact, they actually seemed to be a little annoyed that I would even question their "reservation" policy. And since we showed up on a weekday and the hotel appeared to be far from full, I suspect this might have been their plan all along. My recommendation - if you want a five star room in a nice hotel, there are several other five star hotels in on the strip - many for significantly less money and a better variety of restaurants and shops. I woudn't trust the Wynn or the Encore with a reservation again.

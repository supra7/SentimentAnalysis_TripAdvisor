Hotel rooms look absolutely nothing like they do on the Marrakech website. Rooms are tiny with cheap or non working amenities. We stayed there just before Christmas for a week, the heating could not get regulated; to cool the room down you are forced to use the Aircon (which didn't work in our room). There is no coffeemker, no Massage shower head, no Individual climate control...the WI FI was not working properly in the hotel room. No use of the Flat-screen TV, if there is not one free to air channel! The reception staff weren't very helpful. After all, for the price we have paid we could have stayed in a more central location, in a room which at least would allow you to turn around in!!!

I have stayed at a few Westin's and this one is not comparable. The rooms are so small, not at all enough room for 2 adults and 2 kids. The food and drinks are so over priced it forces you to eat elsewhere which is a pain. On the plus side, we didn't have any problems getting chairs by the pool at any time. The service is really good too.

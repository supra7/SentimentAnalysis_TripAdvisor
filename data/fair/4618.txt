just good location only,no good service,no attention, no care We arrived at the Waikiki Beachcomber Hotel last month (july-05) for our honey moon.We booked it through Hotwire. We asked for a room with oceen view.The customer service told us that there is nothing available for that day but if something comes up during the following days they will inform us.I told them that we are here for 4-5 days and if any day is available, we would appreciate that.But we got no call on that nor anyone informed us. Then there is no iron in the rooms.You have to call them,wait for your number and then after few hours it would be available to you.And they come back within an hr to take it back.So be sure to bring your own iron in the hotel.The next day ,the girl in housekeeping department was so rude that she said directly that its not available,call us back...when ?? she had no idea.Also the hairdryer does not work. To clean the rooms,the Maid knocks each and every door in the morning.Be sure to lock your door from inside because if you are sleeping and you don't answer , they will come right in.They have no record of which guest is staying or which is gone.Thus another option is to put do not sisturb' sign outside the door. so except for the location nothing is good about it.....

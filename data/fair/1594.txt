For a 4* hotel I was very disappointed with the room. It should be a 2* hotel! The rooms were small and the interior was horrible. It was very dark and cold. I was so disappointed with the room that I asked the hotel manager if I could be moved to a different room. I also thought they would compliment me because it was my birthday, but they said that all the rooms were the same. I could not believe it. I was upset because I thought the layout of the room would be similar to the one in Birmingham. Nonetheless, the only thing I liked about the hotel was some of the staff. The service was swift, they were happy and helpful. Particularly the breakfast staff and cleaners.

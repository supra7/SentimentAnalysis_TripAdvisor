I travel to Dubai kinda often. I always stay in hotels from the same category of the HI Express, which means, 2-3 stars, all the same price in average. This time I chose HI Express Safa once I'm a gold member of IC Hotels Group, I'd earn points, so OK, I decided staying there. I arrived at 3PM. There were no rooms available, I had to wait until almost 5PM to get a room, which was not really cleaned (dirty carpets). There were many other people seated waiting cleaned rooms as well. The excuse I received from staff is that "the other people took much longer to leave the rooms". Well, this is their problem to push late people to get out of the rooms isn't it? Breakfast was poor as well, the basic of the basic (OK, I know this is not a 5 star hotel, but as I said, other 2 stars hotels from Dubai offers much more for the same price). Apart from that, staff from restaurant are really slow, either to clean tables or replace food. I had to wait to seat, everybody had to wait 20 minutes to have some food replaced in Breakfast, in a huge line. Staff from reception did what they could to be nice, but the hotel would need much more employees. Internet was really slow, wifi only downstairs. I would not stay there again.

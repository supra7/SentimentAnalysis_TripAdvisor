I booked a last minute Business trip to new York last week, and due to the Marathon, was limited on availability in most hotels. I read about the bed bug issues so called the hotel direct to stress my concerns and they ensured I had a room that was clean. (As they are aware of the rooms that have problems) Room 42 is fine, clean and comfy with a good bathroom.only has one room next to it so no problems on the noise front. It is also on the second floor so easy access. The staff on the desk changed almost every day while I was there some were helpful, however some just looked like they didn't want to be there. The bar is actually cozy when it is open. It states that on Sunday it closes at 11.30, however at 9pm the barman had gone home. I wanted a soft drink and was recommended by staff to have a glass of water from the taps in the bathroom. If I was going back to New York I would stay again if; I could not find a better option at a similar price and I was using it purely for a place to sleep. At the end of the day if pay 5 star prices you expect a 5 star service, if you book a 2 Star hotel, expect 2 star service.

Arrived in the hotel late midnight after a trouble getting into for a metro ride that operates only until 10pm (MA1). We were attended with the night security guard alone. Not English speaker but fair enough to deal about. Room were reserved but shocked to find out that the the shower room covered with clear glass alone and has no door is separated from the toilet there is no shower curtain even. The repair and renovation is going on. Housekeeping is fantastic but the total furnish of the building itself is surprisingly at low costs. This is a typical place for bread and breakfast and not to call a hotel. I understand there were only a few rooms available for guest as the sittings for breakfast which was served only with ham and bread with coffee has only 7 small tables. The receptionist in the day time are fine and friendly but cannot speak English and hard to communicate needless to say. The place is 4 blocks away from the St. Peter's Basilica and Vatican Museum. Though it is an ideal stay to consider but the accommodation is rated LOW to me. I do not recommend staying in this hotel if there are other choices to take nearby ST. Peter. The Hotel is hard to find and there is almost at the back part of the area. Too dangerous for a walk at night.

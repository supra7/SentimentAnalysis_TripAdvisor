Stayed overnight on business. Got in very late. No one to greeted me. At 1am the staff seemed too busy to be bothered. Only one person at the front desk for checking in and got caught behind 3 people who were making some complicated transaction. Didn't have the king bed I had reserved and left me with two twins. They comped a banana and yogurt for breakfast for my troubles. ....nice. I had a "Wonderful" room. It was a room. Wonderful? Not so much. Small. Clock didn't work. iPod charger didn't work. Breakfast made me sick. For $300 a night honestly not even close to par. Had better service at Courtyards.

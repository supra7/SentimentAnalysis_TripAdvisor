The hotel is located right in the heart of Faneuil hall and Quincy market. We stayed there for the new year celebration. Great location. We used the valet parking but didn't take time to check the ticket which read - car retrieval can take 20 minutes. I wish they had verbally told us this and recommended that we call down earlier on the day of departure to make sure out car was ready. When it was check out time the valet service told us it would take 45 minutes because so many people were checking out. This should not be a surprise to them since it was CHECK OUT time. They should staff appropriately for that hour or two. Check in time was 3 but our rooms were not available until after 4. The rooms were clean and up to date with large flat screen TV's, bathroom amenities,...etc. The hotel feels very safe; after midnight hotel staff checks guest entering through main door. Breakfast is not included in the hotel room. Coffee is put out in the morning but swiftly taken away by late morning. Everyone was nice but service was not seamless.

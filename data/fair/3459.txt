Honestly it is not that bad overall but for the price you will freeze your butt off in this hotel. Our room on the 6th floor was in the 50s at night....when we called Leo at the front desk to mention our heater did not work and the thermostat did not control it and it was blowing cold air, he said the whole hotel was on central heat and the room thermostats were disconnected. The hallways were warm; room was freezing. Considered sleeping with door open. Get a upper floor room if you want to sleep; lounge is loud until all hours on 2nd floor. But the room was so cold it ruined the whole experience honestly. We had a "large" room, which was about 12x12. The bed took up most of it. Coke was $5 in the minibar, about average for such places. WiFi was $11 per device per 24 hour day (not per room, per device) Aside from the freezing cold (did I mention the COLD room?) the hotel is located perfectly. Bed was great. Just needed 50 blankets but otherwise great. LCD TV and Bose music player. Small safe in room.

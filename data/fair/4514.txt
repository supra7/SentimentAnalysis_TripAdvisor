Stayed here for 3 days in november 2009. We booked directly from the hotel website for a reasonable price including breakfast. I had stayed at the holiday inn chain before at Singapore and somehow expected a similar experience here. Check in was smooth. Our room was on the 6th floor. I had booked the most basic room ( my mistake!). The room was extremely small, with almost no space to move around. So small that it was hard for me to take a photograph of the entire room! The window faced Sheik Zayed Road and we had a nice view of the Burj Al Arab Hotel. The bathroom was clean and the shower was good. There was no iron/ironing board by default in this category of rooms and we had to request housekeeping to supply us with one. I would think that an iron would be one of the basic amenities available in any hotel of this class. The breakfast menu was similar on all 3 days that we ate there, barring changes in 1 or 2 dishes. We did not use the pool, but I peeped in to see how it was. The pool is situated on the terrace of the building and was really really small. That was the smallest pool I have ever seen and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who would want to use a pool during their vacations. The staff were friendly throughout the stay. I was given the wrong bill during checkout and had to point that out before the correct bill was given. In the end I believe I got what I paid for in Dubai. I suspect a slightly higher budget than normal would be required to get a better room. This Holiday Inn experience was nothing like that I had in Holiday Inn Singapore. I would expect some consistency from such a brand.

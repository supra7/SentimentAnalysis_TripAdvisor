Definitely tired ! We stayed at the Cartwright for two nights at the start of an extended vacation to the San Francisco area. The location of the hotel is quite good for doing most things without a car.However, the room was tiny, wiring was exposed, paint is chipping and the whole place looked to us like it needed to be closed for a few months and be renovated to bring it up to date.The continental buffet was a real downer for us - low quality - and so the second morning we went to Lori's Diner - highly recommeded - for a real breakfast.The staff are friendly and helpful.

was surprised to see how big is difference between what they are advertising on the web page and what you are getting in reality. Price 269 US$ and you getting room which is under renovations....staff seems to be tired with all those quests and they are looking to you as an enemy (if you have question). Vertigo sky lounge - you enter and wondering is it a cheap sport bar? more or less good location, but it is too expensive to pay only for it. I have photos, and I will add them later

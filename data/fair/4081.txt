We've stayed here before and have a recent trip coming up. I can't stand that they try and manipulate people with these empty offers that they email. They recently offered a "Free" night.. So, I decided to see if there was any value in it. Of course not...sure, you can get a free night...if, you're willing to pay MORE than what they offer if you weren't using the free night. So, if you want to take them up on the "free" night....go ahead, you'll pay more. We've stayed in Vegas often, primarily at Palazzo and Venetian. We've used different offers they've provided over the years and they've always been fair and legitimate. The fact that Encore/Wynn tries to scam people is reflected in the attitude of customer service. I've yet to post my experience about having a Wedding with Wynn and the manipulation, scam artists in the Wedding Salons and Catering is so pervasive it's amazing! They totally ruin the experience with the lack of value and the constant feeling of "gotcha" with another minimum or surcharge you were never told of in the beginning. We are so disappointed we selected Wynn/Encore that after this trip we'll never stay there again. Don't be fooled by their initial presentation....they want your deposit....after that...how they scam you will have you laughing at times that they actually try to charge you a surcharge for serving drinks in a venue that only serves drinks! That's one of many examples that will amaze those who've experienced this.

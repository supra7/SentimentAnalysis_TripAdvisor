I stayed here with part of a bachelorette party. Overall the hotel has decent facilities, but the service leaves something to be desired. Check in was at 3pm, I arrived at 4:00, and was told my room was not yet ready. At 4:30, the room was finally ready. The elevators require the guest keys to go up and down, and everyone seems to have trouble with them including the staff. And the pool did not open on time either. The guest services book in my room said it opened at 8am, at 8:30am I called to ask why it was still locked. I was told that it didn't open till 9am. At 9:15, when the pool still wasn't open, I went down to the front desk, and was told the lifeguard had not yet arrived, and they couldn't open the pool till then. It's 9:30 and I'm still in my room waiting. I understand these things happen, but I feel like it's a bit of a pattern here. I will say the rooms are nice, albeit small (but it's a boutique hotel in NY, so that's to be expected). And the lobby, and pool look nice. My only other complaint is that the hallways are pretty dimly lit. I probably wouldn't stay here again, unless the service changes, but it's a nice hotel in a decent location.

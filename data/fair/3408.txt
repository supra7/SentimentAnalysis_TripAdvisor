The room was probably larger than most in NYC and it was, most importantly, clean and convenient to things. The bellhops, maids, and receptionists were all extremely friendly. The only problem came with the manager, who tried to downgrade us, charge us more, and even kick us out on the street because she thought our reservation was incorrect. It wasn't, but even if it was, the way that she treated us, her guests, was horrendous--accusatory, rude, completely unprofessional. She called us every day to ask, in a very rude manner, why we were still in the room. It was unbelievable, really, that anyone in the hospitality business could get away with that behavior. We were there to run the marathon and she totally stressed us out. Who needs that before a race? Or any time?

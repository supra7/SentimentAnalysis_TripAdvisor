We booked this from the UK on the strength of it's reviews both here and in travel brochures and from friends who'd lived in Maui and said Kanaapali woud be too noisy. In retrospect I wish we'd stuck to the excellent Sheraton we'd had in both San Fransisco and Kauai and stayed further up the island. The Maui Prince is in "Golf City" and, despite the shuttle [latest back 9:30pm though] is very isolated and requires a $200/week car rental. Although they realised we were on our honeymoon and had specifically booked an ocean view [we were told there were no deluxe ocean views....although apparantly there were premium which we didn't get!] both rooms [the first stank of smoke] only glimpsed the ocean from one side. The whole hotel, while beautiful in a museum-type way, was very noisy with bell boys trundling their carts at all hours as well as being able to hear everything in the corridor [including lift bells] with both doors shut. We had a lovely holiday but I didn't feel the hotel lived up to it's reputation or price and, when we spoke to the manager, we were told it was an 80's hotel due for refurbishment so....be warned in the near future but it could be great when that's finished.

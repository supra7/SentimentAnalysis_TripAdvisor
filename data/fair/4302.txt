We last stayed in the Beekman two years ago. It was a bit run-down in places, but the room was good and clean and we had a fuss-free stay. We were very pleased to be returning, and were excited when we arrived. That feeling quickly evaporated. The room we were given was really shabby and tired. It's possible it hadn't been occupied in a while, and it hadn't been vacuumed properly. Worst of all, while in the kitchenette, I noticed that there were mouse droppings. I couldn't work out what I was more annoyed by - that there were mice in the first place, or the fact that they hadn't bothered to hide the fact by cleaning up the mess! Unfortunately, the hotel was full that night and we couldn't be moved. To the credit of the desk staff, they offered us gratis drinks in the bar at the top of the hotel and moved us the following day, to a room three floors below. The new room was clean and tidy - no mice droppings - but also looked like it had seen better days. The communal areas (apart from the brand new business centre) all needed a lick of paint and new carpets. In the past I've recommended this hotel, but I won't in future. This could be a great hotel: it's in a good location and it has very caring staff (especially desk staff and doormen), but at the moment it's totally letting itself down. I urge you, Affinia Hotels, spend some money on this place and sort it out.

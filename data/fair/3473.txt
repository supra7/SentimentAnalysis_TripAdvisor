very small rooms, ac did not work well, bathroom shower was moldy and tile was falling out. Shower leeked pretty bad. Soap dish falling off the wall. Bed spread was smelly . Tv didnt work well, had a hard time with the remote working. Toilet would stick on.The hotel was dark and seedy like an off strip vegas hotel. Staff was nice but could of been more helpful to plann tours. We did get a NY times paper one morning that was nice. The resteraunt was expensive and not that good. It has a night club in the hotel that has an unsavory element.

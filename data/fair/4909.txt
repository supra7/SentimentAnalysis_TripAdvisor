I'm surprised by the reviews here, because we were disappointed by this hotel. It exhibits neither Swiss efficiency nor American service. The decor of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated, looks like it hasn't been touched for years. The other big gripe was with the reception staff, who were rude. There was absolute chaos in the reception on the afternoon of new year's eve - it appeared the hotel was overbooked, and the place resembled a refugee camp. The only positive was the view from the room, which was stunning. But the location is a little isolated - not a massive deal, but it's a brisk 10 minute walk to anywhere in the city centre, and it can be very brisk in Chicago at this time of year. There are loads of good hotels in the city centre which offer bargain deals - go for one of those instead.

My husband, my father, my 18 month old daughter and I visited the Westin for 4 days. We felt pressured to go to their timeshare presentation and then found out that you would own at the Westin down the beach. We decided to go hear them out because we were looking for a timeshare on Maui. We let them know that we had to pick up my father in a few hours. Four hours later, while my daughter is screaming and my father is waiting for us, we tell them we will get back to them. They follow us out and the women asks me "Did I Waste my Time?" We finally just walked away. By the time we got back to our room, we had a message from our advisor asking what are decision was. We also later found out that the Westin does not own their land!!!

I was not at all happy with the Bayfront. The lobby is difficult, too spread out. It is like walking around an airport : ( I am diamond level with Hilton, and I opt for breakfast as my perk. I was given two Starbucks vouchers, one for a drink and one for a food item. To get to Starbucks, I had to go downstairs from the lobby, out the door and around the corner. When I stay at a hotel, I want to be pampered not sent downstairs, outside and around the corner. How cheap can Hilton get?! The staff was less than welcoming. The only thing the staff did with any consistency was stick their hands out for a tip.

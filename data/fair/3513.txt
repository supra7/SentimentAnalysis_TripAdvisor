Disappointed at the size of the room (Double Deluxe) which was booked for three people in total. One of our party dropped out at the last minute through illness. Had she come along it would have been a squash to get all three of us in the room. There was not enough hanging space and no draw storage in the room. Neither was there anywhere to store our suitacases which meant that not only did we have to live of our suitcases for 5 days we were tripping over them every time we moved round the room. The staff although they tried to appear to be helpful, they did not have any idea how to solve our problem or even if they understood why we were disappointed with the room. Apart from the size, the room was nicely decorated and was clean, though we had to chase housekeeping on two occasions to service our room. Great location for getting about, smack bang in the middle of Time Square and the hotel was pretty funky with quite a young client base. Would go there again purely for the location but don't try to get more than two people to a room no matter how good friends you are the "double beds" are not big enough for two people to sleep comfortably.

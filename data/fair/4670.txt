Unless you're looking to stay at a run down, overpriced, glorified day care, do NOT stay at the Sheraton Maui. The rooms are very worn down, the towels are just big rags (super thin), and the staff was less than accommodating while we trying to enjoy our honeymoon... No room upgrades were offered or available, no late checkout available, the list goes on. Overall, unless you get an amazing deal, I would look elsewhere to stay!

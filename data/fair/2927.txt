Very nice people and beach. Our room was not equipted with any a/c. It wasn't broken just not there. Too muggy. Glad we only stayed one night. Dogs on beach and just sand chairs that don't recline on the beach. The pool had lounge chairs. "Free" snorkel equiptment did not include fins or any sort of live preserver. Quite a hike to the parking lot as well. No elevators. Glad we were on the first floor with all that luggage.

Stayed at the Prince 2/12-2/22/07. Have stayed there 5 times prior. Have always enjoyed the peace & quiet of the resort, always felt the openess even when resort was full. The resort has restricted the area where guests can place lounges on the beach, resulting in a crowded feeling with lounges within a few feet of each other. Our shower ran from very cold to very hot without warning. As usual the staff was excellent & responded to all our requests,although the shower never really worked right. In the past we have never thought about staying anywhere other than the Prince - After last visit we will at least look at other options.

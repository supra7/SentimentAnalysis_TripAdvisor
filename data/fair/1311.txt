Am used to staying in five star properties, but needed something very close to Euston for a night. The Travelodge Euston is a standard Travelodge - clean and with a bed and ensuite bathroom, and that's about it! The 'hotel' is very expensive for what it is (lacking amenities etc.) and the rooms tiny, dark and not particularly comfortable. The bathroom is awful, with tiny shower that sprays water all over the floor. The TV is located at an odd angle, meaning one can't comfortably watch it in bed. The breakfast is served in the basement and is very poor quality/selection. I would recommend the Hilton Euston for a good value 4 star (which is not by any means perfect itself, but far better and not significantly more expensive!).

What can you say about an uber expensive hotel, in an uber expensive city with rooms smaller than my closet and yet they cannot be bothered to dust? Well, gross is one word that comes to mind. Gross and dirty. Take your money somewhere else because if you dare say anything negative about the "whatever, whenever" experience, they will question if you really stayed there. And don't bother trying to clean up for them because they will actually charge you for touching the mini-bar (when all you were trying to do was get the 1/2 inch thick dust sheet off the area). And do not bother to ask for assistance - ever, because they do not give it. They do not have enough staff to assist at the front desk. The lines were insane (and they do not have the standard SPG preferred guest line). The concierge virtually ignored people waiting for assistance... what hotel in NYC does not have the appropriate number of staff during the holidays. Don't think that you will get the adequate number of towels (even if you ask). Don't think that your keys will work. Don't try to link reservations with points and cash (that just confuses everything). I have stayed in several "W's" and I have stayed in other NYC hotels... this is not acceptable. Heck, I have stayed in better Best Westerns in the middle of nowhere that could show this place a thing or two. This hotel is horrible. Small dirty rooms. Rude staff. Horrible service. I will not be going back again, location be damned. You are better off in Times Square.

Booked with Pleasant Holidays as a package deal. My entire family went, total of 7 rooms. In three of the rooms roaches were spotted. The rooms need updated. Old curtains, bathroom floors need to be redone, and the wallpaper was peeling. The grounds were nice and open. The pool was not heated and in March it was a little to cold for the kids to swim in. No food services on site, but very close by. They do have a church on site, if you wanted to attend on Sunday. If asked to stay there again, I would have to say no. The bugs were the main issue for me, but I guess roaches can be a problem on the island due to humidity.

I stayed overnight in this hotel...Yes, lots of construction - First parking is terrible.. you have to valet $28 per day, plus tipping or self park $24. The parking just stunk~ I guess I just like to get my car myself etc. After the valet you have to take an elevator to the 2nd floor to the reception desk. I did find them pleasent. Also, Housekeeping was helpful. The bar did not have any Happy Hour & drinks were very $$. The room was nice. The bed, pillows, and sheets were very comfortable and I did sleep very well. I will say that there is lots of construction on the street and in the hotel. Trying to relax in your room before going out to dinner is impossible. After reading someone elses review about the construction I thought, "how bad could it be?" It is really, really bad. I am glad I only stayed 1-day. But, for business if you are up & out early and come back late, it wont bother you.

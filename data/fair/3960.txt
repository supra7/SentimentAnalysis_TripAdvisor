OK... but beware the outside noise on the weekends We stayed at the Andrews in Early Feb 07. As stated by previous reviewers- the Hotel is clean, well kept, and has an accomodating, helpful staff. The location is convenient, and the price is right.The complimentary breakfast was 'OK' , the coffee wasn't that great so we opted for the tea.... Best to go around the corner to Dotties True Blue Cafe for breakfast. Get there early to avoid the line. (Even with a line, it's worth the wait - terrific breakfast)As stated in previous reviews, the bathrooms are SMALL - I'm only 5'9, and I had to sit sideways on the toilet so my knees wouldn't hit the drain under the sink.... really.... I'm not kidding. These things were all tolerable in view of the price and location.However, we found that the noise outside from a group of young people in the parking lot on Friday and Sat nites was outrageous. Both nites starting at around 11:30pm the loud, obnoxious and sometimes vulgar conversation from outside could be plainly heard through our closed windows on the 4th floor, lasting until about 3am both nites.They even got together for a 'group scream' at midnight. We are seasoned travelers accustomed to typical big city noises at night. But this was way beyond the occasional drunk or the usual sirens, garbage trucks and street cleaners.Someone from the hotel or restaurant attempted to quiet them down, but they just regathered in about 20 mins and went back at it.So if you stay here, request a room on the 7th floor and hope it's cold out so the revelers don't gather, or - go someplace else.I know we won't be returning, due to the noise issue - too bad, as the hotel is a bargain.

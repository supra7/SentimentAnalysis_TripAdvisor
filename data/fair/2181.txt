The hotel is in a fantastic location in Boston, at the South West cornert of Boston Commons, and walking distance to Chinatown and even places like Fenway Park. Boston's a small city, so walking almost anywhere is possible. The building also houses a couple of restaurants. We tried Finale, which is an incredible dessert place. At first, the prices seemed a little high for dessert, but they were worth every cent. I wanted to go back every night. Apart from that, the hotel was a bit of a disappointment. We had problems with check-in, parking, room service and the lobby restaurant. At check-in, they said no rooms despite a reservation, and the manager had to be called. With parking, no valets were available, so we had to find a garage on our own near the hotel. For room service, they forgot a few items and delivered well past the promised time, and the lobby restaurant service was bad - a lack of waiters, and drinks took half an hour to arrive. The room was small and very subdued looking. Very clean and tidy, though. I've seen better furnishings in comfort inns. The in-room internet service didn't work and we were still charged for it. The view was into other people's hotel rooms, a few feet away.

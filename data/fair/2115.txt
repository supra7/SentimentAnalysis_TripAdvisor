This hotel is nice, clean and very well situated in the city. However, all that is completely ruined by the fact that the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything from neighboring rooms. I had the absolute worst 2 nights' sleep in my life there. The first night, I could hear my neighbor's TV as if it were taped to my head. The second night was a miserable reenactment of "Animal House" in which a group of young men drank, yelled, cursed, blasted TV, and threw furniture (maybe not, but it sure sounded like it) from 7:30-9PM, 11-11:45PM, and 2-4AM when they were back from partying. While the partying wasn't the hotel's fault, its lack of strong response to my complaints was egregious. I called security FIVE times and they only asked the guys to be quiet twice. The other times they ignored my requests. Security's two admonishments were so gentle that the partying continued to rage. Finally at 3:30, the guys were out in the hall yelling at a room service woman about their order when I opened my door and yelled at them for all I was worth. They actually shut up soon after that, no thanks to the hotel security. If getting a good night's sleep is important to you, don't stay here. I will never make this mistake again.

While I can appreciate the cost of decent hotels in Manhattan, the W on Lexington Ave is overpriced for what you get. Our room was small with no space to even put your luggage. The bathroom had no place to put your toiletries and you could practically change TV channels with your feet while lying in bed (although the HDTV was nice). On a more positive note, the hotel has a nice location and the lounge area in the lobby is very lively. In summary, for $500 a night, there are much better places to stay in Manhattan.

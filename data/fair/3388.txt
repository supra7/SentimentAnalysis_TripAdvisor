First of all, I would warn fellow travelers to take the reviews with a grain of salt, since guests at this hotel are requested to submit favorable reviews of the hotel to tripadvisor. (The hotel hands out hotel info sheets and the suggestion to submit a favorable review to trip advisor is included on the sheet.) So I feel there really is some bias here. If you JUST want a place to sleep for the night, this place fits the bill fine, but I found there were a lot of little things that bothered me. First, the room was tiny. Just enough room to walk around the bed and the desk. The bathroom was small too (had a shower stall, but no tub), but manageable for one person. The window faced a brick wall (literally a few inches away) and therefore got virtually no natural sunlight in the morning. Made it hard to wake up! The hallways outside the rooms were very narrow. There was an air conditioner in the room, and it went as cold as 64 degrees, but that was barely cold enough. It would have been nice to get it colder when I was working out. They provide shampoo, but not conditioner. Again, not a huge deal (it's easy enough to stop by Duane Reed), but when you realize this in the morning when getting up, it's not great.

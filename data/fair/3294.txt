When booking our stay at New Orleans, I thought a Marriott would be a safe choice. This hotel is extraordinarily overpriced for what it is: the rooms are worn & run down; the bed is at least 10 years old, you can feel the springs in your back; the wired internet which costs $14.99/24 hours only works on 1 side of the hotel and it is slower than dial-up speed; has no room service between 11pm-6am; the direct tv selection is poor & limited; concierge refers you to sketchy tour groups. Overall, NOLA was a massive disappointment for us. Soon as you get on the shuttle from the airport, you are taken through projects and people sleeping under overpasses - this sets the tone for your stay. There is rubbish in the street; constant smell of raw sewerage; sidewalks are shattered; can't walk around at night without feeling unsafe and almost every server, tour guide, information counter hates their job and hates tourists. Oh and had to request a fridge & extra pillows because they ignored my internet request for them. The only positive is the National WW2 Museum. This is excellent and the only reason to go to NOLA.

Not one of the best places I have stayed in Seattle that is for sure. I would say its good if you get a fantastic rate otherwise I would look elsewhere. We checked in late and turns out we were given the wrong room, which was much smaller and not renovated as nicely. We understand that often happens with hotels when you check in late. Next day we asked and said we were being transfered to another room right away. Housekeeping was still in there just finishing making it up which was fine. We transfered our belongings and left for the day. When we returned at about 8pm we found that our new key cards would not work. We went to front desk to inquire and there was no front desk person. The office was locked, the side door was wide open. There were people waiting to check in. We hunted everywhere for someone. Finally someone arrived after about 10 minutes. This is unacceptable. Even if he had to step away for an emergency he should have left a note. Almost every time we needed to deal with front desk either they were short staff or no one was there. There was another occaision we were down in the lobby and the desk person was no where to be found. the first room itself was terrible and very stuffy. the second room was much better, decorated nicer and more represenatiative of what we had booked but the beds in both rooms were not very comfortable and the air very stuffy. the pros: the location, the price if you get a great rate, the cons: service, the rooms

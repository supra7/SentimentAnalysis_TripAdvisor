Kind of a let-down for a Hilton... we rented two connecting rooms and were surprised to find a broken ironing board that would not stay up, a door knob falling off of the closet, a shower that had barely enough pressure to rinse, a toilet that constantly drained and filled, not to mention no coffee maker?? We have stayed in a lot of Hilton's and would not stay here again. A beautiful lobby and pleasant staff... just sub-standard room features.

The lobby is hopping with mingling people most hours, the decor is 1930's. I am a Sinatra fan and was happy to see Pictures of all the famous people who played at the Empire Room in the 1930's and on. At first glance my husband and I were very happy with our hotel pick until being woken up at 6:30AM in the morning after a prior busy day of sight seeing. We were woken up by a beeping sound that sounded like it was coming from our room. I thought maybe the alarm was on from the previous guests. After investigating this annoying beeping sound, we realized it was our neighbors alarm. Then we fell back asleep for about 2 minutes until he turned his TV on and it sounded like it was in our room. You could hear every word very clearly. I called down to the front desk and they said they would tell security. We decided to then ask if they had a room that was not next to anyone and they said they were full but they could move us. So at 6:30 Am on our vacation we packed up all of our belongings to switch rooms. We were sent a few floors up to an end unit, into a smaller king room. In this room you could hear every word of the family next to us. These were the thinnest walls of any hotel room we have ever stayed in and we are not hotel snobs, we have stayed in the best and the worst of rooms. When we come back to Chicago, we would rather stay some where else.

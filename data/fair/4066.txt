We found the rooms and general ambiance of the hotel to be everyting and more that we could have hoped for...during the day. The suites were spacious, luxurious and came with incredible floor to celing windows providing fantastic views of the city and mountains. The gym was one of the best equipped, in any of the hotels I've stayed at, and we never had a bad meal, although they could use a better coffee bar (Starbucks, Peets, etc.) somewhere inside of Encore. That being said, as soon as the music in their nightclub, XS, got started around 10pm, the bass was thumping throughout our room until 4am. And this was 18 floors up. We complained and the perception I got is that this is a fairly regular complaint. The staff moved us the following day to the other end of the building, and while the nightclub noise was dampened, we could still hear the bass. More distrssing, our 2nd room was above the site of the new Beach Club. While changing for dinner one evening, they crew was testing the sound, and despite now being on the 22nd floor, not only could we hear the music, it was loud enough to follow the lyrics. Personally, we are very leery at staying at this hotel again, and have provided some feedback to friends who knew we had stayed at Encore. My biggest complaint is not that the hotel has a nightclub on premises, if the line had been less than 2 hours, we might have gone in ourselves,rather that the hotel seems to be willing to prioritize noise in the rooms and resulting hotel guests discomfort over their desire to run a "Trendy" nightclub. Sad that a hotel/casino with this much potential, does not appear to be doing anything to permanently resolve the problem. I'll be back to the casino, but would not stay in the hotel itself unless a permanent solution has been reached ensuring quiet suites/rooms for hotel guests.

I was extremely disappointed in the service at the Westin. The bellmen and the front desk were very nice, but the staff at the retaurant and pool area were extremely rude. The pool area is not friendly to smaller children who can't swim because each area has a depth of 4 feet or more and there are no direct paths for people who are trying to navigate the pool area with stollers. The maid service was horrible. We would return to our room at 3:00 and the room was not made up and we had a baby that needed to nap, we requested that our room be made up in the morning and never once did they come at that time. We would have to call to have fresh towels brought up and to dump our trash. Also, every night and on 3 days during our visit twice a day, they had a hula show. It was nice the first few days we were there but, when you have small children trying to nap the loud bongos can get really annoying. I would say that the best part of this hotel is that it is close to Whaler's Village and on the beach so you can leave. It is probably a better hotel for adults only.

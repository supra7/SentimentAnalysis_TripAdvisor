We tried very hard to like the Lenox and parts of it we did like however in our view it had number of faults. Out of five nights there we had three relatively undisturbed nights sleep and one room change. We had an executive king with a fireplace. The fireplace was not being used but the extraction system or ventilation method meant that there was a very strong vacuum whistling through an ill fitting cover. A phone call to reception advised that there was maintenance going on two floors above and this would be finished at 11 pm. Not the case. The next day we were advised there had been a photo shoot and as they had lit a fire in the fireplace two floors above that was the noise and maintenance would fix it. Not the case. A room move one floor down with no fireplace. Three nights reasonable sleep. However fifth night discovered that there is some form of distribution warehouse at the rear of the hotel, bangs reversing beeps engine revving. Originally thought it was construction going on, but it had been dormant due to Labour day weekend. I would say that the receptionists at front desk were pleasant and on every occasion offered us a free breakfast at the slightest hint of trouble. An offer we did not take up as it falls flat at 11.30 at night or 3am when all you are trying to do is get a good nights sleep. So our advice. Get a room at the front. Check it out for fireplace noise. The staff are obviously really used to complaints and there are platitudes aplenty which will no doubt surface in any reply by the hotel. We did make our views known. For a free breakfast, make a complaint, it's the standard offer. We left pretty disgruntled as there are plenty of small points to irritate..like struggling through a door with two heavy suitcases with the two doormen happy to say 'have a great day' but amazingly not opening doors. Yes, flatters to deceive.

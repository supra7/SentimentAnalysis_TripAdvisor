Lots of cons for this property and very few pros. Cons: run down rooms; weak Internet connection; very long delays for room service; all kinds of construction going on; not centrally located; much better hotels for much less money (we paid about $150 and the Palomar, rated #2 by tripadvisor, was $110); noisy heater. Pros: bathroom was ok. Nice view (if you're willing to shell out an additional $30). If you've stayed in other Swissotels around the world, this property will disappoint you. Stay away.

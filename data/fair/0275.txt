So far the worst hotel my boyfriend and I have ever stayed despite all the mostly good reviews and the 4 stars we saw when we bought our Seattle vacation package. We came from a late evening flight and finally arrived at our hotel around 2am welcomed by $40-$50 parking rates, the smell of mildewy shower curtains, and pungent b.o. emanating from our sheets. We waited 20 min for housekeeping to arrive with clean sheets. Throughout the weekend however we kept smelling the odor off and on and we finally figured out it was coming from the comforter which was making everything else smell. The next morning I left a note for housekeeping to change the shower curtains. What they did instead was leave the new curtain and liner on our bed along with the rings... so we're supposed to hang them ourselves? We made another call and right away a man came by to hang the curtain for us. He explained there was a mis-communication and the curtains were laid there for someone else to hang but he/she never got the communication. To top it off I just discovered I was charged for a room when I checked my credit card account... which is funny considering I pre-paid everything more than a month ago.

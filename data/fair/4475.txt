Parking issues Parking was definitely an issue at this hotel. Street parking can be really difficult to find. One night we drove around for 45 minutes before finding a spot that was still many blocks away. We also were told before booking that there was a garage on the next block that was available for $10 per night. The garage is actually the parking lot for the neighboring hotel-- it's just a small lot, not a garage. They told us that they were too booked up at that time to offer parking to anyone but their own hotel's guests.

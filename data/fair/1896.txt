Overcharged on Checkout I had a confirmed rate of $61.75/night plus taxes. When checking out I was charged an additional $2.50 per night as an amenity charge. The manager explained it was a charge for the availability of a coffee pot and ironing board in the room. I nicely explained that I neither ordered or used the coffee pot or ironing board, but he would not remove the charge. My opinion is to seriously avoid places like this.

My boyfriend and I did a crazy amount of research before we went to Maui. This was the most expensive place we stayed. That being said, we were kind of disappointed. The Inn is lovely, like an old hotel in New Orleans, but our room was like a shoe box. No place for our bags, and the air conditioner was broken, it was either on full blast which dropped to 61 degrees, or not at all. Normally this wouldn't have been a problem, but our neighbors liked to smoke on their lanais, which in turn blew into our room's open windows... you get the idea. Plus, because you are right in the heart of Front St. you get the noise. We had no problem at night, but it was terrible in the morning. Jackhammers and trucks beeping, and not at 9 AM, this was before 7 AM! So because we had found so many cheap gems throughout Maui, this turned out to be an unnecessary "splurge". We probably wouldn't stay here again.

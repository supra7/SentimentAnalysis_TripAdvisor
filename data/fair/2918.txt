This could have been the perfect beach front hotel. My wife and I stayed at the Maui Prince for 5 nights in April 2005. We booked an oceanfront room at just over $500 per night including taxes. We were looking for peace and quiet, service and a great oceanfront location. We got 2 out of 3. While we were there, the hotel was changing the room locks. All day long the whine of the worker's drill could be heard. We did not spend a lot of time in the room during the day, but by the second day, this was very annoying. But even worse, twice while we were in our room *with* the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, the hotel staff knocked on our door because they wanted to change the lock. After it happened the first time, I complained to the assistant manager, but the next day, same thing. To me, this is unacceptable. The second time, the excuse was "you are the only room left to do on this floor". Apparently that trumps a Do Not Disturb! Well, you can see where management's priorities are. At $500 per night, this sort of work should not be scheduled when the room is rented to a guest. Not recommended.

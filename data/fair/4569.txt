On the verge of excellence -- comedy of errors We were booked in the RH two nights before our Princess Cruise to Tahiti. The hotel is pink pink pink,the lobby beautiful, but a tad too much like the Tower of Terror at Disney World.We were assigned room 121 at check in (no lei provided either).The room was nicely appointed but really humid -- there was a smell of mildew in the air.But because we were exhausted after our flight from NYC, we sucked it up.The next day, we decided to request a room change. The front desk said they would work on it at lunch.When we returned, their solution wasn't a room change as we requested, but they said the room was sprayed. Huh?I immediately requested a room change. After the obligatory Let me ask the manager we checked out room 405. What a difference! The AC work, no musty smell and there was sunlight!So I returned to the front desk -- but here's the catch. I was then assigned a trainee to change rooms. Another BIG HUH? This added 15 minutes to my room change request.Also, internet didnt work inroom 405, another bad problem.At $400 a night, these problems should never have happened.This property needs work, big time.

I paid $330 for one evening.The room was very small.The room had a wet bar and an 8 ounce soda was $6.I looked at the room service menu and a burger with fries was $47.I had been disturbed all evening by loud noise coming from the adjacent rooms.I had the do not disturb sign out and was awakened by the cleaning staff at 10 am even though check out was 1pm.The room had bottled water at $9 for 20 oz.WiFi wasn't working,I called front desk to ask why,they replied,we are working on the problem.They failed to inform me of their business center.I forgot my cell phone +charger in the room.I called the hotel after I got home and was told by the hotel staff they would check and return to my address.Two weeks later I called and asked about it.They replied,we are sorry sir but we didn't find it.I was pretty disappapointed in the staff and would never even think about staying there again even if it was FREE.

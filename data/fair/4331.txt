Some good points, but some terrible service I stayed at the Omni Berkshire in April this year, prior to boarding the Queen Mary 2 on it's transatlantic crossing to the UK.I chose the Omni Berkshire because of the reviews on this website, but in truth I felt more than a little let down. It seemed as though they were 'coasting' on their reputation, and didn't seem at all keen to make sure that guests actually had a good experience.I had 3 rooms booked for our party of 7. One of the rooms wasn't ready on arrival, and the staff were downright unhelpful even an hour later when it still wasn't ready, despite promises to the contrary.For our room, we had specified at booking that we needed 2 beds, as we had our small daughter with us. It took 3 requests to finally get a camp bed to the room, and it was so uncomfortable that I'm amazed she slept at all.Throughout the night I struggled to find the source of a persistant beeping, eventually finding that it was a fax machine tucked away in a cupboard. Very useful, I'm sure, if you're a business traveller, but as a tourist with jetlag I was less than amused.I will say that the baggage clerks were very good, and the concierge was very helpful, but they were very let down by the rest of the hotel staff. The hotel is very well located near to Central Park, which was lovely, but I wouldn't stay there again. I had spent an awful lot of money on 3 delux rooms - I expected better service for my money.

My wife and I stayed in a suite at this hotel last weekend. The property was not terrible, although the service was lacking to say the least. The major problem with the hotel is that the rooms are not secure. We had 3 envelopes containing cash, checks and important paperwork that mysteriously disappeared from our room. When we brought it to the staffs attention, they did not seem too concerned, nor did they try and offer us anything to make up for the loss. Had this happened at a quality hotel, they might have at least offered to comp our room... or something. All we got from the hotel was, "sorry". I would not recommend this hotel to anyone... unless they don't mind having their property stolen.

Spent a week at this resort. The rooms are nice, but most of the employees are not. The only good experience we had with service was the evening shift room service employees. They were timely and kind. Service at the restaurants was extremely slow, even if they only had a couple customers. Front desk employees were slow and acted as though you were just an annoyance. For such a "Grand" hotel, their service stinks. We went to the Four Season next door for dinner a few times and they had excellent service. Front desk employees were also very helpful. Perhaps Grand Wailea could take some lessons. Also, self parking was terrible and not cheap. Many times we had to drive around and around waiting for a spot. If you're going to charge a premium price, I expect to have a spot.

We were in Daytona Beach for a wedding. This hotel is relatively clean, but just worn out & tired. Old style bedding, basic cheap-style beds, stained tub & bathroom floor. Pool area passable, but unremarkable. Paint chipped off railing around pool terrace area. Service - mediocre. The quality of the hotel did not match the rate we paid.

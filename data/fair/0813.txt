We picked this resort for the gourmet food and beach and were disappointed by both. The food was not gourmet it was marginal and had little seasoning. The best was the place on the beach for breakfast plus it had the best atmosphere. Additionally the wine for gourmet was not. Although they said no reservations the first three nights we were there we hounded to make reservations for theme nights and the themes were disappointing. The beach was big but as we looked out to the beautiful ocean our view was of these huge sand bags about 100 yards out it looked like a bunch of beached whales and was very unpleasant. There was also a really bad sulphur smell each day. The rooms and service was excellent but did not make up the non-gourmet food and the disappointing beach. And there was construction going on which they did not tell our travel agent. We did not like going to the beach and hearing saws and hammers it was not relaxing. The grounds were beautiful but they need to limit the ongoing trimming, lawn cutting, etc again cuts into the calm and peacefulness.

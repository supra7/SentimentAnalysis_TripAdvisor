We stayed for 4 nights in July at the same time that 700 rooms(!!) were booked by teenagers attending a conference on religion. It was extremely noisy and we did not get a full night's rest on any of the 4 nights we were there. The hotel should decide what it wants to be - if it believes itself to be a 4 star hotel, it shouldn't be selling 700 rooms to hordes of teenagers who end up behaving like they are at a mega frat party. Or, they should close the hotel to other guests! Very disappointing stay, especially since there are so many other excellent accommodation options in Orlando!

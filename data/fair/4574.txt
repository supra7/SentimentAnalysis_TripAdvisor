Local Says, 'Choose something else' As locals, we rarely get a chance to stay in Waikiki and play tourists. I've always wanted to stay at the Pink Hotel because it is such as famous landmark.The grounds and public spaces are gorgeous and awe inspiring of the true old Hawaiian way. At first blush, everything looks great.Then you notice that it is not a true 5 star property. It is a solid 3 star property, because of the beach access, and grand public areas.It falls short of a 5 star hotel because thestaff will point to where you will go, not take you there. They act like they are important, but really can't make the decisions to make small adjustments. (For instance, I asked about a late check out time the day before, and was told to call in the morning. I got the feeling the reception desk just couldn't be bothered. My promised Coconut Grove room turned out to be over the motor court, or as the front desk corrected me, porte cochere. The second room they gave me was wedged in between the administrative offices and overlooked the landscaper maintenance area. Finally, after personally consulting the guest relations manager, I was given the promised Coconut grove room.The furnishings are a bit worn and shabby. Light bulbs are weak, small bathrooms, with no counter space. Tables and flatware are a bit dirty, staffs clothing is not crisp and clean (especially at the mai-tai bar  restaurant). And the overall look is that it needs a good facelift and cleaning.Save your money, stay at a different Starwood property and you can still enjoy this hotel. The room charges are interchangeable.Even better, go to the Halekalani for a true resort, first class experience.

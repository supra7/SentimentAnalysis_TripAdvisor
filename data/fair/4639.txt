Upon arrival we were given een upgrade for free. Booked and payed for standard garden view, but got superior garden view. on request we got the room on the first floor so we could walk into the garden from our room. If you book the standard garden view......it has no lanai/balcony. So we were very lucky to be upgraded for free. The staff was very helpfull and friendly. First time we walked into the room we were very surprised. The room was very big and clean. Clean towels and service every day. If you leave a good tip you also get coffee for the coffemaker. You can buy coffee at reception for 1 dollar so that's a good deal also. There is laundry fascility but it is in a rundown shack. $ 1,25 for washing. Detergent at reception for $1 Soon we discovered roaches outside. The terras has carpeting and they were under the carpets. A day later we discovered roaches inside the room. There were cracks in the floor so roaches had in and out privileges to our room. At that time you don't sleep that much anymore. The place could do with renovation. The property it self is fine. Nice pool, good temperature to cool down. Be sure to leave nothing of value in your room. Property is fenced but not guarded. There is an entrance from the streets straight into the back gardens. Checkout time is noon. If your flight is later they will accomodate you for free till 2 pm. You can still use fascilities for the remainder of the day. Free wifi in the lobby. In our room we had some signal just enough to have internet. Free complimetary internet check in and printing boardingpasses at the reception. If you want luxury go somewehere else. If you are on a low budget and if you're not afraid of bugs it's oke.

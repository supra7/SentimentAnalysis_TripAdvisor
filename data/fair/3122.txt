I booked three rooms and we were all assigned to the old tower. Without being advised beforehand, painting crews and drilling were right outside our Lanais rendering them useless during the day. I later found a note in our rooms which said "Please do not use your Lanai between 8 AM and 6 PM; we are keeping the Westin beautiful for your future stays. We apologize for the inconvenience." Do I really care about "our future stays?" I am a Starwood Gold member; only because of that did they move one of our three rooms to the "Beach Tower." You see....they had many groups and were sold out. Well, you do not do exterior painting during the high season; you simply close off a portion of the hotel and paint/repair in September-October. But painting crews charge more in low-season. The rooms in the old tower are ludicrously small and you cannot get maid-service it seems before 5PM, even if you call "service express." In the "Beach Tower," however, the rooms are cleaned early and even turned down. It seems like you must pay for an Ocean View to get "Heavenly Service" in Maui. The beds may be "Heavenly," but surely some of the mattresses haven't been changed in years. I have never experienced a more uncomfortable bed at a Westin. However, the Spa at the Westin is spectacular. Everyone in our group had an amazing treatment. Jon, the Spa concierge is a sweetie, and Kelly my masseuse was wonderful. I was surprised, however, that one of the spa assistants said that it would be "too difficult" to lower the temperature of the men's whirlpool. It must have been about 105 degrees. All in all, unless you are dying to stay at a water amusement park, the Westin is ridiculously overpriced, with almost no spirit of "Aloha." Save your money and stay at the "Aston Mahana," 1.5 miles north. Beautiful sunsets from every room and true Hawaiian spirit are to be found there. The Westin Maui has almost no relation to it's mainland namesakes.

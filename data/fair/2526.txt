I have just returned from a three day stay at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago and feel I have to comment on the poor organisation and service I received.I booked two rooms and opted for the romance package which included 3pm book in and champagne in your room on arrival. I arrived at the hotel at 3.15pm and was impressed with the hotel reception/foyer. On checking in i was informed that rooms werent ready and could I return after 4pm. I returned after 4pm and was allocated rooms then. Despite originally booking two rooms and expecting them to be close by, my friend and i were allocated rooms on different floors. To allocate rooms nearby on the same floor would have caused another delay. The expectation of a surprise for my wife of champagne in the room was quickly extinguished. NO CHAMPAGNE AND CLOTHES FROM THE PREVIOUS OCCUPIER STILL IN A PILE UNDER THE DESK. On contacting my friends they too complained that no champagne was in their room and that clothes from a previous guest were still hanging in their wardrobe. Complaints to the front desk resulted in the delivery of the ordered champagne three hours later. The next evening at 5pm I contacted house keeping for some tea and coffee sachets as none had been left in the room.THEY ARRIVED AT 10AM THE FOLLOWING DAY. Perhaps my expectations were too high when i booked this hotel but they were quickly dashed. Good location,large impersonal hotel,poor service and staff that did not really care when you complained. Needless to say I wont be using this hotel again.

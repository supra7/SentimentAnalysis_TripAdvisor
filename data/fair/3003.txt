My husband and I were in Maui for our 5 yr anniv. When we arrived we were told the only king avail was over the cafe so we compromised with a double for an amazing view. To say the least the room was filthy, we even requested for someone to come up and re-clean. We also had maid service everyday but they never cleaned thoroughly just "refreshed". Stains on the floor, sticky soda on the ceiling, bar, bathroom floor, etc. An accumulation of dust had formed on the door, as well as finger prints, water stains. The bathroom tub was dirty, the floors were disgusting and we wore our shoes the entire time. We did eventually complain to a manager who responded with thanks for your feedback and here's some points. On our last day we woke up to sheets covering the hallway to soak up blood from an incident over the night. They finally came to steam clean 8 hours later. There was also blood in the lobby that was still there when we checked out at 10am. The grounds were beautiful including the pools. The restaurants were great also. But we will not be returning to the Westin Resort on Maui anytime soon.

I won the Palmer House Hilton for a single nite during a Chicago visit. I bid $105 per nite for 4 star in Chicago Downtown. I got the Hilton Palmer House on Monroe for $105 plus feed/taxes per nite.. At checkin, they gave us (myself and GF) one double bed...which I know technically they can do (as that is all Priceline gaurantees)...good thing myself and my GF are not too big...this Hilton room had no view and room was smaller than Hotel Felix (where we stayed for 3 nites)...some wallpaper in room was peeling...bathroom ceiling was in primer...some rust on shower head...very old TV...bed pillows were bad....checkout was 11am...was not too impressed...was thinking how good Hotel Felix was compared to what Hilton gave us...though Palmer House does offer great location...Hotel Building itself is kinda neat..nice lobby...when at Hilton..it felt like we were on an assembly line...missed the personal touch of the Hotel Felix... ..opps, almost forgot...few other things about Palmer House Hilton...you have to pay for Internet Access and you have to pay for the fitness facility... Overall...not much to like...

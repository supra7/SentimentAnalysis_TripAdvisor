My wife used her Marriott points to stay at this place for a wedding. 1st problem - "non-smoking" room stank of cigarette smoke as did the hall. 2nd - I felt like I was in that movie "Coming to America" as I opened the blinds to look at of the window of the 12'x12' room and it was facing a brick wall. 3rd - when we asked to switch rooms because of the stink, the snot nosed pig at the front desk gave us a hard time. 4th - next morning, bill was under our door with a $900 room charge which had been paid for by points 5th - when we complained about this, again the snot nosed pig at the front desk gave us a hard time and never said "sorry" I would never stay here, my wife and I was easy-going as hell but this place just sucks. No doubt about it. She travels overnight for work at least once per month, I travel about once a quarter and we both this place is awful. The people working the front desk think they are part of some sort of elite hotel employ.

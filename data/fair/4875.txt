Under construction, no hot water Saturday or Sunday morning, and worst of all, the front desk was completely unconcerned. Also, be sure to check your bill because they did not charge us rates per our Priceline reservation. We had to stand in line over 15 minutes to speak to someone and then they made the change to our bill. Our room was clean and nice enough, but all in all, not a good hotel experience.

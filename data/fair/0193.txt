My wife and I stayed here for a random Saturday night out of the house getaway. Everything at the hotel was great when it comes down to amenities and cleaniness. The location of the property is not as great as some of the other dowtown hotels if you are looking to go out shopping or out to the bars at night. The east side of the building borders the I-5 so it could get noisy on some of the lower floors. Their roof top lounge also has a great Happy Hour menu and is a good place to just hang out, have a couple of drinks, and to watch Seattle from the top. That being said I would totally reccomend this hotel to other travelers until we checked out of this property. Right after we left downtown, my wife realized she forgot her hair conditioner that she just picked up at a salon the night before. She called the operator and was told that the room hasn't been cleaned yet and that they'll send a security guard up there to pick it up for us. Once we came back with in 30 minutes of the call I went up to the front desk to pick it up, the attendant seemed to know right away what I was talking about and flat out told me that the room has been cleaned and they had nothing for me.... I asked what would housekeeping do with a huge 1.25 L bottle of conditioner, that's hard to miss, he said he wouldn't know and he did not let me go upstairs and check out the room to see if maybe they missed it. He did not seem to care about my concern at all, and he caused me to have a bad "after taste" from staying here. I don't think we will ever consider staying here again, or even come up to the RView for drinks. I would hate to forget something of value here...

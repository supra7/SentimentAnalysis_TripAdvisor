We booked a Waterview room at this hotel for 2 nights...That in its self was a joke because both days a cruise ship was docked right in front of our window blocking any view...but I am getting ahead of myself...going to your room is a trip down long rather dingy and shabby hallways. Very depressing elevators..The rooms are done in a rustic theme which may have looked nice when first done, but now are just shabby looking...worn ragged slipcovers cover even worse furniture...just not what you expect from a 4 star property. They have made an attempt to upgrade the bathrooms, which would have been nice except for the mold in the shower. We went to the store and got cleaner for the shower...something you should not need to do for a 4 star room that was this expensive. The fireplace was a nice touch if the weather had warranted needing heat....One positive about the property is the restaurant...excellent food, ok service, and fantastic views....my recommendation is to stay elsewhere and come here for dinner....this is a 2 star property with 4 star prices.....

We chose this hotel because it was within our budget [$125 a night after tax]. It was our first time to Chicago. We stayed here 4 nights in a non-smoking double double room [no upgrade to a suite as one reviewer mentioned]. Next time, we will pay more for a better hotel. The overall experience was terrible to poor. We gave the hotel 2 stars only because of its location. We checked in around 11am. We were told our room was not ready because the hotel was full. That was not a problem for us. What annoyed us was when my husband handed over his passport for identification, the receptionist took a look at his visa to the US. What was she looking for? We felt this was uncalled for since the visa contains a lot of personal information. When we came back at 3pm to ask for our room keys, the same receptionist looked at us and then whispered something to another receptionist. What was she whispering about? The room is very basic. The bed is the biggest problem: the mattress is very lumpy and it does not provide support for your back. The pillow, as others have noted, is very thin. The wardrobe is without doors, the coffee maker is very old and the bathroom amenities are poor. The wall is paper thin. We could hear the conversation from the room next door and from the corridor. Housekeeping was a real issue. The housekeepers never once managed to replace all the things we used the 4 nights we stayed there. There were always fewer shampoos, cups and towels than what we began with. The final day was the worst. None of the towels we used were replaced. The day we checked out, the housekeepers knocked on the door at 8am! She wanted to know if we had checked out! The housekeeper was so eager to clean the room on the day we checked out but not while we were staying there. Next time we are in Chicago we'll stay in another hotel. This is one of the worst hotels we've stayed in. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

Sketchy A buddy and I did a road trip across the western united states and most of the nights we slept in the back of my van. When we got to San Francisco we realized that it wouldn't be safe to do that. We randomly stumbled on the Air Travel hotel (a fancy chinese food and hotel in one!). It wasn't much better than sleeping in the van. (Though it felt nice to have a shower)Pros: Secure underground parking in a sketchy area. Not a bad bed.Cons: Door connecting to other room was open. Really old and run down. Smelled funny. Terrible neighborhood. I would stay here again if the YMCA was full. But if I was planning a trip to SF again, I'd find somewhere else.

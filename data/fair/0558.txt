We booked a room at the Hotel Max for our Honeymoon. We were in Seattle for 6 days and had stayed at the Alexis for 3 nights previously. We saw the hotel Max website and thought it looked like a hip, trendy hotel. The lobby was very chic. When we got up to our room, however, our jaws dropped. The rooms at this hotel are impossibly miniscule. We are talking 100 square feet miniscule. We booked a queen room and there was the bed with about 1 foot on either side and about 1.5 feet to the tiny little desk. The shower was basically a shower stall in a closet and the washroom was the size of a restroom stall in a gas station. Now we are not huge complainers, but the room almost had us in tears. After a talk with the front desk, we were upgraded to a king room for free. which is about the best we have to say about the hotel. The king room was a corner room with a view of 2 buildings and a back alley. The windows had basically no sound deadening so the sounds of pedestrians, traffic, the ridiculously loud a/c units and garbage trucks kept us up pretty much all night. The staff were nice every time we had to deal with them. As well, the attached restaurant is very nice. The location is great. The parking is valet only and cost an extra $35 per night.

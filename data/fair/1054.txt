We were at this hotel three nights 4-7.12.2009. We made a reservation for three double rooms (for 6 persons) via Gala Hotels. When we arrived to the hotel, there was only two rooms for us instead of three! And we weren't only group who had problems with reservation! Hotel itself was very basic and location was good near the Finsbury park tube station. Because the reservation system is very unreliable, I wouldn't recommend this hotel.

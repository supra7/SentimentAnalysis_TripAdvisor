First the positives...staff was exceptionally friendly and positive, from the Club Room (breakfast and happy hours for people staying on the Club Floor) to the bell staff to the housekeeping staff. Great people. Management, not so much. So the toilet in our room (1435) kept running, we could live with that. The AC never got the humidity down, although in the next room (1436, a family member) the humidity was just fine. The killer? The Shriners were having a convention and their hospitality suite was directly across the hall from us! The are an incredibly self-absorbed and insensitive group of middle-aged frat boy partiers well into the wee hours (around 1:30AM) who were shouting and laughing and slamming the door every time someone came or left to their party room. AND THE HOTEL MANAGEMENT KNEW THIS WAS THEIR HOSPITALITY SUITE BUT PUT US THERE ANYWAY! In fact, we were upgraded because we are Platinum Priority Club members. Despite many complaints from us, and other guests, the hotel security did not make the partiers leave, and the desk staff kept telling us that they were sorry and management would do something to make it up to us. They did not. When I checked out and paid my $1300 bill for two rooms and dining, there was no mention of apology, no mention of making it up in some other way, there was no response from management. Two nights out of the three we were there we were kept awake until after 1:30, as was our daughter and grand daughter in the next room. Total management failure. Intercontinentals in Boston and Baltimore have been fabulous, but this aging hotel suffers from management in absentia.

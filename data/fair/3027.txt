Unfortunately, our experience at the Westin Maui didnt come close to matching the stay we had a competitors hotel in Kauai. Instead of a relaxing resort feel, we were met by loud children at the pool and loud birds in the lobby that create a forced ambiance. We could get over this though if the staff would have been more helpful or friendly. Staff members were curt and never went above and beyond what was required to help you out or make you feel welcome. Valet isnt fully staffed so plan on delays getting your car; self-parking lot fills up fast. Never enough towels or waters in the rooms. Plus side? Good location to Front Street and David Pauls Restaurant (a welcome break from the Westin experience).

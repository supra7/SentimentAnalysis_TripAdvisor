This is a very chic, clean hotel with fabulous staff and in a great location just off the Ramblas...HOWEVER at the moment there is a large building site next door that starts working about 8 and finishes at 5 or 6. We stayed in Room 104... On the back right hand side of the building if you view from the front of the hotel... It is extremely noisy... and at times we had people drilling and tapping into our wall... some people say you should be out all day but if you had a three hour lunch after visiting the sites in the morning you may want to crash for a few hours before heading out... We we told on the first afternoon that the hotel was booked and we couldn't move rooms however on the third day after a further complaint we were moved to 206 ... Much better but still noisy. I think the management need to acknowledge that there is a problem and communicate on their website that those who maybe affected by noise should ask for a room that is on the side away from the site and offer discounts for the other rooms. It's interesting when you look at the hotel's website you get a cute video showing the facilities and they are tres chic but small. You get a good breakfast good wi- fi and friendly staff but if you want to relax during the day in your room... With the window open... It's difficult.

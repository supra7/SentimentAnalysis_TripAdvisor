Not so good... We stayed here between 25 and 27 July 2004 (2 nights) and we chose the Marina Inn after reading the good reviews on TripAdvisor. Our first choice was The Argonaut, but the great difference in price made us change idea. Our room was small (but we expected that) and smelling really dusty. On the first night we couldn't sleep because of the great noise coming (we thought) from a party nearby... it was awful!The complimentary continental breakfast was good (especially chocolate muffins) and the position convenient.But on the overall I wouldn't stay here again.

Simply stated, I was very disappointed with this hotel. I booked here because I gambled with naming my own price on Priceline. I was skeptical when I viewed the website, but was willing to give it a chance. However, it was not at all the caliber of resort my family desired for our vacation. I also feel we overpaid because it not worth what we paid, even with the low bid. The hotel is quite dated, and the suite which they upgraded to (nice gesture) was uncomfortable because it was consumed with bugs. Not an enjoyable encounter. The hotel was very empy, felt isolated. I enjoy privacy and seclusion during my vacations, but not isolation which was becasue the hotel is large and empty. The hotel grounds are not lush. If you are accustomed to nice, tropical resorts, this place will probably disappoint you. Other reviews commented on other overpriced resorts that are nearby, but I believe you get what you pay for... Some of the others are more expensive, however, the experience is 100x better. During my stay, I learned the hotel is closing (not sure when) due to financial troubles. No surprise, but unfortunate because the staff is VERY pleasant.

As all the other postings have noted, this hotel has two saving graces: an incredibly comfortable bed (albeit the same as you'd find in any Westin) and a trendy ambience downstairs. Additionally, the hotel options in Midtown are not incredible (the Waldorf has small rooms, the Palace is great but no loyalty program etc) The rooms are incredibly small, the noise from Lex Ave comes in through the very thin windows, the service is often less than stellar (a "because I could potentially be a D-list model, I don't really have to work" attitude permeates the staff)

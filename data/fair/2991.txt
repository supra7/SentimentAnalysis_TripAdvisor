While we were informed of construstion upon arrival, which never seemed to be a large issue do to being out and about during the day, we were more hurt by those that "live" at the Whaler. Many told us that they lived there and were to inform of of "rules" not only were they rude but also very hurtful in their words. We have been to Hawaii a lot and know many locals on the island but have never had such awful treatment by people who lived there. Where was the Aloha spirit? I will not name their names although I did get them from other staffers, one in particualar seemed drunk all the time and he was always yelling at someone, while another female didnt like where we were walking and was very rude in asking if we were staying there and was quick to yell at our son about talking in the hallway in the evening, he is two. She was rude to my husband and myself and was letting us know that if we were to come back to Maui to not bother coming there again, she didnt want to see us. I heard her multiple times yelling at the construction crews about very small things, stating she was on the board and would have them fired if she needed to, everyone needs a job in this economy. I was throughly disgusted!!!!!!

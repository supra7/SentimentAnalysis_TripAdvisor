We didn't have a problem with bedbugs, in fact we found the room to be reasonably clean, if rather small. The problem was the heat! The radiator was on full for the whole of our 3 night stay, and the only way to combat this was to use the very ineffective cooling unit situated directly above the radiator. We asked if there was any way to turn the radiator off and were told that if they turned off the radiator in our room, the whole side of the building would go off, which obviously couldn't be allowed to happen. They did offer to send maintenance round to unscrew our window, but this seemed a little excessive. The cooling unit was fairly useless and extremely noisy, so we hardly slept at all for the whole stay. Having said all that, the staff were friendly, and the room was clean, so perhaps for the cost it wasn't such bad value. Wouldn't stay there again though.

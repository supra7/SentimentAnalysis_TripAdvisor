We come to Vegas about once a month and usually stay at the Bellagio, Aria, or Trump. This time we decided to try some place new....big mistake. The check in lady was rude, the valets were rude, if you're used to 5 star service I suggest you stay at the Trump or Aria. We had a room on the 38th floor facing the strip, nice view, decent room, but the noise from the XS club was unbearable. So, at around 3 am we decided to call the front desk to ask what was going on and when it would end. So, she says it ends at 4 30 am!?!? I am like ok...well how am I supposed to sleep with this going on all night? She says, "Would you like some earplugs?". I just about lost it, earplugs, you are gonna give me earplugs when I'm paying over $300 a night?? So, long story short they transferred our room to the one across the hall and now we face the ugly side of the strip. Also, if you think the Encore would appeal to a more mature group such as the Bellagio crowd, you are sorely mistaken. The best way to describe the people staying here would be "Jersey Shore". Anyways, with all of the awesome hotels that have recently opened in Vegas I will never stay here again

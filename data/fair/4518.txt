The efforts of some of the staff were good - but they lack enough power to persuade me to return and thus why it received a "poor" instead of a "terrible" The Staff: "Hunter" the manager - was great (sadly we had to get to know him through complaints) - a true professional, and provided exactly what I expected from a hotel manager. "The maintenance guys"(he had brades) - an honest, down to earth person - good service. The breakfast - is good and better than what I expected and was happy about that "The breakfast staff" was friendly and no complaints. The front desk staff  the very happy guy at the front desk was the saviour of the reception staff  the rest were less than impressive. The cleaning staff is as rude as you can get - especially the ones that dont speak English - they have very aggressive tones, the ones that can speak English are very argumentative. The Location: The location of the hotel was good - since this was my first trip to NYC its hard to be definite on this - the one thing that is awesome, is that its around the corner from a dollar pizza shop (@ the exit of the hotel, turn right and then right again at the lights and its on the next corner - go past the dry cleaning shop) The Rooms: Room 1: Blood drops on the floor that had been dripped from the bed to the bathroom. Room 1 and Room 2 - had 2 double beds - "ledge walking" is the preferred method of movement because the rooms are that small. Room 2 bath sink hole was so clogged with hair and no-one had cleaned it and the poor maintenance guy had to clean it with pliers and plungers. I can honestly say, the elevator is half the size of the bedroom.

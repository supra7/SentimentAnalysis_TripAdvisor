The first impression I had of this hotel was that the location was quite nice. It was secluded and at the edge of Seattle near the water. Front desk and valet staff were friendly and service was fast. Valet service was $25 a night. When you first step foot into the lobby, you'll notice a wood or cabin theme all around. Not really my type of hotel, but that's ok. It was different and I like places that stand out. This didn't bug me at all. It's made to look cozy with all the fireplaces and woodland theme. When I was walking to my room, the hallway had this stench of sewage. It was unpleasant but not unbearable. I was hoping that this was only for the first night, but the smell remained after the second night. Another thing that I didn't like was the fact that the washroom in your hotel room wasn't very soundproof. So there wasn't any privacy in the washrooms. Although I have to say I love how the washroom looked - Just the style, layout, bathtub and glass shower. They need to do something about the shutting out the noise from the washroom though. I'm an early riser and my husband likes to sleep in, so when I wake up each morning to brush my teeth and shower, it would wake him. Another thing I enjoyed was the view. The windows in the room opened up to the very edge of the water which is nice. I enjoyed the view each morning looking at the boats pass by.

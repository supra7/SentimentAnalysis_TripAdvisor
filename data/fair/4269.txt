Recently stayed at the Marriott for business travel, needed to be close to the convention center. I would not rate this hotel as a 4 star property at all. Maybe a 3 star. We changed rooms after the first jr. suite they gave us on a lower floor was in desperate need of renovation plus the heat did not work. (this room would not even qualify for 2 stars!) We were moved to a higher floor and although the room was better, it still was more like a 3 star hotel. Once again, the heating did not work well. On a positive note, the bed was comfortable and the service was great. They say they are renovating this year, so maybe after the completion, we would consider staying again.

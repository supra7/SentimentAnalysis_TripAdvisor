I reviewed this hotel back in December 2008. At that time, we were given a room in the unremodeled section of the hotel as we didn't know they had nicer rooms. After reading tripadvisor.com, I realized they had newer rooms. This time, we specifically asked for a remodeled room and it was better. I will have to say that the bathrooms were a lot cleaner, the closet doors weren't falling off - they apparently took the doors off to have an open closet when they remodeled. The door to the room didn't have a 1" gap on the bottom. But, don't expect too much from this hotel. The halls sorta smell funny (bad), the paint and carpet are very old and worn out. But I am much happier with the room this time. I will stay here because we go to the nightclub upstairs but that is the only reason I would ever stay in a 2-star hotel. The staff is friendly and the lobby is pretty though.

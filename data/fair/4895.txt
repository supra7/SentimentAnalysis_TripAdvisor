Pros: very comfortable beds, nice rooms, excellent views Cons: They nickel-and-dime you to death! Parking for hotel guests is $52! That's crazy. There is a $15 fee to use the pool, sauna or fitness center. An order of bacon for breakfast is $9. The mini bar is unheated and a small bottle of water costs $9. There is no mini fridge in the room and the little extras like shampoo bottles and hand soap are miniscule and there are few of them. The tv channels available are fewer than I get at home with basic cable. And there were only two people at the front desk checking in guests. One of them was ignoring guests while she typed on her computer, so there was effectively only one person checking guests in - and this was on a Saturday! He was not particularly gracious. Both of the them seemed slightly annoyed at having to do their job. This is supposed to be an upscale hotel but it is a poor value for the money and definitely not worth the price.

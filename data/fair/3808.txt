I was in Phoenix just for 1 day and the Grand Resort was close to the business meeting I had to get to early in the morning. My room was as far away from the lobby as you could possibly get. A golf cart took me to the room when i checked in and i was informed when i checked out make sure i call the front desk to ask for a golf cart to pick me up and take me back to the lobby. The next morning I called the front desk and asked for a ride back to the lobby. After waiting 20 minutes i called again and a rude employee told me that they were too busy to send one but would do so now. After 15 more minutes it was obvious that it was never going to happen. I ended up walking to the (empty) lobby where outside the golf carts were lined up. The hotel itself was fine but for a business traveler who got in around 9 at night and left at 7:30 in the morning to pay a $30 resort fee on top of the hotel rate is not worthwhile. I would stay there again for pleasure but take my advice and skip it for the business travelers.

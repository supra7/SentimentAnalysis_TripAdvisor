The W Hotels have a recurring campaign on W-words--whenever, why not, etc. For us, it was "we don't get it." As the flagship hotel, the quality of the rooms were far from what we expected. Manhattan hotel rooms are tiny, but in the regular-sized room the closet door barely cleared the bottom of the bed. The lobby was quite nice though, and they had a handy hot chocolate and marshmallow station near the elevators. But aside from the lounge-like atmosphere of the lobby, we won't stay at the hotel again, mostly because of the size of the rooms. For half the price, you can stay at a Choice Hotel where the rooms aren't bigger, but your expectations will certainly won't be completely let down.

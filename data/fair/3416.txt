Spent two nights here- made last minute reservations and it was one of the few places we could find in Midtown, where we needed two rooms. Bell staff and front desk people were very friendly and helpful. One of our rooms was large and had been updated, one was much in need of new mattresses and new caulk in the bathroom. Temperature control a problem- heaters clicked and knocked and banged all night, so we had to turn them off. We were told continental breakfast was served from 6:30-9. Went downstairs at 8am and nothing was left but two bottles of OJ and coffee. When we asked, they said "Oh you have to be down here by 7:30 if you want food." Location was good and rooms were adequate, but we'll try somewhere else next time.

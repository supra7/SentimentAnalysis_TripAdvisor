My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton for three nights. I would not go back and I would not recommend them. The hotels elevator and tower system is not laid out in a customer friendly way. It is usually inconvenient to get from one place to the next. Every bank of elevators were in poor condition, they swayed made noises, and gave the riders a general feeling of uneasiness. On our last night at the hotel the elevators for our floor were broken. We had to walk down seven flights of stairs to get to the closest working elevators. We stopped by the concierges desk twice and they had limited knowledge about the city or directions. The people working at the car valet were unfriendly and inattentive. They did not leave the keys in the car so you had to wait for someone to let you in. We ate at two of the hotel restaurants both the food and service was poor. I would not recommend staying here. However if you do you should get the club lounge. The people who work in that area are inviting and friendly. The food and drinks are good.

We were looking forward to our stay after reading the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We booked a deluxe room and on arrival we were shown a room with peeling wallpaper, marked skirting boards. After pointing out the description of a deluxe room to the Manager we were offered another room which initially seemed fine. However the view was of a department store roof & service yard. There seem to be some sort of electrical engine running somewhere below our room, which could be heard throughout the night. On the final morning we were woken at 4:00am by the waste disposal truck. When using the shower the whole room vibrated! No tea or coffee facilities in the room, it is available in the hotel lobby in the morning. On a positive note the staff were very friendly and the location was good.

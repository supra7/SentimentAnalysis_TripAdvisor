So, let's start from the pros: This is place is in a good position, has a parking on the next door building (you have to pay extra, of course) and is below the average cost for a hotel in the city centre of Seattle. Let's go to the cons: Elevator was working intermittently, it happened that we sometimes had to wait for 20 min before we could use it, and once we used the stairs instead (bear in mind that we were on 7th floor). All the other guests had same problems, and complained with staff at the reception, but no one ever bothered neither sympathized about the situation. They were undergoing major repairs on the elevator, and they clearly should not have kept the hotel open meanwhile, especially considering the number of storeys. Going to the rooms: our was small, not so clean, and the bathroom was microscopic, too. We could barely fit our suitcases on the floor. We could hear noise coming both from the corridor, and from the neighboring room, which was pretty annoying especially late at night. It is true that we did not spend much on this stay, but next time I would rather pay 100$/night more rather than staying at this place again.

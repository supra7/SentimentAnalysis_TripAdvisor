I just stayed at the Hotel for business. I stayed in the regular room with King Size at first then moved to a suite. Both were so small. The Suite was a joke. The 2nd room was so tiny I was running into things whenever I walked around. The walls were dirty, the shower stall small and dingy. The shower head had no power - drip drip. Major attitude in the lobby and the servers in the lobby bar had attitude. The porter was very rude and indifferent to our requests for a cab. It is the worst W I have stayed at....

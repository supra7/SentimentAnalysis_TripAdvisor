We spent a week at the Westin Maui. The hotel is located on the same perfect stretch of beach as other fine hotels, most of which are more reasonably priced than the Westin. We found the hotel to be beautiful, but poor service and sporatic cleaning as well as odd rules regarding beach towels destroyed the concept of a "heavenly" vacation (Westin likes to use the word "heavenly" to describe their experience). We were told that if we wanted to wash clothes we had to hike 15 minutes to the Sheraton Maui to do our laundry (or send our laundry out via Westin). The pool was overcrowded with lounge chairs, yet one is asked to pay 5$ to take the same chair to the less crowded beach steps away. Our hotel room was never vacuumed once during our week long stay. The rugs are soiled and the pool area is dirty. The spa was never at spa temperature. I felt like Westin had come upon hard times to nickel and dime patrons the way that they do. And try to get a towel after 6:oopm. You are asked to wait in line at the front desk, then are told to go to the bell captain's desk (outside in front of the hotel). There are signs everywhere that The Westin will charge patrons $25 for "unreturned towels". The towels are dingy and threadbare; we were curious why anyone would want to take one in the first place. We plan to come back to Maui, but not to the Westin.

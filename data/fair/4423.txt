We needed a place to sleep during an overnight layover in Montreal. We chose the Crowne Plaza because it looked like it had a great swimming complex with slides, etc. You can imagine my disappointment when we get to the hotel at 6:15, check-in, and discover the pool was closed at 6pm. I can understand 10:00 or even 9:00, but 6:00?? I didn't think to ask when the pool would be closed because NEVER have I heard of one closing so early. i won't go back.

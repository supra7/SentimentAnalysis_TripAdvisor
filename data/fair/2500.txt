We arrived at 11pm to be told thatwe had a double room reserved when in fact we had reserved a twin room .We were then informed that they were fully booked and they could not guarentee us a twin room the next day untill 5pm.We were told it was the fault of our travel agent but as all the other hotels we had used on our holiday had been twins i have my doubts.The manager said we could have put up beds in one of the suites for the night and aftera 12 hour flight i was not in the mood to argue.it can only be described as a very plush meeting room.we finally got our very small twin room the following day.Have contacted our travel agent but no responce as yet.On the upside Loved Chicago but woud not stay at the Palmer House again.

Someone needs to take a bulldozer and push this property into the ocean. I would be embarrassed to be called the manager of this facility. It is run down from top to bottom - carpets are stained, paint is old, bathroom tiles are from the seventies - as well as the kitchen. I feel like a sucker for paying close to $200 a night - my only hope, that we have to evacuate due to Hurricane Irene and I get all my money back...

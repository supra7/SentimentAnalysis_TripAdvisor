The Encore is a beautiful hotel... the rooms are very nice and the common areas are just gorgeous. Sadly, the people that work there are inefficient and lazy. Our first impression wasn't a good one. We arrived at the hotel at 3pm and decided to check in. After 15 minutes in the queue, we were told that the computers had crashed, and there was nothing they could do. After a long day with at the airport/ airplane, this wasn't great news. 30 mins later, things started moving. We got our room on the 34th floor, and was placed DIRECTLY in front of the machine room which made a loud noise every 10 seconds. We called down once to tell them about the problem, and they told us they would send up security. 15 mins later... still nothing. We called down once again, a little angrier this time. Still nothing. The third time we called, we were practically screaming and requesting a room change. We were moved up to the 51 floor and the problem was addressed. What was really disappointing however, was that even though we changed rooms, we could STILL hear the pounding noise from the XS nightclub. It's UNBELIEVABLE that in a 5 star hotel, 51 stories above the nightclub, that we could still hear the noise. Terrible. The hairdryers were dirty, the trashcans were not cleaned out, and the tables were sticky. The room didn't seem clean at ALL. The pool was okay. Pool boys don't set up the chair for you like they do at the four seasons. In conclusion, the Encore had bad service, dirty rooms, TERRIBLE sleep quality (from the nightclub and random machine rooms..), and inefficient people.

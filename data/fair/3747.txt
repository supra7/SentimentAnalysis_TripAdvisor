I am a young businesswoman, and I stayed at the Hotel San Carlos because it was conveniently located. That's about the only good thing I can say about it, other than it truly was historic. I loved the history, but there is a line between historic and filthy. When I reached my room at 11pm after a late check-in, there was an extensive puddle of brown water on the ledge under my mirror. The sink was covered in black filth. The standards of cleanliness are subpar at this establishment, and are in need of drastic improvement before I could possibly recommend it to anyone. It is also above a pub, and I heard drunk people yelling into the night as I was trying to go to sleep that night, even though it was just a Wednesday and downtown Phoenix is usually pretty calm. They do not serve breakfast, and the nearest Starbucks isn't within easy walking distance if you have a morning appointment. Overall, I maintained a sense of humor about everything, but I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't willing to do that. My second and thankfully final night at the Hotel San Carlos, my neighbors were apparently roped in to getting an extremely drunk, loud woman back into her room, which was right across the hall from mine. It felt like my college freshman dorms all over again! Unlike the filth of my room, this situation was not the management's fault, but it's a result of the location that should be kept in mind. There are other, better hotels in the area.

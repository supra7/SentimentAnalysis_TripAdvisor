I was expecting 1st Class accomodations, service and food! I was looking forward to the experience of the Encore. I was completely wrong. From the minute we checked in, there was a line to check in, the customer service representative was rude and not helpful. When we got to our room our view was the parking lot - not the American Express Platinum Card upgrade we were promised. Next we went to the cafe for breakfast. We were seated at a table, our order taken and then waited and waited for our food to arrive. When the food did arrive it was ice cold. I sent the food back and 15 minutes later my food came. The bill for two entrees, two coffees and one orange juice was $70. No value in my opinion. We then attended our conference for the day and returned to the hotel for dinner. We were told Bartolotta's was amazing and booked a reservation there. When we arrived the hostess said it would be a little bit, but to take a seat at the bar. A half an hour later, we asked her what was going on. We were then seated at a table located next to a busing station. We said we would wait for a better table. The general manager came out and seated us at a table in the main dining room. To make a long story short, the food was terrible, no flavor and extremely overpriced. We then went to their nightclub and were disappointed with the $17 cosmo and smelly carpet. All in all - we were terribly disappointed with our trip to Vegas. This city has turned into medicore service, food and accomodations and yet charging a premium. We will not be returning.

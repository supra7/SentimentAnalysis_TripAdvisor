Stayed there last week, the hotel is nicely located close to Embarcadero and the Financial District. Friendly staff, authentic interior, nice restaurant. They have some nice rooms with bay view. However, there are other rooms... I had one with two small tinted glass windows facing to a pit within the building. Two floors down, the exhauster from the kitchen runs very noisy 24/7, so you have noise plus the kitchen smelling. The roof is some two floors up, it's hard to tell if it's day or night in that room. Would have asked for a different room, but we had some guests at the same time and I left the good rooms to them. The hotel is to be recommended, but you have to ensure that you get a room facing the street or the bay!

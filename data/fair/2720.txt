So so..we stayed in the tower. The suite was not a bad size for Vegas, sofa was worn. You could see hand and lets just say "interesting" prints on the windows. Crank window in bath for the smokers. There is a edge all around the room and in the hall of dust where it is not vacuumed. No coffee or cups in our room on arrival. Staff at the front desk was friendly. They do offer a shuttle to the airport if you ask for it. Very smoky in the casino. Food is not bad in the cafe...majority of servers are great.

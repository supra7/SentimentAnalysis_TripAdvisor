Paid $26755 for 7 days, way to much money for the service and room. Was told internet service was available, but wasn't told it would be $10 a day if we wanted it in our room, which is where most "good hotels" have it. Had to go down to a very noisy lobby when we wanted to use it. They advertise "paper delivered to room daily" Don't know whose room it went to but it wasn't ours. For the money we paid you would of thought breakfast would be given, but no way. Expensive to eat at the hotel . $26 for a burger and fries. Certainly not worth it. Wish I had read reviews before I booked.

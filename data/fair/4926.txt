If you are looking for a nice location to stay while in Chicago, you must stay at Best Wester Grand Park.... now, if you care about your sleep, the cleanlines and the staff.... go some where else. Several times, I woke up in the middle of the night due to the noise of the toilets at other rooms made. You can hear everything inside your rooms. The doors opening, the showers and the TVs of others. The AC was quite noisy too. Breakfast I purchased the American Breakfast plan and it was truly disapointing. Everyday the same eggs, the same hash brown. It was all the fat you can imagine. I loved the location, but I am not sure that I would stay there again.

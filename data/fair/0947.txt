I try to keep an open-mind when I read these reviews and think that if the positives outweigh the negatives, then there must be the requisite people who simply cannot be pleased no matter what. But this was not the case here: I side strongly with the other negative reviews of the Hyatt. This was an overrated hotel, definitely NOT luxury--the place was dated, undeservedly pretentious, with a few people on the staff bordering on more than indifferent to boot. The first room they put us in had dry rot, was mildewy, and generally unclean. You all know that feeling. You get in the room and don't want to take your shoes off to walk on the carpet. It was supposed to be non-smoking, and when we asked to change our room, the front desk offered to have it sprayed to mask the smell! Not totally awful, but ONLY cause it's location is on one of the cleaner, prettier beaches, but the hotel itself is disappointingly sub-par and awfully overpriced. My sister said, I quote, "The Old Wailuku Inn kicks the Hyatt's butt," within minutes of our arrival at the Hyatt. If you are the type who likes quality lodgings and authentic local experiences when you travel, go there instead if you like doing more than just lying about in a rented out cabana for hours on end. It's near Kahului, and great for jumping off early to head out for excursions to the Crater or to Hana.... But I digress. DON'T stay at the Hyatt if you've been to lots of high-end resorts (or even one really great one), you've been to far better and will be nowhere near satisfied. Do stay here if you don't care that they're charging you minimum 250 a night for a roof over your head and a nice beach nearby. And some parrots in the lobby for the kids to gawk at. At least they have that. Otherwise, this will disappoint. Oh yeah, and as for Hyatt having the pool sometimes rated as the best pool in Maui. No Way.

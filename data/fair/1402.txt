We stayed at the hotel for three nights. The room was very small. There was no free internet, no safe. The room is very basically equipped. The bathroom is good, but we had to ask for additional towels. Worst of all: it was EXTREMELY loud. No chance to get sleep without earplugs. Some members of the staff are friendly others definitely aren't.

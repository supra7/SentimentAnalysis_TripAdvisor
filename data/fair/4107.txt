major overpriced disappointment I agree with weekapaug...I don't understand the rave reviews for this place. I looked over the hotel's website before booking, and nowhere was it mentioned that there is no air conditioning and there are no elevators. Seems like something people might want to know before booking a $200/night room, especially if they have health or mobility issues. There is also no parking or valet, not even temporary parking while you run in to get directions to the nearest parking garage. My husband had to circle the block repeatedly while I got the garage directions, not an easy feat in this neighborhood.After lugging our suitcases up two long flights of stairs, we were hot and sweaty and had only our creaky open window and a small fan for relief. We marveled at the tiny TV, in a size we didn't even think was still manufactured. Then we flushed the toilet, and the flush handle fell off. Yes, fell off. In a $200/night room with no AC. Fortunately the lady at the desk was able to fix it, but I told her I expected a discount, as the hotel was full and we could not be given a different room.The free sherry in the reception area was no longer a perk after this, but a necessity.Unless you're the kind of person who enjoys backpacking through Europe, avoid this hotel.

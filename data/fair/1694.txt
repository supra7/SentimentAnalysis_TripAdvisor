We took a look at trip advisor prior to booking this hotel and were immediately attracted to the many positive reviews this hotel received. But our experience definitely did not match those expectations. We came here with two little children on New Years eve weekend. The first thing we ran into was a very rude receptionist that was extremely condescending and unfriendly. We asked for possible dinner reservations and instead of helping us she riddiculed us and informed us that we would not find anything under $500 euros per head. The room was clean, and spacious. The internet is included in the price but is extremely extremely slow and almost non-existent. The hotel also has breakfast included but the service is horrible, seating is very slow. If you are vegetarian or have special food requirements forget about this place. Although, they specify that they make special arrangements in their restaurant for those people, when we arrived for dinner they had maybe two options for us as vegetarians and the waiter told us they would not deviate from the menu. There is definitely something eerie with the hotel, and I would never set foot in this place again!

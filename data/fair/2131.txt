The Boston Park Plaza is an old school hotel, that needs to make some simple overhauls that will pay dividends. The old school charm and staff are nice, but the rooms need work, please get a flat screen and movie choices in each room, please join the 21 st century. The reception on the 1995 zenith tv's are awful. Also please fix the ice machine on the 5th floor, stayed there recently and was broken the whole time after I alerted them of the problem. Other than that bed was comfy, however I would reduce the parking rate from $44 to $39, no need to be over the top there. Would I go there again? Maybe, when they get their act together,

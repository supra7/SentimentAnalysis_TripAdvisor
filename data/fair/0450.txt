We've stayed at Westins all across the country and this one was very average. First off the pluses. The views were excellent. We had a top floor room on the 41st floor and had great views of the bay, the Space Needle, and Mt. Ranier. The lobby was pleasant and had free wi-fi access. But that's where the positives end. The rooms were very dated. The carpet looked like it hadn't been changed since the 1970s. It looked very old and run down and had stains everywhere. The bathroom wasn't much better. That is the most cramped bathroom I have seen in a long time. There is barely any room to stand. The shower, sink, and toilet are literally on top of each other. The light fixtures and wallpaper looked straight of the Brady Bunch. There needs to be some serious renovation here to bring it up to Westin standards. There is no full service breakfast place here. Breakfast was served by a counter service cafe. Not what you would expect in a hotel the caliber of a Westin. Overall, our stay was very average. The staff was good, but not great. The rate and location (close to a Monorail station) weren't bad. I would probably choose the Hyatt next time.

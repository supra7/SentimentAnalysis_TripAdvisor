Stayed at the Orlando Peabody for 4 nights. The hotel is in a great location for the Convention Centre and is very much a business hotel - it is though well placed on International Drive for the usual tourist attractions. The check in took for ages and the check in agent was not that friendly. The room was spacious and comfortable - our room looked over the back of the hotel. I found the hotel very unpersonal - the staff seemed distant and uninterested and I did not feel like a valued guest. The pool area is very quiet during the day but I found the pool and the whirlpool to be quite dirty and it stopped me from entering the pool too - by the lack of people in the pool too I guess this also put people off. I would stay at the Peabody again if I had business in Orlando though I do feel that even though its a very comfortable centrally located hotel - I would prefer to stay somewhere that values you as a guest and makes you feel welcome. I felt neither of those things.

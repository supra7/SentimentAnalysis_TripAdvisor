Here is the deal I was super excited and happy with the overall staff and really loved the location of the hotel. The cleanliness of the hotel was great but maybe too good! All I know is I walked in with my wedding ring and checked out without one. When I went to report it stolen after searching every piece of luggage, rummaging, the entire room and its furniture and looking thru every picture to see when it was last on me and in my possession it all lead to the same conclusion. My ring was stolen. If they hadn't said that my other two girlfriends stole my ring, charged me an extra six dollars bottle of water consumed and taken off the one bottle of water drank, then maybe just maybe I would considered staying here again. Maybe if when I reported it stolen someone would have been gracious enough to follow thru with some sort of compensation like I don't know a a free night's stay or two- but nothing. Instead just shushed and asked to file a report with the police department.

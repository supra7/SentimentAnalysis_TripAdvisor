DO NOT STAY HERE!! Construction works are a TOTAL nightmare April 26th 2007When I arrived I was told that there were construction works. That was a slight understatment, these construction works are massive and ruined the stay at the hotel. From 7am on the dot they start, and the noise levels are huge.I was initially on the 17th floor over looking the works, and it was dreadful, hte room actually felt like it was shaking.I moved to over look Maddison Ave, it was better, but not as it should have been. I would NOT recommend this hotel whilst these extensive works are going on.The barman was rude (to everyone), and the staff at breakfast were not great and always seemed to get our orders wrong.On the positive, its a great location for shopping, the rooms were nice  spacious, although bathroom a bit out dated.The bar area was really nice.Concierge helpful.Once these works have been done Im sure this would be a great place to stay.But definitely NOT whilst the works are going on.Hope to have helped

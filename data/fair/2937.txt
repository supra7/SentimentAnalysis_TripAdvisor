My new husband and I went to the Ritz Carlton Kapalua for the second half of our honeymoon after getting married at the Four Seasons Hualalai and spending several days there. The Four Seasons was sublime. The Ritz was the complete opposite. The pool area and the view were so artificial we could've been at Disney World, not in Hawaii. No one cared to get towels for you at the pool; garbage, food and dirty towels from the previous day at the pool were still lying on tables and chairs the following morning; the beach requires a golf cart to get to, and chairs are only on a grassy knoll overlooking the beach. It's not really an ocean to swim in just admire from a distance, I guess. The food and wait staff were awful. The breakfast would have been ok if we were at a low level Disney World resort, but alas, we were not. And it took 3 waitresses at the bar about 20 minutes to figure out we needed water and menus. While at the Four Seasons, every single employee seemed genuinely happy to help, but at the Ritz, everyone seemed bothered when you asked a question or they just ignored you. My husband and I managed to eat a snack and get drinks in the Club Room without any staff member even saying, "hi," to us. And this is supposed to be the Club Level with extra special attention given to guests! As for the golf, we golfed the Plantation course which was like golfing at a nursing home. Needless to say, we called AMEX and they promptly got us out of this hotel and into a much better one, Grand Wailea, so the rest of our honeymoon wouldn't be spoiled. I've stay at Ritz Carltons all over the country and in Mexico and was shocked by this one. I don't know if I'll ever stay at one again. Has the service gone downhill because Marriott bought them?

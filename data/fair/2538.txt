The Palmer House Hilton is located in the heart of downtown Chicago. This hotel has a great location and is within walking distance to shopping and dining. The rooms however are very disappointing. My husband and I were celebrating our one year wedding anniversary so we were looking for a romantic getaway for the weekend. Walking in to the Palmer house, the lobby area is very nice and the staff was pleasant. You can tell that this was an old building that was going through some updating. At check in the clerk advised that our room had recently been remodeled and we were given our room key and headed to the 12th floor. Walking into our room was very disappointing. It was very very small and we had no view. In fact, my husband and I had to look up and find the sky to even tell if it was day light or not. The room did have updated features such as a nice modern sink but the curtains and bedding were strangely designed with black and green colors. The worst part of our stay was being woke up each morning to the annoying sound of squeaky pipes. I was so looking forward to sleeping in both mornings but the pipes kept me from doing that. Other than that the bed was comfortable and the hotel staff was very friendly. My husband and I received a very good rate using priceline.com so I guess beggars can't be chooser. If I had the choice, however, I would not stay at the palmer House Hilton in Chicago.

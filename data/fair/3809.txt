I stayed here for a large business meeting and it was disappointing to say the least. The pictures on the website look much nicer than the actual resort. My room was old, dirty, and overlooked the parking lot. Also, it seemed as if only half of the rooms in my building were being used. Some had plywood over the windows as if there had been a fire, or maybe construction going on. This definately didn't add to the ambiance. All of our meals were served outside in tents, in the freezing cold. Not only that, but the food was barely edible anyway. Like I said...disappointing...

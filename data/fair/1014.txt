There are plenty of other hotels that are the same price and definitely worth the money, unlike this one. The hotel staff were not what you would expect of a typical 3-4 star hotel. The front desk staff were particularly unhelpful. For example, our key was disabled twice in the three nights that we stayed, once at midnight, for no reason at all. We had to track down the only security guard to be let in our room because the rest of the staff was gone for the day. 1.5 hours later of tracking down the security guard and sitting outside our door, we finally got into our room. When we explained the situation the next day to the front desk, they were hardly concerned or apologetic. Then, the key stopped working again that same day only to get the same reaction from the front desk! This place is much more geared to owners of the property rather than hotel guests. There is no room service, late night staff, or easy parking. We had to park 5 minutes away when from our building late at night. On the upside, it is surrounded by a beautiful golf course and does have a wonderful beach cabana. But, once again, the cabana staff was rude, they ran out of towels, and did not treat the guests with respect. In case interior design is important to you, I would say the rooms are definitely dated. I HIGHLY recommend looking elsewhere.

We arrived to be greeted by a friendly receptionist who checked us in and promised us a bottle of wine as it was our honeymoon. Good start but it was all downhill from there. The room we got was ridiculously warm and the heating controls were broken. I phoned to complain and they said someone would be up to look at it. Half an hour later I phoned to complain again that no one had fixed it and we got moved. This room had heating controls but the rooms are still very warm and stuffy resulting in sleepless nights. Calling down to reception that night we were told the wine would be in our room when we returned from dinner. . . . Never happened! A couple of days into our trip our safe wouldn't open and we needed our passports. It took 3 hours and constant phonecalls to get it opened. Overall the rooms are below standard. Taps falling off walls, dirty stains, beds that have seen better days etc. The only real positive I have is the location, which is fab. But I would rather stay further out and have a better hotel.

We were upgraded to an executive suite on the 22nd floor which included access to the 23rd floor which enabled us to partake in a continental breakfast daily, drinks (non alcoholic) all day long and hor'dorves after 5. I was most excited but when we got up to the room, it was tiny. 1 double bed not a queen and the wardrobe door that opened into the bed. We couldn't even get a bag into the closet. First appearances are stunning, but the room was very pokey. Location was good, close to Millenium Park, Sears Tower and if you don't mind a walk, Navy Pier.

We booked this hotel unaware that they were under construction. Our travel agent received an e-mail shortly before we left. I wanted to change hotels but our agent was assured that they would accomodate us. Several calls were made by her including on the day we were arriving(this was our 30th wedding anniversary trip). The work was being done in Tower 1 including the area near the pool. On check in we were told we were in tower 1 and I questioned the woman. She assured us that we weren't near the construction area. We walked through scaffolding to get into the tower and when we entered our room and walked out on to the patio we overlooked the construction staging area to the right and scaffolding to the the left-ugh. So as not to ruin this beautiful trip I said nothing to my husband as he doesn't like any form of complaining when these things happen. Why should we have had to fight for decent accomodations anyway. This hotel is in a great location but has zero amenities. Look for another hotel until the construction is finished.

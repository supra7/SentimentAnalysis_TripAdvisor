Not what it used to be! We started staying at St. Elena in 2003 when it first opened and was run by private people. At that time it was a wonderful and friendly place to stay. Then it got sold to Best Western. We have been back every year and unfortunately it has changed a lot. Unfriendly staff, dismal breakfast and especially the rooms which used to be beautiful are getting more and more run down. I booked a junior suite via their website an was given a double room when we got there. When I complained they showed me a form where the double room was registered a a junior suite. But the room we got was a double room on their website. So it's all very misleading. As we travel to Venice every year, we'll have to find a new hotel

Be prepared to be propositioned... I spent a week at Beck's around the holidays. I like it because it's clean and relatively inexpensive, and I stay there fairly often. It's also one of the few lodging choices in the Castro area of San Francisco. I checked in on a Saturday. The very next day the lock on the room door stopped working, so I went to the desk and explained the problem. The clerk took a while to figure out what to do. Ultimately, she offered to move me to another room. The new room was smaller than the original room but the rate remained the same. I persisted in requesting some compensation for having to move. The clerk appeared somewhat dumbfounded that I would ask. Reluctantly, she took $4 off my room rate each night for the remaining nights. I thought that was fair. Be aware: this motel is a cruisy place for men seeking sex. While walking down the stairs to get ice, I was propositioned by a man who smelled heavily of alcohol. It would be inappropriate to repeat what he said, but it was rather crude. The cruising begins when darkness falls and continues throughout the night. The morning I checked out, I counted no less than 5 men wandering around. So, if you want a clean place to stay in this area of San Francisco and are willing to put up with the cruising that goes on here, this is a nice place to stay. However, I don't think it appropriate for families with children or for adults who are easily shocked.

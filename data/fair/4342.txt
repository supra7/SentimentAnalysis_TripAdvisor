Casacrappa My husband and I spent the day touring prospective hotels for an upcoming trip to the Big Apple and wanted to make sure we would be happy with our choice. I'm glad we did! We wanted to make sure we would be close to the Theater but away from all the hustle and bustle. This hotel fit that criteria, however, the hotel is in serious need of updating! The staff was friendly and accommodating, but the hotel, from the entrance to the tiny elevator and the dated hallways and rooms were anything but upscale from what we were expecting. We looked at several hotels in the area and all met or exceeded our expectations. I would not recommend this hotel. There are many other better choices in the city.

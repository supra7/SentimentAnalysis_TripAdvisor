We stayed at the Sheraton Seattle for 3 nights as part of a conference. We had originally booked 1 night through the conference and when we attempted to add 2 more nights - and receive the conference rate - we were given the runaround by 2 reservations people who couldn't confirm the original reservation but yet assured us the new rooms would be connected to the original room and rate. When we checked in, our room was not ready and we we forced to wait. When we finally checked in, there were dirty dishes in our room. Due to the inept reservations people we dealt with when making our reservations, we were forced to check out and re-check in each day and we were charged a different rate for each night. When we called to try to work something out, the accounting department refused help us. We travel 2 weeks per month on business and usually stay at SPG properties. We had hoped our status would have gotten us better customer service. We are in Seattle every month and we will take our hotel business elsewhere - we will not be staying at this hotel again.

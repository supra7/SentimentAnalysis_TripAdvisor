I stayed here for 4 nights on business (the room was booked through our corporate travel group). It was really one of the worst 'nice' places I have stayed. Its a nice enough hotel - cozy interior, great location, clean. But really the worst room ever. First - there was one tiny slit of a window that looked over a roof full of air vents and the like. The set up was terrible- first, the TV hung on the wall to the left of the bed. You either had to lay sideways or perch on the edge of the bed to watch it. The shower head was set not at the long end of the tub (as every other tub shower I have ever been in anywhere in the world) but on the wall mid-way down! You had to stand mid-tub and try and shower width-wise. In the main part of my room - I could hear every (yes, every) noise from the bathroom next door. The closet was a half closet - that is, the hangers were set at chest level (so, long Boston-winter coat had to be slung on the desk chair). They charge 10$ a day extra for internet PER DEVICE!! yes, that's right. For wireless internet - if you log in with your computer and another device (phone, iPad,etc) you are charged 10$ per day for EACH! Housekeeping woke me at 9a.m. on Sat. Room service breakfast of oatmeal and coffee took 40 minutes. The fitness room is very very small, stuffy and windowless - but all I needed was a treadmill so it was sufficient. All in all,given that there are a number of nice hotels in this part of town - I'd recommend you look elsewhere.

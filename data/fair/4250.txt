We went to the Commander 18 years ago. We had a bad stay. We had the same experience as ejhalpin from new jersey. We left our money in the frig. in a bag and when we returned from the beach my money was gone. The manager or owner didn't seem to concerned about it. She also told us that we should have used the safe. I think the safe would be for valuable items. Who wants to take your spending money and put it in the safe, and every time you want to buy something have to run to the front desk. You should be able to keep that with you. We were thinking about staying there this summer, thinking maybe it's changed, but I GUESS NOT!!!!!!!!!!

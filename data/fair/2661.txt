I chose this property because of its convenience to the center of Daytona. When I arrived at 4:00 PM there was a line of traffic to get into the hotel. After spending 20 mins in line I finally arrived at the main doors. The bellman who was very pleasant asked if I was going to valet park ($17.00 per day) or Self Park ($10.00 per day) located across the street. I chose the option to Self Park since I would be using my car quite frequently. I believe either choice has its pros and cons. The valet parking I was told you need to call down  before you needed your car. The self parking my key never worked in to get in and out. The check in was slow, but they were busy at the time. The person at the front desk handled my reservation in an adequate manner, however there were problems. I booked my reservation on line via Hilton rewards. I was quoted a price $159.00 per night. When I arrived I was told $174.00 per night. I disputed this, asked to speak to a manager and was told a manager would call my room to discuss this issue. I still have not heard from management. I was also told my room wasnt ready yet and would receive a phone call when it was ready and that it would probably be less than a half hour. I did receive a call two and a half hours later. The room was in need of updating however it was very clean and adequate; I had a great view of the ocean. The check out was another night mare. Out of four elevators only seemed like one was working. I stood on my floor for 20 mins before I entered an elevator going up. This was the only way I could get down. My overall stay was ok. I personally wouldnt stay at this property again.

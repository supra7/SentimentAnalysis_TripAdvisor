Well, After the mixed reviews on here I was unsure what to expect. Definitely this hotel suffers from form over function, and I'd say pretentious without good cause. It's really trying hard to be something it's not. The room like most have said on here is small. We had a 'Wonderful' room which was the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in - smaller even than one in Paris I stayed in. The room was incredibly dark with poor lighting. There was no WiFi in the room at all, only paid for 'Wired' internet connection which was $7 for 30 minutes or $15 for 24 hours. Also there was no free WiFi in the lobby. The lobby is nice but like a cave - quite dimly lit. The guest information booklet resembles a brick that fans out with information on cards. It really is form over function - quite difficult to read. Room service was really expensive. A cup of tea from room service is $6 plus $4.50 delivery charge + Tax (8 odd %) + mandatory gratuity of 17% ! I didn't bother with room service in the end there's a Starbucks one block down and a few good deli style places handy to eat at. The inroom toiletries are quite nice - all in the Bliss range. They are restocked everyday. The bed + pillows were very comfortable. The desk was a bit shabby, much of the varnish has come off. The shower was OK, although water would go over the floor - mopped up however by the plentiful supply of towels which were changed everyday - around 6 towels a day. On the whole the staff were quite friendly, I got a later checkout (+1 hour) for free, and the concierge helped me to check if the show I'd booked had been cancelled due to the strike or not. I paid $300 per night and my room was on floor 6. The hotel is just OK, or acceptable. I won't stay here again. Not because they hotel did anything to upset me, but more because I think there are nicer places to stay.

my new mother in law got us a room here on our wedding night , when we got to the desk at 3 am with bags in tow still in dress and tux . The guy wouldnt honor her reservation cause she wasnt there. So after explaining to him that the room was paid and should be honored he still wouldnt give it to us. So had to dig for my wallet to pay for the room .149 for the night . Then when we check out the next day the bill states 171 . Which the taxes were never explained to me . So i check my account and now its at 200 dollars for a 20 dollar in case charge they said on the phone.

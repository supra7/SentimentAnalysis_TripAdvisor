Found hotel tacky and vulgar, with clueless management - hotel tries to be upscale, but fails. Noisy - very loud schlocky luau show on Tuesdays and Thursday. Decor very corporate Westin - no resort feel - and hotel feels very old. Horrible water pressure in bathrooms. Lots of midmarket tourists - forget any elegance - but that is Kaanapali. Only good part of the hotel was the valet staff - friendly, proactive and helpful. Only stay here on Starpoints - even cash and points at $90 is pushing the value envelope here.

My expectations for JW Marriott Properties must be too high! Our 2 night stay (which we shortened from 3 nights) was very bad. The room was unclean, the trash cans had not been emptied, there were no towels in our room when we checked in...the heat was not working properly and we happened to be there during a cold spell. NOT a good experience. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. My business partner has allergies and the customer service was awful when we tried to get a "non" down pillow for her. As a long time rewards member I was very disappointed in our stay. The exterior doesn't event look like the online photos and it was much farther from the convention center than we were lead to believe. We were with a group at the convention center and could have stayed at one of their group rate hotels but as a Marriott rewards member I thought we would have much nicer accommodations if we stayed at a JW Marriott. The property in general needs some TLC. The bathroom was tiny and cramped and the wall outside our room was banged up and scuffed. Not impressed at all!!!

We came for my nephews wedding and when we arrived, our rooms are not availabe. We had a party of 3 and needed 2 double beds. I booked 3 weeks ahead and confirmed each time about my arrival time. The desk person said they only made a notation, but didn't block off the room. She gave us two rooms and then moved one into the other with a roll away for the next night. Didn't offer anything else. I had to ask next morning if they would at least comp the valet. Room was small, no door to the bathroom except for the toilet and shower. So in a room of 3, that was not convenient in anyway. The makeup mirror was missing a screw, so it won't stay in place. The bath faucet was leaking and the hot/cold indicator is totally backwards. You thought you are turning to hot, but it was freezing cold water. The Room phone cordless handset didn't work, so we couldn't figure out how to call valet or front desk. Later, we found out it's because the cordless phone has the same frequency as the internet, so it doesn't work. Why put that phone in there then? We also hear the same thing with other guests that was attending the wedding. Couldn't find reservations, the room have things that don't work. There were no place to really have lunch. We had to sit outside. All said, this was a bad hotel and now each time we see a Westin, we don't think we will stay at one anymore.

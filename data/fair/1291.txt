When we arrived in London we went straight to the hotel, first impression of foyer rather dreary. We asked what time we would be able to access our room, were told if we wanted to get into the room before 3pm we would have to pay 10 extra (we had already paid 100+ for the room), We then asked if we could wait in the restaurant, only to be told that it had just shut. We asked if we could use the toilet and were told it was out of order! Altogether a less than welcoming experience. When we did get into the room, finally, it was reasonably clean but very small, bathroom with shower only, no bath. Breakfast was good value, the best thing about our stay. For light sleepers, note that there is a lot of traffic noise, sirens, etc.

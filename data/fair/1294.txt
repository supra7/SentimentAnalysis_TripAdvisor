Spent a single night here (29.11.11) - booked through company. Staff The few staff I saw were friendly and helpful. Room It was booked as a family room (99 for night) but neither myself or my colleague were allocated a family room. We checked in just after 4.30pm and it was evident that the room had just been cleaned. The carpet was damp (perhaps mopped) and there was a very unpleasant musty smell in both rooms, the lift and along the landing. The room and bathroom were small but I had expected that. The worst thing about the room was the invasive road noise. Although the windows are double glazed, this does nothing to lessen the noise from vehicles that lasted until after 3am and started again at 5.30am. The rooms were both odd numbered and on the second floor. Even numbered rooms on the other side of the corridor may have been less noisy. Breakfast Breakfast was not included and we paid extra. It was mediocre and the dining area was in a tiny basement. At one point, more people had arrived than could be seated and they had to wait in the corridor outside. Location Handy for Euston station, bars and places to eat but sadly it is located between two very busy roads which means it is not a peaceful or restful place to stay. Recommend No. There are better more affordable places in the near vicinity.

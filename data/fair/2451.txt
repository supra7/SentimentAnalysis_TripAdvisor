We stayed here last Friday to attend a baseball game. We requested a kingsized bed. I guess we should also have requested a kingsized room. I have never seen a room so small. We paid over $200.00 for the night. The bathroom tub was not clean and the drain was stopped up so we had to shower in standing water. The iron did not work properly. The television had very limited access. The game began in the afternoon and we wanted to check out a hour later. We were told there would be an additional charge. Needless to say we just put our bags in the car.

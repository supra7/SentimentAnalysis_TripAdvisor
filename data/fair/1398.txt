If you have a hearing problem, Hotel 91, in Chinatown, New York, is a fine choice. The room I stayed in was quite large, clean, and the bed was comfortable. However, the noise made by the passing trains, every five minutes or so, was so overpowering it made my stay almost unbearable. I asked the reception for another, more quiet room. I was told I was actually staying in "one of the quiet parts of the hotel." Makes me wonder about the other rooms. The hotel has no room service, in fact no food service at all. There is a vending machine on the fourth floor, mostly containing junk. The nearby restaurants were generally dreadful. There is, however, a Starbucks in the vicinity, but it takes about ten minutes to walk to it.. The people at the reception were ok, if somewhat impersonal and distant. I can't recommend this hotel.

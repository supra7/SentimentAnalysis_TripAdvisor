The W group is not what it was. Sure, it's hard to get a room with a decent view in New York, but the cheapest rooms here are not just tiny but look out on air ducts: you have to crane to see a piece of sky. Pictures are falling off the bathroom walls, the service is curt, and the hotel is investing in fake grass in the lobby in a doomed attempt to become the coolest bar in town. Clean, but depressing and characterless.

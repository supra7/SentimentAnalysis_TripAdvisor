There is no one Elite World Hotel but two, side by side. The one, in the corner, is this of 5 star quality, the other next to this is hardly a 4 star hotel. For bad luck i stayed to this of 4 stars. Nobody was speaking English, bad food for breakfast and on the top of all, somebody from the staff that was cleaning the rooms has stollen one of my new pair of athetic shoes. From the hotel nobody told me politly: "we are sorry for what happenned to you". They seemed to be used in such situations. I didn't recomend this hotel even to my enemy.

Stayed one night in a ground floor room - I was not bothered by the noise problems that seem to have affected reviewers. The general cleanliness of the hotel was poor, there is a very odd smell in the corridors - a mixture of paint and cabbage! My room was basic and functional but there was no way to adjust the room temperature and the window did not open. I had breakfast which was OK for 7.95 (kids eat free) - I got to breakfast early but the "cafe" was very small and it started to fill up by 07.30 You get what you pay for - unfortunately because it was a late booking and london hotels were very busy - it cost nearly 100 for the night. Not a hotel I would visit again unless I had no option

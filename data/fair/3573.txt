the fire alarm goes off on the 15th floor and we grab the passports and head out the room into a foggy hallway. We find the firestairs and a painter in the stairwell holds the door open as we start our descent down to ground. We are calm and talk with each other as we head down, but on several floors find we have to stop and clear the landing of trolleys, housekeeping equipment, tables etc, all blocking our path. If the whole hotel had been evacuating, there would have been a bottle neck and panic. On reaching the street we find there are no staff members waiting to guide us to safety or advise us of our next form of action. We head back into the lobby to find staff members standing around, nobody taking control. We advised the head of security that we believe it was paint particles that caused the alarm to trip and without checking he tells us we can return to our rooms via the elevator. This was totally unproffessional and dangerous to the clients. Also, dont expect a smile, any assistance or even eye contact from the young woman who is behind the concierge desk. She will keep looking at that computer screen until you go away and leave her alone. This must be one of the most unfriendly hotels in New York. We will not be returning. Also the airconditioning wins an award for the noisiest airconditioning in the USA.

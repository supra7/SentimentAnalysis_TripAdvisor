The hotel was old, the elevators worn and wobbly . The room was so tiny , with a very small tv and a window that did not open . The bed was decently comfortable , the bathroom was about the nicest portion of this hotel . Can`t say I`ll be returning on my next trip to Dallas , it wasn`t for me ! But a good location . The parking is a joke , you have to park in a back lot that you have to pay for which was not favorable at all . They don`t validate parking , so the parking situation was a mess to say the least .

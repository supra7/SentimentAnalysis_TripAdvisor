My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights in June 2004. The only positive things I have to say about it were that it is in a good location, decorated nicely, and it is clean. The rooms are VERY small. It really is hard to describe how small they are but there was about 2 feet of space surrounding our full-size bed (not even Q or K size). If you are planning on spending any time at all in your room, this is NOT the place for you. The staff was rude. It took several hours and several not-so-friendly (on their end) phone calls to the front desk to get the cot in our room that we had reserved months in advance (for a friend traveling with us). Needless to say, once the cot was brought to our room, it would not fit. No wonder they didn't want to bring it! There was barely enough room for it to stand on its end and for us to walk by it. A very expensive room that really isn't worth it. You can definitely do better in Boston (as we found out)!

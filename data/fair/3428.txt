Would not recommend this hotel. We were put in a twin when we requested a double (others in our party checking in on a different day requested twins and got doubles, which are tiny). The one lift was broken on arrival. 9 flights of stairs are not fun and there was no offer to help us with luggage. Our first night was in a room that stank of mould - the wall paper was peeling off and was black underneath - and the floor was oddly wet. We were moved to another room the next day and got the impression this wasn't uncommon. The staff were - with one or two exceptions - unhelpful. It might be cheap, but it certainly isn't cheerful!

We come from a midwest state, this was our first trip to New Orleans and we arrived by air to stay in the French Quarter district. We made reservations almost six weeks in advance for a room with king bed facing the courtyard to assure us quiet. We reviewed the web site for this hotel but made a reservation by phone. We would have liked a balcony courtyard room but were not informed that you had to request this in advance, not offered or mentioned on phone reservation call. We asked for balcony room after our first night, no accomodation. Our room was big, roomy with a sofa but not clean. I mean real clean! Our furniture had design ridges that were filled with accumulated dust. The carpet around the wall perimeter of the room had not been vacuumed recently. Faucet fixtures on vanity sink had grime around them; all the corners of bathroom floor were dirty and the molding along floor edge loaded with accumulated dust, dirt, and grime. Light globes above vanity sink loaded with dust/dirt, had not been cleaned in a long time. We are clean people so this was unacceptable and not fun to be exposed to. Since we were here for vacation we did not want to expend valuable time looking for other accomodations. We stayed here seven nights. The continental breakfast offered the same two rolls all week, no variation. No breakfast cereals, no donuts, no waffles. The pool was small so we did not use it and tables and chairs around the pool were in disarray many times. There was no mid afternoon or early evening cleanup as we decided to sit poolside later in an evening, and it appeared well used with towels around and dirty ashtrys. The hotel staff that we did have contact with were friendly people. The breakfast room attendant was great and had a clean kitchen. In our opinion the tourist trade appeared so consistantly heavy at this hotel that there is no incentive or time to have a cleaner facility. So we did not get our moneys worth.

Stayed in this hotel in mid April for 6 nights. At the beginning we were given a smoking room which was incredibly stinky so we barely could breathe there. It was also freezing though the window was closed and very very noisy (cars, trucks), and there were some dirty towels and hair in the toilet. It was also pretty small (TV was inside a closet which open door blocks the entrance to bathroom) We complained but the reception said they are sold out so they can't do anything this night, and they will try to move us to another room the next day. In the meantime, the housekeeping lady came, replaced only 1 towel (!) and sprayed some spray against smoking that helped for 10 min. Since it was impossible to stay in the room, we spent half a night walking in the street and sitting in the lobby, complaining again to every reception shift about this horrible experience. The next day the manager came and indeed moved us to a non smoking, clean , quiet and very big room with much nicer view and we stayed in this room the rest of the trip. The stay in this room was much better, the only minus was that not always housekeeping brought new soap/shampoo though the one in the room was over. Luckily, we also brought our own soap and shampoo... In overall, all rooms have an old rug that is woren and the toilet seat also seems like needs to be replaced. The location of the hotel is OK but not great - 1 min. walk from UN, it's around 49 th and 1st Ave which means about 15 min. walk to 5 th ave, and about 10 min walk to metro.

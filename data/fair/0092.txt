Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Seattle to attend a conference held there. They actually charge $9.95/day for the in-room wireless service. The wireless signal was 1 bar, sometimes 2 bars and generally registered as "weak" on my 10th floor room. To make matters worse, the provided connection is only 256kb down link and 128kb up-link speed. The connection is painfully slow and frequently just log-jams totally. It's hard to believe a five-star hotel in tech savvy Seattle would have such outdated antiquated internet connectivity and then actually have the nerve to actually charge $.9.95/day for it as well. The room is ok, not great, and appears to have been "remodeled" with another layer of wall paper and some paint one two many times. It does have a great view of downtown. Avoid this hotel if you need reliable internet while traveling.

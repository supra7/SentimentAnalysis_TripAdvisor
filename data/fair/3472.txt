I might stay here for $225/night, but never again for $450. Windows not soundproofed, so street noise kept me up even though I'm usually a sound sleeper.Turning off the lights was also a challenge--the two-way dimmer switch for the light next to the entrance was infuriatingly hard to figure out. Even more infuriating was the fact the card key to the room only worked sporadically. I thought the cards had been desensitized and got new ones at the front desk, but the problem persisted. One day the maid saw me struggleing with it and offered to help. She got it on the fifth or sixth try, and when I asked if there was a trick, she said "Oh no, they're all different." Luckily I never needed to get into the room in a hurry. The "closet" was bisected by a shelf with the room safe on it, so that there was no way to hang anything longer than a shirt. My colleague's room had no closet at all, though there was a bathrobe hanging on the shower curtain rod. The bathrooms in both our rooms appeared to be fitted for handicapped accessibility, but it would've been impossible for a wheelchair to fit through the narrow hall/corridor in my room, so maybe all the bathooms were designed that way? Just odd.

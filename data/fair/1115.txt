Hotel listed as 5 stars - rooms are new and fairly well appointed with a decent bathroom, so rating of 4 stars from that point of view is reasonable. However, there are few other facilities of interest in the hotel - empty restaurant and fairly depressing bar - especially compared to other hotels in Las Vegas so that overall I view it only as a 3 star hotel. What I found most annoying is everything comes with a charge, with the biggest rip-offs the forced daily resort fee and the room service charges. Frankly this was the most depressing visit I've had to a "luxury" hotel in a long time. Acceptable if all you want is to sleep there, and want to be away from the crowds and noise of the strip.

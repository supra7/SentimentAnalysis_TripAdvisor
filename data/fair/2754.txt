This was my third stay in Las Vegas, and I needed a quick place with good proximity to the airport before starting our National Park trek. I chose the Super 8 because I had eaten the secret $7 steak dinner at the Ellis Island Casino next door and knew that it was within walking distance to the strip for a quick stroll at night. I would NOT stay there again. I am extremely thrifty and wondered how bad the place could actually be. The carpet was ripped everywhere, and the sink faucet handle came off a couple of times when we went to wash our hands. The level of cleanliness (sheets, bathroom, carpet) was questionable. The number of unsavory characters hanging out there made me feel unsafe, and I wondered at one point if this was some type of "men's hotel" for down-and-outers or whatever. That being said, the restaurant next door is one of the few normal restaurants near the Strip: no $60 buffet, but just normal food. We had breakfast there and had no complaints. If anyone is looking for a cheap but convenient place to stay, try your other options: the Imperial Palace, etc. Don't stay here, especially if you are female, have kids, etc.

TAKE YOUR EARPLUGS Never, never again. Arrived after a morning delay at San Francisco airport to find my fully paid room given out to someone else. I'd paid for a two week vacation there. The female receptionist had a couldn't care less arritude when I complained, that this was all wrong etc that peoples plane journeys must be delayed all the time. Couldn't have cared less if we had to both sleep on the beach. Eventually given a room on the 15th floor overlooking a carpark. The room was very clean. The noise though, every morning at 4am until at least 6.30am you heard dustcarts beeping as they reversed, the noise from emptying them was dreadful. Coaches slammed their doors constantly storing away suitcases for early morning shuttles to airports etc. Even on the 15th floor you heard it all. The Concierge did have a poor grasp of English so we booked in the end most of our trips at the Outrigger Activities Desk at a nearby hotel who were excellent and very informative. The Hotel is very close to he beach, one of it;s few virtues. IIt is clean inside everywhere and breakfast was very nice indeed. Dinner didn't seem worth the very high expense. If you decide to book ahead, you'll be fine if you have no dealings with reception and you can catch up on your beauty sleep on your sun lounger down at the beach because truly the noise is terrible. It could be a good prize hotel if they trebled glazed the rear rooms and curtailed the attitude of some of the front desk into being helpful.

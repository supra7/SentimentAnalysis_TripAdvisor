I have just returned from a week at the Gaslamp Plaza and felt I needed to share this information with others who may be considering this location. It is in a great location, however if you are not a sound sleeper, it is very loud at night. Because of the downtown location, there are people wandering throughout the hotel and there is no security to prevent someone from entering. From 11 pm - 7 am the doors are locked, but any other time, anyone can enter. We had items stolen from our room while we were out for supper one evening. So make sure you take your valuables with you!!!! Then the most disappointing part about this is that the hotel would take no responsibilty for it. I had spoke to another couple who had items stolen from their room the previous week. The items can be replaced, but it was a terrible feeling to know someone had entered our room. This hotel is also very old and the rooms are very small.

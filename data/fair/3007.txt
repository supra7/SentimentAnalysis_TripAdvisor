This is NOT your normal Westin Hotel, don't be fooled into thinking it is quality because of the name. The hotel is dated, has a grimy feel, is incredibly busy, huge, packed with people; not anything like a relaxing Hawaiian resort should be. We were booked for eight days, left after two and moved next door. Had to wait for a room to vacate next door or we would have been out of there on day one. Room was dingy, cramped, and SO loud! The only plus was the shower head, but even that was hard to enjoy because tub didn't drain well and standing in six inches of water took away the pleasure. This is a conference hotel, not an individual stay resort. There were three conventions there when we were booked. Our friends were at other Westin on Maui, Westin Garden Inn, I think was the name, and it's beautiful, well maintained, and a much better alternative if you must stay at a Westin. Don't waste any money staying here, unless you are clear as what to expect.

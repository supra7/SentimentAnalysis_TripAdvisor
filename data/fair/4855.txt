If you're a business traveler, stay away from this hotel. Their internet connectivity is provided by a company called Superclick. It tracks every website you go to. What this translates to is slow speeds, random redirects and, most devastatingly, difficulty accessing my secure work email via webmail. Vista noted the snooping, as did my remote email site, which blocked me out half the time. Work that should have been straightforward and easy took three times as long. Otherwise the hotel was nice enough and convenient, but what I'll remember about this stay was the hassle in trying to get my work done. See more about Superclick in "Superclick is Evil": [--]

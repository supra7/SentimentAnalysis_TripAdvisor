We went for a convention and were only staying one night. Granted, it was close to the convention we were attending but this was the only positive for the hotel. It was too much money for what we received. There was no continental breakfast, I got the impression that the staff was put out by having to help the customers, and nothing spectacular about our room. Our room had barley enough space for the two of us and our luggage. I'm glad we only stayed there for one night. Our friend who was also going to the convention spent 30$ less than we did on a hotel that had a microwave in the room, continental breakfast and free parking. (Paramount has a 27$ a day valet). I would only recommend this hotel to someone who has the money to waste and is planning on only sleeping in the hotel.

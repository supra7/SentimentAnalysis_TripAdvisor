Well we just got back this eve. The hotel is ok if you just need a place to sleep for the night that is cheap . The room was clean but not large. We had water in our carpet from a leak in the heater. The heater is a old radiator,that we could not get to shut off , and we were on the bottom floor in room 153 .So we could not leave the windows open at night . Yes there is a small kitchen . . The hotel is next to the liquor store so a few bums sat out side our window waiting for the store to open . The best part of our trip was the door man Adam . There service is very good , as they really try hard with what they have to work with . Adam made our stay and was really help full . . The shuttle runs on a time frame . So if you need to take it, you have to plan ahead .The hotel is old and a bit worn , so dont expect the Hilton . Good Luck .

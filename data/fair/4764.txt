This is a beautiful hotel. It is brand new and the photos are accurate. All of the people that we encountered were nice and though little English is spoken they do try. HOWEVER, we had a 2 bedroom 1,500 sq. foot suite. At 12:30 at night the locked door is opened and the porter proceeds to bring a woman and a young child into our room. (this is a true story) I jump out of bed and confront them and all of a sudden  no English. They make a motion that they are going into the adjoining room where my 3 kids are sleeping and I tell them no and point to get out -- which they do. I then call the front desk the manager is unavailable but will call me back right away. I wait 3 minutes and call again. This time he gets on and is aware of what just happened. He does not apologize just tells me that the system showed my room as available and thats why no knock on the door, no hello? just right in  at 12:30 at night. I was irate I admit that. He tells me the Manager will contact me in the morning. 3 days pass the manager never contacted me. I check out  pay my bill in full and the lady says that I can send the manager a letter. Well, Trip Advisor has been a useful resource to me and so this is my letter. Caveat Emptor for the Trip Advisor readers. As for the Hotel Manager  you kind of suck.

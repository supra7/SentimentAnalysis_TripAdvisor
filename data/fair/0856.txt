My husband and I stayed here for a convention/awards ceremony put on by his company. The company paid for everything, so I can't complain about money or value, but this place was disgusting. Even the cheapest places should be clean, let alone a 4-star ocean front hotel. We were in one of the last groups to arrive from the airport (11pm), and no king rooms were available, so we were given two double beds. We were tired, so the first thing I did was turn down my bed. I was horrified to find 4 or 5 long black head-hairs up at the top of the bed, and 2 more "insidious" small hairs in the middle of the bed. Needless to say, neither of us would sleep in that bed, as it obviously had not had the sheets changed, so for two nights we both slept in one somewhat cramped double bed. The bathroom also had many hairs along the floor and in the tub. Though the hotel was new and had a very pretty design, I can't give it more than two stars for neglecting to perform very basic essential hygiene practices.

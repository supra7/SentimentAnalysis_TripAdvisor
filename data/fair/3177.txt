Although the pools were great, the room was shabby and ugly. Not very romantic. The TV was at least 30 years old, the towels thin and worn, and the decor very bad a70's style. Other than being old and outdated, the room was right by the street, and very noisy. For almost $200 a night, it was a rip-off. It's better to stay somewhere nice, and just come there for the use of the pools.

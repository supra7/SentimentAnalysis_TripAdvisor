My husband and I stayed here before our Alaskan cruise. We arrived didn't wait too long to check in. We were given our room waited forever for the elevator to the 17th floor. Opened the door and there was underware on the bed (unmade bed) hairbrush in bathroom and didn't look any further. Went got another room thank goodness the bellhop was with us this time to the 26th floor oh yeah had to wait again to go down and up need more elevators. Went to our new room and keys did not work bell hop took care of it. Then while waiting for him we attempted to turn on the tv and it didn't work so they sent a repair man. It did get fixed but stopped working. gave up. Check out was okay didn't complain because they already had our complaints and didn't do anything. (I work in a service industry and you should not have to complain to get things the way they should be if there is a problem you know and remedy it and check how things are going) Breakfast buffet in hotel is good. Well, this experience has soiled my image of crowne plaza We usually do not stay in fancy hotels I guess we expected too much had much better rooms and service at Days Inn and Comfort inn.

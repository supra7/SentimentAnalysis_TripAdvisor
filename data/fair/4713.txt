This hotel is not a four star property. It is more on par with a Holiday Inn. If you have a choice, stay at the Westin down the beach or the Four Seasons in Wailea. The Sheraton suffers from horrible customer service, and is overrun with conventions. The restaurants are mediocre at best, the pool is average, and the property is not well-maintained. I have been to Maui over 20 times, and this is the first and last time I will stay at the Sheraton. The one plus to this property is the unbeatable location on Black Rock.

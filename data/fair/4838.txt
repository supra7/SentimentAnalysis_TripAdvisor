The rooms are very very small. They already look small in the pictures, but the pictures are misleading - they are even smaller. The double bed is a big single bed. The washrooms including the shower are at the size of an airplane's washroom. There is no separate place to shower - there is just a hose near the toilet. Two people cannot walk in the room at the same time. The elevator is extremely slow, and there is usually a long queue to it. Rooms are clean. Book this hostel only if you are a broke backpacker who is not willing to spend a few extra dollars for a better place.

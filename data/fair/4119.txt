We stayed at the Kensington Park Hotel 19/01/08 for 4 nights. Although the hotel is in a reasonable area ie The Financial District we found the hotel to be very tired and worn even though we were given what they described as a refurbished room. The carpet in our room which was situated on the 12th floor was dirty and the heating system looked and worked like something from the ark and did not warm the room in the slightest. The windows were extremely draughty and housekeeping were very noisy early in the morning talking loudly outside our room even though we were displaying a do not disturb sign on our door. We paid $130 per night however we would not use this hotel again. A tour of Alcatraz was the highlight of our stay and is a must if you visit San Fransisco. Book direct with Alcatraz Tours at pier 33 near Fishermans Wharf you will save a lot rather than booking it with a tour company.

Wanted a 3-day vacation with hubby and booked an accessible room with roll-in shower. Called front desk to confirm accessible room and they had it wrong. So they promised it was down and everything was fine. Showed up ( Dew Tour was in town, didn't know that when I booked it) and our room wasn't available until the next night, a mix-up again! So, we had to change rooms the next day (thank goodness I showered before we left) which basically killed our day. Then we finally get to the accessible room and the door to the b/r isn't wide enough! Even if it was the b/.r was so tiny you couldn't maneuver a w/c in there anyway. So I spent the remaining 2 days cleaning up in the kitchen sink. Thank goodness we were prepared w/ a trash bag to wash my hair leaning my head back into the sink. I also couldn't go out onto the balcony either and listen to the surf b/c the door wasn't wide enough. Anyone ever hear of the ADA? Also, w/c accessibility ends at the outdoor bar and pool area. From the pics you get the impression that you could go right up to where they're concrete ends and to the hammocks and be able to see the ocean. Not so! Also, the pool area was packed and the band so loud you couldn't think. The only reason this hotel didn't get a terrible rating was the staff. Front desk employees, bellhops were very friendly and did everything they could. Management only offered a refund AFTER I emailed and complained to corporate. A free breakfast doesn't cut it when you offer accessibility and then don't follow the ADA code! Lesson learned, ALWAYS CALL HOTEL AND GET DOOR MEASUREMENTS!

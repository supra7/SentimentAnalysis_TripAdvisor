The location of this hotel is its best asset! We were able to walk to everything in Boston Common and surrounding hot spots and get cabs for only the real far-away places like Fenway and the harbor. The lobby and hotel amenities are okay and average -surely not of park plaza style and comfort (like we had expected for the $275 a night rate - and that was the hotels.com special rate!). Most of the hotel staff are rude and impatient with tourists. The rooms were by far the most horriable experience we've had in a very long time. There was definately a mold problem. Our air conditioner was of poor quality and not even working. The room was damp, smelly and the bathroom was the size of telephone booth! You had to turn the shower water off to soap up because there was no room to manuever with bathroom products while bathing - very bad! The pictures on the site do not show you the amazingly small/issues of the rooms. Granted it is an old hotel from the 1920s so location was great - but because it was rennovated we expected more from the Park Plaza company. The price was way too steep for the quality. My guess is they are charging this high because of its location. Try the Marriott or Raddison - which is one block from this hotel - same location better price and quality.

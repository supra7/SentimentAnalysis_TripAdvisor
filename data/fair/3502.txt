This hotel is threadbare and in need of renovation. It was probably superb a few years ago, but now it looks old and tired and dirty. I am unsure what I was actually tipping the cleaners for! The location is fab but this doesn't make up for poor service (it took 3 days to mend our safe.) This is a very expensive hotel that sells itself on it being funky. Its not. Shop around, your money is best spent elsewhere.

The location is considered good as it is near to Van Gogh & Rijks museum. Not to memtion very close to Vondelpark, Hard Rock Cafe and river cruise station. However, there's much to be desired on the rooms' side. It is undoubtedly clean but very, very basic and there is no air conditioning system or even a fan. The windows can't be open widely as it is the bottom lever type. There was only about 3 inches of space for natural air or wind to come in. It was sooo hot when i was there that we couldn't stay in the room in the day time. When we come back at night, it is still stuffy and warm. This is too bad as the other aspects of the hotel is not too bad. Although a little bit too pricey.

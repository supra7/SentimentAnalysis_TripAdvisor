Miscommunication among staff Stayed at the Marina Inn twice in the winter. No issues during the first stay with my boyfriend except for room service that kept knocking when we had the do not disturb sign out. It had a quaint, bb-like decor although small. We found the inn to be a good value in the more residential Marina district than the expensive, touristy Union Square area and was able to save on parking with the cheap parking in a lot across the street or, on a day we were lucky, free street parking.Second stay, however, was the last. We paid more for a larger room than our first stay but it was still small. The window did not fully close all the way, and San Francisco's cold at night. Also found blood stains on the comforter. The staff at the front desk said there were no other rooms available but gave us a new comforter. During my shower late that night, I found that the tub was clogged and would not drain. This time, the night person agreed to move us to another room which was more spacious and since it was late, told us to drop off our key the next morning which we did. When it came time for us to check-out the third day, first they couldn't find any record of us. They finally realized that when we were moved into the other room, we weren't entered into the computer so they checked us out when we returned the first room's key the day before. Then because of the problems we had with the room, they gave us the billing department number to call to get at least a 10% discount for the trouble we went to. However, upon calling that number, they said that we were actually moved into an upgraded room and therefore won't get any compensation.Definitely not worth all the trouble. Looking around, there were a couple of more spacious, cleaner inns with their own parking lots at the same or a lower rate within walking distance of this inn.

Not really worth the money at all. The owners obviously have no regard for maintaining the building; out of 5 days, my rubbish bin was only emptied once (on day four); room was depressing and the bathroom sink way too small to use even for brushing your teeth. The only redeeming feature was an extremely pleasant and helpful receptionist - although for large amounts of time the reception is unmanned. Prostitutes appear to frequent the rooms too.

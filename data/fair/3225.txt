We broke our rule and did not stay at the Ritz Carlton. This was based on our recent stay at a Waldorf property in Orlando which was tremendous. This is a beautifully restored hotel. It is worth a walk through and the art deco bar is worth a visit. The staff was helpful. The problem is you stay in a hotel for the rooms and the food. The main restaurant, Sazerac, was terrible. The duck had no flavor and the chicken was greasy. Why can't they find a cook in the south who can cook fried chicken? We had a suite with a bathroom so small you could not turn around. It had a shower, no tub. This is still an old building. The safe in the closet, unless locked, would stay open and it blocked the door to the closet from opening. The soap dish had rust. The walls and carpet were stained. The mirror over the desk had a large crack. If you had a large hanging bag with wheels you could not roll it to the closet because the area between the bed and dresser was not wide enough. Poor planning. The towels were kept in the closet on the opposite side of the bathroom. If you forgot a towel and were in the shower you had to get out of the shower, walk through the bedroom to the closet to retrieve the towel. There was not enough room in the bathroom to put the towels. They had an electronic "dishoner" bar and evidently walking by it triggers a charge. We never used anything out of the bar but were charged. They did take that off. We had trouble at another Hilton property before with the elevators and on the morning we left they only had one (of four) elevators running on the tower we were in and it was always loaded. There is no coffee in the room so you have to go to the lobby to get morning coffee. There is no complimentary morning coffee. The coffee bar, Teddy's, was actually decent for small items however we calculated we could have stayed on the club floor at the Ritz Carlton and basically paid the same price as the up charges for the coffee and muffins, etc.

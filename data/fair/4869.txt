We're frequent visitors to Chicago and were curious to try out this hotel. We got a great winter rate ($99/night). When we checked in in the evening the staff were very pleasant, cheerful and competent. We threw our bags down in our room after a quick once over and went out to meet our friend's new baby. The room was nicely decorated in a modern style and bigger then I expected, with plush furniture and nice window treatments. Sadly we didn't notice the three very large chunks of peeling paint hanging from the shower ceiling or the mildew stains all over the shower floor. The mildew I could live with, but the big (over 6 inches) pieces of paint barely attached to the ceiling really grossed me out. We didn't notice until right before bed, so we thought we'd just ignore it and let them know in the morning when we checked out since they seemed so nice when we checked in. When we were checking out we told the woman behind the desk and she didn't care at all. She didn't apologize for the state of the bathroom and just laughed it off. I wish I had taken pictures, it was that disgusting. Too bad, because the hotel does have a lot of potential.

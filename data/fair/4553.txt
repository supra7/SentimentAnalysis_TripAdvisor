Since New Owner, Dissappointing As the Kahala Mandarin Oriental, this was among the top three places to stay and visit on Oahu and my favorite. Since the Mandarin Oriental sold the hotel, however, it has been a disappointment. The location is still prime and the rooms are lovely but the extra amenities that make a hotel superior are disappearing. The staff still tries its best, but seems to be demoralized. The Plumeria Cafe, which was one of the best places to eat in Honolulu (both for hotel guests and others), is now mediocre at best. Gone is the 'legendary' and delicious lunch and dinner buffet which has been replaced by a limited and tasteless menu. You are better off leaving the premises for your meals and going to the Honolulu Academy or any other venue for excellent food. (By the way, Tokyo, Tokyo--another in-hotel restaurant was equally mediocre in taste and service)The spa too is no longer what it used to be--too many changes and uncertainties. Trully disappointing to see what once was one of the best, most beautiful and relaxing hotels on Oahu loose its lustre. The Kahala Mandarin Oriental was worth every penny; the new Legendary Kahala is well overpriced for what it offers. Sorry.

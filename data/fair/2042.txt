I stay at this hotel on a regular basis and this is your typical Marriott in looks and feel. Nothing to be excited about it. What really shocked me on this occasion was the way I was treated by one of their staff while using their gym. I had barely started to work out when one of the staff cleaning the floor stopped and told me in a very aggressive tone to stop dropping weights as it was very noisy. I thought it was some kind of joke but no. He said there was a conference downstairs and I was too noisy and that the weights were obviously too heavy for me. He told me very to stop or he would call security. I could not believe my ears. Calling security? Where was I? In a 4 star hotel or in jail? I have been training for more than 15 years and know about gym etiquette and would never drop weights in an inconsiderate way. It is a gym not a library and it is meant to be noisy every now and then. I was so gobsmacked that I left and went to the Front desk and had a word with one of their managers. Don't think they will do anything about it. I have been travelling extensively for the last 15 years and cannot recall being treated in such a disrespectful manner.

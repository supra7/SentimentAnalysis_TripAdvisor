I love character hotels, and rate some older hotels as my very favorites. But the San Carlos is just dingy and inadequate. The rooms look like a place you check in to kill yourself (maybe that's why the windows don't open): drab, featureless, and slighltly dirty. Cracked tiles throughout the tiny bathroom. No room service, no restaurant really on site (there is something called the Ghost Lounge, but it's just a dusty, joyless bar). The fitness center is a random room with a few machines scattered about, including a non-functioning treadmill. Ignorant staff -- I asked for directions to a meeting that was just two blocks away, and was sent in the opposite direction. And all this for $199 a night.

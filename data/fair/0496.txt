This is a good location as it is so close to the University of Washington campus. It was also very close to a bridge which was a huge plus on July 4th as we watched the fireworks from the bridge. But the room was disappointing. There was no bathtub! Who would ever have thought you would have to specifically request a bathtub? ("Shower/tub combination" apparently means shower only). As I am a tub person this was a major shock. The staff in the hotel were disinterested. The lack of a restaurant hurt as the restaurant next door was not open all day. There are a lot of other restaurants within walking distance if you don't mind a bit of a hike. But the Portage Bay Cafe next door served my travelling companion the worst breakfast he has ever had. A month later he is still talking about how absolutely dreadful it was. Cold, over-cooked and tasteless. To give them credit, they did not charge him for it, but it put him off his food all day.

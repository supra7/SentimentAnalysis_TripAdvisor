It just gets 2 out of five points because to get only one from me you have to make me sleep on the floor! Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!! I booked it on hotwire. 130$ per night, 2 people. We arrive there and they say that hotwire doesn't guarantee 2 single beds and so they don't have them (unless we pay 20 $ more, so this means they have them!!!). For us it was ok to stay in one bed, but they gave us a SINGLE QUEEN bed, and as we are two boys we don't obviously fit! Expecting a king size, we call and the best they could offer was a KING in a SMOKING room. Hoping it was more or less ok we accepted. It was literally a smoking room, like those in the airports: it was even impossible to breathe inside there. Really disappointed, after that they've been making fun of us for more than an hour, we complain again and finally we get something decent (acceptable, but still a rob for me): a SINGLE room with an additional temporary bed. BUT WE PAID FOR A DOUBLE. We felt like thieves there!!! I will never go there anymore unless I'll be able to afford the top suites at full price. Never ever dare to book them on hotwire (and similar I would say)! And the staff was so unpleasant and really not friendly at all, caring only about who had the Hilton club card (whatever it is called). I still wonder how that hotel could be part of the Hilton network after my experience!!!

Hotel is in a fantastic location across the street from the Mandarin Oriental. The worst part is the security. You enter from street level (no lobby) w/ your key card and then take the elevator straight to your floor of rooms. You never have to pass the lobby/reception. I entered the hotel as others were leaving a few times. The room is completely not functional. The rooms are large and we had a balcony which was nice. Our 16 mo son loved walking around the room. The sinks are two tall cylinders with absolutely not one inch of counter space. You have to leave your soap in the sink after you use it and Ladies, good luck putting on make up!! The glass doors on the shower and toilet leave you no modestly whatsoever and the same goes for getting in and out of the shower. The floors are very slippery when wet. It's just a disaster. They also only give you two towels. Period. No washcloths and forget a box of tissues. You pay so much money for the room and it feels the same as my cramped NYC apartment. Yuck. Also there were bugs all over the bathroom and our phone wouldnt accept calls from abroad to be transferred.

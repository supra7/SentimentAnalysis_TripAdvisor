Our family went for our 4th visit to the Westin Ocean Villa Resorts, which we really love to do. Since the Sheraton is a sister property, and they had a good dinner deals at the Sheraton, we decided to try the Sheraton Steak and Fish House. Our waitress was great, great setting and the seafood dishes were pretty good. However, my wife had one of the worse steaks she ever had. Probably should stay away from steak there. She should have sent it back. The bizarreness began when trying to get my car. I had to go to the front desk to pay for the parking. I was literally in line for 30 minutes to retrieve my car with no end in sight, since they had one night person that was either really slow or dealing with lots of problems. I would still be there I think if my wife did not go to the parking desk, that took pity on us. At one point, a manager type came out to help someone with a problem, and when she was done, I said I have been waiting 20 minutes just to pay for my car. She literally turned around and ignored me. A real cold shoulder. Any rate, I am Starwood Gold and stay at Starwood hotels, but will never step into that Sheraton again for any reason. We had also planned to try another restaurant at that Sheraton, but cancelled. Normally I would not publically complain, but when a manager just ignores you and leaves you to rot in a slow, slow line with one desk clerk, I think that is worthy of a public comment. That shows there is something not right at this hotel in my mind. This is the first Starwood property where I would never stay. Compared to the Westin just down the road, the difference is dramatic. Frankly, the place looks like it should be torn down and rebuilt.

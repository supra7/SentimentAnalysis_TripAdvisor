Hip but Hopeless My husband and I stayed at the Clift the weekend before Christmas. He had originally thought of the Clift because as it was a weekend away from our children, we would enjoy staying in a hip hotel, having a drink at the Redwood and enjoy the hotel's proximity to everything downtown. BUT--the reality was: In our first room the walls were so thin we could hear lilterally every word of our neighbors (and therefore they could also hear ours). We were given a tip that the best rooms were on the 17th floor. So we asked to be moved to that floor and we felt lucky that they had a room available, but the room had it's own issues, right next to the elevator shafts. So all night long we heard the whooshing of the elevators going up and down. So onto the third room the next morning. Luckily they finally took care of us and put us into a suite, but it was a little too late. Half of our weekend was over and we spent way too much time trying to resolve our room issues. Next time we'll do it the right way and stay at the Mandarin or the Four Seasons. For not much more per night, we'll be hassle-free.

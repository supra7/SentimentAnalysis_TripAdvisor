This was a disappointing experience from check in to departure. Check in desk person had an attitude issue and started out our stay poorly. I am sure the lousy location of our room was her way of expressing her power over our stay. We had a lovely view of the roof with huge spotlights to light our stay. Just lovely. A warning siren went out on the first day and continued to shreik the same message for 30 minutes. We had no A/C the first night and awoke to a system wide failure on Day 2 that resulted in cold showers that morning and that evening before dinner. A letter from Mr. Wynn stated it was the only time in his history such a thing has happened. Just there at the right time apparently. Food was overpriced for quality and portion size. A very small bowl of fresh berries in the cafe had a 12.95 price tag and a veggie omellette was 15.95. And it was indeed just the omellette, not even served with a slice of toast. I had to ask three people to get a cup of coffee and the restaurant was almost empty. Luckily, we were close to the Capital Grille and Postrio at the Venetian so were able to enjoy two nice dinners with excellent food and service. Pools undersized for a resort of this size. Very little in the way of personal service. We are not fans of Las Vegas but expected to be wowed at Encore. It was a yawn.

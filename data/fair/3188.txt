Just got back! Spent 2 nights here and 2 nights at the Villagio Inn and Spa in Yountville. The Villagio was first so this place had alot to live up to. We were on vacation with another couple and each had our own rooms. Let me first say I don't like the decor of this place and probably shouldn't have stayed here. Having said that it was ok at best. We were upgraded to an executive sweet and who doesn't appreciate that. Room was 2 stories and filled with all the problems you have making a bedroom in the attic with a bathroom. It had charm and character but for the price I expected more. The View from the balcony of our room was Wonderful! Right in the vineyard that is for sure. Nice grounds assuming you want to walk through a wedding reception on the way to your room everytime. Our friends had some problems however. When we got to their room it really smelled like fireplace smoke. More like burned out building smoke. They called and someone came and sprayed something to make it smell better. MY MAIN PROBLEM with this place happened to my friends who returned in the afternoon at 3pm after being gone for more than 6 hours to find that their room had not been cleaned. Oh they started but then closed the front door and left without making the bed, cleaning bathroom etc. Did you notice I said Front door. Yes the door leading out to their porch with a view was left wide open and yes it is on the ground floor. I'm horrified just thinking about it. Noone was around either. It's not like the staff went next door for a minute. Bottom line this is NOT a first Class hotel. Will never stay here again. Villagio blew them out of the water in every way. Same price.

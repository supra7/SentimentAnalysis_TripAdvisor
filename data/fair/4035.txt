The website is lovely... can't say the same for the hotel. The best thing I can say about this hotel is that they have a lovely website -------. And admittedly, everything on the website is technically true. For example, they do have personal safes in every room. However, as the owner will eagerly inform you, they don't actually have keys for them. The bathroom did have an antique, claw-foot tub. You could tell it was antique because all of the paint was chipping off. The front door is indeed secure with a coded entry pad, but you'll probably have to make a separate trip down to the owner's office in the basement to get the entry code, since he'll forget to tell you. Check-in time is, in fact, three pm, and they even let us check in a few minutes early. However, we couldn't actually get into our room until three thirty, because it hadn't been cleaned yet. Oh, and don't assume that the reservations you made will correspond with what you actually get. They somehow overbooked the first night we were there and reserved us a room at the Beresford Arms around the corner (an infinitely nicer place) instead. They notified us of this by taping an envelope to the front door with my name spelled incorrectly on it. The website claims it has room service, but as nearly as we could tell, it consisted of handing us a photocopy of addresses of local restaurants and liquor stores. The basket of breakfast beverages was just generic ground coffee. It wasn't all bad, honestly - there were clean plates, cups, and silverware, a toaster and a microwave, and all that. And the bathtub is big enough for two people, which is nice. Just... don't expect too much.

This hotel is in a good location being a hop, skip and a jump away from the Flat Iron Building. The rooms, for New York, aren't a bad size and there is room to move in the bathrooms. Although there are only 2 lifts we rarely had to wait very long and they are a decent size. Then the negatives........ On check in a quiet room was specifically asked for. The room we were given had an air conditioning vent outside the door which was rathernoisy and irritating and went 24/7. I spoke to a helpful chap at reception who said that we could move room the following day (it was getting quite late at this point and we didn't want to pack to move that night) The following morning we went to talk to the females at reception and they sorted out a new room. We got up there and it was mich quieter so imagine our shock when we got back that night to find that it sounded like a plane was taking off in the room. It was literally vibrating. Every few minutes it would swich off then come back again. I think it was an air con unit for the adjoining building. I wanted to sob. All we wanted was a quiet room. I accept that there are sirens, traffic noise etcin cities but this was beyond what I would expect in any hotel regardless of location. I went and mentioned it to the guy on reception and was basically called a liar. On another occassion our keys stopped working but rather than apologise I was told it was my fault as I must have had it with a credit card (which I hadn't). This level of customer service I find unacceptable. We also had issues with a broken shower curtain rail but this was fixed promptly. If you want a hotel in this location and are heavy sleepers then it's fine, I personally would never go back.

Don't stay here unless you get a really good rate on the room The decor in the lobby and bar of this hotel is very interesting and modern, and the location is ideal. Also, I was able to check in a couple hours early, which was much appreciated. Everything else was pretty much a thumbs down. First, the hotel has no sign or other identifying marks, requiring much circling around aimlessly. The room was tiny and difficult to maneuver around, leading to many bruises on my leg from the bed frame. The bathroom, as others have noted, ------. The television was tiny and somewhat pathetic (I realize we were not in San Francisco so that we could watch TV, but still). The parking was ridiculously expensive and fairly inconvenient. We even had a voucher for a significant discount on the daily rate, but of course they did not honor it initially, requiring that my already unreasonably long check-out time involve some uncomfortable haggling over whether they would actually honor it (leaving me feeling like somewhat of a cheapskate, but come on -- $46.50/night ($40 for parking and $6.50 parking tax)?! That is scandalous). The waitress in the lobby lounge was horribly rude and pretty much went out of her way to ignore us, brought me a completely undrinkable cocktail that I had no choice but to return (something I've never ever done), and of course overcharged us at the end of the miserable ordeal, again requiring me to negotiate the bill so that we only had to pay for what we ordered and received (as opposed to the things we ordered but never actually got). All in all, it was an okay experience, but certainly did not live up to my expectations for a purportedly nice hotel. Had the weather not been so beautiful and my vacation not otherwise so enjoyable, I might have been more annoyed at my experience at the Clift.

I stayed at the Peabody Orlando during a conference held at the hotel. The rack rate was $300 and the conference rate was $200. My company just about had a cow over this price. For this money and 4 stars, I expected an all inclusive resort type atmosphere. Boy, was I wrong. Check-in took 40 minutes (it does have 25 or 30 stories, with but one desk). There is no complementary airport shuttle like many lowly 2 and 3 star hotels, so I had to rent a car. Breakfast is not complementary. In fact, I spent around $20 for an omelette, hash browns, milk, and juice at their restaurant. That's just rediculous. They charge a fee for a "health club membership" of $7/day instead of having a complementary gym. In fact, just about everything at this hotel costs extra that is included at hotels costing 1/2 to 1/3 as much. The room was no different from those hotels, either. I would expect a whirlpool, suite, and kitchenette for this price. I kept shaking my head trying to figure out what makes it a 4 star hotel. I even asked the management, and their answer was that they have all these facilities available on site (but for and additional fee). Even the duck parade was a major let down. How lame! On the positive side, it does have a pretty lobby, but its size just makes it that much farther from the parking lot (a 5 minute walk to the elevators) to your room. Stay somewhere else unless someone else is paying your bill.

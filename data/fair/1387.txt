Upon arrival we were surprised to see that the reception desk of a 4 star hotel is like a cubicle. Communication was a struggle as none of the staff can speak English though they acted friendly. A clean standard room,no bath(just shower) and you can hear the noise from the next room. It's appalling that the towels were not changed for 5 days, although they tidy the room everyday. Breakfast is boring, we ate mostly outside. No ironing facilities,no kettle to make hot drinks at night,thinking that this is a 4 star we were talking about. The spa is a laugh, the space is so small .The location is hard to find,luckily we booked a shuttle so we were dropped off in front of the hotel upon arrival otherwise it is so hard to find. It's near the Ottaviano metro ok but there are hotels nearer to it. It wasn't worth the price you paid for. Don't be fooled by the pictures.

good location BUT outdated means dirty furniture, carpets etc. If people upstairs use the bathroom you think that your bathroom is exploding. Seriously as long as somebody else uses the bathroom or water you will not be able to sleep. Normally I am easy going and dont need to stay in luxury hotels. just clean and quiet. This hotel fails in both points. every Motel 6 is better

great location, but that is about all I stayed at this hotel because it is close to the Miami Beach Convention Center. It is good location where everything is within walking distance, but after arriving at Miami beach I realised almost everything is within walking distance.The room itself is in desperate need for upates. However, the hotel is repainting the outside, so they obviously realise that. The service was ok to minimal. The room does not provide complimentary slippers, and the carpet does not look like it is clean enough to walk bare foot on. A few things that that is good about this hotel is that it has an OK pool out back, and walks out to the beach, which is nice. Also our room has nice corner view of the beach, which makes it worth while.Next time I go to Miami I will definitely try another hotel.

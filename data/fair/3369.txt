Location? Great. Price? Affordable (we opted for the cheaper, smaller first floor rooms). However both of these things did not make up for the surprise waiting for us when we arrived and checked out the room. Inside our dresser drawer was a used syringe, as well as a burnt, bent spoon. The room was also damp and not as clean as it should have been. The managment's resonse to our complaint was awfully casual, as if this had happened before. They did refund one night's stay (but we had to ask for this), clean the room again and remove the syringe and spoon (not sure if they just threw it away or disposed of it properly). But it was not a good welcome to our first time in the city. I wouldn't take them up on their complimentary breakfast either: rat trap in the dinning room. We stayed here in May of 2005, based off favorable reviews from TripAdvisor, as well as a personal recommendation from a friend who had stayed here a few years before.

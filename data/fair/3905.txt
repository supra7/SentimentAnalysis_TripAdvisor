Atter reading all the positive feedback for the Cow Hollow I booked 4 nights. We found the staff very unfriendly, the rooms small, and the traffic noise shocking. Location is good and there are some nice restaurants nearby. If I knew what I knew now I would have got a hotel closer to Fisherman's Wharf.

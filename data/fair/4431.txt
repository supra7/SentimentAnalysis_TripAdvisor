Westin is among my favorite hotel chains, so I was very surprised by the indifferent treatment I rec'd from the front desk and concierge staff at this property. Colleagues staying at the same hotel had a similar experience. When I called for a blow dryer it never showed up. OK, mistakes happen. So I called again and was assured it was on the way. Nope. After a third call, I had to leave so mentioned at the front desk and then it arrived after another 2 hours wait. I'm frankly baffled. For clarity, maids and bellhops were quite helpful, but I couldn't buy a smile or polite/helpful word from the concierge and had the same problem several times with some (but not all) of the front desk staff. They did appear to be having a good time talking amongst themselves, however. The room was fine and clean but again I had to call when they forgot to clean it on a given day.

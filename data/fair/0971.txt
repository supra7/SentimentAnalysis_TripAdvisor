This hotel had really good reviews which is why I booked it. It was old, (which is why it was very quiet and uncrowded) . I will have to say it was clean and well kept. The beds were not comfortable nor the pillows. The restaurant food was awful. We usually stay in really nice hotels and this was such a disappointment. The reviews talk about how friendly the staff is. I did not find that at all. The only friendly ones were the valet, which we tip very well. The concierge booked a helicopter ride for us, but he was a real jerk about it and acted if we were bothering him when we asked questions. The soda machines never worked and they ran out of beach towels. If you like nice hotels with nice rooms restaurants don't stay here. If you want just a cup of coffee in the morning, there is a convenience store out front to get it with fake cream. NO ROOM SERVICE EITHER!!

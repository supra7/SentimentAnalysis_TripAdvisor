Very noisy, very bare and the most uncomfortable bed ever. The only hotel I had to wear ear plugs in because I could not sleep with all the noise. The breakfast was very minimal and not worth the free price. I'm a tiny girl and I had major issues fitting into the shower and being able to turn around in it. Every day we had to ask for towels because there was never any left in our room. My mother and I laughed about it to keep in good spirits but we would never stay there again and would never recommend it to anyone. The only good thing was it was in a nice part of town and close to a tube station, so you could get away from it quickly.

I stayed at the Copley Marriott for almost a week. There are no services offered despite the high charges. NO internet services unless one pays extra in this day and age !! Even the smaller hotels and hostels in Boston apparently were offering Internet services. The front desk was very rude to say the least...appalling for any kind of hospitality services not to speak of a hotel of this scale. They laugh off your queries almost making fun of you ! and the final icing on the cake was a sudden appearance of a security Guard at your hotel room at about 9 PM asking you to report to the front desk immediately for they had some weird problem with the Credit card. We were told that we had to go with him immediately or else he would stay at the door till we comply ...sounded like being at the Police station !! Afterwards on reaching dowstairs (27 floors) we were told that all was well and that they had some initial problem with the card !! This I thought was a very rude behaviour from the staff overall when facilities were available to call us on the phone or even sort it out at a more suitable time !! The swimming pool/GYM / Jacuzzi faicilities for a big hotel of this size looked to be of a miniature size !!

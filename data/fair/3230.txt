After visiting the most beautifully decorated lobby in New Orleans with family trying to decide on a place to stay for the holidays I TRIED to order something from the gift shop to be shipped. Gift shop mgr Sarah Buchman was cordial on the phone but after 4 e-mails and 3 phone calls I discovered the order had NEVER gone out! her explanation. " I LET THE WEEKEND GET AWAY FROM ME". At this point it was a week later and my guest were no longer at home to receive the gift. After 2 phone messages to the hotel mgr. went unreturned I dont have a very high opinion of this hotel. I worked in the service industry for over 30 years this was unbelievable.

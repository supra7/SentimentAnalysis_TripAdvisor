Booked the room via Priceline for $90 as a weekend getaway. Seemed like a good deal. But buyer beware. This is an old Swissotel in the midst of a renovation. This is NOT a typical Hyatt Regency in any way (I have stayed at 3 other Regency's this year). I'll tell you about the bathroom. Missing bulbs showed a lack of attention (but the extra darkness was welcome). Rust on the bar for what was supposed to be clean towels made one worry about how well anything else was cleaned (took a photo with the camera phone, low quality but you'll get the point). They also do not provide soap/shampoo unless you request it -- otherwise the shower and sink have on-wall hand-pump dispensers that you would otherwise see in the shower at the gym. The staff was nice enough. The TV screen in the room at checkout asked for guests to call the front desk if there is anything that would prevent a guest from rating a "5" if called for a satisfaction survey. I shared the info above, and they were very understanding (gave a comp for breakfast). They cited the ongoing renovation project. I was very aware of the renovation -- it started before 9am on Sunday morning. The hammering and drilling were a pretty good clue that there was construction going on. Other items: * We did breakfast by room service which was good quality and very quick * There is a gym with a pool, but you would not believe how many levels of stairs you have to descend to get there! * Parking is via valet ($36) or self-park ($20) at an unaffiliated garage somewhat attached to the hotel Overall -- unless I was committed a room that had the renovation and was FAR FAR away from the construction zone, I would avoid the hotel for now. At this time, this is a Hyatt Regency in name-only. If you get a good price and are comfortable with a mid-tier hotel, it's fine. But do not expect a Regency-quality experience yet.

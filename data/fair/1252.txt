We have stayed in a number of Marriott Courtyard Hotels on our annual Summer holidays to the US. We have found that their standard varies quite a lot. Some are excellent whilst others are very poor; unfortunately, this hotel fell into the latter category. We landed at PHL and needed a bed for a night, a pool for the children to unwind in and somewhere to eat. We found that the hotel room was adequate, although it looked tired and we did not have the pillows on our beds thta we pre-ordered on their website. The pool was small, which we knew, but it was being used by a large number of unsupervised and very noisey children. The hotel staff appologised for this but it still ruined our stay after an 8 hour flight. The food in the resataurant was poor, although it was not expensive and the staff were friendly. The restaurant was dirty. Overall a below average stay especially so given that we paid $190 for the experience. I would not stay here again.

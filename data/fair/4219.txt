We stayed there a few days last week. The staff is wonderful and ready and willing to help with any problem which we had one big problem. But, the hotel is smelly and very outdated. I think that many beachfront hotels have the same type of problems. You pay sooo much money for hotels up there until you expect sometimes more than you get. The pool with swim up bar is great. There is also a snack bar beside the pool. We will not stay there next year. There were some other people we knew that stayed there and felt the same way.

As noted in a previous review, the hotel is now refusing to honor their original commitments regarding when a voucher can be used and the level of discount it brings. Please read the hotel's response to the last reviewer in which they say "This gold card program is very value driven and is a program that comes with a number of restrictions attached to it, restrictions that do change according to business demands." Of course, a simple translation of this prose would be "a deal is not a deal if we decide it's better for us to unilaterally change the conditions...." In other words "too bad for you, sucker." Dear Reader, you have a choice of the people with whom you want to do business. I heartily suggest that you take your trade elsewhere. with Aloha a Maui resident

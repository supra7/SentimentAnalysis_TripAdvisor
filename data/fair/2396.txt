What a terrible experience we had at the Burnham Hotel Chicago. We booked a room with two queen beds over two weeks in advance. when we arrived at the hotel we were told that policy is "first come, first serve" and all they had left was a small single! WHAT! Thats crazy. They already took the money out of our account two weeks prior when we booked the room. We were told there was a room with two queens available at that time. What's the purpose of a reservation if you don't get the room you requested. The people at front desk seemed to think that was perfectly ok to to give our room away and not even offer any compensation or even assistance finding us alterative accomadations. Consenquintly , we had to scramble around Chicago to find a another room to accomadate the rest of our party. Terrible customer service!

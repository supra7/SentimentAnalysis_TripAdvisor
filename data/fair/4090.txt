When one says they are the best of the best, I expect them to back that up. But they didn't. Good: nice hotel, rooms are decorated modern, casino nice to look at, pool is great as well The restaurants and bars are fabulous as well. Bad: No coffee in the room, the snacks in the room have a sign stating that if you remove anything for more then 60 seconds, you will be charged for it. They do this by the weight. Everything is expensive (no surprise here). Worse: We had 2 rooms booked with queens, desk said too bad, since the fine print does not grantee this, even though we called back after making the reservations to double check. Manager said same thing, and that there was nothing he could do. Wasn't too apologetic either. Had that, I don't care attitude. Waited 2 hours for our server to finally come back to us at the pool for a drink order. 2 hours!

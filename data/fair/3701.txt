I stayed at the Peabody Orlando with my pregnant wife in May 2010. The hotel is very clean and has lots of amenities, but ruins itself by nickle and diming and having the worst parking setup of any hotel i've ever stayed at. At check in we were told that only smoking rooms were available, and that we'd have to pay an extra $35 a night for a non-smoking room. We agreed to the extra since neither of us could stand a smoking room. They then told us we had to pay a mandatory $15 per night service fee for 2 bottles of water in our room and passes for the bus that goes down I-Drive (which we have no need for). After this I went to park, the parking lot is about 1/2 miles away from the main entrance, and you have to walk thru a construction site with no side walks. It was raining, so I had to walk uncovered all the way through a flooded road. They then charge $12 per night to park. Ordered a cheese pizza from room service for the advertised $13.95 since they advertise no delivery fees (figured just add tip and tax.) After taxes and (hidden) fees, but before tip, it came to just under $19. Rooms are nice and clean, but outdated with a very basic television and no amenities such as fridge or coffee maker. Coffee is $5 from room service and very poor quality.

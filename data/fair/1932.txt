this hotel is old, still has the clunky tube tv, cleanliness is below average. all the female staff are nice except for this black dude who worked at the counter. had to deal with him twice on 2 different days but the same [--] attiture remained. 1st time he was unwilling to credit our stay to the marriot rewards point. then the next day he refused to honor the $30 gift card as stated on hotel.com. i had the hotel.com staff on the phone talking to him and he refused to talk to anyone on the phone. so hotel.com end up giving me the $30 as a credit towards my future stay. this man has failed to even pretend to be nice or professional, just plain rude. They also charge double for government rate compare to internet rate, that tells you something about how these people run business. breakfast was nice, standard residence inn hot breakfast, also evening snacks monday to thursday. we stay in residence inn a lot but will never go back there.

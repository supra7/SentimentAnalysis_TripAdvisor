Were recommended this hotel by a couple of strangers we met in San Francisco, so tried it out. The place was almost empty and the listed prices at the desk, for "High Season" (started a day before we got there) was $110 and up. We just wanted to stay and move on, so asked for the best price, which was $149. We thought that didn't agree with the prices listed, but were basically told to take it or leave it. Seemed like a little flexibility would be good if there is 10% occupancy... We didn't feel like looking any further so stayed, nice enough room and the pool looked great, but we didnt have time to try it out. We planned on leaving early in the morning anyway, but at 0800 the leaf blower fired up. It was a good thing we were planning on heading out, that would have been pretty disruptive. Judging by our reception and others in this string of reviews, the staff would likely not have cared. Will not recommend to others, even strangers in a bar...

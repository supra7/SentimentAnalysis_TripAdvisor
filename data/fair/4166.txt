Booked two rooms for ourselves and a couple of friends for a concert at key arena. Lobby is totally small and cheap looking. Staff looks like they are in high school. We got our key and took thier elevator to our room. Elevator jerked to a stop and was briefly stuck. I was freaked out. We went to tell the counter and they stated this was fairly normal. We got to our room and found it small, with the elevator connected to the room. We asked to be move and were put in a room that was twice the size. The other room literally had the elevator in it. The furniture was as cheap as it gets, filthy curtains and a pretty eighties feel to it. Dated, tasteless art. Old carpet with burns and ashes ground into it. The shower in the bathroom was tiny and had a door on it so small that a really heavy set person would be unable to get in. I swear it was a camper shower. No place to set soap or shampoo besides the floor. Our friends room had TV problems and was smaller than ours with a horrible view of the skanky parking lot they share with a bar. Pretty seedy people on the next block. Ice machines were out of ice, making it hard to make a drink in our room. Side staircase smells like hot urine and puke. The carpet is definately from the 70's and was a filthy huge print design coupled by dark woodgrain. We had to take pictures of it because it was so extraordinary. Had people knocking on our door in the middle of the night looking for the obvious drugged out hooker fest going on across the hall. Had to call front desk as party kept spilling into the hall. Thankfully we spent little time in our room. Would not recommend this hotel.

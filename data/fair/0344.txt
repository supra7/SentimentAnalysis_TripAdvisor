Me and my family were staying for 3 nights at the Edgewater over Thanksgiving. The hotel re-confirmed that the room booked has enough space for 5 people. When we checked in it turned out that the beds are ways to small, even for our 3 kids who are only 8 years old. So I had to go for a additional room which of course costs extra. Although the breakfast itself was good the service was really bad. No real attention for a family and at the and they were claiming a higher tip. Unbelivable ! Summery--> Nice view but pretty much far away from a 4 star Hotel.

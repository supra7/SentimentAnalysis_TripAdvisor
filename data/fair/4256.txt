I stayed here one night with a colleague. Both rooms had the same corner-style shower that was terrible, the showerhead is a quasi-rain shower and it is oriented such that the spray escapes when the shower door is open making a mess and a slip hazard. The oncongruous redecorating starts in the bathrooms - nice looking marble tiles, porcelain tubs, stone covered vanity contrasts with the showerhead height s-extender and poorly designed shower. The contrast continues in the room with odd louvered wooden doors to the closet (two doors operate and then a third is affixed to the wall), stained carpet that looks dirty, older style window coverings that were dirty, an eighties-style lamp (somebody confused Miami Vice with real art deco). The wooden furniture's styling is supposed to carry a theme from the lobby fails because it clashes with the carpet style, the usual Marriott bed linens (contemporary, not deco), and generic lamps. The lack of any furniture beside the beds (no nightstand) sharpens the incongruities. Beds seemed old in that the mattresses appeared to be cheaper than those usually in a Marriott and were on older-style metal frames - not comfortable. A few good things: room on the freeway side of the hotel but I did not hear the traffic, the staff was very helpful when it came to directions and finding out whehter our chosed eatery was still open, and the check-in and out were easy (the TV check-out worked), the sleep-timer on the TV worked, and the iron and ironing board appeared to be clean.

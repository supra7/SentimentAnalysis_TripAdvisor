This hotel is located on a back-street in a construction zone in Napa. The facility is new, well appointed and up to Westin standards but the location is totally inconvenient for walking to restaurants, etc. in Napa. Some staff appear to be poorly trained. It took almost an hour to get a simple breakfast in an almost empty restaurant after a comedy of errors. There are much better places to stay in Napa. Only very big positive was the very helpful and very knowledgeable bartender Jim who provided excellent guidance on the wineries and the region.

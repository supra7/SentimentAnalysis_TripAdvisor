Our stay at the Westin has been our worst & most disappointing in several years. Checking in was cold & very impersonnel. First time a hotel wasn't prepared to accept my Visa card as it was a debit card. In the end they did as it was that or nothing. The receptionist ignored us and spoke in another language to another person in the queue behind us. That was our introduction to the Westin & it just went downhill from there. Rooms tired, small, our first room was noisy as it was next to the lift & sounded like an electric sander was being used in our room, in the end we were given a room with 2 double beds - small double beds - not something we expected for the our anniversary. Air cond was noisy, a repair man arrived to fix it even though we never reported the problem, phone continually flashed as if it had a message but it didn't, safe was not working when we arrived, carpet dirty, worn & stretched, furniture worn. Lifts were frequently out of order. Booked for the Luau with a warning that we would be charged if we didn't go to the show but after queuing for over 40 minutes we were advised our name hadn't been included on the list. After speaking to a manager it was sorted out., with numerous apologises. We left very tired not at all relaxed as their ads would suggest. Never before were we ready to leave in a bid to get a comfortable nights sleep. We've stayed in a lot of hotels & this would be one of our poorest experiences. Choose elsewhere if you can.

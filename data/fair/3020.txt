When we checked in we were informed our reservation had been upgraded. They did not tell us it was next to a noisy elevator that runs all night. After a sleepless night, we asked to be downgraded to a room away from the elevator and preferably with 2 double beds that we had requested instead of the king and rollaway we had been upgraded to. We were told it was not possible and basically they did not care. I expected a Westin to be more luxurious instead the rooms were outdated and worn. As our 10 year-old observed, they spent all the money on the lobby and pools and none on the rooms. Pool area is great, especially for kids and the views are wonderful. We just expected more from a Westin than an outdated hotel with poor service.

Pro: It is convenient to subway, only one stop from Columbia; newly renovated bathroom was clean albeit tiny. Con: Very uncomfortable bed, broken TV, tiny room at the end of a long, dark corridor; thumping noise when hot water is on in shower; no closet (over the door coat rack); tiny pieces of furniture were old & battered, like something from a Maine summer house, no heat from the radiator, noise from bathroom next door. It feels like a renovated rooming house and sound travels from the halls the way it does in your house. It's like a high end hostel, not a boutique hotel.

No 3* Hotel Got this hotel through Priceline for $43 a night. We have stayed at the SeaTac Hilton and Doubletree Hotels for the same price in the past and was hoping for the same. No such luck unfortunately.Pros: free parking for guests. One free bottle of water. Newspaper in the morning.Cons: sleep number bed way over-rated. Give me a Heavenly Bed or Hilton bed any night! It was nothing special. The bed linens were plain and did not feel clean. Definitely not luxurious. The bathtub was old and grimy. No rubberized bath mat so the floor of the tub was slippery. Ice machine on the floor did not work. Guest checkout and hotel evaluation on TV did not work. Room moderately quiet- airplane noise not a problem after 11 PM.Bottom line- this is no 3* hotel (2* at best) and I hope we never have to stay here again.

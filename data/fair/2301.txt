Service was exceptional and as business woman traveling solo: neighborhood felt safe if precautions taken (doorman usually around). Signage inside was poor (elevators going up/down? --a mystery). Slighted hotel on rating more b/c Hyatt policy than staff there: pay for WiFi, pay for music via TV, can't move anything in (sensor) mini-bar if wanted to bring in own beverage. Staying 2 nights for almost $800? Throw the Internet in as complimentary. I'd stay elsewhere next time at that rate; there's plenty of choices nearby. (Hyatt, review your policies if you want the business traveler.) Cleaning staff didn't refill toiletries, towel had someone else's makeup on it. Otherwise, superior service from staff!

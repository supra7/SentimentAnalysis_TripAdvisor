My friend booked this hotel for his business event in Dallas and I went along for the ride. We were actually kind of excited about this hotel because it was such a great deal and being a Hyatt we were expecting great quality and service. After the 4+ hour drive we check in and get into our rooms, ready to wash off a bit and realize that the water coming out of the faucets is a dark brown color and smells of sewage. I was mortified. We checked both sinks and the shower and actually got video footage. Then we called the front desk and asked if they were aware of any problems expecting them to be apologetic and maybe even having us move to another hotel. No reaction. They said they'd send someone up to our room. No one ever came so I went downstairs to try to find some potable water. When I turned on the faucet in the ladies down stairs-- same thing! Disgusting. I asked the front desk person if they knew of any plumbing problems and she said no but called her manager. When she was finally able to track someone down by phone he said that yes by the way they had shut the water off earlier in the day and this happens. We should let the water run a while and it should be fine. We never received an apology. No one ever checked up on us to find out if the situation had been resolved. Nothing. Very, very disappointed. And disgusted. How does this happen? Really?

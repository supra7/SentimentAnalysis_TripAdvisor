First, the good news. The Beach Tower was recently remodeled that we stayed in, and it was nicely appointed. A few cheap corners cut, like the toilet seat looked like it was from 1975, and the room was remodeled in 2008. The hotel has a nice pool, that is a bit crowded like all of the hotels in the area. The real problem is the management. Turn down service didnt even happen the first 2 nights of our 4 night stay in an oceanfront suite. when we complained, they made promises that didnt pan out. They seem to want to make the attempt at superior customer service, but just dont execute like the 4 seasons or a Fairmont property (like the Kea Lani we stayed at just prior). No less than 4 different members of managment made customer service promises about turn down service, wristbands for the pool the night prior , etc, that never happened. Really embarrassing in my opinion. This place just doesnt match up to the competition. If you want a quality experience, pay a litle bit more and stay at the Fairmont or Four Seasons, or other. Good luck

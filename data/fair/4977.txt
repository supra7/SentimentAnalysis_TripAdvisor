I took a chance on Hotwire, and what a mistake. It was cheap but Hotwire misrepresented the star rating. They said four stars but to my eyes it is two stars. Starting at the reception, where the paint on the wood trim looks old and five layers thick. The room is old, dated, not renovated for several decades. The air unit was noisy. The room layout was awkward. The TV was old school. The light switch did not work. Bed was good, so was water pressure. Shower curtains were the really thick plastic type that does not bend. It is an embarrassing address. Had to leave. Got no refund, lost two nights. Went to the lovely Dana down the street. Lesson...never again Hotwire.

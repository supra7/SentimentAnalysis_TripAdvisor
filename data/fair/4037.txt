We stayed here a few years ago and saw Garth's show. I thought it was nice so thought we would go back but was very unhapply when we went to book the room. This time we planned to a 7 night stay and they acted like they were doing me a favor to stay at the Hotel. I guess they don't realize they have other really nice hotels in town that are not on the edge of the strip. That was the thing I hated about the Wynn/Encore - it was far from other places and not central located. I just booked with another hotel and will never even think about going to the Wynn/Encore again.

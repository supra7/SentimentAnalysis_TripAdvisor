I arrived at the hotel on 6/14 and actually found the hotel lobby and pool area to be nice. The staff was friendly and the check in process went rather quickly. My room was average and could have been nicer but far from being terrible. The trouble began starting at 1:00am that night when a party for teenagers was being held that night started which may have been related to a group who were at the banquet hall in the hotel. I immediately called the front desk to complain that there were multiple teenagers walking the hallways being loud and slamming doors. I spoke to Mary Grace at the front desk and provide her with the offending room number but the noise and door slamming continued. I called back and asked her what was done and she just said sorry and called security again. I called the office on the  hour repeatedly but again the countless guests and the noise continued until 3:00 where I basically gave up. In the morning I spoke the weekend Manger Jon Carlo and basically he had agreed that the was a situation that was out of control and suggested I speak to the manager Ken on Monday. I told Ken that I expected some kind of response that the hotel owed it to me as a customer to provide me with a secure hotel and quite night of sleep. He asked me what I expected the hotel to do with the situation and I told him that the hotel should have at least walked up to the room and told them guest to stop making noise. The hotel has not compensated me although it was stated that it would consider sending me a voucher.

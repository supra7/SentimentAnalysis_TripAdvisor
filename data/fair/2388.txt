My brother was getting married in Chicago. I was going to book the hotel for the weekend but we decided to stay one night and I'm glad we did. Based on some of the other reviews, some of the rooms must be updated with newer beds. Our beds were so uncomfortable that my husband and I didn't sleep all night and got up with sore backs and necks. The tub in the bathroom wouldn't drain. I ended up not taking a shower in the morning because I didn't want to stand in inches of water. The room had a nice flat screen TV but seemed a little smaller then the average room. We wouldn't stay again even though I'm a Hilton honors member....I would stay some where else.

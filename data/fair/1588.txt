I staid there for 6 nights during my business trip to Turkey, as a Five starts hotel close to the center and attractions! I have to say it was very bad stay. First impression when you arrive you will say WaW, then you get to your room ... the carpet is filthy, and it was like sauna ... I was burning out, I turned on the AC .. it was not working, so I went down and they informed me that it will not work till 6pm "this is the system" so I was sweating till 7 and it doesn't work (of course the windows don't open). and after hard talk with them they moved me next day to a room where I can open the windows, but it was for people with disability, therefore everything was designed for disabled people to feel comfortable, which means I felt handicapped in this room. Not to mention that the mattress protector was dirty with red and brown spots everywhere. Don't you agree that this is too much for 160 EUR per night!!!??

We were put in a room on the third floor when we arrived after being told that the lift was out of order and that it would be better to be on a lower floor. The music in the lobby (second floor) was very loud and we asked if the room would be affected, the reception manager said no. We carried our cases up the stairs to our room which was clean and comfy. We went for some food and a drink but decided to be in bed fairly early as we had had a long flight from London and wanted to make the most of the weekend. Trying to sleep was impossible, the noise went on until 3.45am, it was incredible, so loud it thumped through the floor and every word could be heard. We kept ringing reception to ask them to turn it down and they said yes but never did. Eventually we went down at 3.30am in our bathrobes and asked them to turn it down and asked why on earth they thought it was a good idea to have a bar below hotel rooms. The response was unhelpful to say the least, once again they said they would turn it down but didn't. We had no sleep that night, the next morning although unapologetic they said they would move us to a higher floor. When we tried to check out on the sunday we could not get into the only working lift as it was packed trying to serve 16 floors, we waited for 25 minutes. Not impressive customer service and the claim that the hotel is tranquil is a joke, try sleeping on the third floor. Surely a hotel is obliged to provide a peaceful environment for sleeping and working lifts? Unimpressive customer service in a country that is meant to be renowned for it and generally lives up to that reputation, The Time needs to get its act together fast.

I stayed there recently for three nights on business. The hotel was clean and facilities, while older are nice. I did something dumb and left something there and later spoke with a nice gentleman on the phone who helped me a great deal though his hands seemed a little tie din terms of what he could do. I also though had my iPod stolen while I was in one of the workout rooms and was very disappointed when security told me they could check records to see who entered the workout room and took my iPod but it would be too much trouble to do so. Only one person entered the room while I was in it! Food is pretty expensive and the hotel room was pretty noisy. I was also disappointed by the cost of parking while they seemed to have ample parking space.

Our stay at this hotel was Okay only because we liked the location. I though this hotel was over priced and not all the rooms had microwaves, we even had a full ocean view, there is no restuarants at the hotel. The pool was closed our first day. They would not honor our AAA card and said if i would have called them three days in advance they would have honored it. I have traveled a lot and never had an issue with a hotel honoring our AAA card. I was not impressed. There are hotels along the pacific ocean much cheaper and they all look really nice. Remember you have to pay 20.00 extra a day to park also.

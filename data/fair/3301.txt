Positive: Good location, steps aways from the quarter. Nice lobby. Good service from the door staff and bartenders. That is all the good I can think of. Negative: This just isn't a JW-type hotel. There is no way they should call it one. I have stayed in several JW Marriotts, but this hotel isn't as good as many marriotts that I have stayed at. Poor, noisy plumbing, hot water problems, small and outdated rooms, cheap tv's, indifferent management, poor followthrough, wall outlets that don't work, empty and nonfunctioning mini-bars (after they gave me a key for it?!). I could go on, but trust me, this hotel just isn't up to par. Stay at the Le Pavillion instead. I know i will.

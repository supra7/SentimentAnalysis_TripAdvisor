Nasty. Was probably very nice 20 years ago. Rooms need major over haul. Pool Oasis was cool, but it was over populated by 200+ people. Felt like we were ona dirty, low budget cruise or summer camp. So many nicer places to stay, like Camelback Inn, Intercontinental, Marriott Desert Ridge, hyatt Gainey ranch, etc. Will never go back.

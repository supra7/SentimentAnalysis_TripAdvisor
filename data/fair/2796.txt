"Brokedown Palace" best describes this place to me. I think the glory days for the GW are long gone. It's still on a beautiful beach and the pool is nice if you don't mind 5000 screaming kids like Disneyworld. During our visit there must have been some sort of Fred Durst family convention going on LOL I swear, every guy there had a backwards baseball cap, a goatee or soul patch (!) and had tons of kids in tow. The whole grounds, pool area and all the patios (especially on the ground floor) looked like they had been hit with a tidal wave of inflatable toys, boogie boards, towels, food, soda bottles and trash. I have nothing against kids, but this place markets itself as a romantic high-end luxury property (with prices to match) but in reality it is more like a huge 3 1/2 star Disney hotel aging in a beautiful location. Did I mention most of the Durst clones were sloppy drunk at the pool by 1PM? A true Durster wouldn't even get up until 1PM. Amateurs ;) They should lower their prices and lower their guests expectations. The prices at GW are still very high and there are many other beachfront hotels that are less expensive and will probably offer the same experience for less $. If you are looking to spend big bucks for a romantic luxury trip of a lifetime and you want a true 5 star experience, you will be much happier at the Four Seasons next door or the Ritz in Kapalua. I've stayed at both and both are a thousand times nicer than Grand Wailea.

This hotel needs a major overhaul in every aspect: Needs new attitude in its staff - too rude, even for New York standards - new entrance, new lobby, etc. Rooms are horrendously small and everything is old, old, old. Paid $350/night. It does NOT deserve more than $200. I would NOT recommend this to any traveller. For comparable prices one got to be able to find something better.

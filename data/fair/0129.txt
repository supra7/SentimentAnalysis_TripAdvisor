The room was small and dark and hot, the beds uncomfortable, and there was loud street noise, including drag racing, all night long. The heat could not be adjusted (the people at the front desk were no help at all with this), so we had to have the windows open; therefore, due to the heat and the noise in the street we got no sleep at all. The most unbelievable part of it all was actual drag racing in the street below our window in the middle of the night. I've never seen anything like it. Would definitely not stay there again.

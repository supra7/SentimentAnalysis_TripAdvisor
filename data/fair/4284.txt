I stayed in this hotel with my family and didn't enjoy it at all. The price was extremely expensive for such a hotel; apparently it's a high season in Manhattan at this time of year and all the hotels were expensive. Hotwire picked up this hotel for us, it was about $260USD a night. The staff were professional and helpful, but the room was a disaster! Starting with the carpet...old and disgusting looking; the kitchenette was out dated, and the beds were uncomfortable and very noisy. The AC/Heater were old and very very noisy; we used to leave it on when we go out and as soon as we enter we turned it off. Found small Cockroaches in the bathroom and near the bed! The hotel was not close to the metro station, you need to walk for 15 minutes to get into the subway.

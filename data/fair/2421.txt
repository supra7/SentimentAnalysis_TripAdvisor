Saving up for more than a year to have my honeymoon at a great hotel for once in my life. I was so upset and disappointed. The people were unpleasant. The room was not comfortable. The maids did not clean the bathroom. They didn't even touch it. The wall in the so-called living room was patched. The wall in the bedroom was dirty. We had paid our money up front 3 months before the time to be there. When we go to check in, the clerk says that he needs a $200.00 deposit for incidentals. No one mentioned this when we booked and paid for the room. It was awful!! I will never do this again. I had more of a relaxing, fun time at La Quinta Inn!! Soooooooo Disappointed!!!!!!

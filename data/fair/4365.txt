I was very disappointed in this hotel from the moment I entered. The carpeting in the entry, lobby and in the room was very worn, making it look dingy and rather gross. The room I had, with one bed, was pretty small and looked out on a fire escape. The furniture was worn and beat up looking ... a missing handle on the desk drawer, scratches on the bedside table. The bathroom amenities were minimal: two regular size towels. No wash cloths, and sometimes no bath mat. There was something weird about the soap that took it forever to wash off. The TV worked, but I'm used to many more channels from other hotels. The place seemed like it was run by rather inexperienced young people. The one bedside lamp in my room did not work, and I asked twice for a new bulb to no avail. On a third try I got a bulb, but the lamp still did not work. Once a male employee walked into my room unannounced ... he apologized, but it was still disconcerting and I made sure to keep door locked after that. The room did not appear dirty, but the overall condition made it feel dirty and made me uncomfortable. I feel the website misrepresents the hotel as a nice "boutique" hotel, which it is not ... it is definitely a budget place and borderline acceptable in my view. They also insisted on photocopying my drivers license on a prepaid room, which did creep me out. air conditioner was adequate, if rather loud. I spent a minimum of time there over the course of the 3 nite stay.

Our room was small and in need of updating. Also, the windows were really drafty, it almost felt like they were open. And the heater was so loud that we had to turn it off to get any sleep. And the windows were not only drafty, but you could hear all of the street noise, even though we were on a high level floor. Also the breakfast is really expensive, but it was good, and the service was good, I still found it very over priced. The biggest problem I had with the Crown Plaza was that the parking lot the next day took 2 and a half hours to get us our car, even though we called from our room to make sure they would have it ready after we checked out! If I had known we would have to wait so long, I would have gone shopping or walked around. We had to sit in the lobby for 2 and a half hours with a bored toddler, and when we complained to the front desk, they said that the parking didn't belong to them, so they had no control over it. There are much better hotels on the mile in the same price range, do yourself a favor and skip this one.

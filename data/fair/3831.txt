I only stayed for one night while visiting the zoo with my wife's family and it was right down the road from the zoo. The park was literally right across the street, so that was great too, and it was far enough away from the beach and downtown to avoid horrible parking and most undesirable people. There were a couple of shoeless hippies wandering around with walking sticks outside the inn in the morning. The staff was friendly and brought us an iron and ironing board with a tasty pastry and fruit breakfast in the morning. They let us check in a little early as well, which was very nice of them. I had the same problem as a previous reviewer-- the heat was on full blast when we first arrived. That wasn't too difficult to take care of, though. The buildings seem like very old apartments. All the floors creak and I can imagine that anyone staying below us would have heard every step we took on those old floors. The paint was peeling, the carpet seemed very old. It wasn't a bad place, just old and probably shouldn't be ranked #3. If you need to be close to the zoo and are only planning on doing the zoo and the museum, then this is a fair place. If you want to see any of the rest of san diego or socal, get something a little nicer.

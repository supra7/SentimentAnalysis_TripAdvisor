My husband, 19 month old daughter, and I just got back from our trip to Maui. I booked 8 nights on points (3 nights at the Hyatt and 5 nights at the Westin). We choose the Westin because of the location to Whalers Village. After spending a day at the Hyatt pool, we drove over to check-in at the Westin. We pulled up and no one greeted us. My husband and I pulled our luggage out of the trunk and still no one offered to help - The bellmen just looked as us. Eventually, we just asked for their assistance. It was really very odd. The initial experience seemed to have summarized the customer service at the hotel. If you are interested in a time share, you will be treated much better. From the concierge, to the front desk, to the bell desk - it was the worse service i have ever seen at a hotel. The rooms were very small, but they used the space well. The pools are a big liability waiting to happen. If you have young children, do not stay here! The Hyatt and Marriott are much better suited for young kids. Even the Westin timeshae property would have been better. The tile was slippery on the ledge of the pool and there is no shallow area for kids to play in. Even the lounge area was very anti-children with just cement. If it were my husband and I laying around the pool all day, it would have been lovely. With the red flag warnings at the beach daily, it didn't leave us many options for water play for our daughter. Overall, we were in Maui and stayed for free. If I were booking the trip and paying with cash, I would pick the Hyatt hands down. The Hyatt was AMAZING and I would gladly pay more for their facilities.

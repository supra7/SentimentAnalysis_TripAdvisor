The price was reasonable which is probably why the saying "you get what you pay for" comes from. The rooms are really small which is fine because I don't camp out in the hotel room anyways when I visit the city. What bothered me the most was there was mold in the shower. I'm sure due to lack of circulating air that can happen in hotels but they sell sprays to take care of that and I think it was just carelessness on their end to take care of that. We also didn't have hot water which comes in handy when taking a shower. You are really paying for a bed to sleep on here. Literally. They don't offer any complimentary toiletries which isn't the end of the world but pretty standard in hotels. The hotel doesn't have any lounge or lobby to relax in either. I'll be staying at the Monacco or the Clift across the way next time.

The location was marvelous, but the price for what we got was terrible. We were charged at least $20 a night for parking. We were overcharged for our room. The room wasn't even amazing for what we paid. It is an older building. The pool was completely in another tower. They asked us if we wanted a little goody bag for our child. We thought it was a nice gesture, so we took it. Pretty sure they charged us for that too. They did have strollers at the front desk for us, which was nice, but our experience was poor. We will never stay there again. We stayed at another hotel that was 15 minutes away earlier in our vacation, it was 3 times less expensive, had a delicious continental breakfast, had evening snacks, and we didn't have to pay for parking.

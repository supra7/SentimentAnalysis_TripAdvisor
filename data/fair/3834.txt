My mother-in-law used to stay at this property many years ago. The luster has obviously faded. While the physical property is interesting, this part of San Diego is a bit dumpy, unless you like homeless people sleeping all around you while you are on vacation at the beach. But the reall problem is the staff. To say they are below the standard for the hoteling world is an understandment. If I owned this place, they would all be replaced. It was extraordinary to have every person who I had an encounter with to have such a poor disposition. Beware of this place!

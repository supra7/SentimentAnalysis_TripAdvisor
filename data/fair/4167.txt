I booked this hotel last minute on the internet. The hotel location is OK. The location itself is not that great, right next to a car dealer and with suspicious people behind the building, but it is a 10 minute walk to the downtown center. Once I checked in, the first thing I noticed was a hotel worker arguing with a man who parked his SUV right infront of the lobby. The parking was very cramped and I could not find a parking spot in the front or the back without waiting a few minutes. I was greeted inside by an empty reception desk and a run-down lobby. Once I rang the bell, a young teen in white socks came out of a door behind the reception, where I could hear rock music. He did not know that much about the city, but he did offer us a travel brochure. Out room was on the 2nd floor, (it was the one with the large balcony in the front). Probably the best thing about the room was the large balcony, that had just a view on the road. The carpets were stained and the matresses were hard, but the bathroom looked pretty new. An average Travelodge I guess. But my worst impression came on my first night when I entered my floor. In the hallways, there were suspicious people looking at me and candy wrappers all around the floor. This was the case most nights. I will not stay here again, and I will make sure to book a better hotel like the Ramada or Warwick, ahead of time.

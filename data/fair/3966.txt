Just OK I just stayed at the Archbishop's Mansion in SF. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. This is a bed and breakfast and the breakfast was a joke; it consisted of toast, coffee and jam. You can have a hard boiled egg if you wanted it and a glass of milk. The rooms were very different. First of all, most of the rooms I walked by were very nice looking (old, bed and breakfast style). Our room... pretty lame! The bed was very small and pretty uncomfortable. The room was not kept up very well.The location is far away from everything and a costly cab ride everytime you want dinner. Really, there's nothing to do anywhere near the place. All in all, not very impressed and wouldn't stay there again. There are plenty of other choices! Thanks!

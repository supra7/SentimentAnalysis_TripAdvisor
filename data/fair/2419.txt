Beware those traveling with your children who think you will have a seperate living space when the kids are asleep in the "other room." All of the pictures online indicated a seperate sleeping area with a door. We specifically chose the Omni for this feature so that my friend and I could be in another room while our young daughters slept. There is a seperate sleeping area, but our room had no door, despite specifically requesting one. When we called to ask for a room change, another room was not available to us. Also, we asked for cribs and a refrigerator to be in the room and even called ahead of time to verify the requests we had through our online booking. Despite our efforts, the cribs and a refrigerator still were not in the room when we arrived. Housekeeping quickly did bring them to the room, but while we had planned ahead, the hotel had not. We will not be returning to the Omni Chicago with our young children.

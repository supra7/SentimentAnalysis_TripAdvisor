I had never stayed in a Travelodge before but being fairly well travelled I have slept in more than a few basic places. However, this place is really poor. As others have commented, the ground floor rooms are horrendously noisy being adjacent to a busy main road and the breakfast is minimalist continental. There is no storeroom for luggage so, after checking out by midday, if you are not leaving London until the evening you will have to pay a minimum of 8.50 per item to store your things at Euston Station. All in all, for a flying stopover-business-trip-type thing, it is tolerable. For a cheap weekend break, give it a miss and pay a little more somewhere else.

As a lot of hotels theses days the lobby is well design as the bar/club but as soon as you go into a room it's complete different world. They tried to put some "design" into the room but you feel right away that it's just fake. So no isolation between rooms, I could ear clearly what my neighbour was doing and I had to change room at midnight because the music was too lowed... 4 stars??? And I am not finished, I had too pay an extra fee to hold an extra shopping bag with my luggage, come on!! Seriously could we stop this "fake" hotel trend! Lucky we have Trip Advisor to help us to avoid these places. That's being said location is good but I went to Yotel which is a little bit further from time square but what a service and quality for almost the same price. I hope this review will help you to...avoid this location or push them for better quality in their rooms.

This place looked modern and swanky on the website, however was anything BUT. Location is good - walking distance to all of the main attractions, however as a group of 4 females, we did not feel safe in this hotel. The doors to the rooms did not lock appropriately. Rooms were dirty and ill-kept, with hairs on the sheets, multiple burned out light bulbs, windows over the street that did not close, and draperies half falling down. There were no safes in the rooms, only at the front desk. Our "view" from one room was of a brick wall with a flower spray painted on it. When we complained to the front desk, we got a lot of run around about an unavailable, then suddenly available suite, which we ultimately checked out, and thouh it was much better, we were still not impressed. We were looking for basic, clean and safe accomodations, and felt this place used false advertising and was not worth the price. We cancelled our rooms and moved elsewhere, then dealt with the travel agency who recommended it to get back a partial refund (europeandestinations, com - would never use them again, as they recommended this place, multiple tour rip-offs, and were not helpful when we had issues with travel plan changes due to union strikes). Istanbul was wonderful. Kupeli was NOT.

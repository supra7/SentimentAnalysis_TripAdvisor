Only Internet connection in rooms is Ethernet wired connections, no cables provided. Can't use my wifi iPad except in the lobby. They do have a large lounge, which they cleared out at 3:00 to set up dinner service. TV has very few HD channels. Rooms are fine, location is great, but I could pay $150 less and get wifi and breakfast. Marriott should be ashamed of this property.

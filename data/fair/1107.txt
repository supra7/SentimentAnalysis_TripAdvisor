My husband and I arrived to Las Vegas for the first time after a 6 hour flight. We were exhausted and just wanted to sleep. It was 11 pm at night and as we arrived to the hotel the valet and doorman were very hospitable. The front desk however was extremely rude. They gave us a room and we carried our luggage there opened it up and low and behold..an extremely dirty room with towels and garbage everywhere, bed not made etc. We were extremely disappointed. Had to go all the way back down did not receive an apology from the man who made the mistake and the manager was no where to be found. Finally got another room, slept and woke up early to speak to the manager. The manager turned out to be a very snotty BLONDE (no offense to anyone but I do not see how you can hire a lady like this to run this damn hotel) came up and didn't bother to do anything about the night before. She blamed it on the system (typical). Since I was extremely dismayed I refused to eat there or spend anytime there for that matter. However, I did take a look at the pool area just to compare and contrast with the other five star hotels in the area. Honest to God I do not even understand why this is considered a five start hotel. I travel a lot, been to many five start resorts..this one DISGUSTING. For god sakes look at the bellagio, venetian, and aria and learn something. Thus, Location is crappy, the hotel is extremely small, room service especially house keeping was horrible. I would definitely never stay there again and I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.

I had some work at US passport agency for which i had to travel to chicago. I checked a few hotels near by the agency and found bestwestern had a reasonable price($130-$160). But they have the worst service i had ever experienced. When i went to the lobby for check in, there was no body in the reception and 2 guys who work are standing by. None of them cared if we needed some help. After waiting for 15 min and no one showing up at the reception i asked one of the guys if he could help. He then went inside and called somebody up. We checked in to the room and it was descent. There was no water in the room.. So we called guest services and requested for water. No response till 30 min. I called again and then they sent some. We switched on the AC and after 2 hrs , my kid was perspiring in sleep. I couldn't go to sleep because of the sleep. So i called guest service and asked to check the AC. They talked some horse [---] and gave me a wonderful advice .. guess what...all i need to do to fix the issue was to "OPEN THE WINDOW"....

This place needs a lot of upgrading, its rundown and seedy. The photos on their website must be at least 30 years old. The linens were clean so was the pool and the ocean view was great, its a good place to go on the cheap. The main part of the resort and the pool are across the very busy Kehei Road, don't even think about sending the kids to the pool alone if you are by the ocean.

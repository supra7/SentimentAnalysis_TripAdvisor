Miffed at the Clift A big, beautiful room with a breathtaking view ?and that it.This hotel completely inattentive and unprofessional staff dampened our vacation spirits. Rather than feeling like a guest at the Clift, my boyfriend and I felt like we were imposing and unwelcome.Yes, the Redwood Room is amazing. Yes, Asia de Cuba serves a unique fare, but with a staff just too cool for school?and completely uninterested in making a guest feel comfortable and at home, everything good is wasted.With so many choices today, customer service is of UTMOST importance and apparently the Clift just doesn get this. Spend your money somewhere else, unless of course, you enjoy being treated like dirt.

Was expecting so much better from this hotel, good location but that is all i can rave about regarding this hotel, For a 4 star hotel i was very disappointed. If they had put in as much as effort as they did in the lobby towards there guests rooms it would have being great. poor guest rooms, very small and the view I had out the window was looking at straight at another room and a brick wall. TV is back in the old age and you could hear everything in the rooms beside you, even if your talking quite. i would avoid hotel if looking for hotel to stay in chicago.

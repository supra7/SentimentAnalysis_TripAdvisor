The resort and grounds are beautiful, however I had a terrible experience at the Grand Wailea Spa. For what was supposed to be a relaxing afternoon with my husband at the spa, due to the poor customer service we experienced, it soured everything and I wish we had never gone. In addition, there were foreign gardeners right outside my massage room, chattering away, so it made for a very un-relaxing experience. Also, my massage therapist was just average- I thought their standards would be higher. When we complained to the spa manager on duty afterwards, she was very indifferent, like she didn't care. She gave us coupons to use their hydrotherapy again (which I believe is free to use with any service), which we will not use. We will not waste our valuable vacation time there again. Go somewhere else where the staff actually care.

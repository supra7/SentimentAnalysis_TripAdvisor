We stayed at another Personality Hotel, the Kensington at Union Square, and it was terrific. So the odd mishmash of old and new in the tiny room at The Diva was a disappointment, to say the least. Got off to a bad start with dirty carpet in the lobby. Television blaring a movie inappropriate for families, and there were kids in the cramped lobby. Valet service sloooooooooooowwwwwwww, albeit pleasant enough. Reception desk help was fine. Upon entering our room, we noticed a split seam in the carpet. The minimalist design they were looking for was simply cold and bare feeling, and the decor had a Home Depot feel to it. The bathroom sink was in the bedroom, and had a bar faucet, making it impossible to wash hands without getting water all over the counter. The bathroom felt like something you'd find at a hospital -- completely devoid of charm. Later that evening, we noticed the bathroom was stocked with only one towel. We alerted the desk clerk, who told us we'd have to come down to get another one since he was the only one working.

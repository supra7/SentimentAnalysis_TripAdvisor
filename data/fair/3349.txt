My wife and daughter visited New Orleans from December 23rd to December 26th. We stayed at the Frenchmen inn. It was my wife and my 4th time staying at Frenchmen inn, our first with our young daughter. In the past we have stayed in smaller rooms and only used the hotel to sleep and refresh ourselves, as we spent most of our time enjoying the quarters nightlife. We booked a 1-bedroom suite. We stayed in room 301 on the second floor over looking Frenchmen Street. The room was large and we had a balcony. The furnishings are very tired. The pull out sofa was useless as the mattress springs are coming through. The kitchen is ill equipped. The bathroom is dated and was lacking a tub stopper at check in. the whole hotel is in need of repair. There were very little festive decorations. We went out and purchased lights and decorations for our balcony. Every other hotel seemed much more festive and magical. Upon check in we requested some tips and bookings for sight seeing and restaurants. We would get bits of information but never any answers or suggested bookings. We did everything on our own, booking through the Internet when it was functioning, which was not very often. In fairness, we spent more time in our room, then we initial thought as it rained and was cold during our stay. We thought of staying an extra day when we first arrived but after viewing the room, and realizing this is not a city for a young child when the weather isnt favorable we decided to move on. We chose New Orleans as our destination because we realize they need help at the present but very disappointed in the city over the holidays and the hotel. I dont think we will be back to the Frenchmen Inn.

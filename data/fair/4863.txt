The hotel was small but very nice looking. The "deluxe king" rooms are very tiny, large enough for a bed and desk but not much more. There are no refrigerators or microwaves in the room or evidently on the property. The free breakfast is just flat out pathetic. Your choices are fruit or mini-muffins that's it! Good luck ordering off the menu, we sat for 20 minutes and the sole waiter never even came by. We finally got up and left as did the table that came in after us. I think the reason this hotel is soo expensive is it's location, but even that isn't all that good. The navy pier is still a good 2 miles away as are most of the museums. It's only a great location if you need quick access to about a dozen parking garages! Speaking of parking, do NOT drive to the hotel. Parking is $44 a night EXTRA!!! We took a train in so this didn't affect us but be aware of it! Next time we do Chi Town we will be staying at a hotel in the burbs and then taking the very efficient train system to where we need to go.

Yes the rooms are large and fairly clean, the hotel entrance and general area much better than it was afew years ago. However, there was a good deal of construction going on at the new tower being built right next door, and it began at 6 a.m. It penetrated our 4th floor north facing room and from conversations with other guests during our 4 days it seemed to bother many on that side. A move to a higher south side room helped. For us, it was just an ok place with a reasonable rate on Easter weekend, we wouldn't return in a hurry. Had an excellent Easter morning breakfast at the cafe.

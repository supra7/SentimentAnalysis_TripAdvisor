I was allocated a room on the ground floor on the road side. Checking in at night, the room was not noisy but from about 5am busses past the room and they sounded more like they were in the room! The fast automatic check-in was a good facility and the room itself was in good condition. Unfortunately there was no remote in the room, and reception didnt speak English well but said there were no remotes - you had to stand on the edge of the bed to change the tv channel. I have now stayed at London Faringdon, London Kings Cross Royal Scott and London Docklands and all are as bad as each other. Sadly, its IBIS or Premier Inn in the future as they offer better value for money.

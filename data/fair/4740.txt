Spent two nights here. Nice rooms. Poor quality housekeeping. Only got around to making our room after 4pm and after two requests. And all they did was throw in some clean towels and make the beds. No vacuuming etc. Concierge service no more than adequate with a bit of an attitude adjustment needed. Mispriced as dont tell you about mandatory resort level. Some guests arrived after 5pm and their rooms not ready. Not a comeback.

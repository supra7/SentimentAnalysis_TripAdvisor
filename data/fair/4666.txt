The resort is in a great location. The outdoors is beautiful. That being said, the room did not live up to expectations. The room assigned was designed for a person in a wheelchair which isn't a problem; however, I hate to think of someone being stuck in this room. It is located next to a loud elevator that one can hear through the wall, even the ping of the bell. The sink leaked. The switch on desk lamp did not work. The lanai overlooked the roof of a walkway. I will not stay here again.

My family and I stayed there last week. We arrived at 3:00pm and our room was not ready. We stayed in the lobby area and went back at 4:0pm (check-in time) and the room was still not ready. I finally asked them to switch us to a different room in the same area. The woman who helped me initially gave me wristbands for the waterpark--not telling me only 4 wristbands come with the room fee. She was very rude and I felt like she was bothered with me checking in at 3:00. I had to go wait in line to purchase another wristband at $20/day! We finally got our key and the bellman met us as we left the hotel. He said there was no parking at our building. I asked if they were at capacity and he said no, it was because they built the Villas next door and did not add enough parking spaces. Every night we would have to park far away and walk to the room. Finally, we went to the pool and all of the chairs were taken. It took us a while to find two chairs together. My kids ended up getting a rash from the pool so we only went one day. I would not chose this hotel again!

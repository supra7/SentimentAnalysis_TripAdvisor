Sorry to report negative features of this hotel, starting from the moment we pulled up to the door. No "aloha" greeting for us. Had to search out a valet parker, and received no lei (everyone else got one- guess we should have asked. Our Garden View room wasn't ready, so we opted to pay more for an ocean view room which we were told WAS ready. Got to room and found patio door bolted and a painter on the balcony. On top of that, there was an overpowering paint smell. How can they sell such a room?? Went back to desk, and were assigned a new room. Got there, and found dirty razors, coffee cups and used shampoo bottles in shower. Is it too much to ask for a clean room with an accessible patio? Waited 45 minutes for our luggage to be delivered. When they arrived, they had only one of our bags, not two. They had lost one piece of luggage between valet parking and the room. We panicked when they denied ever having a second bag. Luckily they were able to produce the "non-existent" bag after an hour or so. Just a sloppy operation all around. I must say, however, that their much-advertised "Heavenly Beds" were just that- great. And note, the rooms in the Beach tower appear more spacious than those in Ocean tower. For a first visit to Maui (especially with kids) this hotel should be fine. Just know that there is much better out there, at much better prices. Just don't understand how they can sell rooms with no balcony access(and with workers outside balcony door) without informing guests beforehand. This hotel isn't cheap- should get more for the prices they charge.

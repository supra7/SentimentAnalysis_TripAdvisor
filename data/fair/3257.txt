Came into town for business. Our king room wasn't ready so they put us in a double bed room. I was shocked at how grimy the place looked and felt - carpets and chairs were stained and dirty. The room, the hallways all smelt very musty a d moldy. View from our window was not a view - it looked onto another balcony, which had garbage scattered on it. The bathroom could have used a bit more scrubbing. There was some mould on the ceiling. The beds were AWFUL! Lumpy, sinking, uncomfortable. Could not get a good nights rest. The walls are paper thin - we could hear the guest next door on her phone/ getting ready. At the end of our stay we got a little surprise - a bill for parking -$32/day. Only thing this place has going for it is it's central location. That is it. I'd heard good things about Intercontinental hotels - I was expecting a lot more. Ive stayed at holiday inns that I've been more impressed with.

Since it first opened, I had stayed at this hotel fairly often using the corporate rate. When I arrived at the hotel, the check-in desk told me that the corporate contract terms had recently changed (although apparently not in the reservations system) and that they would not honor the rate--I could stay if I paid a rate that was 2/3rds higher. Since Holiday Inn had offered and accepted the rate through their on-line reservation system, and I had a confirmation number, I requested that they honor the rate for that night. To my amazement, they took a hard line stance and refused to honor the reservation made through their reservation system. It was a situation that clearly called for compassion and the lack of concern by the management was chilling. In the past, my interaction with the staff had been great. The facility is new and the rooms are nice. This had been my hotel of choice at MDW before the horrible customer service experience. If they would treat a frequent corporate customer so poorly, as a customer, how can you be sure that they will honor the rate and how can you be sure that they would honor your reservation? For this reason, I recommend that staying away from this hotel. There are a number of hotels in the same hotel grouping to choose from. The employees of one of the hotels assisted me in finding another room for the evening. Sometimes the Management of the Hotel makes all the difference in the quality of the stay. If you book at the Holiday Inn at MDW, there is a chance you will unexpectedly be left without a room and that you will be ill-treated. It's not worth taking the chance, even for a nice facility.

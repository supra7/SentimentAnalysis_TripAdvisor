I was excited to find this hotel as an alternative to the conference hotel, because I hate smoke and casinos. I got a great rate and the room was very nice. The lobby service was nice, including the bellmen, bartender, servers, and front desk. That is where the service stopped. They charge the resort fee automatically and it includes a newspaperm bottled water, etc.Did not get the newspaper delivered once without calling for it. My room was not serviced for two days because someone had pushed the tiny light that indicated I wanted privacy. I did not even know about the light. When I called down to get more water, I asked for 3 bottles instead of 2 for the aggravation, and they said they would have to charge me for the third. I asked them to also bring up a couple of new towels--they brought the water and no towels. I had specifically requested a room away from the noisy train--they gave me a room on the train side. It was very loud. There were two hangers in the room when I checked in. I had to call for more. There is no place to lock anything up in the room, although there is a closet with a lock, which they said is the "owner's closet." I can't imagine The Donald would be using that room or its closet. To be fair, they did take off that bloody resort fee. I actually hope I don't have to go back to Vegas, because there are not many options for hotels without casinos and smoke.

While its location is great, the hotel itself leaves a lot to be desired. For starters, there is no lobby in this hotel. That is right, you walk in an there are a couple of desks, you are greeted, get checked in, and up you go to your room, nowhere to "hang". We had an 'upgraded" suite, and other than a (terrible) sleeper sofa, and a double door to divide the two rooms, nothing about this place was impressive. Amenities were average, and the noise level a problem, late into the evening (being across from Fannueil Hall, and Market Place). We needed directions to the hotel, and when I called the hotel, the concierge person cut me off, and hung up on me because I could not write fast enough for him, he was too busy to wait for me. All in all, this mostly stems from the price of the room, at over $300 a night, you'd expect much better. Also buyer be aware, there is a whoping $40 a night parking fee!!! OUCH!!!

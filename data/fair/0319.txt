This hotel is perfect for young travellers who just need a place to sleep, and who have no needs far beyond that. The rooms are basic but clean, the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are clean with hot water but very small showers, and the front desk staff is friendly and helpful, but do not go "above and beyond." Essentially, this is a two star hotel, fair and square. Bring earplugs, as the walls are paper thin, and there is constant noise either from the street or from other rooms. Even just the people in the room above you moving around is enough to keep you awake at night, since it creates a loud creaking and thumping sound with every step they take. The area is so-so. It is within walking distance to main areas and attractions, and cab rides are short and cheap from this central location, but I wouldn't want to be walking in the immediate area surrounding the hotel. The best feature of this hotel is the restaurant. The staff is amazingly friendly, attentive and FAST! Service is top notch. The food is also great for what it is. Don't expect gourmet cusine, by why would you at a hotel of this callibre. It's homestyle American food, and it is good, with oversized portions (perfect for sharing!). I would stay at this hotel again, but I would bring earplugs.

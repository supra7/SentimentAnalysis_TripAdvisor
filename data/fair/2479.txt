I looked forward to staying here after hearing the renovation was finally finished. I was wrong! The room was hardly big enough for the bed, the thermostat and light switch were actually behind the television set - that's how small it was. And it is loud as ever - the sound of plumbing from other rooms in our little cell was deafening, drunks roaming the halls sounded like they were screaming in our room, and we had some traffic noise. The old school, Shining-set charm just doesn't make up for this nonsense. There are much nicer, better built places to stay nearby for the price. Stop by the Palmer lobby for a drink and spend the night elsewhere. Enjoy Chicago!

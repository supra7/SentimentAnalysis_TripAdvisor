This hotel is located in the Theater District, right across the street from Boston Commons. The Freedom Trail starts about a five minute walk from the hotel. Also convienant to grab trolley tours, gray lines, Boston Ducks. About a 15 minute walk to Faniual Hall & Quincy Market. I got a room with a king bed, which made the room extremely small. A friend had double beds and their room was larger. My room was so small, you couldn't open the dresser drawers all the way. There was barely enough room to get in between the bed and dresser. In the bathroom, you had to manuver between the toilet paper holder and toilet. It is a small room and bathroom. I am a light sleeper and didn't hear alot of outside noise, although the hotel was busy. Shower heads are excellent. Some of the staff was a little rude. The female consierge (I think her name was Ashley) was very kind and extremely helpful. The male consierge was a little rude and hard to work with. Got lost and tried to get directions from security, and found them hard to work with.

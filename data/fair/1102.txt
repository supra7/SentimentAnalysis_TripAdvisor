Where can I start with this hotel? Talk about extra fees. I booked with American Airlines so I could earn towards my air miles. I was quoted at $582 for 5 nights. It said this included taxes. When I got to Trump there was no self parking so we had no choice but to use the valet. When I got to the check in counter surprise it was an extra $450!!!! This was apparently for the valet parking fee, fitness center fee and just extra hotel fees. That's a lot of money - the fitness center was an extra $22 a day. You would think it would be included or you could be given a choice if you want to use the fitness center - I did not. The parking was $20 a day. My friend did a couple of room charges for a couple of cups of coffee and muffins a few mornings and the charge came to $114!!!! How much for coffee??? Then they took out for 2 rooms instead of one. It took a few days for the mistake to be corrected and me to get the money back on my card. It left me very concerned about my cash flow for those few days. When you get past all the money that you have to fork out it is a really nice hotel. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms were secure and a safety deposit box in the drawer. The kitchenette was very nice. It was very clean. I did take a bath in the jacuzzi tub. In fact I could have easily have stayed in just the bathroom the whole trip. The toilet is glass enclosed same with the spacious shower. There is a double sink and a tv screen is embedded in the mirror. It's a shame that this place had those extra fees to add because I really would have enjoyed myself more if I wasn't having to live on Walmart food to make up for the extra cost!

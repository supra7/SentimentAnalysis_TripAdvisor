I stayed at Citystay Hotel in August 2010. First of all, the neighborhood was one of immigrants (Indians especially). The receptionists were from Pakistan. They were very friendly and helpful, except the fact that we had to pay the whole amount of money before even seeing our room. The room was a bit small for a triple, we didn't have enough space for our luggage and stuff. The walls need repainting and the whole room needs some changes since there was water coming from the ceiling and lending on the floor. The bathroom was clean, but very very small. At the basement, the hotel has a kitchen and a dining room, where you can serve breakfast. They offer tea, coffee, cookies, milk and fruits for free. If you wish to eat something different for breakfast, you can buy from Tesco or another supermarket,. both situated very close to this hotel and put it into the fridge. The Bow Church metro and train station are very close to this hotel, as well as Bus Number 8 which leads to the center of London.

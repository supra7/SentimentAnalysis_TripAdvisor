poor value The Motel has no security car parking you park in an open lot without a fence around itfull acess to public no problems,but does have a boom gate!Room clean bed really really bad very stiff woke many times during night due to being uncomfortable in bed both of us woke with really sore backs.Pull out bed well worn so worn that you had no problem feeling the surport bars underneath the worn mattress both children didn't sleep and had very sore backs as well very poor.For a family frendiley motel room service was not available till 6pm so if children 1 to 6/7 years old no dinner till 6.45 Menu in room does not show childrens meals only adults have to ring room service to find out who didn't really know.earliest,had to go down the road to a service station for crapy pies,sad!You have to walk distances through out the motel and carpark.Not very good value at all.

Stayed at Palmer House with over a hundred extended family members for a wedding which was also held at Palmer House. There were well over 100 in our party. The hotel is quiet beautiful and our double beds room was large and very nice. Family members in king rooms were shocked at the tinyness of their rooms and all those in interior rooms facing walls were disapointed by the "small dark feeling of the rooms." Requested a late checkout (12:30 rather that 11:00.) Was told, "No." The manager was rude and unhelpful. Finally agreed begrudgingly to let us stay for a $25 fee which we would have been happy to pay if given the option in the first place. $10 fee to use workout room $20 fee for internet unless you'd like "slow" internet for $16. $200 deposit for wireless apparatus. ridiculous. The attitude was "take it or leave it, babe." No feeling of warmth or interest except by the housekeeping staff who were friendly and nice.

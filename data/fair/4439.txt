I stayed in room 902 from May 11 to May 14. On the evening of the day I checked out, May 14, 2011, I realized that I had left the pajamas that my late husband had given me as a gift and immediately contacted the hotel manager, Lex, to inquire about them. He said he would find out for me and called me back to say that no one had found them and that I should call the following day so that he could speak to the people that made the room. My cousin stopped by the hotel the following day, after taking me to the airport, and Lex implied that I was mistaken because no one had turned in or seen the pajamas. It is very clear to me that whoever made the room took them and no one is taking action to get them back for me. I don't expect any of you to understand my grief. I lost the love of my life and I wanted to wear the pajamas that he gave me for the rest of my life. I need for you to conduct an investigation and recover my pajamas. They are Ralph Lauren, cotton, long sleeved, long pants, white with purple stripes. Yesterday, I tried speaking to Lex, but he was busy. Elisa took my message, but Lex never called me back. I would appreciate very much your contacting me at (956)337-8610 or (956)724-3397 to tell me that you did what needed to be done and that you have recovered my pajamas. I just cannot believe that something like this is happening in a hotel like the Westin. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Laura S. Matos

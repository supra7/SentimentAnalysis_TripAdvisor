Sad about the Kahala As a returning guest of the Kahala of 10 years, I must say it's quite sad to see it go from my opinion from a 5 star hotel down to a 3 star.. Since the Mandarin group sold this property the quality of service has gone done quite a bit. Checking in was great, my partner and I recieved an upgraded room for our honeymoon, complete with champagne. However the empty glasses stayed in the same spot for 3 days. For maid service twice a day, only thing we noticed was that the bed was made, and fresh towels were brought. Service at the Veranda...., well, we were ignored for over 20 minutes before finally asking for a drink. I know everyone is on Hawaii time, but come on! To make the stay even more enjoyable, we were asked to leave Hoku's bar! Yes, returning from dinner in Waikiki, we stopped by Hoku's bar to order a night cap from the bar, upon immediate arrival from the manager, telling us we would be more comfortable ordering drinks from downstairs. Why? I asked. Turns out we were not dressed appropriately. Apparently my silk Tommy Bahama dress shorts and shirt were not in conjuction with their strict dress code. Who brings dress shirts/pants/tie to Hawaii when they vacation? I spoke with the manager for over 30 minutes inside the hotel. Nothing was done to rectify the situation. Not that we were looking for freebies, but come on, to deny a paying guest staying at your expensive hotel property? Our problem was that before staying at the kahala, we were at the four seasons on the big island where they do know about guest satisfaction. So having said that, if you normally stay at 3 star hotels, you will be happy at the kahala, but if you like the ritzy 4-5 star hotels, the Kahala might not be what you are looking for. Perhaps the Royal Hawaiian instead. I hope the Kahala improves and works on this as the quality of service and ammenities keeps sliding down year after year. Very sad, as I once loved this hotel property.

Well, what could I say..and what could I do? A friend of mine and I booked a twin room online, but when we got there...they could only give us a room with a queen bed. We were so polite to take a look at it, but we had to say no. You must be in love or just married to sleep together in a bed like that. A "no go" for us two men, so we went to another hotel, which gave us the same problem at first (what is it with these hotels), but happened to have a smaller room with two beds in the end. So Newton, it looked good, but the service was not there.

We traveled from Maryland to Oklahoma City, OK...all at Marriotts and this one by far was a let down. Very uninterested staff at the front desk. Pool was sort of clean and room had a very funky stale smell. Mostly clean, but will not stay at this Courtyard ever again. Not worth the price in my view.

I have just returned from a five-day stay in Staybridge Suites where I stayed with my wife, adult son and my two other boys aged 16 & 11.The first thing is location, which is excellent for visiting Disney. The suite itself had three rooms and two bathrooms. The kitchen was very poorly equipped with old-fashioned equipment but what concerned me most was the condition of one of the bathrooms. Complaints about it produced no results. The shower was dirty with discoloration between the tiles and generally neglected. The other bathroom was very clean. The walls are thin and you will hear the people above moving around. We were on the ground floor. The food at breakfast time is just ok but you can have your breakfast outside which is very pleasant. The two younger boys loved the pool, gym and games room. There is also free Internet access. Staff are helpful but the place needs a revamp and there is no excuse for allowing a bathroom to become that neglected.

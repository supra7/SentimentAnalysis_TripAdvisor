The hotel itself was "okay" and the service was good to be fair. I did, however, witness quite a distributing event in the hotel gift shop wherein the attendance, "Dana" was quite rude/boarerline racisit to a Chinese guest whose name I will leave off of this. I filed a complaint with the hotel and never heard back. I will not be staying here again as a result and will take my business to the US Grand-- just up the street, on par with cost and far superior in accomodations/food.

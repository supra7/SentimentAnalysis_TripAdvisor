I paid $175 on a night when everything else was $250 - $300 min. I got what I paid for. The entrance to the hotel (tenament stair well with musty carpet) was shocking. The room was a bit worse. No closet, depressing decor and a tiny, run down bathroom (the shower floor was grey/black -- intended to be white). No remote for TV and about 5 channels. More than a bit depressing, but there were some positives. I slept very well as my alley facing room was quiet. There is a Starbucks downstairs and the subway access was perfect (#1 line). Location is good for runners as you have quick access to Central and Riverside parks. If you just need a cheap bed, Marakech may be ok but expect the worst as far as accomadations are concerned.

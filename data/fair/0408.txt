We didn't sleep at all in our room on the 17th floor because the building creeks like the hull of a ship when there's wind. We inspected other rooms on the 34th and 12th floors, and finally moved to the lower floor which was quieter but still creeked. We heard from everyone we talked to in the elevator the same complaint -- especially people in the middle floors. Conversations with the desk staff made it clear this is a common complaint. I can't believe I'm the first person on Trip Advisor to mention it. If you stay here, ask for the lowest floor possible or the penthouse. My guess is only the basement and rooftop are truly quiet.

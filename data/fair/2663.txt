It is too much money for the service that the housekeeping gave us ..My first day staying at this hotel i put a dot of ice cream in my sheets to see if the lady was going to change it the next day,"she doesn`t change it" the only thing that she do was to strech them and thats it.im really disappointed beacause now i dont know if i was using sheets that was using it before.. """"ROOM SERVICE IS SOOOOOOO BAD""""

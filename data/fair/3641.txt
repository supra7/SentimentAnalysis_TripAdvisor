We stayed here while our Manhattan apt. was being painted. Our room was billed as a "Wonderful" room (they had a lower class of room - the "Cozy" room). It was so small that we could barely move around and kept hurting ourselves on the furniture. The shower was poorly designed and the bathroom floor flooded whenever it was used. Also, they deliver USA Today - why would a New York City hotel do that? The bathroom amenities from Bliss spa were very, very nice, and the bed was comfortable. The selection of TV stations was poor - we couldn't even watch a Yankee game in the heart f Manhattan. The climate control was also poor - the room was constantly either too hot or too cold, and the air conditioning unit was extremely loud.

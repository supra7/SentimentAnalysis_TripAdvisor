The Edgewater in on a pier in Seattle. You can walk the water front, walk to Pike Street Market, and the fantastic water front sculpture garden just to the north. The hotel has a nice public area and a bar that have great views. The downside is that the hotel is a serious need of renovation. Everything seems beat-up with dirty hallway carpets and the like. I was taken aback by all this when we checked in and felt mostly like I was staying in a dump the three nights I was there. The standard rooms are very small, the ones on the eastside ("City View") get train noise from the tracks that are a couple hundred yards away, there is no place to park other than valet which ends up costing an additional $40+ a day, and there is no free Wi-Fi. If I had not gotten the booking via Hot Wire for fairly cheap, I would have been very, very unhappy. No way is this place worth even the typical discounted rates.

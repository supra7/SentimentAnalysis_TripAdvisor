I just got back from Seattle and I thought the Sheraton was just average. The room needed a make over. The carpet was stained in certain spots, the shower head needed to be replaced(you could hurt yourself with that thing) and the A/C didn't work very well. It turns out we were in one of the older rooms. The other tower had the newer updated rooms. The staff however was extremely helpful and nice. The location was awesome(just a few blocks from Pike's Market) and the rooms were very quiet. We really enjoyed the bar in the restaurant on the lower level and the drink prices were reasonable. I would stay here again but I would request a room in the new tower.

Stayed at the Park Plaza for a corporate event. The rooms are NYC/Boston size...meaning small. I was in a (relatively) recently remodeled room and it was fine as I spent most time outside of the hotel. The water pressure was great in my shower. That said, a few collegues of mine were put in non-renovated rooms (mostly smoking rooms) and they were HORRID. Bare bulbs in the bathroom, even a mouse running out of the closet. Also-if you are sensitive to dust or overly floral disinfectant, do not stay here. It is an assult on your sense of smell.

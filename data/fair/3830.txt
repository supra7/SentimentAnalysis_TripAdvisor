My husband and I stayed here partly because of the great reviews on TripAdvisor. Our friends also stayed here too and between us, we saw three different rooms at this location. I am embarrassed to have recommended this place to our friends and feel compelled to write a more realistic review to save future travelers. Here is my take on the following: LOCATION- very good especially if you want easy access to the zoo and other downtown attractions. But note, they dont have a parking lot so be prepared to be circling around the block to look for street parking. ROOMS and VALUE - depends on the room. Pay attention on which one you get because some of the dcor is downright tacky. And all rooms are very old. The Monets room is decent and clean and for $149 per night is a good value. The Greystoke room is good for those that want that zoo feeling but for $219 per night isnt worth it unless you love, love, love, stuffed lions! And the Greystoke room is awful, do not pick this room, it is super tacky with a mix match of repainted furniture and odd scary looking fake plants. Service - Not sure because we hardly had any interface with the front desk folks. They seem nice enough. Breakfast - Its just pastries and juice, not much to comment on. In summary, this is a harsh review but only because I am baffled at why it is rated so high by other travelers. I would rank this way lower than its current spot on the top ten San Diego Hotel list.

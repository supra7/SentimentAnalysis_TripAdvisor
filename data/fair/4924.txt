There are only two positive things I can think of to mention about this place: the service and the air conditioning unit in the room. Upon arrival, we were treated very nicely. There was a pretty long wait to check in, but once we got to the counter, the staff was helpful and friendly. Unfortunately, we were told that there was no more parking in their garage, so we had to park in a garage that was a few blocks down the street. We found this a bit ridiculous, since we had booked our room 2 days in advanced and they should be prepared for the amount of people they have staying here. Be prepared for this expense, because we paid $44 for parking for a total of 48 hours in that garage. The hotel is clearly geared towards catering to families, and by that I mean there were families and children everywhere, and screaming babies in several of the rooms next to ours. As we were on a bit of a romantic trip, this put a damper on our stay. There are only two very small elevators, meaning that you're usually waiting for an elevator, and once you get on one, you're crammed in there with a several other people. The doors to the rooms don't go all the way down to the floor (there's a good one inch gap) so you can hear everything that's going on out in the hallway. The rooms themselves are quite small and old. The bathroom was very small and didn't have a vent. Our bedding didn't look very clean (there were questionable stains on the comforter). The bed overall was quite uncomfortable. All in all, we wish we would have only booked one night here so that we could have spent our second night at a different hotel downtown. We really felt like the $120 we paid didn't go that far.

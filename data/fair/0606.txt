I never write reviews but I felt so violated after our recent experience that I had to warn others. We recently booked a room through Priceline at this hotel when we visited Seattle for a family graduation. Considering we paid $82 for our room, I was expecting a clean room with decent amenities. Imagine my surprise when I learned upon check-in that we would have to pay $21.09 to park our car overnight. I have stayed at hundreds of hotels, dozens of them near airports, and I have NEVER been charged to park my car unless it was some sort of park and fly package. Needless to say, I was not happy, but the room was prepaid through Priceline so I didn't really have much choice. THEN we got to our room and discovered there was no wi-fi available in our room, nor was there a refrigerator. Cherry on top? No free breakfast the next morning. I have paid A LOT less at other hotels and received way more for my money. I was extremely disappointed, and angry, and will NEVER stay at a Double Tree again. I will also be passing the story on to family and friends because that is just not right.

The extremely loud music from a celebration carried on till 3.30am. We were informed by other very bleary-eyed breakfast guests that they had also suffered the noise the previous night! Complaining at Reception we were informed music should have stopped at Midnight. Reading previous reviews on this Hotel it is obvious they do not read thier customers reviews and they do not care. No wonder they want the fees paid in advance...

Maybe I expect too much. The sheets were so thin I was concerned they didn't even look washed. The bath towels were large enough for a small child. The room didn't feel clean until I used my own alcohol to rectify the matter. I made sure I kept my shoes on at all times. There was no complimentary water in the room. We arrived late so had to go out to buy water. We stayed two nights so I wrote a note asking for decaf coffee for the coffee maker. My request was ignored. We brought our own toiletries luckily, but I did use the shower cap and soap in the sink. When the room was serviced the shower cap and soap were replaced which I thought was wasteful. I would rather see them spend the money on bath towels a little bigger and not fraying. The front desk staff were friendly enough but when I asked if I could have late check out I was advised only till 1pm and then I would be charged for another day. I then went and booked a day room at LAX. Maybe that is another way they could increase their $ value on their room which again might enable the to renew their linen.

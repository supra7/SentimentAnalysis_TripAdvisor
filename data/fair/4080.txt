I am just finishing up 5 days here at Encore. Check in was not easy. We had 3 rooms and only 2 were ready. All 3 were to next to each other. We reserved 6 months in advance. 2 rooms were on the 22nd floor, the best they can do was 39th for the 3rdmroom. The problem is the 39 is a different set of elevators. So each time we wanter see our family, we had to go to the lobby and switch elevators. In each of the rooms, you could hear the people in the next room drying their hair, talking and flushing toilets. Also, the hall noise is really bad at 2am. The room has 1 tv on a swivel so it blocks the view from the bedroom to the sitting area and outside. The AT]M charges 25.00 to talke out 200.00 I would nor recommend this hotel.

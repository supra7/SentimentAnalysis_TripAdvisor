Disappointed! The first time we went to Chicago we stayed at the Hotel Burnham. The hotel was fabulous, the rooms were exquisite and the service was impeccable. As a result, we wanted to try another Kimpton Boutique Hotel and after seeing the reviews, we decided to stay at the Monaco. When we first arrived the front desk staff was rude and acted as if we were inconveniencing them when we asked for the added touch of the pet goldfish. They cared more about their chic instead of their job. The rooms were nice and large and my fiancee loved the little alcove where he could stare at all the activity outside. The next morning after our room was serviced VERY LATE AND we did not receive new glasses or the ironing board returned to its original location. An addition to the other amenities the Monaco provides a complimentary wine hour. During this hour, we went across the street to the White Hen to pick up some juice for in the morning. After returning to the hotel the front desk staff advised us of the wine hour. We politely said that we may come down later. Looking at our juice, he then emphasized to us that the wine hour was "FREE" insinuating that cost was a factor to us and we were being cheap. That night we wanted to eat at an italian restaurant and the concierge recommended a place 2 minutes away stating that the staff eats there regularly. The food at Nick & Tony's, THE GRILL ROOM, was horrible UNLESS YOU HAVE NO TATSEBUDS. We only ate two bites and then decided to eat sandwiches from White Hen. The next day we ate at a much better location for a lot better price off Michigan. We had a great time in Chicago but for the true hotel experience I am staying at the Burnham.

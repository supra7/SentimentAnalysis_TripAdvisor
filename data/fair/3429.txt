This hotel is nicely priced for the location but there are several problems that are very annoying: 1. The person at the front desk (Charles) was unfriendly from the very beginning for some reason. I could feel the unfriendliness even before I opened a mouth when I checked in. Every time you pass the front desk, you feel like you are passing in front of someone who has grudge against you. 2. The heater did not work. We stayed in late December and the temperature outside was sub 32 F. I reported the problem to the front desk and was a repair person came twice but it was never fixed. By the way, when the service person was working on it, the heater was making a noise that sounds like someone is banging a pipe with a hammer hard. I asked if this is normal and was told yes. One another couple who I met in the elevator was also talking about this problem and it seems like this is normal for the hotel. 3. Wi-Fi costs $5 per day. Security code is changed every day. Even one start hotel gives this out these days. 4. Locker costs $5 per day. Even a one start hotel does this for free.

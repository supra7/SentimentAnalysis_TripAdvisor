We stayed here on hh honors points. For 80,000 points per night , we were extemely disappointed with the rooms. We had to move three times! All of our rooms smelled of mold and had ants in the bathroom...after being upgraded to a ocean view we decided to just try and enjoy our stay. The grounds are nice, pool areas are impressive. Those are the good points. The extremely overpriced food ($25 for a burger?), inattentive front desk staff and overcrowded parking ( we had to park at the shops of wailea mall down the street and walk back!) ensured we would never stay here again. We stayed on maui last year at the Diamond hawaii resort/spa and Kea lani hotels and experienced clean, comfortable rooms and superior service compared to the very much non grand wailea. And keep in mind this review is coming from someone who paid nothing for his room! It was free with our points....Check out the diamond resort or the fairmont kea lani, you wont be disappointed.

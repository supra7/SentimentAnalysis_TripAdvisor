We stayed here 10 years ago when we got married. Even back then the service wasn't very good. This time we renewed our vows at the chapel but stayed at the Seasons. We still spent on the spa and renewal ceremony about 5000. We asked if we could swim in the pool between are rehearsal and our spa appointment even offering to pay. They said no but we could eat at one or their restaurants and stare at it. I'm not making this up. I went to the desk to see if this was for real. I was told all the managers were in a meeting. The same meeting they were in 10 years ago when I had a problem and needed a manager. Maybe after another 10 years of this meeting they will be able to fix the problems with this hotel. Stay at the Seasons.

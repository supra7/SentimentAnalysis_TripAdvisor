After staying over the years at many condos/resorts on Maui I finally decided to give this one a try. We stayed in a one bedroom in the Puna Point building and thank goodness we got a special of half off or we would have probably demanded our money back. We did have air conditioning so that was good. The room itself really was nothing better that what you would find at a Motel 6. Old and funky and strangely depressing. The patio was really nice but our neighbors were so loud that we couldn't even begin to enjoy sitting out there. There is only a thin divider between patios...great if you like to evesdrop! They were so loud we had to have our air conditioning fan on high the whole night to get some sleep. Not what you are looking for at $500.00 a night. This resort is all about the beach. We loved the beach at Napili...it is outstanding! The restaurant is very nice and the staff friendly. The grounds are very pretty but they hide the fact that the buildings need serious updating. There are many better options nearby (like the villas at Kapalua) that charge less and are sooooo much nicer. My advice: go to the beach for the day, maybe have lunch at the restaurant...but unless you want to spend your hard earned money at a sad, old, tired resort please stay elsewhere!

Be wary - El Dorado Maroma (EDM) makes a habit of cancelling bookings. They cancelled ours in favour of a large Wedding Party 24 hours before our arrival and whilst on-route from the UK. We had spent a long time selecting the EDM and had paid months in advance so were very angry and disappointed with their behaviour. To get any satisfactory response we involved local travel agents, Kuoni in the UK, directly contacted the owners (Karisma hotels). We also went to the EDM to face the manager and demand an explanation. Via Roma Travel (UK - many thanks) we identified an acceptable alternative hotel - this destination was not suggested by either Kuoni or the Karisma chain - though was part of the Karisma Chain (Azul Beach). To be fair - once we had accepted the alternative, EDM and Kuoni were generous and considerate in their compensation. We were relocated to Azul Beach and had great time - all's well that ends well ?

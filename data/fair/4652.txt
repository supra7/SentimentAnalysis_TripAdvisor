This was our 2nd stay. Years ago we were beach side and had no complaints. This time around we stayed gardenside. This place is in desperate need for a renovation. The grounds are well kept and clean, but the rooms are getting run down. It's not brutal, yet. You get what you pay for, shop around. If your renting a car, which you really should, consider a bed and breakfast. Don't expect much, it's basic. If you want a relaxing and low key vacation stay in Kehei.

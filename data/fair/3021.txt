Overall major disappointment! Came to celebrate 15 year anniversary, booked almost a year in advance. Booked ocean view room, top floor. Got a small window of ocean and a terrific view and sound of the mall parking lot next door. When booked was food we would get "special" treatment for our milestone....that didn't happen. Broken airconditioner, carpet that was disgusting, broken elevators and the constant sound of the food court delivery trucks unloading at the mall. Not what you expect when paying almost $500 a night!

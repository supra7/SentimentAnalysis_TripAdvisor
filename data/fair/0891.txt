Well we arrived here to celebrate our honeymoon, come to find out this hotel doesn't guarantee you your room or bed that you pay for in advance, for example we payed for a deluxe ocean front room with a king bed. We got a partial oceanfront room with a queen bed. The front desk acted like this was our problem and not there problem. We even asked to speak with a manager and she wouldnt even look me in the eye. Trust me we are easy going people, this is the first time we felt it to be necessary and justified to post a bad review. I think this hotel claims to be a 4-5 star hotel, not hardly they are a 3 star hotel. We even had to call a couple times to request to have our room cleaned. This kind of stuff is acceptable when staying at a hundred dollar a night hotel, but not when paying three times that amount.

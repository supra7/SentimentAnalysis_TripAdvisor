I understand that most of the Hawaii condo are individually owned and chains like Outrigger are only running them. In the case of Maui Eldorado my feelings are very negative probably because I have been assigned a condo that was very unconfortable in very humid extreme corner of the building very "smelly" no view at all - it was very poor also as a garden view. I am not saying that the location and the resort are not nice I am confirming my negative feelings about my stay, most likely if I would have had a better condo my opinion would have been different. Poor clealiness - poor parking facility It was for one night only - transiting to a better resort

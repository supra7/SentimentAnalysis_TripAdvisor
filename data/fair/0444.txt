I was forced to stay here for a work conference and I would never recommend or return to this Westin again. There are so many other nice hotels in Seattle and this is not one of them. The carpets are gross; I was afraid to even walk on them even while wearing socks. Bathroom looked dirty when I checked in, stuff was in the sink and just looked unclean. The towels were old and thinning. The shower is fit for a very short person...not sure how any adults over 5'5" are supposed to maneuver properly in there. The glasses in my room were disgusting, a sign that the rest of the place probably was not properly cleaned, either. If they don't even leave clean glasses, then they certainly are too lazy to properly clean other parts of the room. In addition, the TV is a piece of junk...analog only stations...what hotel doesn't offer HDTV at this price point? Wireless charge of $10/day is ridiculous, too. Icing on the cake here is that the room has been HEAVILY sprayed with some sort of perfume or air freshener which has me very concerned about the smell they are trying to mask. Overall, I am clearly not impressed and cannot wait to leave in a few days. I hope my company is getting a great rate here b/c my discount at the Four Seasons is $160/night and that is TRULY a 4+ star hotel that knows good service. This place is a dump.

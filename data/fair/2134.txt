Overall, I would suggest staying elsewhere if at all possible. The hotel is very old and only some of the rooms are renovated. The first day I checked in, they put me in the tiniest hotel room I have EVER seen. It barely fit a queen bed, one nightstand, and a small dresser with TV on top. And the bathroom was so small that I could sit on the toilet and wash my hands in the sink and my feet in the shower. And the bathroom was old and dirty (hairs on the floor) and the bedroom carpet was awful. Not to mention the fact that my headboard shared a wall with the elevator shaft! I tried to get them to move me, but they said they were oversold that night but could try to move me the next day. They also said the elevators would shut off at 9 pm so it shouldn't be as noisy. 9 pm came and went and the elevators still went. All through the night they went on and off and I barely slept a wink. So at 6 am, I decided to get up and go to the front desk. That guy was actually very nice and tried to be accommodating by offering me breakfast which I already had with my group. I asked for a renovated room and he was able to get me into a handicapped king which had been renovated and was MUCH nicer than the room I had been in. It was a normal size, had nicer bedding and bathroom, and was just in general much more pleasant. If I had gotten that room to begin with, I may have given it a slightly higher rating although the walls were still quite thin! I was frustrated that I lost a night of sleep though since the room was already available at 6 am when I complained! The hotel is in a great location and the staff seemed friendly, but overall, unless you can be guaranteed a nice renovated room, I would say find somewhere else!

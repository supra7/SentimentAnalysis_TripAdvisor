We do an annual girls weekend in O.C. We have stayed at The Commander before, but I do believe this is our last year. As other reviewers have stated, the rooms are dark, outdated and barely clean. As we were standing in line to check in, there were some other guests in front of us asking for some bathroom ammenities (shampoo, conditioner, etc.) and the lady behind the counter (who I believe was a manager or owner) laughed and told them she could offer them some that she has taken from other hotels that she stayed in. I honestly couldn't believe my ears! Yes, it's true, in the "living room" area your $269 a night buys you a vinyl sofa, a bakers rack with a 19" old television, a few chairs and a desk with no mirror above it (which would be nice considering this is the room with the best light from the windows). There is no telling when was the last time the mattresses have been updated, so unless you plan to drink alot and pass out, good luck sleeping on them! You also can rent a room which sleeps six, but most likely six people are not going to arrive in one vehicle. However, don't even think of asking for a second parking pass. The rude hotel staff will be quick to tell you 'One parking pass per room, you can park on the street"! Now, all that being said, the location is great. It is also nice to have the kitchenette with a full refridgerator in the room. But I can honestly say, you would be better off spending this kind of money some place else.

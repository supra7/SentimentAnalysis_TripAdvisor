Stayed at the W on Lexington for 1 night. Check-in was fine but the "spectacular room" the check-in person told me I had turned out to be only slightly bigger than a walk-in closet, had no view, no room safe and a broken message light, which meant i missed a message. The fan in the room was loud and kept turning on every 10 minutes, keeping me awake. Check out was slow and the person didn't even ask me how my stay was. The place looks better than it is. Completely over-rated and disappointing for almost $700 per night. Will not stay there again.

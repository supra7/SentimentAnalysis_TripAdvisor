This is not a Marriott or Hilton but with the price they charge what would you expect? Honestly, the place was clean and is perfect if you do not intend to stay much in the room. I don't go to the beach to hang out in the motel...but if you do this place isn't for you. Everything is quite old and in desperate need of renovation. Smoking is not allowed in the rooms so the majority of the renters were hanging outside on the cheap chairs smoking...and in some cases drinking. It was laughable. Also, they claimed to offer free wifi but none of our 3 devices worked. They claimed it was us but there was no way that all 3 of our devices didn't work at the same time. Stay here to save money only. Don't expect luxury, quality or service.

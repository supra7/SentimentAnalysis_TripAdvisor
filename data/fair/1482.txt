I'm visiting from Los Angeles I book this room cause they say they are downtown, that's good for me cause i didn't want to rent a car i can walk where i need to go. This location are at least five miles from everything there's no stores, restaurants or anything. They do have a shuttle that supposed to take you downtown the problem is you might can catch the shuttle. you better off taken i taxi, the hotel room i stay in was great and quited the the soda machine have warm sodas and the ATM machine don't work. If you planning on staying at this location rent you a car cause the location is isolated from everything and the staff seems to don't care about there customers.

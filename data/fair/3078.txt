The positives: Wonderful grounds, pool and beach. Nice location next to Whaler's Village for shops and restaurants. BUT: This Westin has serious customer service delivery issues. Our AC didn't work and we reported it at 4 p.m. after check in. After calling back again, the engineers finally showed up at 11 p.m. after we went to bed. They had to get into the ceiling and replace the condenser. We also requested a rollaway at checkin that took 8 hours to be delivered. The rooms are VERY small - no closet (armoire only) and very few dresser drawers. Both rooms need a "deep clean" - especially the drapes which are a light color and have been stained and appear filthy. We traveled with 2 teenagers and after one night ended up getting a second room. We also had an issue at the restaurant. They had signs advertising a special July 4th meal. When we ordered it, we were told it ended 2 hours before - they had just neglected to take down the advertising. While there are some positives here, you can do far better at the Marriott or Hyatt. Westin needs to do a serious quality control review at this property to protect their brand's reputation.

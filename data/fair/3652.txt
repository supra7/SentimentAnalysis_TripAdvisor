I cannot recommend this hotel. Yes, I know that all the hotel rooms in NY are small, but this was ridiculous! I've stayed in other NY hotels, but never in a room this small. Even the elevators were tiny. I will say the bed and linens were nice and comfy. There was no where to put anything! Thank goodness we weren't in the room much. The closet was tiny - not even big enough to open up your suitcase in- and there was no light in it. The thing that disappointed me the most was that there was only a shower - no bathtub. I know that doesn't matter to a lot of people, but it is important to me and considering I booked the room through the hotel's website I really think they should include that in the room description. They didn't. There was also no shower cap, so I had to work to keep from getting my very long hair wet when I showered each day. The person who said in another review that the bathroom was a nice size obviously had a different type of room than we did. We could brush our teeth in the sink, take a pee, and shave a leg in the shower all at the same time. The location of the hotel was good - about 7 blocks from Grand Central. Also, the Bliss spa products in the bathroom were very nice. I did have a facial in the spa one day and it was one of the best I've ever had. I do recommend the spa - they know what they're doing there. Keep in mind that this is a very trendy hotel and there is always a lot of buzz going on in the lobby. Oh.. and we also got a wakeup call early one morning that we did not ask for. All in all - go spend the same amount of money at one of the other million hotels in Manhattan and get yourself a nicer room.

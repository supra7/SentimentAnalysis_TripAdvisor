My family and I stayed here on 12/28/10. Great location on the water, right near the North End, and short drive to Logan. Our stay however wasn't very good: super noisy hotel at all hours, too-small second floor lobby, waiting for crowded elevators, lame pool - plus in our room (#527) we could hear the elevators non-stop and the toilet was really dirty (yuck!). A nod though to Mike Barnes out front who was super helpful.

So my stay at this hotel was actually great! My husband and I stayed here along with another couple. Our friends were in the room next door. The staff was very accomodating when there was a mix up with our room, and the location was ideal for our trip. BUT, when I got home I discovered that I had a couple of bug bites. No big deal, I've had bug bites before. But then the next morning I had dozens of bites all over my body! I knew right away what it was, bed bugs! My friend had found what she thought was a bed bug in the shower the first night we were there. I shrugged it off, but now I know that is what it was. When I discovered the bites, I called my friend to see if she had any. Sure enough, she was also covered in bug bites! my friend and I live in completely different states, so there is no other option than that these bites came from this hotel!!! I'm sorry to write this review because we did enjoy our stay but I feel I need to warn anyone who is going to stay here.

A colleague and I stayed in two different rooms in different areas of the hotel, and had the same problems (we did not know at the time, until we compared notes later). This was during the week of Presidents' Day. The rooms were spectacularly hot (80+ degrees), even though it was snowing outside. Engineering seemed to know about it, and so did the front desk. We were both moved from our original rooms to different floors, and experienced the same problems there. Engineering was very courteous, but they offered me fans for the room. Can you imagine - fans for Boston in February?! The front desk also tried to be nice - they even offered a free meal in the restaurant. The hotel is very convenient if you are downtown, and the restaurant is absolutely first-rate. It is also not that expensive given the quality and location. However, I would check carefully to see if cold air is coming out of the air conditioning in your room when you check in. If not, turn around and find another hotel.

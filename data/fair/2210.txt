This place is pretty typical of old, historic hotels: when you walk in, youre stunned by the gorgeous lobby, but then youre disappointed when you see your cramped and dusty old room. I was there for a conference, so there were a lot of people in and out at the same time. The elevators were hopelessly overloaded. The conference facilities were nice, but labyrinthine. Woe those attendees who forgot their maps upstairs. The room was really small  you could barely pull the chair out enough to sit down. The windows were ancient and wouldnt close properly. No curtains, just some shades. The bathroom was tiny and the fixtures were old and worn, and not perfectly clean, either. Completely sub-standard. Internet access is not free, and they tried to charge me for an extra day. The extra charges on phone calls are outrageous. If Im already paying a Corporate rate, I dont appreciate being nickeled and dimed to death! On the plus side, I got good food from room service, although it was also expensive. No breakfast included here! And service was generally snooty. Location is about the only thing this place has going for itself. Overall, this hotel was a disappointment, not just in price-service relationship, but also in quality. I wont be back.

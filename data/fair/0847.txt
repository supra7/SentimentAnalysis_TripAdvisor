I booked the hilton in san diego, because I thought it would be a nice retreat for a long weekend. The hotel is beautiful and right on the water. I think I could have been satisfied with a nice hotel that didnt 'nickle and dime' you for everything. Gym fees, internet fees, parking fees, etc. I didnt really think the hype of the hilton was worth all the extra fees. If the room included the extras, it wouldnt have been so bad.

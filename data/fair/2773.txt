It has some fun things, like a bar in the pool, but the drinks start at $15. They book events like whale watching and you can get the exact same thing for 1/2 the price by looking on the Internet. The first day I got there I had their buffet breakfast. Everything was cold, there was a meager selection and it was $30. Their sprinkler system has a pump that sounds like a jackhammer so you can't sleep with your windows open. You can hear your neighbors through the walls. Though it is lovely in some ways, it is artificial. Maui is so beautiful and there is so much to do hiding out in a overpriced artificial Maui just does not make sense.

Second visit to this Travelodge and the last. You now HAVE to check in at a machine in reception which means you cannot ask for the quieter rooms at the back. The person at reception could best be described as miserable. In the past I have found the staff good. The room itself was clean but looking tatty, the mirror was cracked, the window vent missing which caused a draft, the sink tap broken and the bed was a joke. I know it is budget but they are obviously not spending any effort on the place now. If you can get a room for 19 go for it, if not then best avoided.

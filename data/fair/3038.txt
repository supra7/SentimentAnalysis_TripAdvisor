Please do not stay at this hotel. we paid a great deal to stay here for our honeymoon. We even paid to stay in a nicer room and i signed up for the star reward program. the westin hotel are known for being a good quality hotel but this one falls short. We stayed in cheaper hotels with average rating and had a much better experience. When we got there they put us in their star reward suite floor. this was s suite and it was disgusting. the room was not well cleaned. the hotel needs to be fixed up. the wall paper was falling off the walls. the carpet was dirty. the staff was not helpful. we end up having to complain to see if we could get money back. after a few room changes we ended up in an ok room which was their best room. the room itself was not very clean. the shower had mold on it. the bed was the best though. we did not a great view most of the views face into the court yard so you only get a side view of the ocean. the breakfast was awful. many days we waited an hour or so for a wait staff to even come over and give us water. at the end of our trip we decided to eat out b/c the service was so bad. we had free vouchers for the breakfast too. it wasnt worth it to us at the end of the week. They ended up being construction in the suite next to us so it was not relaxing. we were not even notified of this. it was one of the worst hotels i ever stayed at. the elevators smelt like beer and sweat. there seemed to be alot of spring breakers which surprised me. the elevator broke down a few times. Our water was cut off by the construction without us being notified. I was even surprised that the pools didnt even seem to be cleaned. there was always alot of stuff floating in the pools which disgusted me. How much time does it take to skim the pools.

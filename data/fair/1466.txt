Negatives: The hotel is very difficult to find. Unlike most hotels, Suitedreams has a little door entrance on a side alley street. The hotel was noisey and there was constant banging throughout the night. We would wake up with aches and pains from the uncomfortable hard beds. The breakfast consisted of stale toast, coffee, biscuits, cheese and ham. There are no English TV channels. There are hundreds of places to stay in Rome closer to key points of interest that are probably cheaper and offer better value i.e better breakfast, balcony / garden, a bar on premises and a comfortable bed! Positives: The staff was very helpful. They reccomended some great places to visit for sightseeing, dining and shopping. You dont need more than 2 days to see Rome. The hotel location was great. You get free drinking water in the mini fridge. Tips: Do NOT buy the 'Roma Pass' if you dont plan on going to 5 museums or more. The Vatican is not included in the Roma Pass and it is primarily the only thing that is not free in Rome of key interest. It is better to get a Metro Pass for 7Euros for 3 days. Buses are confusing and too crowded. Beware of pickpockets. I would never reccoment this hotel to family / friends.

I read the reviews that said that the rooms were small, but I was travelling by myself and got a really good rate in this good location. However, the room was even smaller than I expected and reminded me of a cruise ship cabin. I actually felt a little claustrophobic. Free internet was a bonus I wasn't expecting and the staff was friendly, but I don't want to stay in a room that small again.

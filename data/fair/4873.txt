My boyfriend and I just returned for a weekend stay in Chicago at the Hotel Blake. We originally were going to stay at the W City Center but due to a last minute deal on Expedia, and positive things I read about Hotel Blake, we decided to stay at this new boutique hotel. I heard there were some kinks initally but that they had been worked out. Unfortunately, this was not true and we were very disappointed in the lack of customer service and attention to detail that most boutique hotels, especially those in the Preferred Boutique group, usually have. First, what you might read about this "luxury boutique hotel" on Expedia and it's Web site is false advertising. While the hotel looks nice from the outside and is located in a great area, there are none of the luxuries they promote (i.e., plama screen TVs, TVs in bathroom, robes, Molton Brown products, morning paper etc.). And, the customer service was awful - they made us feel like we were constantly putting them out any time we asked for something. When we arrived, our rooms were very warm as the air conditioning wasn't working and the windows did not open. The staff offered to provide us with another room but it was the same situation. They did not have fans or anything - basically they told us to tough it out. Also, I tried to talk with the manager several times during our stay but he was never on duty. I could go on and on...So, if you are looking for a luxury boutique hotel get away spend a little extra and stay at The James or W on Lakeshore as Hotel Blake still needs A LOT of work and some customer service training.

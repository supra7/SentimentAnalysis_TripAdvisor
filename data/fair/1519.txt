I was fooled by Le Fabe's cool website. This hotel is nowhere worth the price. Pros: - Free Internet access. - Alex, the main employee working there speaks good English. Cons: - Room was small. - Poor bathroom design. Shower/bath has a panel that covers only half of the area, so when showering, water gets out and gets the floor wet. - Small and very thin towels. - Extremely weak Wifi signal. Wasn't able to get a Wifi connection from our room at all. - Slow Internet. Luckily we brought our own cable and was able to get Internet access from the wall, but the speed was slow. - Poor location. The area looks okay during the day, but come night time, it was a bit scary. Drunks and homeless people on the streets and most stores closed. We also stayed in the Moulin Rouge area during our Paris trip, and stores there close much later than this area. - We spoke to one other employee when Alex wasn't around (didn't catch his name), he tried his best, but his English just wasn't very good. - The double bed was just two single beds put together. My girlfriend kept falling into the crack between the beds. Overall, this is just an extremely overpriced hotel. Don't make the mistake we made. Also, not making any accusations, but I really have a funny feeling about all these 5-star reviews this hotel got. Along with their beautiful website, let's just say they really know how to market themselves on the Internet.

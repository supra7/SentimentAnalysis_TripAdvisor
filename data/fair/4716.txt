I just returned from the Sheraton Maui. We were there 12/24-29. I chose this hotel as the prior reviews said this was the best on Kaanapali beach. Well I beg to differ. The hotel was not at all upscale; very basic with no pizazz. The beach had a big drop off to the ocean which took most of the lounge area away. One day my daughter could not even get a chair as they were gone by 8Am. The next day she went at 7:30 and got chairs and umbrella. The pool was without any character. If you don't stake out your chair by 8AM, you won't have one. I found the staff fine and had no problems. We visited the Hyatt and the Westin-both upscale places. The best was the grand wailea, but we couldn't get a reservation. Now that's a nice hotel! The one advantage of the Sheraton was its closeness to Lahaina. We ate there several times. I would not recommend Longhi's-way overpriced and less than ordinary food. However, I can't complain about the price of the hotel. I guess you get what you pay for. I found it quiet, while the other hotels were buzzing.

We stayed at the Place D'Armes for New Years/Sugar Bowl. Note that when you book this hotel during a "special event", the stay is non-refundable, but the website is very upfront about that. While there is many positive reviews about this hotel, I am afraid the negatives outweighed the positives for this stay. First the positives. The location is excellent, right in the FQ, very close to Jackson Park. The courtyard and outside of the hotel has that old New Orleans charm. Fortunately, the weather cooperated enough so we could sit in the courtyard, rather than the dismal room. The hotel has parking and the valet was quick. I have waited for hours on my car at other hotels in the quarter. Our room was quiet. That too is rare in the Quarter. The negatives. Our room was dismal. Dark, dirty carpet, flea market quality brown bedspread, 80's 19" TV. While the room had some shabby chic charm, it did not make up for the saggy bed that honestly, I didn't even look under the sheets at the mattress. Bathroom was so small, tub and toliet and the sink was outside. We used extra towels to cover the dirty carpet and pulled a chair over so we could put our shoes and socks on right after our showers. AC was right next to the bed so you got a constant draft. Windows were painted shut. We were in a second floor room, so you have to lug your suitcases up a narrow flight of stairs. We were traveling with others, some of their rooms were nicer, very hit or miss. Due to the full hotel, we could not change. Fortunately, New Orleans is so much fun and you don't stay in the room. I guess you could call it a good drinking then crashing hotel.

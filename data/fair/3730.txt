Recently stayed 3 nights. We saw several roaches, the onsite manager said they had a problem with the "palmetto bug" = cockraoch. They never offered to transfer rooms just apologies. My son found a roach on his bed 2 days in a row and also in the shower. Beware!!!! I am not going back nor do I recommend you stay here.

The view from our superior room was fantastic but from that point this hotel went down hill fast. Expensive and indifferent food rather tatty and the noise each night as the Lu- au churned out the so called local culture under our window was intollerable. Maui is civilised and very manicured, if this is what you want, then try a different hotel.

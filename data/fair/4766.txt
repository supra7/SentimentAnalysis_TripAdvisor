We stayed at the Lenox Hotel in boston over st patricks night. The hotel was very clean and the girls on the front desk were very nice and helpful. We were however very disspointed on how we were treated by the staff in the hotel irish bar which seem to be run by children pretending to be adults, it reminded me a bit of bugsy malone. We complained that one of the bar tenders was stealing money from us by short changing us which was pointed out by another hotel guest. He then insinuated that we were drunk and to cover up what he had done, which was not the case as at least two of the party did not drink. Because the barman had been rumbled, the bar would let us in then say we were drunk after being in there a matter of minutes and we would be asked to leave regardless of what time of day or night it was, once even allowing us to order a meal in there and then when the food was bought out asking us to leave. The bar staff seemed to be very young. I liked the hotel and would have stayed again but they seem to victimise us after the bar episode so on this basis I would not stay there again and would not recommend it. Don't go near the irish bar though, its terrible.....grim, grim, grim!

Misleading Onthe hotel's .com website, the Fitz Patrick in Manhattan was rated well and I thought I was getting a good place for a little getaway. The room that I booked was the deluxe room and was non smoking. Also, Hotels.com said the hotel had been updated in 2005.The staff was friendly but from the minute we stepped in the room I knew something was wrong. EVen though it was clearly marked non-smoking room, we could smell cigarette smoke everywhere. There were cigeratte holes in the curtains and the entire table/desk was covered in dust.The bathroom wasn't even big enought to turn around in. The mirrow was losing all of it's finish ( a clear sign that the place had not been remodeled last year) The bottom the vanity was also kciked in.Next time I will go back to a place we know and be a little bit less trusting of Hotels.com information.

We stayed in the Whitehall for 3 nights. The first night we stayed in a King "superior" room. We noticed the air conditioner was VERY noisy that night but just assumed that was how it was going to be. The next afternoon when we went back to our room to rest and shower before going out for dinner, we were surprised to find our room was 90 degrees and as humid as a sauna -- there was also a gaping hole where the air conditioner had been with only a flimsy grate keeping it from being wide open to the outside 11 stories up! The furniture was all pushed up against the walls. We went down to the lobby to talk to the customer service people who checked and said they were "fixing" the air conditioning -- they said that and then tried to ignore us. We informed them that we needed to rest and get cleaned up and that the room was unusable and dangerous. They again said they were working on it == and then tried to ignore us again. We again told them we coud not use the room and asked how long it was going to be == they said they were working on it but didn't know how long it would be. After we refused to just go away, one of the reps finally said he would find us another room. We were put into a King suite which was a much better room than our previous one and we thanked the rep; however, neither room was really that of a 4 (or 5) star hotel: wallpaper bubbling off the walls, uncomfortable beds (the beds were more than firm -- they were hard but then covered with a feather bed), problems with electrical outlets in the bathrooms of both rooms (in the suite the outlet was actually loose and sparked -- we could not plug anything into it), etc. We were also dismayed to find charges to our bill for things we did not use: wireless internet and minibar. When we told a rep that we did not use these things, she questioned us about them and then nastily crumpled the bill in our face and said they were off our bill. We will not stay in the Whitehall again.

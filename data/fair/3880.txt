I stayed here in February while visiting my daughter who lives nearby. It is really motel-like, my room was very small and seemed old even tho the furnishings were stylish. The view from the walkway to the room was of giant dumpsters and some really crappy apartments. Did enjoy hearing the waves at night. Glad I was on an upper floor as there were some skanky people out on the boardwalk (not the hotel's fault.) Staff very pleasant. I paid $99 a night, would have been really annoyed to pay any more than that as it was just so-so.

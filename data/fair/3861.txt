I honestly cannot understand how this is the #1 rated hotel in San Diego on TripAdvisor. It's incredibly over-rated and very expensive for what is a 3* motel with a great looking pool and sea view. The rooms are floral-themed circa 1978 and are in drastic need of updating. The wash basin is in the room itself which isn't great. The toilet and shower over the bath (which again is like a motel bathroom) are off the room separately. The "free" breakfast is served in pokey, dark room just off the pool - and you have to walk through it to get the pool. Breakfast is cereals, some bagels, bananas, apples and juice so don't get too excited. The pool is nice enough though smoking is allowed and with kids around, not brilliant. There is no pool service for drinks or food. There is some free wine for an hour in the afternoon but no great shakes. There is no restaurant - but there are restaurants locally who will deliver. There is free parking within walking distance of the hotel but it is limited - it's there though. Noise-wise, you can hear other balconies and because the area overlooking the pool is half-moon shaped, can be quite loud, although my 3-year old slept through soundly. For the price, this hotel (motel) is hilariously expensive. It hasn't had much competition in the past, but with hotels like Tower 23 springing up (2 minutes walk from the Pacific Terrace and better in almost every way) I hope they will have to reconsider their proposition. If you think you're going to get a great hotel because of the rate, you won't. But if you're happy with a good motel that has a pool and view and you think it's worth $350+ then book away !

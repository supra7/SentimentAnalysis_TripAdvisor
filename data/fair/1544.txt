We booked 2 triple deluxe rooms. The pictures on the internet are not even close. There was no couch and 2 very small beds in one of the rooms, and the view to the giant pile of trash 2 floors down. Hotel staff not very nice really. But... The Location was superb!!! I would not stay there again but would find better spot on same street.

Pros: -great location -delicious biscuits made to order -beautiful courtyard -some very nice staff members Cons: -rooms in dire need of updating (may not apply to all, but certainly did to ours and from other reviews there seems to be several rooms in this category) dirty carpet, ancient bathrooms, musty feel -very poorly lit overall, especially the common areas -some bitter staff members who put on a smile, but it's obvious they don't like their job Major Con: -Massive Cockroach in our room!!! The incident was not dealt with properly either. We did not ask for money back or make a stink, just threw our things together and checked out as soon as humanly possible. Never once got an, "I'm sorry." and the woman actually, said, "Well, you're in New Orleans." Great way to persuade us to come back. If you're going to mind the positive reviews, it makes no difference to me obviously, but I would definitely recommend fumigating your belongs upon your return home...unless you don't mind living with large cockroaches from down south.

Booked it as a reward stay for 3 nights with my wife. Small room, muggy smell, kind of mildewy. A note on the night stand said they will fumigate the next day and to please let the exterminators into the room. Noisy and busy area, the birds make such a noise starting around 5am. Not much chance to change anything when you arrive at 1am. We left in the morning to find the new hotel after a breakfast in the on site restaurant, which was actually very good.

When you stay in a 5 star hotel, you expect certain things. None of them are here. Well, maybe with the exception of a friendly and helpful concierge, which speaks to the credit of that person, rather than the hotel. The room I had, looked like it desperately wished for a renovation. The bathroom is tiny and is more of an excuse for a bathroom, rather than an actual one (attempting to bear in mind the star rating of the hotel, once again). The soundproofing level is next to none - had to enjoy various lovemaking sounds emanating from several rooms! Breakfast was a killer - all (yes, all) of their dairy products were expired and a complaint to the management was met with an "oh really?" raised eyebrow. Adding insult to injury, they've attempted to charge me for a breakfast that was included with the room. Long story short - never again will I stay in this hotel.

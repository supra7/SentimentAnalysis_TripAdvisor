Having stayed at numerous Hiltons across the US and the world, we were decidedly underwhelmed by our experience in this one. So much in fact that we only stayed one night, before we moved to Lotus inn and suites instead. It was run-down and very average, so whilst not a disaster, it was poor value for money and below par for the Hilton brand. Room service was of poor standard for this type of hotel, the room and the communal areas were tired looking and the general cleanliness and tidiness was poor. The staff were lovely though.

Where to start, where to start. Check in was a disaster. Reservations for one night on HHonors and one night paid. What a fiasco!!! Had to totally separate both reservations which started the whole ball of problems. Was told I would have to rekey my room key the next morning because they could not key my room for the two consecutive nights even though I was staying in the same lousy room. After checking in only one key would work so I had to go back downstairs and key the cards again. Parking was a hassle because you never knew where to pick up your car; Norrth Tower vs South Tower. Even if you called in advance they would never tell you where our car would be coming out. For $19 per night you would think their parking was a little better. Restaurants were way overpriced and food was below average. No wifi in the rooms although they said there was. No frig in the room although they said there was. Very disappointed with this stay and probably will not go back and waste my points on this joint. You guys need to get it together because word may get out that Hilton is a subpar hotel in Daytona. Nice location, terrible service.

While the staff were friendly & we managed to communicate with my minimal Italian the hotel bears no resemblance to its website See attached photo. It was incredibly noisy at night and was set in a fairly run down area w/o nearby eating except a small supermarket & snack bar only open during the day. The rooms had been redecorated but badly and awkwardly furnished. Howeer there were two trams that gave access to the Vatican & the Forum areas but not the Terminii .

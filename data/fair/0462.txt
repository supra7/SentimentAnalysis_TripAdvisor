I took a chance on this one. I was torn when booking a room at the Westin Seattle. Reviews of this hotel are mixed, but I relied on past Wesin-stays and thought that I'd give this one a shot. What a disappointment. I transferred to the W Seattle after the first night. Pro's: Location: Walking distance to everything downtown Seattle has to offer! Views: The higher the room, the better the view. My room looked out to the Space Needle and over the water! Bed: Westin's 'Heavenly Beds', as always, live up to their name. Front-Desk Staff: Very welcoming and courteous. Coldwater Bar & Grill (Food): Very yummy Con's: Public Spaces: Generally uninspiring Rooms/Hotel in General: Though recently undergoing renovations, this hotel shows its age everywhere. The room had stained/torn carpets. Bathroom was drab and moldy. Hardware and furniture are worn and tired. Room Service: Overpriced (like most 4 star hotels) and unfriendly room service attendants Coldwater Bar & Grill (Staff): Honestly? They scared me. Our servers were older, poorly groomed, and overbearing. One of them stood against the wall opposite the tables in our section and watched us (and others) as we ate... I'm sorry, but that's creepy. Overall: Sorry, but new cushions and bedding does not a renovation make. However, I have hope for this Westin. With a major staffing, service, and building overhaul, this could potentially be one of Seattle's finest hotels.

The service at the hotel is impeccable; the lobby and room were luxurious. Unfortunately, neither my husband nor I got any sleep as the hotel creeks all night. They did provide full disclosure that the building sways when it's windy and offered to provide earplugs or other alternatives, but paying this amount of money, I would prefer to be relaxed vs. having to drown out noises. Very disappointing, but management was very courteous to us in trying to resolve.

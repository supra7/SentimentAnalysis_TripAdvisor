The hotel was close to the beach. walking distance to " da kitchen" an excellent local eatery. great moco loco! our room on the second floor was alright except for the one day we went to the beach for the day and came back late in the afternoon and found the that we had no clean towels. actually no roomservice at all that day. we were told the staff went home at 4:30. sorry. part of our family had rooms on the 5th floor and they had toilets yep, toilets in the hall and all around the elevator. there was plastic over all the doors on this floor and down the scarry hall. this was the same on the 4th and 6th too . we assumed they were remodeling because on monday morning we were all shocked to hear the sounds of hammering and such at around 8am . if we choose this hotel again we will definatly call to see if the remodel is done first. it just reminds me that you get what you pay for.

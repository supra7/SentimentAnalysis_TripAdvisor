This property has potential, but is in bad need of a remodel. The common areas are nice. The service was good. But the rooms are worn out. Furniture, carpets and fixtures are in dire need of an upgrade for this to be considered 4 star hotel. Watch out for the hidden costs. Parking is $40.00! Hotel is only 7 stories, so don't expect a view.

We booked a 3 bedroom, 2 bath condo for a 3-day Disney vacation with 4 adults and 3 kids on a recommendation from a friend. While the rooms were very nice and clean initially, there were many things about our stay that completely turned us off to this hotel. After our first night we realized that we were only provided with 4 bath towels. In a condo of this size that is just ridiculous. We called housekeeping for more towels, which they brought up very quickly, but were surprised at checkout with a $40 housekeeping fee. This upset us because that was the only thing housekeeping ever did for us. They never even came in to make the beds. Speaking of beds, the sheets barely fit the beds and we found ourselves having to completely remake them every morning. What they call a continental breakfast was laughable. They only provide food in carbohydrate form (cereal and pastries), although there was some fruit. They never refilled the 2% milk and left it empty after 8:30. They claim that they have shuttle service, but it is only available a few times a day. It's NOT a constantly running shuttle service that you would expect, so you have to plan around the shuttle schedule if you want to use the service. After using the shuttle on the first day and realizing how inconvenient it is, especially for a family with young children, we ended up driving ourselves to the parks and paying for parking for our own convenience. The shuttle was also late to pick us up in the morning and we nearly ended up missing an appointment for one of our prepaid activities at Disney. So overall, the condo itself is very nice. It is kept up to date. The rooms were beautiful and held our group very comfortably. It is the (non-existent) amenities of this hotel that make it a "never again" for us. All 4 adults agreed that we would never be staying at WorldQuest again.

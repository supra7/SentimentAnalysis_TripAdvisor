Hotel has lots of gadgets in room :fax, internet connection, massive tv etc - but the room was not clean and the shower curtain stank,the bathrrom seemed to have been cleaned with a ditry mop. Staff didnt do anything about this and only offered me another room when I was changing hotel (way too late!). Stylish but tiny rooms,but a terrible lack of maintenance with bits of gunk on the walls( dont ask,dont tell) and a filthy carpet. It could be so much better if they kept it clean and looked after the rooms. Another gadget is not what they need.Great location but it is not enough and I moved after one night.

I stayed at the W New York for one night last August. Having waited in line at immigration at JFK for two hours, I was ready to collapse into bed upon arrival at the hotel. On arriving at the hotel, I was practically thrown out of the cab by the waiting hordes outside. I looked in vain for someone to help me with my suitcase (it was heavy!) and in the end a passer-by took pity on me and helped me inside the hotel. I left my suitcase at reception to be brought up, but waited almost an hour in my room for it, before going back to reception to fetch it myself. The receptionist promised me a free breakfast as compensation for the poor service, but after I checked out I noticed I had paid for my breakfast. The room was nicely furnished but tiny - any longer than one night would have been claustrophobic. The lobby was more like a nightclub than a hotel. Bliss toiletries in the bathroom were a nice touch. The guys in the room next door decided to party all night, and the walls were too thin to block out the noise. I couldn't wait to check out and won't be coming back. I emailed the manager afterwards with my complaint and never heard back.

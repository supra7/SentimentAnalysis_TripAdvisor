I checked what was available and it said it was a double bed. I checked it out on the hotel web site. The web site said amenities included a refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. When I got to the hotel with my print out that said a double bed and went to the room, it was the size of a closet with a single bed, bed side table and a tv on the wall. It was 11 feet wide with no refrigerator ,etc. The bed was situated with my head 4 feet from the air conditioner. I got 4 hours sleep because it was so noisy and the air was blowing only head. It was clean and I did feel safe for a positive comment. I would not have stayed there if the available room had been accurately represented.

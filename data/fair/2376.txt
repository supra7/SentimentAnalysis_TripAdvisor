We stayed over a long weekend to see sights and visit family. We stayed in a corner suite that faced the fire station. It was a very noisy not only because of the sirens, but also because our furnace fan was loud and ineffective at heating our corner suite.(I would have hated to stay in that room when it gets below freezing outside.) The maintenance man came and turned the furnace on after our first night without heat. Old unused baseboard furnace vents outlined the outside walls of our rooms and were falling off with some of the metal parts just laying on the floor. The windows were thin and opened without screening to the outside street below. There was much confusion over our booked room through out our stay. Thankfully, Ronnie was very helpful and straightened our charges out. The cleaning staff did a great job of cleaning our room over our three day stay. The complimentary breakfast was good. The hot tub was a warm tub our first night, but on the second night, it finally did get hot. The sauna did not work. The pool was clean and had plenty of towels for guests. The afternoon front desk was the same workers all three days we were there. At times we found them to be unprofessional and rude. There are several choices of hotels in Chicago, therefore next stay to visit our family, we will look for something else.

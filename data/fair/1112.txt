The front desk staff made me feel like I was lying. I booked a trip through Travelocity which included a $50 credit for the spa and a 4pm check out. However, I had to prove it in writing to the clerk. Secondly, the city view suite was awful. All I heard all night was the freight train going by. The showerhead had some filthy white stuff on it. Overall experience was awful.

At best the staff at Westin Seattle is indifferent: bureaucrats. The concierge acts like he pays for the maps; the front desk insisted that we pay for TWO connections to their outrageously priced (and lousy) internet service because there are two of us in the room. This being the second Westin I've stayed in during the past two weeks, I am getting the impression that management has decided to cut corners. Penny wise, pound foolish, once you're in this price category, for these little details (cheesy shampoo, tight-fisted clerks) are what distinguishes one upscale hotel from the next. This is a Holiday Inn about to happen.

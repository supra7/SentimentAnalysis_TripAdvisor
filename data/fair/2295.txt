usual problem, requested a high floor and they could not give us one, despite asking 2 days in a row. we booked a la fayettee suite and were disapointed to find that they all come with a cecting door! very poorly fitted conecting door, our sons were in a standard room and they dont have conecting doors !! one of the reasons for booking this hotel as it had an outside sitting area, however i was asked to leave it twice during my stay as it had been booked for private functions , whats that about ? it either does or it does not have an external seating area. bathrooms in all rooms very tired and in need of renovation. also only had 6 coathangers in a room that can take 4 peopel ! not great value for moeny we paid $300 plus a night and then stung $22 for breakfast !

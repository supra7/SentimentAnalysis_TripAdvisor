I stayed at the Intercontinental over Easter Weekend. I read the reviews on trip advisor warning that the hotel was not up to the typical Intercontinental standards...but thought the people were being hypercritical. Well....I learned first hand how run down and gross this property had become. We had a balcony room which was ready at 11 a.m. when we arrived. That was they only good part of the stay! The room smelled like urine. The wallpaper was falling off the wall. There were marks all over the walls. There was a vent over my head in the shower that was missing the cap and I could see cobwebs and dust while I was trying to get clean. It just felt grimy....like years of partying and neglect took place in the room. The balcony door was nearly impossible to open and close...once we did make it out there we noticed RED RUM was written in the 1/2 inch of dirt on the sliding door. awesome! This has clearly been there awhile due to the 1/4 inch of dirt filling in the letters. We did try to upgrade the room to the concierge floor because I read those were nicer...but they said no. We could stay in our current room and pay an extra $60 a night to have access to the concierge floor. We passed. With so many options in New Orleans...I would definitely stay someplace else!

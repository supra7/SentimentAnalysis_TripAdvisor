Room are perfect with excellent view. But service is bad and they don't carry respect. Very expensive parking of $52 and let me tell you a shocking news, they stole my GPS. And they say what is the guarantee that you have a GPS in your car, and fill a claim foam at the end. They don't realize that i pay 3 times for a night room than a GPS, i don't damn care about the GPS but a little respect and care for there customer. I never recommend for this hotel ever in my life again.

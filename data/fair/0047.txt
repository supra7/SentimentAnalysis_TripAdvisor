Hotel Seattle where the sheets have 3 different colors of hair. But that is ok because they were clean on the second day. The bathroom made my friend cringe. She asked if I brought flip flops and sanitizer spray. The dirty shag carpet didn't stop at the wall. It crawled up at least another three inches. I'd give it one star, but I saw The Shining, and that was worse.

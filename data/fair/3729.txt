We stayed in a ground floor unit. There were several "palmetto bugs" at night and in the morning. They were primarily in one bathroom and the kitchen, averaging two a day. At first, unapologetic management tried to say that the roaches flew in when we had the door open or came in on our clothes. It was obvious that the bugs were in the walls and possibly coming up the drains. It doesn't matter if they had a warm winter or what other excuse they want to try, they have a roach problem. Under the beds had not been vacuumed in a very long time. Staff come and go all day with carts clattering loudly up and down the walkways by the pool and the rooms. They are very noisy and disruptive. It is a very poorly thought out system. Garbage bags of towels and who knows what along with cleaning carts are left all day in front of the ground floor rooms by the stairs. There can be an extremely long wait for towels at the pool. The buffet breakfast is very low budget. The staff member in charge of the free wine and beer "reception" three nights a week watches like a hawk and does not allow some guests to pour more than one drink or use larger glasses. The snacks are very cheap. Walls are thin and there is a great deal of noise from other neighbours especially from the bathrooms.

My husband and I had seen the Inn at the Market a few years ago on vacation and had decided that we would like to stay there on our next visit so I really looked forward to staying at this hotel which is directly across the street from Pike Place Market. But I was truly disappointed. Although the Bellman were superb, the front desk personnel and concierge were sorely lacking in being service-oriented. When asking for a suggestion of a nearby restaurant, I had to ask several questions just to get the name of one restaurant across the street which had a 2.5 hour wait and had been told by this front desk rep that we would not need reservations. On a few occasions during our two-day stay, one of us asked for suggestions and it was like pulling teeth just to get a suggestion. They were never rude but just not helpful as you might expect from personnel at a fine hotel. I'm sorry to leave such a terrible review which I RARELY do but I would not go back.

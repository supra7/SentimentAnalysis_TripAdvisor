My wife and I have stayed at the Beekman quite a few times over the past five or six years. We were happy to trade the location and room size for the shabby decor and tired carpets. However, the last two times this year has convinced us to give up on the place. We were told that the hotel does not provide room heating unless the outdoor temperature is under 50 F (sounds like tenement rules to me). The doormen were never at the door and if they ever appeared, it was outside smoking. Our in-room tea alowance was one teabag and three packets of sugar daily. The trash bins were not emptied daily and the rest of housekeeping service was prefunctory. A guest left their room service tray and dishes next to the elevator door and IT STAYED THERE FOR TWO DAYS!!

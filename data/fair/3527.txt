IsOur group should have anticipated a disaster upon arrival when mobs of customers were lined up at 3:30 with complaints of rooms not ready....we overheard one couple state this was their 5th visit to the desk only to be given keys to a VERY occupied room. No bellman was even available to assist in the pouring rain....for 10 women!!! The desk clerk was very nice and upon request offered 6 vouchers for drinks for a party of 10...I requested to speak to the manager and explain that when rooms are supposed to be ready at 3 ....new arrivals really do not care to hear explanations such as we allow our "platinum and gold" members to check out late....thereby inconveniencing minions such as our obviously unimportant party. I might have felt I was being overly critical had there not been a long line waiting to speak with management. To compound matters....after one full hour at the desk and the absolute refusal of the "welcome desk talent coach" Scott -- to at least provide a measly cocktail for our entire party....some of our keys failed to work resulting in a subsequent return and wait at the dreaded desk. Mr -- is a poor representative of what is usually a wonderfully branded hotel. Choose well and differently....our previous stays at The Mela, Grand Hyatt, Marriott Marquis, Renaissance Times Square and even the Holiday Inn Empire State have exceeded my first abysmal 3 hours at this horrible place. The room...coined a cozy queen is without doubt the smallest room in existence.

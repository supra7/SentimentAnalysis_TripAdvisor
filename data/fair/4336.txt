Great location, hotel ok We booked this through Lastminute.com a couple of weeks ago as a birthday treat for us both as it sold itself as a 4* boutique hotel..also, I knew that it is in a fantastic location close to Bloomingdales and a short walk to subway stations, 5th  Madison Avenues and Central Park. When we checked in, the lobby  restaurant were undergoing refurbishment, which we weren't warned about, however there was a big notice to say that for the inconvenience, a complimentary continental breakfast would be available in the bar. The next morning, we tried it to find that there was a pile of pre-wrapped croissants (no butter or preserves), and a bowl of fruit, as well as only one juice, and tea  coffee- hardly a complete breakfast, and it appeared that the hotel was paying lip-service to it. If you are going to inconvenience customers, make a proper effort! The room, although not particularly big, was clean, decorated nicely with a fantastically comfortable bed. However, be careful as the games, CD library  films on the TV can cost $9 per hour! The bathroom was immaculate, with free toiletries but only one robe (odd as there were two of us), and the staff, especially Dave the barman, and Mike the porter were really friendly  helpful.All in all, not a bad hotel- excellent location  clean. However having stayed in other hotels in the States, I was disappointed in its fundamental qualities, and in my opinion should be rated as 3*. 4* hotels generally have a decent breakfast, service lifts for the staff to use instead of them using the guest ones, and a bar which isn't an Irish themed pub. If the little tweaks were perfected, it would be excellent, at the moment, it's just OK. But I may think about staying here again.....

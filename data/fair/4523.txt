After landing in New York City finding out that the apartment we had booked was unavailable we had to stay one night at Holiday Inn Express at 39th street. It was a stay to remember bot not to recommend. The tiny lobby was crowded with bags and people, the room was SMALL and decorated in a 1970's fashion and the breakfast was horrible. When we came down to eat nothing was left but awful white toast and watery coffee. The dining area looked like a very run down Mc Donald's. Not something you want to see on the first day of your vacation. The staff told us they were out of everything so we skipped the dry toast and had breakfast at Le Pain Quotidien instead. I have to say that the room was very clean, nothing wrong with that, but the elevator, staircase and breakfast area were in need of some refurbishing. I do not recommend this place to anyone who cares about ambiance. It might be good if you just want a bed to sleep in though.

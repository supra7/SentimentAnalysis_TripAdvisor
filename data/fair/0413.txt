Room okay, certainly a nice location, but the little things got to me. $9.95 internet charge. $7.00 dollar service charge if you put any personal item in the minibar fridge. $4.00 for a .99 cent tube of toothpaste in the gift shop. No TV listing in the room and the TV is analog and impossible to know what channel is what, and the main desk had no answers. I applaud that if you "go green" and forego housekeeping, they give you a $5.00 "food and beverage" credit, but really, a $5.00 food and beverage credit, that with the inflated prices really cost Westin maybe $2.50? How much does Westin save if you forego housekeeping, laundry, replacement of coffee and bath items? Thus, Westin even makes a profit if you "go green," undercutting that they even care. If the sheep keep giving this 5 stars, nothing will change.

Location is about all you get My family of 6 stayed at the Omni this past weekend (Feb 15-18) and we were disappointed. First, you should know that there is construction going on right next to the hotel. We could look out our window and practically touch the construction site. We did not have noise to deal with because of the holiday weekend, but another traveler might. Also, I had booked two rooms and paid extra for King Deluxe with two beds in each room. I also phoned the hotel to reiterate this necessity and to request adjoining rooms. My children are 10 and under, so we needed them to be in an adjoining room. When we arrived, we were told that not only did they not have any rooms with two beds, but that we also could not get adjoining rooms. They offered us a cot for free in each room - but still - I had paid about $100 extra for the two beds! Running bak and forth to two rooms proved to be a royal pain.The first night, I asked the concierge for directions to a Japanese noodle restaurant and she sent us to a different one than I had requested. Maybe she got a kickback - I don't know. The rooms are decent but the TV is TINY and as soon as you walk in, ther is a console stuffed with minibar food on the top -- I should have asked the hotel to remove the mini bar food! Also, when we left, it took over 30 minutes for the valet to bring our car. I think they didn't actually order it until we asked the second time after having waited 30 minutes already.The doorman was a pleasure and it was nice to have the hotels umbrellas (which were in our closet) on the day it rained. The location is great - but that is about all the good I can say.

I surprised my husband with a trip to New Orleans in June, 2008, and we booked Place d'Armes based on the positive Trip Advisor reviews. I would echo most of what others have said. The location was stellar! It was right between Bourbon Street and the River and right on Jackson Square. We were able to easily walk everywhere. This was the best part of the hotel. The price was decent. Breakfast consisted of coffee, OJ, and two options of store-bought pastries. Good to save a few bucks, but better to walk to Cafe du Monde two blocks away. Do not book for the free breakfast! The room was o-k. It was NOT as nice as what was pictured on their website. But, we did get a quiet, courtyard room in the back, which was nice. If they just updated a few things the rooms would be much nicer. They could start with the bedding, which was pretty old, thin, and getting dingy. Pillows were old and flat. It definitely had character, but it could have a little more character with some updating. The courtyards were nice and kept the hotel pretty relaxed and quiet. We didn't use the pool, but did read by it for an afternoon. The employees were generally extremely helpful and gave great recommendations. The only problem I had was that two days before our scheduled stay we got an email saying that the reservation had been "cancelled". I had just called a day or two prior to confirm our reservation and to get the cheapest way from the airport (2 or more--take a cab!). Apparently there was a typo with my credit card and instead of calling me, they just cancelled it. Thankfully I was able to "re-book" them before the hotel itself was booked.

Stayed here on a Saturday night. I had reserved a basic room. When I arrived around 2:00pm, I was told the room would not be ready until 3:00pm. An available upgraded room was offered to me for an extra $20; I took it. Room was small but nice: nice decoration, large flat screen TV, Radio and iPod player, etc. At check out, there was a $14 charge on my bill for using the mini-bar. But I never used the mini-bar. The explanation by the front desk person was that someone had come into my room to check the mini-bar. However, I checked into my room around 2:00, had a "Do not disturb" sign on my door, and check out the next morning. So there is no way anyone would have come into my room to check the mini-bar. Also, When I called room service several time, it would go into voice-mail !!! By the way, newspaper is delivered to you each morning at a cost to you, unless you call the front desk to tell them you don't want it. Pros: Great Location, Nicely decorated rooms, many amenities in the room. Cons: Rude people at the front desk, bad service, money trap on your bill (charges for things you didn't order or use)

The westin sits on the fabulous ka'annapalli beach and has the location from heaven. The interior design of the lobby is spectacular , with a waterfall and flamingo's. The Heavenly bed is well heavenly and if you wear earplugs the whole time you would have pure heaven. The hotel is dated to say the least as a building and wouldnt be out of place on the high rise strip in benidorm ( no joke) . the patio doors to the balconys are old and have no sound proofing at all. The interior design of the rooms , gives you an immeidate impressions of luxe , but really thats all it is interior design , the walls are paper thin , the bath was more of a shower tray and the sound proffing was none existant. We tried 6 rooms as the first one we went into , wa sover the waterfall whcih was fine , but neighboured the entertaining area , which was very very loud . We had asked for a quiet room by the way. so we were offered another room , complimantary upgrade apparently , whihc we stayed in for the first night due to exhaustion , but his upgradrd room was over the car park whihc is like piccaddilly circus from about 7 in the morning , we then toom a ocena view roomat an extra 350 for the 4 nights and its was only quiet whilst the oceann drowned out the sound , you could still hear you neighbours conversation! Maui is superb and well wort a trip my advice get a condo !! as all the other hotels looked the same. If you must viist the westin , just go to the Spa , its was the best massage i have ever had in my life.

We stayed at the Inn for 3 nights. After the first night, considered leaving early, but didn't out of inertia and fear that we would fail to find another place and/or not get a refund. (they said we could if they were able to rent it.) The room was very small. The bed was creaky each time we rolled over- did not allow for a good night's sleep! Shower only, no tub. Worst of all, they ran out of hot water our first morning. (other guests had the same experience.) When we let them know, the woman at the desk told me repeatedly why they shouldn't have. On the plus side, she got right on the phone to have someone take a look, but kept telling me why it shouldn't be a problem. Never once did she say anything about being sorry for the inconvenience, etc. She also said it's only happened once before in 2 years. (I think that was the frequency? i wasn't all that impressed with the track record.) The porch was nice access to the outdoors, but as noted in other reviews, not peaceful. We very much regretted the choice and will definitely not do it again.

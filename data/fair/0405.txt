I have stayed at hundreds of hotels around the world and most of the high-end downtown Seattle hotels. Just had my first stay at the Sorrento. I will never go back though I can see it's appeal for others.. Pros: Victorian look. Friendly staff - when you can find them. Small intimate feeling. Great quality food at the Hunt Club. Room Service breakfast was great quality (overnight cooked steel cut oats and whole grain pancakes). Negatives: A/C couldn't get the room temperature below 80F. When we arrived, the room was over 90 F. Cleanliness. Stuff still in the trash can in the room. A completed survey card still sitting on the desk in the room. Aged infrastructure. Toilet ran frequently during the night for minutes at a time. A/C is a window unit not central air. A/C was so noisy (chirps, rattles, etc.) it kept waking me up. I'm used to central air and not window units at high end hotels so this might not be a problem for you. Hunt Club restaurant (was original reason to stay actually). Very disappointed that the service was not nearly on par with say the Georgian at the Olympic Four Seasons (Fairmont now). Expected better treatment, better staff knowledge of their wine list, more attentive service. The food did taste quite good though and was reasonably priced for the quality. For a $250 dinner and $300 night at the hotel, I ended up feeling like I would have rather stayed home. I only managed a few hours of sleep. I've never felt that way before following the same routine at other Seattle area high end hotels or around the world.

read amenities carefully. When it said ceiling fan, that was a big tip off. Front lobby is air conditioned. You think wow this is a nice place. We visited during a heat wave. We were given a fan and told to prop open our door. There is a dog park across from the inn. If the dogs aren't barking, the fire trucks and ambulances zipping by are noisy enough. could have sworn I heard gunshots at 2 am our last night. If you're going to have an inner city establishment, get air conditioning so your guests have a restful evening.

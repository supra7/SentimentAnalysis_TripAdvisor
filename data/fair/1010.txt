Just got back from the KBH. Overall, we were disappointed with our stay. Positives: Housekeeping, groundskeeping and Mixed Plate restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a superb location for beach, Whaler's Village and transport to Lahaina. Desk person Salome was very helpful upon our arrival. Negatives: So called non-smoking rooms in the Kauai wing are sandwiched between smokers, so the whole wing is smoking. We couldn't sit on our balcony or leave our window open because of cigarette smoke. We were moved to the Molokai wing because it was "smoke free." Although there appeared to be less smoke in the air, we could still smell it wafting up from lower balconies. Our table tops weren't wiped clean during our entire stay. We had hoped to sit and enjoy a meal and drink during the nightly entertainment, but Jo Camel and her Marlboro man shared their burning dung with us there as well. In fact, the whole grounds and immediate beach area smelled like a smoky old nightclub, even with a good breeze. The Molokai wing has no elevator or tub, which was a pain after a long day of walking etc. We went to the KBH for rest and relaxation, but were wakened each morning around 5AM by old plumbing and inconsiderate neigbors "talking" at full volume. The "free upgraded room" upon arrival is purely a come on. My request for one was met with, "We're very busy and don't have the room." We had great weather and the ocean water and sunny skies were a super break from winter in The Great White North. We may be back to Maui, but will definitely stay somewhere else.

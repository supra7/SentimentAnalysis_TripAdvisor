Lobby staff were inexperienced and unprofessional!!! several guest had problems with getting there complaints across to the staff< including myself. The rooms were great if you could fight off the mosquito's. The amenities were great. although i have one really big complaint. The pool water was uncomfortably cold! and unbearable to swim in.That was a major complain of most of the guest we spoke to. We tried talking to the staff about this problem and the answer we kept getting was that a lot of people from Canada vacationed there.Well my answer to that was we paid just as must to stay there and that the water should be comfortable for all to enjoy!!!! the pool was not being enjoyed be hardly anyone.. that is a shame, because they are so beautiful.I was so disappointed that i wanted to sell this time share two days after we arrived. This is the first time i have ever been compelled to write a review about one of our timeshares. What a great disappointment , to me and to future family wanting to go and enjoy this resort. I have suggested they not go, and pick another vacation spot in mexico next time around.

We had a suite. It needed maintenance work but was "OK". We are not complainers so we just stayed in that room; we probably should have requested a move to a different room. But the flight is so long, and we were so glad to be there we went out to explore! When we did sit on the lanai, there were smokers under us, and their smoke drifted up to our lanai.(this is a smoke-free hotel so smokers have to smoke outside) Our room was also near the air conditioners so the noise from them was loud. Good things: Pleasant personnel at front desk, very helpful. Great sunset view from the front elevator!! Pool facilities good. Restaurant: we went over one morning and although there were several empty tables, we were told (by the very bored appearing hostess) it would be a 'wait of 20-30 minutes' (we didn't bother to wait). We did eat there the last night; it was so noisy between the music and the street noises...and then my husband must have had a bout of food poisoning as he was up all night.

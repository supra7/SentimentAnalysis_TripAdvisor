Overpriced - Noisy Location - Mediocre service. I've stayed at much nicer hotels in bigger cities for far less than this hotel. We flew into Seattle for a romantic weekend and attracted to the hotel's unique location we thought we would splurge and stay at the Edgewater. The room was nice, well decorated but nothing impressive. The room was small, a coffee table and two upholstered chairs were crammed at the foot of the bed. The small balcony was dirty (lots of dead bugs) with only a flimsy divider between ours and the next room's balcony. The balcony overlooked ... cruise liner decks and stateroom balconies! The noise of the cruise liner's engines, their bells, loudspeaker announcements and the hustle and bustle of the people boarding them right outside our window from dawn to dusk, did not make for a pleasant stay. We tried to order breakfast in bed. Room service took forever, they got our order wrong and the Hollandaise sauce on the Eggs Benedict was cold and congealed. Their muffins tasted store bought, not fresh. Their coffee was blah! Had the hotel cost $90 or $100 a night I would've put up with it, but for $400+ No way!

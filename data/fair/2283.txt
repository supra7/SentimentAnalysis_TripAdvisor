Pros: Room was nicely furnished-better than expected. Decent size, modern and updated. Decent location-any further from downtown would be too far. Near T-stop, prudential center/mall etc. Friendly staff. Cons: Noisy! Loud! Very, very thin walls. Can hear toilets flushing on other floors! Phones ringing, t.v.'s, vacuuming in other rooms! Half of the hotel was under construction- began very early every morning. The thermostat in our room didn't work. Ice machine broken or empty on at least 3 different floors. No fridge. No fan.

I cannot decide if I liked the hotel or not. It definitely is clean and the service was what I expected. But here is a list of my issues. 1. Booked a room with two double beds and requested a rollaway which was printed on my confirmation. Upgraded for $25 to bayview. At check in was told that rollaways were not permitted due to fire codes. Impossible for me and two teen boys to fit in the room we were given. Even though it was an upgrade, the room was so small, you could not walk around the beds, there was no door to the bathroom that you could close, only a pocket door that did not close. Windows were covered up in places with yellow tape, as if they were broken. Upon seeing the size of the room and the unavailability of the rollaway, I had to book another room. Funny thing is - in booking the new room - I got the cheapest room available at the time and it was much larger and nicer than the original room I booked (so my issue with the hotel, is what is the point of an upgraded room, what exactly did my upgrade pay for)...! By the way the cheaper room also had a bayview. Another point of contention, my friends stayed in a lower rate room and not only had more space, a bayview and a real bathroom door, but also received bathrobes, which I did not get). My suggestion is do not get the upgrade!! Another point of contention is the location. I think it is convenient in the sense that you can walk to just about anywhere you need to go, but I would not feel comfortable at night in that area, definitely as a woman with kids felt like I had to be hyper aware. I am used to the homeless, living and working in Boston, but the hotel seems to be in a very active homeless area. There is a lot of people asking for money, so just know this if you are going to stay here. I did like the pool and hot tub, but other than that, I don't think I would stay here again.

We rented this place because it is on Kaanapali Beach and we wanted a first floor condo. We didn't want to have to worry about eating out for every meal and then not having anywhere to even store the expensive left overs. We also chose the first floor so we could go in and out without having to deal with a lobby and elevator chaos, well ironically- we were in a condo right against the elavator shaft. We rented the place from an owner on a vacation rental site and of course she was not going to tell us about the "problem" but you almost want to cry when you spend 1800 bucks to not be able to sleep in past 7am or take any naps. If you want to stay at this place- ask whomever -where the unit is (not near the elevator). If you can get a condo for the same price anywhere else on the beach-I think this is the oldest one-so pick somewhere else. oh, and the pool is lame compared to the neighbors. More things- they only clean your room once a week and the gym is down in the basement and it is old, dark, and moldy smelling.

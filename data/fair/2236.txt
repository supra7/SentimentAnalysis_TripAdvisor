We stayed at this hotel in Feb 2003 on our way to a ski trip in Vermont. We booked through Expedia and paid the extra to stay in a Deluxe room.On arrival the hotel is impressive with ornate moldings and high ceilings. We checked in only to be told that they do not have deluxe rooms all rooms were the same. (Why do expedia charge extra then?) We made our way to room allocated only to find this hadn't been cleaned, the window faced a brick wall and was tiny. I wasn't happy and went back down to reception to demand what I had paid for. I was told that Expedia always do this but I got what I had paid for. I was finally offered the keys to another room which on inspection was larger. The bed and bedding were fine all clean and comfortable. The carpets were stained and in need of replacement. The bathroom was tiny, (only one of us could go in at once) and was in need of renovation. The sink was cracked and the tiling badly patched. The restaurant offered a good full breakfast although a little pricy. I wouldn't stay there again although the location was good and our stay otherwise problem free.

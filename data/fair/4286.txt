I stayed at the Beekman Tower Hotel in September for 5 nights and it was ok - good location, walking distance (15-20 mins) to time square and we got a good deal on priceline ($140/night). Upon check in we were placed in a suite with to twin bed - reservation was for one queen bed. Staff was friendly and switched us to another suite with a queen bed. The room seemed satisfactory at first. Clean bed, bathroom and kitchen but very old decor, carpet, curtains, etc. Carpet should be replaced asap!!! Stayed in the room for one night and started noticing small ants in the bathroom (more than 10 at a time) then later in the day found the same ones in the kitchen. After coming back to the hotel at midnight we decided we were not comfortable since these ants were probably also in the carpets! We called the front desk and were switched again to another even bigger room (bigger is definitely not better - I would rather a small clean and new room!). The final room ended up being fine, same old decor but it seemed clean and we felt more comfortable for the remainder of our stay. However, I would not stay here again and would not recommend it to anyone unless you can get an extremely good rate. Definitely not worth the rates posted on their website. I know reviews are mixed and it really depends on the room. If we stayed in the last room for the entire stay I would pobably have a different opinion.

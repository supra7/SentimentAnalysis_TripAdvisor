Read reviews about this Motel 6 as being brand new (not one that was another hotel before) and was expecting a new one. The clerk at the front desk was helpful when checking in but when we were struggling to open the front doors with our hands full he was standing by the front doors and just watched without offering to help. The beds were new and very comfortable. The sheets and blankets were very clean and white but the bed cover when pulled back there was a huge (size of an apple) burned hole on the inside of it. The room was extremely hot when we arrived at 8pm and it took till midnight to cool it down. The floors felt uneven, the bathroom was so-so. I just wouldn't recommend this hotel/motel to anyone of my friends or family.

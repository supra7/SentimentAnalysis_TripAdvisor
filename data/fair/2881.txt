I had some really unpleasant experiences when my wife and I had our honeymoon back in March this year. The male staff in the front desk asked us to present the booking confirmation email letter to him for check-in. He looked so impatient as I had taken quite a long time to find out the letter from our bags. Since then, he didn't smile at all, and had a poker face toward us, and very impatient to our questions regarding the hotel facilities and internet access. I understand his job may be stressful. But his behavior just made us feel unwelcome, disrespectful and upset after a long and tired flight trip to Maui and this quality of service is unacceptable as it is a 4-star resort. In addition, the room is clean but a bit old and certainly update is needed. Other staffs are really friendly and helpful and I would like to say thank you for their quality service. Overall, the location and the facilities of the resort are good but the front desk service we received were really bad and disappointed.

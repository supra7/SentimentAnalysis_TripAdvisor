We arrived at the Warwick Hotel on September 24, 2010 for a weekend stay. Staff was all very friendly and helpful, but room was a tremendous disappointment. Very dated, uncomfortable beds and not up to standard for cleanliness. Our "Space Needle" view room also overlooked the roof of the theatre next door and all its HVAC units - not attractive at all, but Space Needle was in the distance. Worst part was the noise from the street both nights we stayed - people yelling and whistling; honking horns; etc. until after 3am both nights. It was reasonably convenient to most sites, but in the middle of the monorail route - would have been better to stay on one end or the other to make travel easier. I would not stay here again.

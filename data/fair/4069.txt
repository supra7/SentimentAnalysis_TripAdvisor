We booked our trip through Expedia. Everything was on time and no problems. When we arrived at the front desk we had been up since 3am (Atlantic City time). While checking in the clerk told we could upgrade for a panaromic view we both declined. Then she went on to tell us that our rooms on the 13th and 15th floor would be noisy because of the nightclub. We said that was ok and got an eye roll out of her. We joked with each other during the whole check in process and couldn't get a smile out of her at all. Felt like she just wanted to get us out and there. A credit card was asked for incase we billed anything to the room. We signed paperwork and left. On the second day someone from the casino stood by the elevators and asked to see my room key but not the two teenage children because they said, "They didn't have one" and he let them go and another couple dressed better then us. Nice way to treat paying guest. They should treat everyone the same! On the last day we checked our bill and found out she charged us for the $20. extra a night for a panaromic view that we never agreed on. Oh but we gave our credit cards and signed. Our view a construction site, McDonalds and Ross. They wouldn't do anything for us and the manager wouldn't talk to us. First time ever in Vegas last time we will stay at Encore.

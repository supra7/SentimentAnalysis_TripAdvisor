My wife and I stayed at the encore the first night it was open to the public. We had booked a suite but we were contacted by the hotel front desk manager telling us we could not have that room because of a computer glitch that they were over booked. We were offered a regular resort room for a discounted price. Not really a great consolation considering thats not where i wanted to stay. The truth was they had vips staying in the suites and didnt care about the little people. Not a good way to start. Overall hotel is average for vegas standards. Small gaming and lobby. A few upscale restaurants, switch being the coolest. The Encore did nothing to set itself apart. Rooms were beautiful but not functional. Sofa faced away from a swivel tv that you can watch only in the bedroom or the sitting area. My suggestion stay at the palazzo where there standard rooms are much more functional. With vegas always raising the bar this hotel just may be right on par. Not what i was expecting.

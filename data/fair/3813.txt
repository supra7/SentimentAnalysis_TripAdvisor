This resort needs to decide on an identity. The place is showing its age. The first room we were put in was like a cave -- no view out either window and very dark. We were moved to a nicer room with an open view, but that took two hours. By the time this was settled it was 5 pm. We had to pay an automatic extra facility fee that allowed us use of the facilities. We went to the water park and learned it was closing at 5. Same thing next day. However, we lost one evening of usage of the pool and lazy river, but still was stiffed for the $20.00. This hotel is geared to conventions and convention attendees, not families. They seem to expect guests that do not use the facilities. Your money is better spent elsewhere.

Stayed here for business this week for two nights. the rooms are not designed for doing any work in at all. When I enquired if there are desks, I was told "No" The restaurant was disappointing, really below expectations. Great for happy hour, but just dont eat there. Overnight parking charge - extortionate. Front desk staff - need to be more customer focused. They dont seem to care about helping guests. Overll, there are several better hotels I have used in Seattle and I recommend one of those

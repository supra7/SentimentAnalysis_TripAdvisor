My wife and I honeymooned here for 5 nights at the end of January to the first of February. Well, first off, the hotel looks like a 2nd rate motel. Not very nice at all. I was very dissapointed in the rooms. The service was terrible. The first shower I took was all cold water! I mean freezing cold water. I called down and it took a couple of hours to get someone up to fix it. Another incident occured when my wife and I were in our room changing for dinner. Without a knock or anything, one of the employees walked right in on us changing and half naked!! They just inserted their key and walked right in. Absolutely horrible. Also, the guy at the excursion desk tried to rip us off and sell us an excursion for more money than it was selling for elsewhere. Dont book anything through the hotel. Also the food for the free breakfast is absolutely terrible. I mean disgusting. Same thing everyday and very poorly prepared. The 2 good things were the beach and the restaurant downstairs had a good banana's foster type desert that i had twice. Otherwise, the hotel was terrible, do yourself a favor and spend a little more to stay at a nicer hotel.

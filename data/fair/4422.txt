I stayed here after being stuck at the airport; my flight was delayed because of the weather. The airline company paid for my stay and my meal, I'm sure glad they did because this place was awful! It's renovated, but there is gross stuff everywhere; sticky floors, hair everywhere (even on the bed), white stuff on the comforter; everything was grossing me out! The restaurant is sketchy and the manager/waiter that waited on me was an odd character. My impression about him was right, because I just checked my credit card bill and I was charged full price for my meal, they took my voucher but did not apply it to my bill. If there is one thing that I cannot stand is cleanliness issues, this is one of my worst hotel stay EVER in that regard!!! The only positive thing I can say about this property is; the friendly staff (minus the waiter/manager at the restaurant), most of them were quite nice, from the front desk to the shuttle driver.

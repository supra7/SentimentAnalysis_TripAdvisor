Arrived with young kids at 2pm having booked via aged and specified our requirement for adjoining rooms. Told on arrival we weren't in adjoining rooms. When I asked them to suggest which of the three kids under 8 they would leave in a separate room they weren't able to help. Told us if we went away they might be able to get an adjoining room and would call us when ready. We didn't hear anything until we took a gamble and showed up at 8pm having heard nothing. Passed on this feedback to the hotel at the time they never bothered to respond Very noisy Close to airport though!

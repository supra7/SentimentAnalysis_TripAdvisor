Good value, could do better for same $$ My wife and I booked a package through Pleasant Holidays and were given 4 nights at the Ambassador. We had stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court (across the street from Ambassador) on two previous trips, also booked through PH for about the same money. Our 2nd fl room at the Ambassador was a more spacious than Maile's room, and we had a pseudo-kitchenette (counter/ sink, cabinets, and fridge, but no coffee machine or microwave) but we were put into a room w/ 2 doubles and would've had to pay to upgrade for a room w/ a king bed instead of two double bed. Both places are no frills, cheap, clean lodging, which is fine since you'll spend most of your time out-n-about. Our biggest complaint was the ridiculously loud trash trucks or tour buses that came by at 5am every morning hauling or loading something that caused a loud ruckus and had to back up to do it, making even more noise with the back-up beeping alerts! Not once did I hear those noises while staying at Maile, which is literally across the street! We wouldn't have minded an obnoxious wake up call like that at 7 am since we would have been up anyways, but 5 am is a little too early for that much noise! Since Ohana is a chain of hotels in Hawaii, we think they're a little more attentive to detail and have more options as far as rooms go. We asked several times about changing our room due to the noise and bedding option but the front desk was not very helpful with either complaints.The only reason for the low rating is that for the same money, you can do a lot better by staying at Maile Sky Court. These are your basic no-frills hotel rooms and you can expect to get what you pay for... clean room, clean sheets, a place to rinse off the sand/salt and sleep. But having been at both, I'm certain you can get more bang for your buck by not staying here.

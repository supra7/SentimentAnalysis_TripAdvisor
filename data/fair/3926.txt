Hotel Diva had it ALL--so we thought. It was the perfect location for us to stay just 1/2 block from the starting line of the Nike Women's Marathon. We were definitely the envy of all the runners who had to get bused in from faraway places in the wee hours of the morning. However, the one thing we didn't take into account was the NOISE on Geary street ALL NIGHT LONG. Cars honking, trucks backing up and beep beeping incessantly, people getting out of bars and theaters late at night and standing out on the street laughing and talking, car alarms going off multiple times. We didn't get any sleep all night, and I even tried to drown out the noise with the room's air conditioner. The hotel is very clean, the staff is exceptionally nice, and there's a Starbucks practically right in the lobby, so everything else was terrific, but don't stay here if you need rest for a big morning event.

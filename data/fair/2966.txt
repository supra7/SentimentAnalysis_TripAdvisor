While having a nice relaxing swim in the pool, a dead bird washed up on my wife's shoulder. She screamed in horror and all the staff could do was offer us a cup and ask us to fish it out for them. Not exactly what I expected from the Ritz. I thought they might approach us later and offer us a complimentary drink or some other gratuity, but nothing. Overall, we were very disappointed with the quality of the room, it was tired to say the least, and needed an overhaul. The sheets were worn and the bed had indentations where people had slept. Not to mention the cabinet door in the bathroom that was falling off the hinges. Not what you see in the brochure.

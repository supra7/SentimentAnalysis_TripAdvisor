Be warned -- 18-20 steps UP to the front door and 25+ more from floor to floor--narrow, poorly lit stairwells make it a challenge for all but mountain goats with built-in headlights. Special bonus--no elevator. Advice: don't bring a suitcase. You can also construct an accurate subway timetable given the station that seems directly below the hotel -- and keep close track of trash pickups that go on all night while the garbage crew noise alternates with the trains to prevent sleeping. OK, keeping it positive: Wi-Fi works in the lobby. Housekeeper let me use the staff fridge. Close to Columbia University.

Buzz saws, jack hammers and water outages await you at the lovely Hyatt Maui :) We booked our vacation this year at the Maui Hyatt, after a wonderful experience at the Kauai Hyatt last year we had high expectations. Unfortunately the hotel is under construction, the pool area of all things, so whilst sunbathing you will be serenaded by buzz saws and jack hammers. This is particularly fabulous while waiting in the spa's open air "relaxation room" and even better when you come back to your room to find out that the water is off in the hotel :) But the troubles in this hotel go much deeper than just a period of construction, the management team just isn't giving this property the attention it needs, which is unfortunate given the location and beautiful grounds... One evening we were informed by the room service staff it would take 45 minutes to deliver a butter knife :) that plus the food poisoning we received from the chicken dinner really made our night! Couple all of this with your wonderful "terrace room" overlooking the parking lot (can you say car alarms at 2 am) and you've got the perfect vacation! Our adise? Do yourself a favor and stay at the Four Seasons or the Ritz :)

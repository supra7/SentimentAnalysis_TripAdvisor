I prefer historic charming hotels, but the Hotel San Carlos needs a lot of help. Bathroom was ancient and gross. Old everything in the bedroom. A ceiling fan is an odd necessity. I was on the 5th of 7 floors and it was loud from the outside, as well as loud from the neighboring rooms and the hallways. Not to overdo it but... no in-room cofeemaker (bummer), no high speed internet (duh), and no glasses or anything to drink out of (very odd). Service was solid and friendly, but to what end? Next time in downtown Phoenix, I stay at the more modern Hyatt or Wyndam.

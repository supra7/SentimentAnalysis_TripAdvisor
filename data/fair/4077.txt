The boyfriend and I make it a point to come visit Vegas at least once a year and we'e always stayed at the Signature (which by the way has always been an EXCELLENT stay). Decided to try something else this time and picked the Encore. Don't get me wrong, the hotel, the decor, the room were all beautiful. I'm a fan of red despite the fact that it made the lobby and casino look bordello-ish. The room was nice... loved the bed and the drapes and of course the view. Bathroom was nothing spectacular..still prefer the SIgnature's huge jetted tub. I did not like the toiletries at all. Oh but the robes are awesome! One thing they really need to work on is the soundproofing. It felt like we could hear each adjoining room's toilet flushing and door banging while we were in that room. Oh and if you're out in the hall walking past rooms you can hear the conversations and whatnot going on behind closed doors. No microwave, no fridge, no coffeemaker! Be prepared to pay for every little comfort. No comp. bottles of water like the Signature. If you want to use your laptop during your stay, be prepared to pay $13.99 for 24 hours of internet access for EACH laptop. Steer clear of the minibar and the goodies found in the rooms. And I mean don't even touch them and lift them because you will be charged for it. Housekeeping was great! Roomservice was expensive but you have got to try the ribs. It was to die for! I also didn't like the fact that there was someone from security (i guess) standing by the walkway to the elevators asking guests to show their room keys.

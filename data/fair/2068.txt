Arrived tired after long flight from London expecting comfortable ambiance like Marriotts elsewhere in the world. Had to beat our way through the chaos outside to what seemed like a downmarket shopping centre and onto the escalator. When I saw the room I cried as it looked onto the Palm court and we had to keep the curtains shut as everyone could see us. To add insult to injury the bathroom extraction did not work and the whole place smelt. The hotel was full they said so after a bad night when the air con blasted loudly in my ear we managed to get our room changed to a view of the harbour. Better but by then I was feeling very disenchanted for $299 a night plus taxes about another $50 this is not good enough. I was concerned that security guys patrol the corridors as they do not have key cards on the lifts and just anyone could walk in so I did not feel safe. The staff were all friendly and helpful which was the only plus side. The restaurants are very underused as they do not open onto the harbourside and the hotel is like a big stranded whale which only looks Ok from the water itself. One other thing is the rooms only have bottled water from FIJI ? and the restaurants VOSS water from Norway! Eh why can't they buy local. We stuck to the tap water. Ther are loads of much nicer and better value hotels in Boston as we found out when we moved to the Courtyard on Tremont Street and looked in a few others. The T system means you are never far from the Harbour so I regret the choice to stay there.

I love the Hotel Monaco chain (especially Seattle) but Chicago is terrible. I just stayed there August 19 - 21st and found service lacking and the staff apathetic. Both requests I made during my stay took hours. On Friday Aug 19th I requested a yoga basket for my room at 5 p.m. It arrived at 7:45 p.m. while I was dressing to leave for dinner. This was after being told "we'll send one up immediately." On Saturday Aug 20th I arrived back in my room at 4 p.m. to find my hotel goldfish dead in it's bowl. I called the front desk and was told that they would send someone up "immediately" to get it. At 9 p.m. I took the dead goldfish and it's bowl down to the front desk myself receiving no comment from the staff at all. My pillowcases had old mascara (makeup stains) on them and were not that white and clean looking. I asked the conceirge to recommend a great Italian restaurant (it is Chicago after all). She referred me to the upscale Bennigans-like Nick and Tony's chain around the corner. On Saturday night I left the hotel to go out for the evening (single woman alone) and had to hail my own cab on the corner as the doorman couldn't be bothered. The advantage of boutique hotels over chains is service. Despite other reviews on the great service of Chicago Hotel Monaco, I didn't see any. This will definitely taint my opinion of Kimpton hotels which is unfortunate.

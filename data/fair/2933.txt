We have a personal coordinator from the hotel because my boyfriend is the platinum member of marriott rewards. So everything was liaised before we went there, telling them when we will reach and etc. We reached the hotel at 1pm and ok, the room was not ready. We entertained ourselves at the beach and got really tired but by 3pm, we weren't able to check in as well. Our so called personal coordinator was on leave and we did not receive a warm welcome like other visitors did. We got to pay 25bucks resort fee in order to use the facilities like pool, gym, internet; which is very absurd. Aren't those facilities come with the hotel room? No breakfast, and we also need to pay for the parking lot. What is worse, when we finally checked in to our so called ocean view room, we can't see the ocean becoz it was blocked by trees at the golf course. We felt so angry about it! So we complained to the reception and after some negotiation, they gave us a true ocean view room. The brochure said it is a 5 diamond rated hotel but I felt their services and response is just like a 3 star hotel. Shocked with Ritz Carlton quality of service. Location is a bit too far off but the beach is just good for children as there is no big waves.

I stayed here for two nights with my boyfriend. We are travelling the USA, and admittedly have been staying in cheap hotels and hostels. While our expectations are pretty low when it comes to accomodation, this hotel really disappointed us. When we arrived, the man who checked us in was extremely rude. Didn't even say hello, and when we questioned why he was printing a receipt from the credit card machine with our credit card details when we weren't paying for our room until check out, he got extremely defensive and uppity. Later on, we spoke to another, younger guy at reception, who was also incredibly rude and was saying very explicit swear words, even to older guests. This was so unprofessional to us. Our room was basic, the bed wasn't particularly comfortable but everything was generally clean. After we checked in at reception, we went upstairs to our room and, after trying to enter, we discovered a man was in our room watching TV. what the hell? was our reaction. I think he worked at the hotel, but again, unprofessional. The next day, a guy at reception gave us the wrong directions to the airport...good job we checked it with somebody else or we would have missed our flight. The shared bathroom was dirty and the toilet was blocked for a period of about 8 hours (it was blocked in the morning when my boyfriend had a shower, and was still blocked by the evening when i showered). Luckily we had a toilet and sink in our room. The only good point about this hotel was the free to use computer in the lobby with fast internet. Then again, that is expected these days with hotels. The location was okay, but it didn't feel particularly safe despite being in the centre of the city. Overall, we did not enjoy our time here. If you are looking for cheap accomodation in Seattle, go with HI hostels instead.

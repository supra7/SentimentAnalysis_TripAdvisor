Beautiful hotel, nice and quiet, gorgeous views, great location. If you get a lake view room, Navy Pier is lit up at night and fabulous. The view from the 42nd floor (health club/pool) is remarkable! First night I was there the internet would not work in my room, but the hotel engineer went out of his way to fix the problem, kept me updated on his progress, and when he found it could not be fixed, he made arrangements to get me moved into another room. He gets an excellent rating. Housekeeping on my floor gets a poor rating. Mine was an extended stay, and while the room was clean, I had to chase down the maid to get simple toiletries and coffee refills, every single day. When I finally called the front desk and complained, the week-end maid made sure everything got refilled, but when the weekday maid came back, it was the same thing all over again. Melted soap left in the shower and not replaced, empty shampoo and conditioner bottles put back in the shower, and forget about getting any more body lotion from the weekday maid. Not sure why hotels don't seem to understand that their guests opinion of the hotel is influenced more by housekeeping services than it is by how ornate the lobby decor is. Two other things. Website advertises that hotel has a pool, but does not inform you they charge an extra $16.20/day just to use it. The hotel is connected underground to the Hyatt Regency, and these underground ped-ways will also take you to Michigan Ave. Very nice if you are staying in the winter, although the doors back into the Swissotel lock at 5:00 p.m. so you have to face that Lake Michigan wind at night.

stayed here for more than a week in july 2006. This is a huge hotel, and as such has more the feeling of being a factory. It is extrememly inpersonal. The building is old, and in need of renovations. Some rooms don't have ac only forced air heating/cooling, thus the thermostats which one finds one the wall are just a tease. There is no way of actually setting the temperature. Our room was bone chilling cold (65 F), and we called maintanence who simply turned the whole thing off. Every time you need to change the "ac" you need to call maintanance. We also found that the hot water doesn't come on in the early morning. They have no wireless internet service and charge a ridiculous fee for the lan network in the rooms. All that said if you manage to get it through pricline under 90 usd it is an OK deal.

I stayed in a motel room at The Beach Cottages, in Pacific Beach for five nights, and think I can answer some questions single travelers may be having about choosing this particular property for their getaway. First, and foremost, the view and location simply cannot be beat. Close to everything you need, and miles of boardwalk make this spot ideal for a beach vacation. With that being said, I wanted to report that as a single older woman traveler, you may want to rethink some things. My room faced the ocean, and was uncomfortably hot with no breeze. No A/C, I had a fan only. There were people behind me (second floor), so no cross ventilation was possible, hence a hot box of a room. Bottom line: Unless they have a better room, don't bother booking this cell, and it's no way appropriate for two people!! The front desk was sullen but efficient. Not a friendly place, and unless you bring your friends along, you'll likely not speak to anyone for days on end. But, again, this may be what you are after. The shower was great, and the micro and refrig looked brand new, so no worries, there. There were lots of families with preschoolers, and I would only stay here again if I was in a cottage in the front, with people, and there was a chance for a breeze via cross ventilation. Bottom line again: if this is the best you can afford, go for it. Just be ready to enjoy the view! P.S. The internet does not work, either. Nor does the ice maker.

I was booked into this hotel for one night by the excellent Singapore Airlines when they changed my flight. Frankly I knew I wouldn't like this hotel, it's not the kind of place I'd ever choose, and I'm a little surprised that Singapore Airlines use it. The hotel is actually a converted school, and it feels like it! The location is not great. I like walking, but when I ventured out of the hotel it seemed to be in the middle of nowhere, and in the heat, knowing I was there for just one night, I just couldn't be bothered to start walking looking for signs of civilisation. Surprisingly the restaurant closes early so as a stopover hotel it's not too convenient. However the staff were friendly and this made my unscheduled stay far less painful than it could have been. To summarise, it's a very basic hotel converted from a former school building, with a very tacky pop music theme ???!! mediocre rooms, a rather average restaurant that closes early, and it's in the middle of nowhere so you'll need taxis. One more thing (and I'll never understand why any hotel would allow this)..the shower head didn't even fit in its holder which meant you had to hold the shower with one hand. Any hotel must meet a few basic requirements..bathing, sleeping, eating, so it amazes me that that any hotel that caters to tired international travellers could have a shower that doesn't function properly!

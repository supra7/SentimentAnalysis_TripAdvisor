We were really nervous about staying here after reading the reviews. However at first it didn't disappoint. It is in a great location by the subway with some basic places nearby for food and coffee. The decor was lovely and on arrival the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was lovely with the Morroccan theme and it was also clean (we had paid for a supreme room but looking at the pictures on our return we don't think this is what we got). Check out was bit of a nightmare. When we put our bags in the guy was quite abrupt and impatient and upon collecting them they put them into the taxi for us (great we thought) but on arrival at JFK they had given us a wrong suitcase. This meant we had to call them constantly to get them to hunt for our bag to put it into a taxi to bring to us. We were offered no real apology as such and they seemed more concerned about who had given us the bags. Due to us having the wrong bag another poor soul had to fly back without their case!! We were very nearly in the same position. After begging the airline (Delta who were in fact excellent here) we managed to get our bag checked in late and hold off the gate closure. We were also quoted the wrong price for the taxi booked by them which lead to a small and embarrassing row with the taxi driver.

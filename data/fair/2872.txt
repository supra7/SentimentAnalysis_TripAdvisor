The dinning room food is very good, That is where it stops. All the wait staff but one male waiter who was very friendly, and prompt with our order ( he server our first breakfast ) were terrible. The female bartender was nice, and even corrected our drink order, after over hearing what we told the waiter we wanted but when he repeated our order to her he mixed it up. One waitress actuallty huffed when she came to our table and was abrupt with us. When I asked her are you ok she said we are short staffed AGAIN and we have been busy all morning. Poor girl never did smile.( she had 4 tables ) But the hotel was nice, and the pool bar area is beautiful with live music that is soothing, not loud or rowdy. Nice place to stay, just eat else where. Our stay was fron Aug. 24-26. Then we stayed else where till Sept. 3.

The location is great, the staff is friendly, but this property is worn, torn, tired and in serious need of a refurb. Even a fresh coat of paint would help. This hotel is less expensive than other Kaanapali area hotels and I was trying to keep costs down. So, I was willing to overlook the peeling wallpaper, worn furniture and aged bathroom. But, a sleepless night on a rock-hard bed was the limit. We packed our bags, had our travel agent book another slightly more expensive hotel in the same area and we departed - never to return.

I've been to several all inclusive resorts and after the first day I was basically wanting to leave. I was really disappointed, bored and hungry. All the resorts in Mexico are pretty remote from anything fun and exciting and if you want to go anywhere off the resort you need to arrange transportation to get around. The resort had basically NOTHING to do. I booked a 1BR suite on bookit.com because you receive a $500 coupon book of offers. We ended up being upgraded to a penthouse suite because our room smelled a bit funny because there was water leaking throughout our place. We went to the pool. We went to the gym. We went to the spa. We went to eat. We slept. We watched tv. We were beyond bored. We basically didn't have much to do while we were there. The beach area is really small and you can't do anything like water sports. The service was great and the people are nice. The best meal I had the whole trip was when we took a taxi to the shops and ate at a hole in the wall restaurant and I had amazing shrimp ceviche and enchiladas. But the all inclusive food to put it mildly was disgusting. I was so hungry the entire trip! If I ever travel to Mexico again, I will definitely book a resort closer to Cancun and known for a lot of activities and great dining.

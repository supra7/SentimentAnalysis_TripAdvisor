Stayed three nights with with my husband to celebrate our honeymoon. Our only request was quiet room. Room was very small, hot and stuffy. A/C did not work and had to open window which resulted in tons of street noise. I barely slept a wink due to noise. Location was good. Evening wine reception was nice. Room/bathroom was subpar due to small room, noisy stand-up fan, broken A/C, and noisy street-noise. We normally like boutique-like hotels like JVD's but this was the worst place we stayed at for our honeymoon.

We booked our flights to Seattle as a package and got a great deal! $660 for two people, three nights, and airfare, but we didn't have a choice as to where we were to stay. The hotel itself if old and kind of stinky. I refused to go in the elevator because it was a bit decrepit and smelled of vomit, and the stairways smelled like pee, but the room itself was quite clean, though very bare. We walked all over the city many times over, as the location of the hotel is superb. You're in Belltown so there are tons of cute places to eat or drink, and you're right next to downtown with a plethora of chain clothing stores. I don't know that I'd stay there again, but it was certainly sufficient for our low budget, last minute, long weekend trip.

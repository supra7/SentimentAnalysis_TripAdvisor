I stayed at the Ritz Carlton for a week in mid-late January. The hotel had been closed for renovations and just reopened around Christmas. The rooms were spacious, clean and nice, with flat screen tv's, great bedding, lovely bathrooms. Sound insulation is sub-par though - I could hear things from adjoining rooms and from the hallway quite well. The pool is very nice (though doesn't get many hours of sun this time of year), and the fitness facility is excellent. However, I experienced dismal service, much below what I would expect for the ritz carlton name and for the price. When I arrived at the hotel (well after the stated check-in time), I was told that the room was not ready, and that it might be an hour or so before it was cleaned. No gesture was made to acknowledge this problem (not even a drink at the bar or something), even after I politely expressed my dissatisfaction and asked if there was anything they would be willing to do. After traveling over 12 hours, this was not a pleasant arrival. There were also little things wrong with the room - there was no lock on the patio door, and the lock on the actual room door did not work. No one came to address these problems even after I nofied the front desk on the second day of our stay. Also, little inconsequential things - there were no ice machines on our floor due to construction, the alarm clock was out of batteries, the room safe was locked on our arrival, one of my room keys was not keyed correctly - these were all little things in themselves, but the entire experience left me less than impressed. More importantly, the grounds were not finished yet, and there was construction noise and work vehicles outside our room most of the day - not exactly great for the vacation mood or view. All in all, I wouldn't stay there, and especially not until the construction is completely finished. Maybe they just need time to work out the kinks, but I wouldn't recommend staying there.

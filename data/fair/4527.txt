Stayed here with my Husband and five year old while on a three night breeze-through NYC in April 2010. We were charged US $ 360 for a room we could barely turn around in and the staff were exceptionally unhelpful... bordering on rude. After the first night my husband walked in to the hotel right next door - Candlewick Suites - and managed to get us a room there for the next two nights which was much larger and had a little fully equipped kitchenette as well - for a good $120 US less - PER NIGHT. Would not reccommend the Holiday Inn Express TimeSquare NYC to my worst enemies.

The hotel is very nice, and we booked here because it is not your typical Vegas hotel. I would, however, NEVER stay here again. Housekeeping was ridiculously inept. We checked in at 1pm, called for extra hangers, and left our room. We came back 4 hours later, at 5pm, no hangers. No big deal, we thought. The next day we left our room at 11am and returned at 3pm. Housekeeping never showed up, even though we left the call light on. We got ready and left at 6pm. We then called housekeeping and asked for our room to be made up. Needless to say, we returned at 1 am, and no housekeeping. The following day we left at 9am and returned at 5pm (at a convention all day). What do you know?? No housekeeping. So, basically, it took them over 2 days to make up our room from the time we checked in. I have stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels and never received this poor of service. If I were Donald Trump I would be mortified to have my name and my brand attached to such sub par service. We will never, ever return. Next year it's the Mandarin!

My husband booked this hotel for 2 nights. After that we were booked at The Westin in West Maui. I looked up the hotel on Trip Advisor and saw the negative reviews. Was happily surprised when we got there. The grounds are lovely. The room was near the pool so a short walk. The pool was too cold for me, but the kids liked it and my husband swam in it. It's like a large cement pond so we stayed near the steps because the kids, 3 and 5, couldn't get up the slippery angled sides to get out. It was slick everywhere and I had to keep a hand on the 3 year old when he was on the steps. The room was large and clean enough. The only roach (small) I saw was when I got up in the night and turned on the light and it quickly scurried under furniture. Hotel worked for us great because we were gone all day in Kehei and just needed somewhere to sleep.

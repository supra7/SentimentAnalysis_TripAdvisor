My family travels to Hawaii frequently. We stayed at the Grand Wailea in June 2004. The rooms were incredibly expensive, but we decided to splurge for the grand finale of our trip. We were sadly disappointed and left the hotel a day early even though our entire stay had been prepaid. The ocean view was nice but you must look over other buildings as the rooms are set back a significant distance from the beach. The water elevator (which was the reason we chose this hotel) was broken during our entire stay. The shower in our room was covered in mold and the room was not well maintained. The pools were overcrowded and the slide attendants were bragging about their exploits the night before as my young children waited in line. When I requested a discount due to dissatisfaction, the manager was rude and implied that it was my own fault the shower was moldy and would have been fixed if I had brought it to his attention sooner. In my opinion, the shower in a $600 per night room should not have been moldy in the first place. We completed our trip at the Hyatt on Kaanapali Beach which offers a friendlier staff, much better room rates, and nice (less crowded) pool with fun features for the kids.

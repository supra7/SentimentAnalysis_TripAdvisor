We stayed at the hotel while in NY to see the US Open. Hotel is a little on the worn side, but the rooms were spacious and comfortably accomodated our family of four. Overall, we had a good trip. The problem came 15 months later when an unauthorized charge appeared on my credit card in the amount of $244 for The Beekman Towers. I have called the hotel four times over the past two days to try to get an explanation, but the staff at the front desk says they can't help and the accountant is not available. It is possible that there was an honest mistake, but given that the staff are not the least bit concerned and they have not made any effort to assist me, I doubt it. I cancelled the card immediately and will now have to go through the hassle of setting up another account.

great location  We chose to stay at this hotel because of its contemporary design shown in pictures. Once checked in, we realized that it was also situated in a great location. Our main problem was that the staff did not really speak English. It was very tough to communicate. They meant well and were all nice but they never understood our requests. One night we asked for a plate to be sent up to our room and it took them more than 30 minutes and 2 phone calls. Our friend asked for a Taxi 2 hours in advance to take him to the airport at 11:30 am, and when we went downstairs, they hadn't even called for a car yet.The maid services were not impressive at all. Our towels had holes in them, and they would not leave kleenex, soap or water! This hotel does NOT have a kitchen regardless of what you read. Their idea of room service was 3 menues from Chillis, a sushi joint, and a Mexican restaurant. Their Breakfast Buffet was very small and costed $12 per person. Definitely not worth it.One really positive note I should mention was the VERY comfortable bed and pillows. The rooms are also greatly designed and pretty large.Overall, it is an adequate hotel if you speak fluent spanish and don't mind slow/non-existent room service.

Wouldn't stay there again We stayed at the Waikiki Parc thanks to some rewards points. We were in Honolulu for one last night before heading back to the mainland. The front desk was friendly, but we weren't impressed by the property. The rooms are small and functional (which doesn't normally bother me, it was just off) and there was a definite smell issue in the hallways and rooms, although I couldn't put my finger on it. Maybe it was cigarette smoke? (We had a nonsmoking room). The breakfast at the Parc Cafe was pretty bad. I know they are billing themselves as a sister property to Halekulani, but it might as well be a separate country.

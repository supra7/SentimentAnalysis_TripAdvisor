The hotel itself and the views from the Grand Waiela are beautiful, however if you aren't into hanging out with other peoples screaming children I don't recommend this hotel. Everyday the parents of kids go down to the pool and save all the chairs with towels. They are gone by 8am-ish. If you try to use one you will be quickly told that little Jimmy is on his way! They claim to have an adult pool but no one regulates this - not even the adult hot tub. There were also never any towels at the pool after the peek hours of the day (after 4pm). You can call housekeeping but no one will come. Not to harp on the kids, but I tried to make a spa appointment and was told that I could not be booked anytime during my four day stay because they had several "little girl" birthday partys to accommodate. At the prices of the spa I couldn't believe it! We were there for a conference my husband attended so we only paid a small portion of the bill but if I were coming out of pocket $600+ a night I would have been highly upset!

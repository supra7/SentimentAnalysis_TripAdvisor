might have been ok twenty years ago (in fact employee today told me it has not been renovated for at least fifteen years) this hotel is most certainly not a three star or above property. It needs total remodel and updating, seems to be getting some paint in the lobby area but needs at least paint everywhere and all areas in and out seem worn and old. the jacuzzis are plastic above ground and i have never seen such on any property i have stayed.. the pool area is a horrible cement surface and again dismal. numerous local staff at the hotel and other places told me the hotel has been "distressed" in recent years and is now under new ownership. DO NOT STAY here until you are sure it has been updated or unless you get an incredible cheap deal and dont mind motel style rooms. Beach is ok, staff are pleasant but aware of the challanges ... resorts down the road in Walai are all nice .. go there.

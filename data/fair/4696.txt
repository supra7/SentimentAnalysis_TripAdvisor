I spent months planning our honeymoon. Lots of time on the internet, going through reviews, books, websites, you name it, I did it. And boy, was I fooled into thinking that this hotel was going to show us a great Hawaiian experience. The website makes everything look great, with their majestic lighting and "evening cliff dive ceremony." The truth about that - anyone can, and will, jump off that cliff and its not as high as it looks. As far as the hotel....no spa, food isn't great, coffee bar closes, and staff isn't as warm as the other resorts we stayed in. Our room was small and we found bugs twice. Our "ocean front" room was on the other side of the resort, in which we had to travel up the elevator, over the breezeway, down the elevator again, around the resort, and back up the elevator, in order to get there. And by the way, there was a chain link fence in between our "unobstructed view" of the ocean.... Tons of kids, and the hot tub and swimming pool were not very great either. My biggest regret was listening to the reviews on here and not picking the Westin - with their beautiful landscaping and plush beds. Oh well, there's always next time.

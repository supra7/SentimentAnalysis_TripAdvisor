No bedbugs, no vermin, other than pigeons on the window sills outside. Tiny but clean. Hot water near scalding. Was near lobby and the room was loud. Reminded me of my college dorm experience, which was "active". All young folks and all seemed oblivious to the fact that they were sharing space with others. Doors slammed at all hours of the night and people coming and going, talking in the halls. Walls are tissue paper thin as far as sound is concerned. Sleep is difficult if not impossible. The location is convenient and price was low. If one is a 20-something backpacker, this place may suffice. For "adults", this isn't a viable choice; low cost and convenient location are not enough. No elevator and at least 20 steps up to enter. Starbucks right next door and plenty of restaurants in the area. Subway directly across the street. Still, none of the positives is enough to offset the fact that it is like sleeping in a bowling alley. If one is on a tight budget and suffers from insomnia, this may be an option to consider. Otherwise, as they say in parts of NYC, forget about it!

This is a MCY that is undergoing a major renovation o to install the new MCY bistro. The place was under construction and a real mess. Temp check in was not well thought out. Looked like a storage closet conversion. Date we checked in room key making software was having a big issues and they had to take you to your room and let you in. Supposed to deliver keys that worked later but never received ours. They really could have done a better job if they were planning on staying open during this construction, perhaps a free breakfast or something for all the inconvenience. To get from my room to the temp check in room was a huge maze. Somethings not right here!

We just returned from a weekend stay at this hotel. I must say we were not impressed. I had booked this hotel based on all the rave reviews I was reading. When we arrived, we had booked a superior room throught the hotel itself, the receptionist at the desk told us that they upgraded us for free to a deluxe,but upon arriving to our room 604, it was clearly not an upgrade, the room was the same type of room that they call a standard room on their website, more like a downgrade. Plus the room was hot and I asked for a room fan,was told that they would send it up,it never arrived. Found the hotel staff not that friendly. Would not use this hotel again, based on our experience with the quality of the room and the hotel seems a bit run down. Westchester NY

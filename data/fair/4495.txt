This is not the place to stay if you want a peaceful nights sleep! We were constantly woken up, either by really squeaky floorboards, clanking water pipes, the (really loud) sound when any neibouring room has a shower, and then finally by the maids being loud outside our door (for which they did apologise to be fair, but still!) It is very tired and in real need of an overhaul. Fine if you have low expectations but not if you like real comfort and peace & quiet.

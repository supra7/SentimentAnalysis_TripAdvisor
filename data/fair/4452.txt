The lady Estrella Padilla is a wonderful housekeeper. She's clean, neat, made sure I wanted for nothing (water, towels, soap, coffee). The hotel itself needs better air conditioning (temperature control needs improvement), hot water, hot food (generally delievered luke warm) only a few times when Marina would deliver my food was it ever really HOT. Elevator lights were not properly working ~ even when I spoke to an employee who was waiting for the elevator and I showed them ~ it never got fixed. Front desk managers ~ although at times nice, (was told out of sight out of mine). Windows are dirty, vents are dirty. LOVE the beds (probably the best thing the Westin has to offer). Towels are ruff! When the hotel was full ~ renting a moving or just watching TV ~ WAS A HUGE PROBLEM. Room Service people were always fabulous. I noticed that the front desk people always seemed to have a chip on their shoulders and the help behind the curtains always had a smile on their face and were willing to help. Bellmen ~ fabulous!!!!!

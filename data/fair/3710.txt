We stayed from May 23- 25, and while it is a beautiful property, the parking situation is out of control. First, it cost 19 bucks a day to park, then it takes FOREVER to get your car. We went downstairs Sunday morning at 9:30, and asked how long it would be. We were advised to give it 1 hour. My husband went at 10 :30, and was told now it would be 1 1/2 hours, We had to get to the airport, and at 11:30 my husband was able to get someone to get our car, but we were jumped in the line, to tell the truth. People were angry and I don't blame them!!! Not a way to spend precious vacation time. We also did not get cleaning service Saturday , but they took the 10.00 service fee off our bill, For an expensive resort that likes to nickel/dime you. they really need a better plan to take care of their customers.

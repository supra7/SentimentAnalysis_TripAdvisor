The rooms are not what they show in the picture. We stayed in the oceanfront suite and it looked like colonial times. The beds were falling apart. Our vehicle was broken into while it was parked in the garage and they do not have a camera system and the guard does not make regular rounds. For the money you pay to stay there it is not worth it. The restaurant doesn't have set hours and you never know when they will be open. I would reccommend staying somewhere else.

After reading the reviews here, my family was VERY disappointed with the hotel. First, the hotel is going through major renovations in the tower part of the hotel. We stayed in the village part of the hotel, which were found to be old and dark. The room was like staying in a basement, an old and mildew smell. The A/C put out hot air. We put the A/C on 60 and the room immediately heated the room up 89 degrees. I could not recommend this hotel.

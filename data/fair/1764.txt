When I got to my room it was musky and then I realized the airconditioner didn't work.. They changed my room and there was a leak under the sink..they changed me again and the room was "ok".. the rooms are dark and depressing and you and you can hear every noise. the breakfast was nothing special even though they advertise a "bountiful buffet" its not. This hotel is not even close to being 2 1/2 stars. maybe 1. If you have a choice stay away.

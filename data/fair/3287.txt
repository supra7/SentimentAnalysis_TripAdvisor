For the price in the French Quarter in New Orleans, you can't beat Hotel Villa Convento. However be advised that there are problems with the hotel: the hotel in general (lobby, courtyard, stairwell,...) is very run down. Our room seemed to be charming BUT we were very dismayed to find bed bugs laying on our bed all 4 nights of our stay there. Good points: FRIENDLY staff, location (safe neighborhood), bathroom was newly renovated. All in all, if you have a family, spend the extra money to stay at a nice hotel. All others...be aware what I detailed above.

The negative reviews are right -- the rooms are small, the bathrooms are the size of closets (no, really), and in-room climate control is very noisy. Fine for solo business travelers (good midtown location) but rooms are a tight squeeze for 2. This is an *old* hotel building that has been redecorated with dark paint & furniture to look tragically hip. No idea why this hotel rates 4 stars -- the hallways are narrow and dark, rooms are compact and gloomy. Lots of better choices in NYC.

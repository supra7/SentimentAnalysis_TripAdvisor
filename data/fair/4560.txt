Disappointed I spent two nights at this hotel when I ran the Honolulu Marathon. I brought along my 4 year old son and my babysitter and had requested two double beds. Upon arrival, we had trouble using our room key to get the elevator to work and got to our room to find just one double bed. I called about the bed situation and they brought us a rollaway (not an acceptable solution in my opinion). Then I was really looking forward to relaxing by the pool and jacuzzi after the race, only to find out that the pool/jacuzzi was closed for resurfacing! The parking was 12.50 per day and EVERYTHING closes in the area on Sunday (even the Jamba Juice and Starbucks!), and everything else closes by 6pm on regular days. The room had a nice big tub with jets, but the water was often lukewarm and not hot enough to enjoy a nice tub bath. I will not stay here again.

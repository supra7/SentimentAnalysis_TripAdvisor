Lovely grounds, nice staff, but when it's 95+ degrees outside, one doesn't want to sleep in a room that smells like a well-used fireplace. It was toxic! The only way to compete with the smell was to sleep with the patio door open, the fan on and the A/C on high. Plus, the rooms were tired and the decor boring -- especially for the price. Even tho the rooms were large, who cares when all your clothes start to smell like fireplace ashes.

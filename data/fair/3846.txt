Our stay at Gaslamp Plaza Suites had highs and lows, but overall this is a reasonable value for a downtown stay. The Suites are wonderfully located for shopping and dining in the Gaslamp District. The rooms are updated, clean, relatively spacious if a bit oddly laid out, probably due to the state of planning in 1913 when it was built. Continental breakfast is include on the 10th floor rooftop, both inside and outdoors, although the facility has a worn look. The room price, at a couple of notches lower than the typical downtown hotel, made it somewhat attractive. On the downside, the desk staff seemed a bit dazed and confused about their duties. Calling for different services, which in most other hotels direct connects you to the valet or room service or housekeeping, will likely get you whoever is sitting at the front desk and it is potluck as to whether or not your wish will be communicated! Parking is atrociously expensive, but you have the option of self-parking within a block or two. Lastly, rooms facing 5th or E street may suffer from some late night noise from the clubs at street level. Not a bad place to stay, and particularly if you value a convenient downtown location. Stay away if you can't deal with the downside issues mentioned above though.

This is a new "5 star looking" hotel. Unfortunately it only comes with " 0.5 star SERVICE". I stayed here for 2 nights. First night, **nightmare!** the LOUD TV SOUND woke me up at 5:32AM. The "think" wall is like paper. I could clearly HEAR what my neighbors talking about! 2nd day , I ordered room service in the morning. After finished, I called front desk to pick the remaining food and tray up. They said we will send someone to pick them up. But they never! I called 4 TIMES! They PROMISED 4 TIMES. Finally they came after 5th call. I will NEVER stay here again.

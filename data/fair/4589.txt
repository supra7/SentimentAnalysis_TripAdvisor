Good hotel but bad customer service for some reason the customer service here was horrible, the front desk people are not very nice at all, and especially since we have a child I think they did not like that. Anyhow the rooms where nice if you get a high up floor and mountain facing, I heard a lot of bad reviews about the noise, the free parking is always a plus, the only thing this hotel has going for it is location and recent renovations (apparently). If you want good customer service this is not the place for you.

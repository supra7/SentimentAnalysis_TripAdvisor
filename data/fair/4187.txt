I'm happy for the other people who had a good experience, but mine was just awful. Only upside of the hotel was the location, that's it. Ok, I didn't paid that much, but there are some basics which I may expect at least. What happened: - Reception insinuated my best friend was a prostitute when she visited me. I was like WTF? - How can I do business if the internetconnection is bad! Wireless disconnected all the time and the signal was poor (or even wasn't able to connect at all). - Next day, my Lira and Euro coins mixed up so I took all the Euro money out of my pocket. When I left the room and came back later, guess what......money was gone! It was only 8 or 9 Euro, but that doensn't matter. I didn't report to avoid hassle for the employee. - Next day, I took my flight ticket out of the deposit to reconfirm my flight for the next day. I putted the ticket on the desk and had some food, came back....guess what.....ticket was GONE! I had big problems with getting back home, cause it was a paper ticket with red flightcoupon. You guess if I will come back?!

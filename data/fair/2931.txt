Definitely NOT the kind of customer service my family expected from a "5-Star" resort. In terms of landscape, the resort deserves a 5 Star. In terms of customer service, the resort deserves a 1 Star. This was our second and definitely our last time to this resort. Our bad experiences are mainly in the restaurant area. We received rude, cold services from the waitresses, especially the early-middle age brunette-non islander at The Terrace-breakfast buffet) , who was dispassionate and not happy to be working there. They seem to be in a hurry and not happy to be here. Concierge not very helpful and only provided superficial information that I can find myself. Desk receptionist not happy-no eye contact. Overall, I believe the "emotional IQ" of the staff at this resort is very low, which translates into poor customer service. For a 5-Star experience, go to the Four Seasons, which is where I will take my family next time.

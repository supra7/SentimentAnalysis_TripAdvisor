I have stayed at the JW Marriott many times both before and after Katrina. Good location with very dated, noisy rooms and poor over all service. Noisy rooms mean every time someone opens and closes there hotel door you can hear it slam and you can hear your neighbors tv and phone calls. Remember, New Orleans is a convention city and a party city which means you get to hear your neighbors coming and going at all hours of the day and night. Quick and easy check in. Poor service for both breakfast and dinner at Don Shulas. Housekeeping does a poor job. Food crumbs still on the floor next to bed from the previous guest after three days. Some days Housekeeping would leave plastic coffee cups, some days they dont and yes I always leave a tip. If you have a bellman bring your bags down, you tip him. Then a second bell man loads the bags into the car and you tip him. The person who brings your car around wont give you the keys or open the trunk or unlock the car until you have tipped him. My business associates are always amazed. The NFL uses this hotel for both visiting teams and referees. I wonder if the NFL gets the same treatment as a Platinum member.

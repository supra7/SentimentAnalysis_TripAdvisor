This was our third stay at the hotel. The other two visits were pleasant and fairly relaxing. This visit, however, was very disappointing. Our room was not ready until an hour after the check in time. We were not able to use the room allocated to guests who are waiting for their room- this was "full". Instead, we changed into bathing suits in a closet. The main problem with our stay was that the resort was overcrowded. The adult pool (guests over 18 years old) had numerous guests under 18 who were loud and playing football. There were no chaise lounges available after 7:30 am. Everyone "reserved" the lounges with towels but never showed up. This also applied to the cabanas. They were reserved but no one ever used them. The sushi restaurant was the most disappointing of all the restaraunts. The service was poor and the sushi was fair at best.

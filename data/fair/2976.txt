Stay at the Four Seasons! We stayed a week at the Ritz-Carlton and a week at the Four Seasons. What a contrast! The Four-Seasons was everything you would expect from a luxury hotel- beautiful rooms, wonderful service, clean and meticulous. The Ritz-Carlton on the other hand, was completely rundown. The hotel itself is on a gorgeous piece of property but the rooms are in terrible shape. When was the last time you saw a Magnovox TV?! The room looked like a rundown Sheraton hotel. The wallpaper was peeling off, the carpet in the room was bare-thin and the sheets on the hotel bed were worn through and there was an actual tear in the top sheet! A hole in the sheet at a luxury hotel!!!! We had a deluxe room with oceanview and for the amount of money spent, the Ritz-Carlton should have made some renovations long long ago. We were completely disappointed. Don't stay here unless you're an avid golfer because they do have great discounts for the golfing on the property. The weather in Capalua is also not as sunny and warm as it is in Wailea (where the Four Seasons is located). Again, if you're golfer, then perhaps a good idea but otherwise, stay at the Four Seasons for the money. The Ritz-Carlton charges $75 for the poolside cabana for 1 day use. The Four Seasons is free. The Ritz-Carlton charges as "resort fee". Four Seasons does not. Ritz charges for valet parking, Four Seasons does not. Food at the Ritz is mediocre. Food at Four Seasons was fantastic. All in all, our 1 week stay at the Four Seasons made up for our big disappointment at the Ritz.

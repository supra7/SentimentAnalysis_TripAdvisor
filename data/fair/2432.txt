This has one of the most beautiful entryways and lobbies I have ever seen. Unfortunately, you do not get to sleep in the lobby. The accomodations are the smallest tiniest rooms I have ever stayed in that did not have wheels on the bottom. The closet door will only open part way because it hits the bed. The bathroom has no shelf space to place your toiletries. There is only one chair in the room, and not really much space for that. Yikes! - were people really tiny in the 1930s when this place was built? The staff is cordial and polite. The place is kept clean and tidy. The elevators are extremely slow. Admittedly, the hotel was fully booked on the nights of my stay, but my wait time to get an elevator averaged 17 minutes, and the longest wait was more than 25 minutes. Here is the problem: the room rates are outrageously high for the size of the rooms and the general accomodations. Unless you derive great pleasure from looking at neo-classical art and art-nuevo architecture, you do not get a decent value here.

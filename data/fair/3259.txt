We attend the Mardi Gras celebration every year and have been traveling to New Orleans since 2000. 2011 was the first year we ever tried Intercontinental and it was a HUGE mistake! In addition to the room being very ordinary, the amenities that we were seeking such as ability to easily watch parades was not as we expected considering we paid for Grandstand admission as well as all the extras that the hotel charged for. You would think with all the extra invested the event would go off just fine, this was NOT the case. The main parade we wanted to watch was Endymion and since that parade was moved to Sunday due to weather we extended another day. Then, when we arrived at the Grandstand, we learned that parade goers from the Sunday parades had already filled the Grandstands & were offered tickets to stay through Endymion. So, all of the patrons who had Endymion grandstand tickets ended up behind all of the other parade watchers. TO make it even worse, after standing behind all of the crowd, it was sadly apparent that Intercontinental Employees had their families front and center occupying at least a third of the Grandstand prime location. While we understand that the weather couldnt have been avoided, the management of the Grandstands should have been more organized. We were truly disappointed w/ the Attitude and the behavior of the employees who were representing the Intercontinental. REALLY unprofessional approach to the entire event.

This hotel's service is just appalling for a so-called five star hotel, and it started before even arriving at the hotel. I was trying to find out information from the hotel's PR and promotional team, and encountered unreturned phone calls, and numerous promises to provide me with information which never came through. I am in fact still waiting to receive information about a particular hotel package from the hotel's PR manager, and the request was made 6 weeks ago. The service levels are simply appalling. Despite the nice rooms, I will never recommend this hotel to anyone, as the lack of service for the amount you pay has totally turned me off.

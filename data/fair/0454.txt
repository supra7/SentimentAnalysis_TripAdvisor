First, because of booking through expedia, we got assigned a room with a very average view and not on an elevated floor (although we requested it specifically). We had issues with the housekeeping mostly: no attention to details, some hair here and there upon arrival, carpet stains, no proper restocking of towels, soap or coffee ...I constantly had to make requests to their 'service express' which was annoying. I found the hotel charmless and very cold and will never return. Other than that the staff was friendly.

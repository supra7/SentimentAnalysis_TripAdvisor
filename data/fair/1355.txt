Stayed at Miami Hilton for New Years Eve 2011. Great view was the only good thing at this hotel. Rates were too expensive and service was terrible. 4 persons stayed in room but only towels for 3 people. called hotel reception 3 times and no towels were ever delivered. not a good way to start New Years eve having to share towels. Air conditioning noise is horrendous. kept you awake all night. Phone did not work in room. WIFI is not free either. Would never stay here again and maybe not at another Hilton either. Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.

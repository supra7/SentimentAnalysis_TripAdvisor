I do a LOT of Traveling and Im self Employed , so it comes out of my pocket , when away on Business. IF your traveling in ASIA , do yourself a Favour and MISS Singapore - Its glam with NIL Substance. IT is SO Expensive.!!!! Value for Money is Simply NOT there , and the Crowne Plaza is a classic NO Value for Money Hotel Look Great , but wait until you get there. Its a way overpriced name.!! Rooms average and expensive, Meals Example Buffet $55 US and NO discount for kids. INTERNET - WOW $30US for 24 Hours , no 3 day or weekly rate. IF in Singapire take the short ride into town and stay in another hotel. Crowne Plaza Changi Air Port REAL disappointment, UNLESS you dont care how much you spend, nor Value for Dollar.!

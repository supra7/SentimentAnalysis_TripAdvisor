My two kids and I got to listen to our neighbors have sex twice, laugh, talk, then argue, as the walls on the second floor were thin and, I doubt, insulated at all. I am deaf in one ear and I could almost decipher every spoken word - spoken, not 'yelled'! Of course I spoke to them and shut them up, but the point is the hotel is so old, the walls are 'paper thin'. Our room also faced 4th Ave and the street noise was quite loud. We could not sleep with the window open as a result but even when closed the sounds were loud. A little money spent soundproofing is in order. Our room with two double beds was also quite small and short of space. But again, it is an older hotel. The staff are all wonderful, and the location great, but your money is better spent elsewhere. And it is certainly worth it to spend more if you want a downtown experience. However, if you want to only have a four hour sleep and grouchy teens the next day, stay here!

We just returned from staying at the Edgewater. Overall its an adaquate property, but it was the little things that added up to a disappointing stay. The "biggest" little thing was having no hot water for the shower. However, after 30 minutes, the maintenance / repairman rectified the situation. Our room rate was also inaccurate at the time of check out. We had confirmed a package rate which included valet parking. Upon check out - our roorm rate was $100 more and their valet parking fee was also added on to our bill. Again, after some additional conversations with the front desk and their revalidation with management, the additional costs were removed. An interesting property with potential, but unfortunately it was not a flawless experience.

I booked our stay with the Ritz over 9 months in advance, seeing it was our wedding/ honeymoon....along with paying several thousand dollars in advance to secure our room. Well, I called them 4 days prior to our arrival to confirm the room we requested....we didn't want any surprises. We were assured the room we requested for our wedding/honeymoon was ours. Upon arrival 4 days later, we were told our room was given away to someone else! The young woman at the front desk didn't know what she was doing. They definitely put a dent in the start of our wedding celebration. After battling with the front desk and management, we were comped one night and given a tiny credit for the spa. I would have much preferred the room we reserved. No, they did not arrange for us to be in the room we reserved. The staff was callous and sloppy. The rugs throughout the hotel were dirty. We were privately told by a staff member, on the side, that this is a common problem and there are many complaints because of the front desk forever screwing things up. We were woken up early in the morning by someone running around above our heads...part of our original request was having a top floor room...we got a ground floor room. Will will never stay at the Ritz again...we'll gladly spend our money at the Four Seasons from now on. This was by far the poorest service we have ever received at any resort. But this will not happen again. We are done with the Ritz. It's definitely not what it used to be in the past. If you're accustomed to staying at moderate hotels then I suppose you would think this is a wonderful hotel. But we are accustomed to 4-5 star resorts and this severely paled by far. We won't ever return to the Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua. It's very low class now.

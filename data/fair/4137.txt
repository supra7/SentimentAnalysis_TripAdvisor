I gave this hotel a 2 star rating because it is not a Hotel... it's a large Bed & Breakfast with a few distinct problems. #1 The bathtubs are an absolute nightmare! Think "YUK" and you'll get a mental picture. They are so old that they're rusty and corroded around the drains. The hotel is supposedly redoing them next week, but what good did that do me? I got robbed out of my daily hot bath & wore flip flops in the shower so my feet didn't have to touch the black stuff. I asked to switch rooms, but the only one available with a refinished bathtub had a BROKEN FIREPLACE!!! Real classy. #2 If you have eyesight problems, don't try to watch TV. It's a million miles away from the bed. #3 The bed is REALLY comfy, but the rest of the room needs help. #4 Old, old, old elevator. #5 OK, ok... So it's within walking distance of Union Square & Chinatown. However, all the hotels along Powell Street (Westin St. Francis, Chancellor, etc.) are MUCH more convenient!!! If you want to stay off Powell, choose The Orchard. The saving grace of this B&B is the yummy breakfast buffet, the SUPERIOR wine/ fruit & cheese sampling at 5:00pm, and the adorable bellman, Louis. The only way that I would ever stay at this B&B again is if they sent me a voucher for a free night's stay AFTER they refinished the ALL bathtubs & fixed ALL the fireplaces. Otherwise, for the hefty $200 price tag, I'm at the Westin St. Francis. Hope my reveiw helps!

We arrived at 6:00 PM, to wait 20 minutes in line to check in. There were stations for two agents, but one overwhelmed individual had to handle all the guests. The bellman never arrived, contrary to promise. The small hotel elevator took us to the 4th floor, complete with plastic sheets on the carpeting. As we entered our room, we were greeted by a rather dark 1940's style room. There was no refrigerator nor a coffee maker. An armoire with TV had a broken door which fell off its bracket when opened. Individual switches on each lamp made it a chore to arrange for sufficient light. Guests are limited to one very small drawers per person. We found a letter to guests, notifying them that since renovations were in progress, they should expect noise from 9AM, even on weekends. Not a welcoming message. The bathroom was immaculate and the sink tap brought forth plenty of hot water, inspiring hopes of a steamy morning shower. Those hopes were dashed at 8AM, when we shivered in the shower, as the water temps hovered roughly two degrees above tepid. As we arrived in the hotel restaurant on a weekend morning, we were turned away. The hotel management had booked a private party, despite the fact that there was a fully renovated dining room on the second floor. Our concerns about our bathroom, previously considered immaculate were reignited when we saw one single housekeeper cleaning without cart, her supplies limited to two rags and a spray bottle. No mops. No vacuum. At check out we were assured that our bags could be checked while we made a shopping trip. When we returned, we discovered all bags were unsecured, lined up in the lobby.

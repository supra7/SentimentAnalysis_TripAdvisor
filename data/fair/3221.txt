The courtesy van driver (Asa) is wonderful! The rest of the staff are o.k. Our room was the smallest in which I've ever stayed, but it was clean. We reserved a suite for the 2nd/3rd nites, but it was dirty and scary (hot sauce on the couch) and looked like there was a party in it the nite before we took it. We moved back to our little room where we were at least used to the weirdness. Our stay was quite an experience. The very, very best part is the complimentary cocktail. Ma Bailey's was the very best bar we went to during out entire trip. Both the bartenders were wonderful. The drinks were the best. This was our 1st time in NO and we found it to be very dirty, not too friendly, and somewhat dangerous. Dauphine is very New Orleans. I'm glad we did it for the experience, but we wouldn't do it again.

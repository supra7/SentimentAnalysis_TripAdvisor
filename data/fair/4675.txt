My wife and I went to Kauai and Maui for our honeymoon, 5 days on each island. At Maui we stayed at the Sheraton because we liked the location and heard good things about the beaches nearby. The location is really good as it's right near Black Rock and very close to good shopping and restaurants. However, the hotel itself is disappointing. We booked a queen bed but by the time we checked in, all they had was a room with two singles (again, this was our honeymoon). After spending about 40 minutes with the front desk (the lady who helped me was very nice), they said they would move us to a queen bed the next night. Sadly, that's not even the most disappointing thing about this hotel. The hotel grounds are huge and spread out. So it could potentially take you forever to get from the check in desk to your room (and it did). Want to visit the gym? Forget it, you need a car to get from one end of the hotel to the other. Parking? There's a self-parking structure, which again can take forever to get to, and is very small and crowded. And yet that STILL wasn't the worst thing. The rooms were awful. This hotel hasn't been remodeled in years and it shows. The bathrooms have a separate small room for just the toilet, with no ventilation so it smells like body odor. And remember, we had two rooms and BOTH rooms stunk. Maui is amazing and we still had a wonderful time. But I'm sure we could have done better for the price. This experience makes me wary of Sheratons generally.

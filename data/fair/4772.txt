yes location is perfefct however the hotel is old, floors look like an hospital ward!! Bathroomss really old and in need of urgent renovation. We had a corner room, fireplace could not be lit. Clean was not spotless. Receptionist are really unfriendly however the concierge was excellent. There is no lobby. Never again!

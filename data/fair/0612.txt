I sateyed here with husband and 1 year old son. One night we arrieved to find out patio door left wide open. We were on the first floor. There were also 2 cigarette butts on the small patio. Nothing was missing from our room but we were gone for over 10 hours that day and I do not know how long the door was open. The manager comped our parking ($17/day) but he was supposed to let us know who the last person to open our room door was and they never told us. This hotel is by a small lake and at dusk there are misquitos and misc. other bugs every where. I would not recommend this hotel. The only good thing about it was that i booked it on Priceline and got a really good price.

We have stayed at this hotel before. It is a nice hotel, with a nice upper floor restaurant and lounge. The food was delicious, I believe a little over priced for such small portions. The room itself is nice enough. We self parked in the garage of the hotel. It cost $30 per night. We could have had the valet park for the same cost. I do not think the room or the hotel is nice enough to pay $60 in parking. I realize this is the going rate, but the hotel should maybe have specials with parking included for guests fo the hotel. We will not be staying her any time soon

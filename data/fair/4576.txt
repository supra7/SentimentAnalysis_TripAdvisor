Rooms badly needly updating Stayed here for four nights in the new (1970 or so) wing. Architecture of the wing is awful, the rooms and baths are smallish, badly need updating and not worth $500 the night we paid for them.In particular the room decor listed in guidebooks and literature as ala Tommy Bahama is more like a comfort inn or an old fairfield. The location is great, the hotel staff is friendly and the building is a historic beauty-but I think it was a terrible value and would not stay there again.

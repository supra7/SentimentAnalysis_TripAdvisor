If you have to stay downtown, stay at the Omni. Cons: On all my arrivals, the doormen just stood around while I carried my own suitcase, opened my own doors Room service food - grilled chicken, who knows when it was ever grilled, it was barely thawed, when I bit into my supposed grilled chicken it was icy cold (although it did arrive quickly)Shabby, 50s style decor, stains on the bedding. lots of noise through adjoining doors. hardly any bathroom amenities, just the bare minimum, shampoo, soap, conditioner. they were too cheap to buy a TV stand, so left the old mini bar and frig which was empty and non functional, to put the TV on! Pros: the front desk service was very good, I never had to wait to check in or out. decent lighting

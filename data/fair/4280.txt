We stayed here for 4 nights. We had travelled from San Francisco over the past 10 days and were really looking forward to unpacking and relaxing for a few days before moving on again. However we were given room 203 which faced the road. I was horrified when I opened the door. The room was digusting to say the least. The walls were marked, the walk way through the wardrobes to the bathroom was well!!!! The plug sockets were loose so I dared not plug anything in. It was a health and safety hazzard. We immediately complained and asked to be moved but as the hotel was allegedly full they could do nothing about it although we could try again next day. Still no luck. The lady on the desk was not very helpful and appeared not to care. I never unpacked. However on day 3 we were given another room which was lovely, although this was for 1 night only but we took it anyhow. Next day we were told we would have to move so we were given room 201 which was next door to the original room but oh what a difference. I would not recommend it to anyone else unless you could request a referbished room. Incidentally the Asian restaurant up the hill behind the hotel was excellent and well worth a booking.

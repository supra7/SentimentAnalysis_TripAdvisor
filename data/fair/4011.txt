shame the hotel wasnt as good as the restaurant! we arrived at the clift late afternoon to find we had to struggle in with our own luggage (3 bags!) the reception staff were very unhelpful and uninterested. we eventually managed to get everything sorted and were shown up to our room on the 9th floor. the room was a 'junior suite' and they tried to make out we had a separate living room by putting a curtain inbetween the bedroom and the living room!! the bathroom was tiny and dirty. i stayed here with my mum and unfortunatley on the first night she didnt feel well and had been suffering from a bad foot. she decided to phone down to reception to ask if there was a doctor that would come to the hotel only to be told ther wasnt one local however the receptionist 'put her through' to the closest one and she was told to phone someone else. we eventually decided to go to the hospital just to be safe. when we came back from the hospital that evening the doormen were talking to some girls outside and we had to let ourselves in! The following night we ate in the hotel restaurant aisa de cuba which was fantastic! i think the hotel only show intrest in the restaurant and bar. at the end of the day we were only sleeping there so we ignored it but i wouldnt stay there again.

This used to be one of my wife's and my favorite NYC hotels. I am a platinum memeber with Starwood, and because of that we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite for our recent 2 day stay. On the positive side, the staff at this W is fantastic- they are friendly and helpful. On the negative side- the rooms may look good with the fish-eye camera lens that they use to photograph them, but they are totally impractical. Our bedroom was barely big enough for the bed. There was nowhere to unpack our suitcases and store clothes, other than the closet- which had one shelf and a hanging bar- not a drawer in the room or closet. There is a great flat screen TV on a pole in the room, but you have to swing it over to open the closet door, and then limbo past it to get to the bathroom. The bathroom has a small stall shower, and one sink with virtually nowhere to store toiletries (again no drawers, one small shelf). The water pressure in the shower was virtually non-existent. The sitting room had an unbelievably uncomfrotable art deco couch that had cushions which resembled flotation mats for the pool. It also had a lamp which hung next to the couch, but swung over the couch when you sat on it (not by design), so that one bumped their head on it when standing up. On the first night, there was no turndown service. they charged me for a number of things we did not use (e.g. mini-bar) or returned (e.g. blackberry charger)- and although they were happy to remove the charges, they should not have been on the bill initially. My brother had another room (he was upgraded to a "wonderful" room from a "cozy" room) and his bedroom was virtually the same size as our bedroom- I have never seen rooms that small before (what must the "cozy" room look like?)- and he also had no drawers and a tiny bathroom. Our advice- use the W in Union Square or Times Square.

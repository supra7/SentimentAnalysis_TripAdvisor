This hotel was alright at first but then it became hell. The bathroom door got stuck and my Dad got stuck in the bathroom and the door would not open as the door knob was falling out. This also happened to my Grandpa. Housekeeping has been in that room and they even gave us a new roll of toilet paper, yet they neglected to notice the door knob was still halfway broke. How can anyone clean a room so many times and not notice a door knob was halfway broke? This hotel is also bad as it is right next to train tracks which can keep you awake all night, especially when trains are passing by nonstop. This hotel is also bad as some of the people you will see around it look suspicious. The town of Memphis was very nice and the tourism was loads of fun. Even though I had fun, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. -5 out of 5 stars in my book.

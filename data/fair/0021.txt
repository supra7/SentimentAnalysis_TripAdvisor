The girl at the front desk ignored me and kept on talking to another co-worker, until another man walked into the lobby and told her to help me. She was very abrupt/rude when she finally checked me in. There were loud banging noises throughout the night, that kept waking us up. I am not sure what was making the thumps.... elevator, cleaning, etc? In addition the outside traffic was very loud even though we were on the 5th floor. The bathroom was not clean, I found brown strands of hair in the bathtub and the sink.

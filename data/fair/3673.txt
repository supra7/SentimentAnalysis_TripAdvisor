We stayed at the W New York March 4-6 for our one year wedding anniversary. The only good thing I would say is that they did deliver the flowers my husband got for me to the correct room. So when I checked in the flowers were there. However, my key cards did not work when I got to the room and security had to come up to open the door. One of the cards was not activated. For all the raves that I hear about the W hotel resort chain I would think that the service would be better here than at lower end hotels that I have been to. The fact that I as a woman had to lug my own suitcase into the hotel without being asked by any of the employees standing outside is unacceptable! The fact that when I left nobody offered to help me with my luggage is unacceptable. The bell captains attend to whomever they please to attend to. On quite a few occasions we were standing outside and they asked other people that arrived after us if they needed help. Then asked us. Very rude! I have read numerous reviews that the rooms are small. You are correct they are small. The bed took up the entire space. There was no counter space in the bathroom for our toiletries. I was concerned that I was going to break the counter as it was all glass. For the amount of money we spent I would have rather spent it somewhere else. Thank goodness we only spent a weekend there. I don't think I would have lasted any longer.

A day before our two night mini vacation I read several reviews, I was past the 72 hour window to cancel so we had no choice. I agreed with most of the reviews. The staff was fairly nice. The hotel definately needs some TLC. The carpets in the hallways and lobby need to be relaced badly. The pools we ok but could use alot more cleaning. The pool on the fifth floor was neglected. We noticed in the morning that all the wet dirty towels from the previous day were still out there. The kids club SUCKED. We went in there at 3pm and they said they were open 5-6 for free play. We went back at 5:05 the doors locked and no lights on. Finally at around 6 the manager offered no help and just suggested I call next time. I don't think I would stay there again. It was a real disappointment. Not what I expect from a Hilton

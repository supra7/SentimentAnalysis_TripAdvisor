We had stayed there some years ago with our children and like it but we revisited with our granddaughter. and were disappointed. We had a suite and when we called to get help opening the foldout couch the front desk never answered and the housekeeping said they would send someone up and after 20+minutes we just figured it out. When calling to cancel they never said 'sorry' etc. At the pool there were no towels until we asked for more and again I felt they were not keeping an eye on this kind of thing. Finally the restaurant is expensive for the costs. As they are far from any other restaurants I guess they have a captive audience. The view was good but location was too far from many things.

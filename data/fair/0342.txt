It is delightful to be right on the water at this hotel. Sitting in front of the fire looking out to the Sound on a rainy day is delightful. Rooms ar comfortable if a bit odd in having a mountain lodge theme replete with teddy bears. Service is terrible and it is a long way and a long hike up hill from anything one might want to do in Seattle. Pricey for what you get - there are plenty of fabulous hotels for the same rate or less in this great town. But hey! the Beatles stayed here.

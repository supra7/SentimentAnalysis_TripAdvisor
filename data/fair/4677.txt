My experience started with us arriving and being told that we couldn't get a room with a king-sized bed because we booked through Expedia. This was very disappointing after 9 hours of flying plus is was my significant others birthday. Real nice sleeping in separate beds...thanks Sheraton. We were moved the 2nd day into a king room but that is still unacceptable. The rest of our stay went fairly well until the last night when we were evacuated from our room due to the tsunami. The entire staff seemed ill prepared to handle such a situation and it didn't seem there was a clear plan in place. All guests from floors 1 and 2 were placed into the ballroom on the 3rd floor and given a sheet and a blanket for sleeping purposes. We came to find out later that tsunami evacuation procedures recommend being on the 4th floor or higher. We spent the entire night from midnight until 7am there and finally decided to just go back to our room despite not being told anything by the staff. We were to check out that day so I called the front desk to request a late check out seeing as we had slept on a concrete floor the whole night. They were not willing to accommodate that request which was very disappointing. I understand that an act of nature is out of their control but the way they chose to handle it was downright unacceptable. I brought this up when I checked out and told them I was very displeased with the response I got. They were more concerned with their incoming guests than they were with the ones who had spent the entire night dealing with potential disaster. I made the comment that it would've been nice to get some sleep and the guy working at the front desk responded, "well I was here last night too". I pointed out to him that it was his job and he was being paid for it while I was a paying guest at the hotel. Had they not handled this situation so poorly I probably would've recommended this hotel but can't due so in good faith after being treated so rudely by the staff.

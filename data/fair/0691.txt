We walked in and stayed at this Quality Inn for Sat. May 26, 07. Paid $69 + tax for the room, room 116 it was. Dim hallways, no elevators, smell smoke everywhere. Everything is true in the review dated Jan 7, 2007. Blankket and all sheets, pillow and mattress were very flimsy. But can't turn the strong AC off since it's very stuffy so we were to wear more clothes to bed, esp. when there's not enough blankets for warmth. It was clean (enough). Lighting is dim throughout the hotel. Fridge and microwave in the room. We actually saw many plane crew members stay here too - to my surprise. Good location for the airport, great value esp. with breakfast, but we wouldn't wanna stay there ever again. P.S. there's a small casino right across the street for those who are interested.

This Hotel is beautiful, modern and just a few steps from the Gaslamp quarter and from the Seaport village, but I rated it only 2 stars because internet connection costs 13,90 $ per 24h ( and 19,90 $ for full speed !!!!), the carpark costs 27 $ per day , and they do not have a shuttle for the airport, which is only 4 miles from the hotel. Totally unacceptable !

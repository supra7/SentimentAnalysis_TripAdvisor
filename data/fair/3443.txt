Very small room, no surprise there. Excellent location on quiet street in the West Village, not far from Union Square hub. Staff was friendly enough. All in all, we'd have been pleased as punch, were we not covered in insect bites. I got well over twenty nasty bites all over my body, including my face, during a four night stay. I couldn't spot any bed bugs, but neither could I see flying insects so I'm not sure what was biting me, except that it was while I slept in bed at the Larchmont. I washed everything we own in hot water upon returning home and am praying nothing survived.

We stayed at this hotel for the ACS conference and decided to make a week of vacation. The hotel looked nothing like the photos on the internet. We had a 12 inch closet which we could not hang our clothes. We called platinum American Express and asked them to get aus a room with a real closet. Well that didn't work. The bathroom had mold in the tub and the ceiling had mold and falling down wall paper. The ice machine around the corner was filled from our bathroom sink so you can imagine that noise! Our view was terrible, just the air conditioning units from the buildings. UGH! On the positive side, the food in the hotel was very good.

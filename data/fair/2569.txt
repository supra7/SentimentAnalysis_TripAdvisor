We stayed on the executive level over the Easter weekend. The public areas of this hotel are well kept but once you get to the rooms they are shabby and tired. The a/c in our room clicked and groaned through the night and didnt even work very well. The bedrooms are small and the bathrooms even smaller. The location is good but I certainly wouldnt stay here again.

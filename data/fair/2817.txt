I was there for a conference so we did not pay the usual rates. Although it has beautiful pools and lovely scenery (especially the beach-side sunset), I would not go back if it weren't for business, for a few reasons that are probably impossible for the hotel to improve on without a major makeover: firstly, the rooms are very very noisy -- thin walls (I could hear the couple next door planning their itinerary, as well as their television; even the wheels of the bellboy's cart were audible, and I am not usually a light sleeper). Secondly, the place is showing its age (mouldy balconies, bird-dropping-stains). thirdly, you need to walk a really long distance to get around -- the front desk, the eating areas, the pick-up points (more than one), the pools -- are all far apart, and confusingly not on the same floor. That's tiring if you have children and / or elderly parents. Service was by and large impeccable (except for one concierge who couldn't answer even basic questions about touring, whom I never identified because he wouldn't give me his name on the phone), although, as everyone else has mentioned, there are about seven items that appear on your room bill each day (tips for the staff are taxed!). However, that does not make up for the poor sleep and long travel times (within the hotel!).

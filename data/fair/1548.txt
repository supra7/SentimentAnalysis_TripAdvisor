Rooms were clean and spacious, and the location was convenient to Mall of the Emirates/Metro. However: 1. After a four-and-a-half hour drive from Muscat, it took more than 30 minutes to check in, even though we had a credit-card confirmed and guaranteed booking. 2. It took an additional 15 mintes after check-in for the extra bed to be brought in, even though we had specifically requested it in the booking. Staff did not care that we were already extremely tired after a long drive, and didn't offer any refreshments while we waited. While being charged an extra AED150/day for the exxtra bed, it was so unconfortable that none of us could sleep on it, and instead rearranged the cushions from the sofa on the ground. 3. Internet is ridiculously expensive and SLOW (transfer rates of dial-up) for AED20/hour, AED100/day). 4. The hotel charges AED50 for an replacement keycard, and can only issue ONE KEY PER ROOM (RIDICULOUS!) 5. Front desk staff is completely incompetent -- when called and asked for manager, was told to hold and no one responded for more than 10 minutes. Then realized we had been hung up on! When we called back, the staff said the manager was not in that day! 6. While trying to get ready to go out one night, we requested 3 extra bath towels at 6PM. Front desk/housekeeping responded that there were NONE AVAILABLE, as all their towels were still in the laundry! HOW RIDICULOUS IS THAT!?! Didn't end up getting the towels till 1AM! When raised this issue with management during checkout (when we were finallly able to get ahold of Mr Iqbal) he was belligerent and uncompromising, offering insincere apologies and no explanations. Overall, stay away from this poorly managed property and completely incompetent staff (including all properties managed by ETA Star Hospitality)

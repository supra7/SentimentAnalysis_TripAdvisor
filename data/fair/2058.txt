The location of this hotel is amazing. The amount of loud partying that went on is more on par with a cheap motel. We had to call security numerous times throughout our stay for noise control, and the loud partying continued until about 4 am. Room rates are high and the quality of the stay was a disappointment. The rooms are very clean and the hotel restaurant was amazing though!

It needs to be cheap to go. The room is dirty, dirty, dirty. We took our kids and after supper they bathed and we had put clean new white socks on within two hours they were black from the dirty floors. Nothing is ever scrubbed clean including the dishes that are just dipped in water(they will do this infront of you at any of the bars) The room is set up nice but many things didn't work (ceiling fan, lights) The water is a rusty color and leaves a film on you and you will run out of hot water. You will have to beg for hand towels, faceclothes and towels. The room never got cleaned twice and is usually done late in the day. The pools are ice cold but did warm up as the weather got warmer. The food is excellent and is the highlight of this esort. The problem is the service is super slow and can take over two and a half hours to eat a meal. The servers are not lazy but they can't keep up and they tend to only fill just over half the seats because of it, so you at times will wait over an hour just to get a table. If it's slow the service is very good. You will have to pay for internet service and it doesn't work most of the time. It will cut in and out wherever you are. The room service is horrible and takes forever. We also had some make up stolen from our room. The beach is just ok and you can't really go in the ocean because of all the rock but if you cross the rock there is sand further out. All in all i wouldn't go bak to this resort even if it is cheap i would gamble on something else.

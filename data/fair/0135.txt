My boyfriend and I are both students and booked into The Moore for a weekend away. We paid $66 plus taxes a night for a double room with no bathroom. This was during what is still considered high season in Seattle (Seattle being what I consider to be an expensive hotel city, but I digress). Look, The Moore isnt fancy, but for $66 what are you expecting? Our room was on the 7th floor. It was small, but CLEAN and I felt SAFE which is all that matters, to me at least. The bathroom and showers were just down the hall, but I never encountered any one when I went to use them. The staff are very helpful and kind. Yes, there is some noise from the street and The Moore theatre below if there is a concert going on. As for the street people, theyre harmless and left us alone, which was refreshing (considering were from Vancouver where you can encounter aggressive panhandling) and I felt pretty safe in the area. The Night Lite lounge was great for a quick drink, $3 beers cant go wrong!. Great location, 2 block to pike place market, 2 block to GREAT shopping in the Pine Street area. The hotel is also in the middle of the free zone for busses, which makes it pretty cheap to zip around down town. We were so busy out seeing Seattle we didnt spend much time at the hotel, except to sleep. Ask for a room higher up, youll encounter less noise.

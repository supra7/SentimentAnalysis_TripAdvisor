We chose this hotel as it was near our son BUT would not choose it unless looking for a short stop over. The room was basic although clean with complimentary shower gel etc and fresh towels daily. There was cigarette smoke smells on the landing which showed people did not obey the signs. Reception said that some of their premanent guests liked to smoke in their rooms BUT this is breaking the law and fire regulations and should not be allowed. The shower and toilets (shared with 6 other rooms) were very small and required full refurbishment. The single toilet was SO small you could hardly sit down ! Breakfast was adequate although the basement cafe where it was served was cramped.

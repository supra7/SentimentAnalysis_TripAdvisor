I was in New Orleans for business meeting one week at the Intercontinental and the next at the JW Marriott, The Intercontinental room was very weak for the price, the service left much to be desired, my business lunch guest at their pricey restaurant found a bee in the bottom of their tea glass and the restaurant manager never bothered to call and apologize. Valet parking is a nightmare, front desk is not even friendly, and on and on. My next stay was at the JW and was very impressive.....and closer to the French Quarter

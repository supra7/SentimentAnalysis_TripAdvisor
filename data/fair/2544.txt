Stayed at the Plamer House one night last week and I came away greatly disappointed. As a diamond member I was originally denied access to the executive lounge. It took a number of phone calls and finally a visit down to the front desk to resolve. They tried to claim that I had to pay to access the lounge. Unreal. Aside from that issue, the standard room was quaint, but clean. However it did have issues as well. 1. The drain for the tub was not installed. Basically an open hole in the tub served that purpose. 2. The lock on the bathroom door was not functional. 3. The phones (both of them) could not access the message function and would cut out. I'm guessing these physical issues with the property will be resolved with the renovation currently under way. Ended up at the Drake the following night and it was everything the Palmer House was not.

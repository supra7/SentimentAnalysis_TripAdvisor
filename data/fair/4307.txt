A family of 2 adults and 2 teenages, we were really looking forward to this hotel after seeing its website. We had just left the Sherton in Boston which is pristine and I thought things could only get better, plus the Beekman Tower was art deco in style. When we arrived and got to the room the decor and furnishings looked really tired and it looked like it could do with another hovering. There was one double bed and a sofa bed which wasn't very comfortable. I was really very disappointed. There was only one mirror in the room and that was in the bathroom so getting ready in the mornings took some time. The airconditioning was quite loud. On a plus side it was good having a proper fridge and if I had wanted to cook I could have done. A bit of a walk to the centre but being in New York is all about experiencing the place so we didn't mind. The staff were polite and kind. On reflection if the decor and furnishing could be updated it would be a great hotel. For couples and families with small children

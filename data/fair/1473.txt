This hotel is undergoing a renovation, so it had the new signage and new bedding that the newer Hamptons have, but the bathroom was not done yet, and it still had a slightly undone look to the room. Most importantly, we found a large roach in the bathroom. We told the front desk about it, and they were going to have maintenance do something about it.

Love W Hotels but this is the least impressive W location I've experienced in my travels. I know most rooms in NYC hotels are small, but you expect them to be clean. I had a balcony and the door wouldn't open correctly and the lock was broken. The balcony was litered with cigarret butts. Service staff didn't seem concerns about fixing the door either. Room seemed worn and dirty. Restaurant in lobby was closed and very small lobby. Staying in NYC a lot over the next few months and hoping the other NYC W locations will be better. I would not reccomend this location for business or pleasure.

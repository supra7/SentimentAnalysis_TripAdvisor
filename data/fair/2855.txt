I just got back from Maui today and I thought I would write a review about this resort since there is so much "Hype" about it. It does not live up to any of it. I stayed at several different hotels on the island and loved the western side of Maui, the main town, Lahaina, is there. There are lots of shops on front street in Lahaina, and surfing conditions are good here. If I was to stay here again, I would stay at Kapalua Bay Resort, the Hyatt, or the Ritz. All of the beaches are beautiful here, especially Kapalua Bay. On the Southern side of the island, where the Grand Wailea and Four Seasons are, it is over an hour drive just to get to Lahaina(which is where you will be going every day for shopping, dining, prettier beaches, and all attractions. The beach in this area is not near as pristine. The water is kind of, well...murky! I was so dissapointed at the Grand Wailea Resort. It reminds me of a water park( a bad one). There are so many white lawn chairs layed out all over the place, it was overcast every day I was there. And I didn't go all the way to Maui for a rope swing and 2 slides. On their web site, they make it sound so "Grand" when the whole thing consisted of 2 small slides, 1 lazy river, a water elevator I never got to ride on because the line of kids was so long, and murky water. The rooms were mediocre at best, and for $600/night, this is ridiculous! Don't stay here. The western part of the island is breathtaking! Stay in the Lahaina, Kapalua, Kaanapali area and you can't go wrong.

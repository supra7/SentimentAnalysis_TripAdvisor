We thought we found a great value at this hotel until the hotel started to nickel and dime us. Twenty-eight dollars per night to park at the hotel, ten dollars per day per person for a continental breakfast, thirteen dollars per night for wireless internet, etc. They also make you pay tax on things such as parking and wireless internet. Additionally, we could hear the guests next door loud and clear. The toilet seat wouldn't stay up, the closet doors wouldn't shut, and their was no fan in the bathroom. These are the little things we expect from the Marriott brand. Unless you get a smoking deal here that offsets all the different charges, we suggest staying somewhere else.

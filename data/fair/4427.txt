I stayed at this hotel back in Septemeber to attend a concert and to visit some of Boston's attractions. The best aspect of this hotel is its location. My room was freezing and adjusting the temp. controls had no effect. The main problem with this hotel was that there were 4 neanderthals in the room next to me screaming, throwing furniture, wrestling, staying up all night and throwing things in the hallway. I complained the first night and nothing happened. You could even tell by this group of guests' behavior in the lobby that this group was a problem. The Bruins had their first exhibition game on my second night at this Holiday Inn. So at first, I wondered if these guys were hockey players because they were all huge. But I eventually realized that they were just to moronic to be professional hockey players. On the 2nd night I confronted them myself, and of course they just threatened me in return. 4 against 1 was not a fair situation and I had no one on my side. I wondered how on earth none of the other guests on my floor were complaining about them. Of course, these idots were the last room on the floor and I was in the room right next to them with no one else on the other side of them. Still, they were all over the hallway causing problems. Thanks Holiday Inn for putting my right next to 4 loud jerks. And thanks (very sarcastic) for not doing anything to boot these idiots. At minimun, this Holiday Inn has a security problem, along with a certain amount of tolerance for loud guests. The second night, I got threatened and I got no sleep whatsoever as a result of this. I love the location, but I don't know if I'd stay there again after my first nightmare there.

Booked an expensive waterfront suite to view sunsets from a private balcony. The water we were looked at was a skinny canal, overlooking mangroves and tin roofs at the neighboring property. The property has some units facing the gulf, but even those views are not that great. The sugar sand in front of the cottages in the brochure photos is the walkway behind the connected buildings, nowhere is a great water view to be found unless you are on the third floor attic looking out a window. Not worth the extra money we spent. Asked nicely for upgraded room and was turned down. We won't recommend or be back to the Parrot Key Hotel.

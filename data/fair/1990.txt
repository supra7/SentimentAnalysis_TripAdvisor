What a TRAILER PARK dump, They abuse the use of RESORT. This place is nothing more than a blacktop lot with white lines to squeeze your coach in. When we're ready to leave, we're going to need to ask three rv's across from us to move so we can pull our 45' coach out using a shoe horn. They weren't here when we arrived. I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE SELECTING THIS DUMP. We love San Diego, but will look for somewhere else to stay in the future.

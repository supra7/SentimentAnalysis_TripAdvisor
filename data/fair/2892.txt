The location and property were very nice, the beach was amazing and the view fantastic. The people who worked there were very friendly and polite, but I could not get over the dirty feeling of the room we were in. The bathroom felt like it needed a deep cleaning and the carpets, well lets just say I was uncomfortable taking my shoes off in our room or sitting on the floor, and when you have a toddler that is important. The couch that was in the room was very dirty, both looking and feeling. The baby cockroaches crawling around the room pushed me over the edge. We were scheduled to stay there 9 days but moved after 5, we just couldn't relax. The restaurant was also dirty feeling, and the buffet left a lot to be desired for it's price. I don't know how this hotel gets such high ratings.

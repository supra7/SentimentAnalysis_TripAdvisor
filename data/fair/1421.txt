We were mislead to this tourist trap by an August 2009 "Save or Splurge" travel article in the New York Times. The rooms are ridiculously small and some of them have no view outside (and therefore no natural light). If you have any problem, the management will remain completely oblivious. The bath tub in our room sprung a leak during our stay (with an ensuing flood after each shower) but this was not rectified nor acknowledged by the staff. The breakfast is adequate, and the location is great, but these are not enough to make up for your uncomfortable stay The only redeeming thing about this hotel is the lovable day porter - Akif.

Stayed for two nights for a bachelor party and rooms are oversized, very plush, and great room service. However, if you are looking to gamble, stay elsewhere. I found out afterwards that many pros play at this casino and their rules are extremely tight. After rolling for 30 minutes and winning a nice amount on the craps table, Murray, the pit boss, kicked me off for not hitting the back wall enough. I go to Vegas often and have never seen this. The table was irrate when he pulled the dice from me. Apparently, this is how the Encore controls winning, which is most peoples goal when going to Vegas. If you want to gamble, stay somewhere else...I will.

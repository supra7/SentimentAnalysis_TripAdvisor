Stayed at the Whitehall on a recent business trip to Chicago. This hotel has alot going for it...the intimate scale, great location, and really nice staff make the ideal combination. What did not work for me was the airconditioning in my room and the strange menu in the restaurant. I know that the restaurants are often leased to other operators, but hotels that lease their restaurants need to understand that the restauran is a direct reflection on the guest experience and the hotels brand reputation. Please fix the airconditioning and the restaurant

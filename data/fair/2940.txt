We just spent a week in Maui splitting our time between the Sheraton and the Ritz (had a wedding to attend at the Ritz). Even ignoring the price gouging, I was very disappointed. Compared to the Sheraton, the staff was less friendly, the views were less interesting, the distance to the beach was farther, and the price gouging was worse. On the flip side, the room itself was nicer than the Sheraton (with the exception of the bed which wasn't level at the Ritz). I travel a lot, so I am used to the outrageous hotel prices. But when my wife got a mani/pedi for $150 and it was worse than she could do herself, that is just plain offensive. When we checked into our "Deluxe Ocean View Room", was a little surprised that I had to lean over the railing and look left with binoculars to see the ocean. And with the window open, you certainly couldn't hear it. The Sheraton was right there and most rooms have direct ocean views. I was looking forward to this stay expecting the much higher price to command a much nicer (or at least somewhat nicer) experience. Not so. Plus, the weather in Kapalua was consistently worse than Ka'anapali (sp?).

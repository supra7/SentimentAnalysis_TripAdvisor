The entire place felt old and tired. The room towels were shabby, the carpet was dirty and they did not have the regular nice amenities you would expect at a resort. Our room was only restocked at our request. Watch that you don't get a room near the ping pong table. Ca-ping ca-ping ca-ping from 8 am to 10 pm. The water park was FILTHY. The lounge chairs were disgusting. Just about everyone had towels draping every part of them - and they came at a price! You had to wait in line to get in to secure a chair and a place to sit. Not the relaxing scene I had imagined. Very disappointing that you can not bring in your own food and drink when their's is way too expensive for a family. The birds seem to have the run of the restaurant mainly because it took so long to clear tables. The food (while delicious breakfast food) took forever to arrive as did the check (4 days in a row). The centerpieces looked as if they had spent an eternity there. I saw one tucked away in a potted plant nearby. Guess the diners didn't want that dirty thing on their table either..

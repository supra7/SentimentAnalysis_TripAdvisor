Overpriced, small rooms, meeting rooms claiming to have natural daylight had frosted windows backing up to a concrete wall. Wallpaper was damaged and panels missing in the meeting room. Rodents in 2 separate guest rooms and cockroaches were found on the lunch buffet table before meeting delegates had started to eat. The central sales process was long and when finally passed through to the hotel events team, responses to requests had to be chased and chased. Transfers were booked incorrectly despite email confirmation. Not good for business.

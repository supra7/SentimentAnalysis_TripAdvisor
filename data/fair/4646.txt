We booked through Orbitz big mistake. They charged us 3 times for a single room. When we arrived to hotel they had 3 rooms waiting for us. The credit card company then froze our credit card on thought of fraud. If you must call Orbitz you get someone in India that you can't understand and vice versa. They were useless, and stayed on hold for over 40mins while they reviewed case, in end they would tell you to wait 5-7 business days for refund. Ok Hotel, it's not the one pictured here online. The resort is not exactly a resort. We weren't expecting much, The rooms and properties are old. Have the property is condemed, and they are redoing half the property. So construction starts early. Our room was in need of upgrade. Bathrooom is very old mold around the caulking, floors are worn out, toilet feels like it will go through the floor. No AC in bathroom so very humid. The AC in the room is a small unit that during the day just can't keep up, the room is warm. it finaly will cool off during the night. The sheets are very nice and comfortable as well as the beds. The rooms lack light. Good location across the street from beach

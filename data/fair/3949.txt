I, too, am mystified as to why the reviews of this hotel are so positive. I expected the service to be as good as what previous reviewers had said that it would be but found it to be quite mediocre. The front desk staff was business-like but not particularly friendly. The service at the Cafe Andre was actually poor during our stay. Also, the decor of our room was somewhat worn, and the noise from the street at night necessitated the use of earplugs in order to have any chance of getting a good night's sleep. And the shower kept turning off repeatedly while in use, which was annoying. With so many wonderful hotels from which to choose in San Francisco, the Hotel Rex certainly gave me no reason to return.

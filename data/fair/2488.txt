I would not have even bothered writing a review about this hotel if were not for the fact that they ran out of cribs. I expressly stated when I made our reservation that we needed a crib for our infant/toddler. When we arrived we were told that they ran out. I asked why. The front desk said that a family extended their stay and needed to keep the one they were using and the hotel did not have any extras. I then asked why, when it became clear that your guests were staying an extra night, you didn't make provisions to get more cribs since you knew we were coming. (I mean, come on, did they think we were not going to notice?) After a very long song and dance, where I was made to feel like I was making a fuss, the front desk got someone to go and buy a portable crib from a nearby shop. Fortunately, even though it was a holiday weekend, they managed to do this. After this experience, I am not sure I would stay here again. (There was also hardened dried snot embedded into one of the bedsheets. Clearly, the laundering facilities leave something to be desired as well. ) That said, it is right next to the Arts Institute - which is a major plus if that is the main thing you are doing.

This hotel (I use that term loosely) is quite frankly not IMPERIUM! While the service is impeccable, the location is incredible; this is a 6 room Pensione and nothing more. Don't be fooled by the advertisements. The rooms are in a small home off the Piazza Novona and there are several other apartments in the same building. You can hear everything from your neighbors (and I MEAN EVERYTHING) and the "lobby" is in the same space as two of the hotel rooms. I was extremely disappointed with this place when I arrived, but I will say that the location is ideal. So, if you don't mind hearing your neighbors, could care less about being in apartment building, then this is the place for you.

Tired The rooms on average are small.Small defined as impossible to move around in if the ironing board is out.The decor is a little tired in the rooms.The room only had one accessible power outlet that is part of a lamp and not suitable for adapters.There is major construction next door that looks like it has a year to go.I was not warned about this but was in a room where due to the noise i soon discovered it for myself.Ask not to be put on the back wall of the hotel.The gym is out of date and not well maintained.The missing foot straps on the bike have not been replaced in two years.Unless you order USA today you will not get your paper of choice.Over all an underwhelming place.

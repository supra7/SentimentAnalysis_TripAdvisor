The Westin Maui is not like most Westin hotels. Very unfriendly staff and they do not try to make things better. Our room did not have air several times and instead of changing our room they knew we were single women but they said they fixed it and just kept sending someone back. (not thinking that next time we would bring our husbands). First disappointment was that we booked with Apple Vacations and you do not get points with the Starwood points program. Second, I have traveled all over the world and I don't mind paying resort prices but a simple glass of chardonnay was $12.50 a little too pricey. But walk 100 feet next door to Hula Grill and the same glass of wine was $6.50. The pool had very rude servers and very limited hours. They need to look at different time zones and schedule servers. If you are there 5 days you don't want to live a 5 hour time difference. The hotel staff worked when they wanted to and did not take in consideration your vacation time. The fitness center was excellent.! The breakfast buffet was great if you got the ocean front view. But plan to wait on your vacation for this. The coffee bar early AM was nice but really slow. And don't purchase the pineapples in the lobby to take back they get broken during during travel. Ask to ship instead. The Econ Tours (Ask for Eric) Travel Rain Forest 5 mile hike was the fabulous and the Snorkel trip with the Pride of Maui was excellent! Also, the Hula Grill next door has wonderful food & drinks. And Duke's restaurnat ( 3 minute tax ride) is the best dinner I have every had. Try the seared rare ahi tuna, to die for!

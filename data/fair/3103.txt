The good: Westin Maui Resort And Spa is in a great location with a nice beach and very large multi-tiered pool. There are many activities that can be booked right off the beach in front of the hotel. It is also right next door to a fairly large outdoor mall called Whaler's Village, which has shops, three sit down restaurants, and a couple of fast food operations. The bad: The management and most service workers at the hotel have an "it's not my problem" mentality. When you call at 4pm to ask why your room wasn't cleaned, dont be surprised when you are informed by the person on the other end of the line that it is not their fault because their shift just started. There is no team mentality with the management or the service staff. Expect to get a lot of attitude from the towel distribution staff and don't think you are getting a towel from them past five when they close, even though the pool shuts down at ten. Don't be surprised when your a/c or balcony door do not function. Of course you will be informed that the hotel is planning renovations to "begin very soon." Expect to contend with tons of kids. This hotel is not up to Westin standards. I have stayed at Westins all over and this is the worst. Go to Maui, you will have a great time, but stay at the Fairmont or the Hyatt next door, they are both superior.

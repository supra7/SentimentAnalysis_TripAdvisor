This hotel needs updating. Old Hampton Inn beds. No pictures hung on the walls. Old TV. Maintenance issues all over the room and bathroom. Just rough around the edges. I live in Memphis. My wife and I moved and we needed to stay at a hotel for a few nights while we began sorting through all the stuff in our home. Needless to say, with a plethora of Hampton Inns in Memphis, I will stay at others if I need a room or need to direct friends, family or colleagues/clients to a Hilton hotel. If you need to go to Baptist hospital, I recommend staying here. If not, try another Hampton, including the Inn and Suites off poplar, the Hampton Inn East Memphis on Poplar, the Inn and Suites in Bartlett, the Hampton downtown, etc. For non-Hampton, the Hilton, Doubletree and Embassy Suites are all relatively close to each other. Downtown, you are left with the Doubletree and the Hampton. The hotel didn't do anything wrong ... but there are better properties in Memphis, and until they freshen this place up to the new Hampton model, I'll recommend that travelers stay elsewhere.

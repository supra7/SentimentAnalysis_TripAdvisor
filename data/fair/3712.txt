I don't know if the hotel recently changed it's policies, but most of the amenities everyone talked about are no longer free. Firstly, each day you are charged a $10 fee which I was told was for WIFI (even if you don't use it), 2 bottles of water per day, tickets for the trolley (worth $1 per ride) and free coffee in the lobby. Come to find out, the coffee is only available from 5-7 AM! Also, the gym is another $10 per day. There is not a shuttle to any attractions...it costs yet another $10 per person. If you do rent a car, beware, it will cost you $18 per day for parking! Yes, the ducks were cute, but once you got past the lobby, the rooms were just average. One more thing, they closed the pool for 3 days to clean it during our 4 night stay.

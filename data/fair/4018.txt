You Got To Be Kidding !!! I knew i was in for trouble when I discovered that the hotel had no signage to identify itself (pretentious , not cool). The room was a decent size (we had a deluxe) although the bathroom was a joke (I have never seen a smaller one in a hotel)The IKEA plexiglass orange furniture, small TV, lack of drawers and hard bed didnt help. If you are there on the weekend be prepared for even more noise (allot of traffic noise even on the 8th fl.)than usual.The $51.65 for parking (they charge tax on parking) was insulting enough but it took 1/2 hr to get our car on a Sunday morning.The lobby, bar and restaraunt are all unique but dont come close to making it worth it.If you are young (under 30) and painfully hip this may be the place for you otherwise go elsewhere.

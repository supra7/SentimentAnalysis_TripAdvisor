We stayed for 3 nights at the Moore Hotel but were some what disappointed with our stay. We wanted kitchen facilities as we had 2 couples travelling and wanted to have breakfast and maybe dinner at our room. There was no toaster or kettle available. We had a small fridge, 2 elements and a coffee maker. We are mainly tea drinkers. It was very noisy as it's on a busy street with concerts held next door. Room was clean.

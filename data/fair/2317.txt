This is the first time I have written a review- because I am so disappointed with this room. I am in Boston for a short business trip and was looking forward to a couple of nights in a hotel. I generally stay in nice hotels when on business, with a little touch of luxury especially in the bath amenities, and I like a good gym. The Hyatt website describes their "elegant granite bath" in each room as well as pointing out the presence of a large flat screen tv in each room. Well, the flat screen tv is any old regular tv with a screen that happens to be flat. do not think that it will be LCD or a thin flat screen. And the bath is NOT granite. It is a regular, smallish bath with a granite COUNTER next to it. The mini bar seems to be quite hostile- there are sensors on each item and the room is charged as soon as an item is moved. Internet is available but at cost via T-mobile. AND- there is no safe in the room, which for a 4 star hotel that charges 200$/night is unacceptable. I am worried about going to see the gym. All in all a very ordinary room that is probably fine to sleep in but not 4 star, and not as described on the website.

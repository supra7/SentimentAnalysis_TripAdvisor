I stayed this past weekend with friends and family. The hotel is old and historic and has so much character and charm, but wow do the rooms need some updating to say the least. Our rooms was mismatched with furnishings dating from the 1930's and up. The curtains we truly filthy. There were phone cords and electrical cords just piled under the table in the living room. The kitchen had a gas stove in the kitchen - is that safe? The bathroom had hairs everywhere and lots of mildew around the tub - it didn't drain well either. You know the funny think is that it is NYC and I was with some of my favorite people so we had a great time. Would I stay again, maybe, but please I run an inn and I understand budgets and our economic times, but please consider updating and fast. I would hate to see such a great gem just go by the wayside. The do have to say the staff was very friendly - John offered to take our bags and gave us a great map and suggestions - He made the stay.

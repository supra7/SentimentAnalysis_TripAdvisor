We are an adult couple over 50, booked 2 nights and chose the hotel based on reviews. Big mistake. That is why I decided to write my first review ever to help people to look closer when booking a place to stay even for one night. No matter how funky or modern a hotel room is it should never lack comfort. Yes, it's all decorated in black and grey but you still need enough light to find your things around and be able to fire up your PC. Dark and depressing room!Yes the bathroom was nice and modern but you don't need to bump into walls to move from sink to the shower. The duvet and pillow shams had stains, we asked to be replaced , the toilet did not flush properly (bad plumbing for a new hotel!) There were only two plastic seats and a small table in the room. no real chairs to relax in, no desk, a very low table with a missing leg serving as the only piece of furniture to store something on, a very small closet not full height, suitable for one person. No coat rack or at least some hooks at the entrance- that was really a big miss. The laminate flooring was cheap and squeaky, the only rug in the room was the one they use at the Mall entrance.The most idiotic thing was the location of the wall mounted TV, right in the small entry hallway, across the bathroom, 16ft away from the bed and the plastic chairs. Everything looked like designed by a blind and drunk individual. Moving from comfort to safety, how can the only sprinkler in this unit be placed in the bathroom?? As a construction engineer I can say without any doubts that the hotel was built cheap and with no idea of comfort. Won't ever go back.

Hotel is really called The Point, nobody seems to know where it is located. If you have a room like ours, you have a wonderful view of a questionable auto shop. Don't be fulled by the "free shuttle" to Sea World and Universal...there is only one a day, miss it and you either pay a small fortune to get a taxi or wait for the I Trolly. I Trolly is great, but you have to wait sometimes. Oh, the hotel told us they sold the Trolly passes, but they don"t you have to go to another hotel to purchase. No place to eat at The Point, unless you like tapasse for a meal. The only meal is breakfast and it is nothing to write home about. So be prepared to go else where for a meal. Staff not very nice either. To busy chatting with each other and not intrested in customers. When I called to confirm they told me that I would think this place was better than Portofino Bay.....hardly folks. I would rather pay the price to be a resort property. THan to top it off, there is a "resort fee" they hit you with after your stay...what...this is not a resort..is was a hotel.

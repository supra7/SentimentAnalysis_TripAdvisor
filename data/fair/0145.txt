The details of the rooms detailed on their website are falsely listed. They do not offer continental breakfast, they do not have a fridge in the room. Booking travel comes with expectations based on the outline of hotel and room rate details. This hotel misrepresents what is offered. The rooms are very small but that is the expectation for a downtown hotel of this era. The bed was small and rather hard, pillows also flat. Bathroom ammenities were minimal and the sink very small. The location was very close to the stadiums but quite a distance from the markets on the waterfront. Reasonable for a reduced rate. Elevator slow and very old.

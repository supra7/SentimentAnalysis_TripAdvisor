Our reservations were messed up from the moment they e-mailed me. It took 2 weeks before someone assure me that they could not do anything for me. Called the hotel directly and they assured me the they had taken care of the problem. Got an e-mail from them and everything was in black and white until I checked in. Went down to the front desk twice (not to mention the line) because they had given me the wrong room and not the room I paid for. By then I gave up and said I'll never stay here again!

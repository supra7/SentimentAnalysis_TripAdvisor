I stayed for one night while I was attending a conference at the Four Seasons next door (company policy wouldn't cover the $400 room rate there!) The Back Bay location of the hotel is fantastic - and expensive - so the hotel was very well priced given the location. Should have been a clue! The lobby and common areas were nice and the staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive, I thought. Even the hotel room itself was okay, if a bit tired. I was upgraded to a "deluxe king" room, which I believe was a combination of two tiny little rooms - since my room also had two, teeny, tiny, tired bathrooms on the mirror image of each other! Now, together, these two, teeny, tiny, tired bathrooms would have made one normal sized bathroom - why the hotel has not bothered to combine them is a huge mystery to me. First, they were still tiled in 50's light blue tile - a clue as to the last time they were renovated? The sink also looked distressingly original, with a rubber stopper instead of a more modern levered stopper. However, the bathroom was so small and the bathtub stuck out so far into the tiny room that I banged my knee on it every time I approached the sink. Also, the bathroom door didn't quite open all the way, since there was a towel rack behind it, and when opened, the door came about 2 inches from the sink (did I mention the bathroom was small?) As a result, between the bathtub and the bathroom door, you had to angle your way through an opening of about 12 inches to work your way to the sink. It was awful. I'll never return to that hotel until they upgrade the bathrooms.

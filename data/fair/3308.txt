Place d'Armes/Better places Checked into this hotel which is centrally loaced in the French Quarter. It is a great location to explore the area. Front desk service is adequate. We received a room in the back of the hotel on the second floor with a view of the wall of the adjacent buildidng. It wasn't really that bad because it was quite. The room itself was a decent size but needed updating. The bed sagged in the middle. The bathroom sink was badly worn but worked. The toilet/tub-shower room was very small. The shower knozel should have been replaced. Our TV broke but was changed out quickly. How about a flat panal tv vs the tubes. They are so cheap now. Air conditing was great and the room had a fan. On our last day they forgot to clean the room. I realize the rate was 125 per night but this was a two star European hotel not a three/four star American hotel as it is represented in TA. Oh well lesson learned.

I stayed here when my sister was taking the bar in dallas. This is an old building and has an interesting "old stench." The walls are very thin. The window occasionally made whistling noises when it was windy. One of the elevators was out of service during our stay. My bathroom was barely big enough to turn around in and the shower backed up EVERY time I used it (up to my ankles)....seems to be a common issue with this hotel. They provide free milk and cookies but they weren't very good. They did try to make the bar people feel welcome by giving out complimentary candy bars and writing utensils. The free breakfast they provided was just okay. My sister ordered room service from the restaurant below and said it was awful. They provide free shuttle service within 3 miles based on availability They also provide a free bottled water each day you stay there. BEWARE about PARKING.......there is none, unless you park in a parking garage which charges (I think) $8 each time you go out UNLESS you leave the garage before 6:30am then it's only $2.00 to leave.

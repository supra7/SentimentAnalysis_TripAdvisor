Just returned from 5 days in Kapalua after spending 5 at the Grand Hyatt in Kauai. We absolutely LOVED Kauai and the Hyatt so maybe that biased our opinion of the Ritz. Fortunately we stayed using Marriot points because if we had paid out of pocket, we would have been very disappointed. Basically, the hotel is beautiful and the staff wonderful but the hotel is located far from the beach with an ancient cemetary between the hotel and the ocean. They have golf cart shuttles to the ocean for those that don't want to walk. The pool was FREEZING. My 19 month old cried when I brought him in and he loves the water! West Maui just doesn't have that beauty that Kauai or Hana in Maui has. It's very commercialized and you actually drive past a sewer treatment facility to get up to the Kapalua/Kannapali area and you can definately smell it! Kapalua is also windy and about 10 degrees cooler than Kannapali which is just 10 minutes south. If you have your heart set on Maui, we recommend the Wailea area (less windy) with lots of amazing restaurants (Ferraro's,etc). We've stayed at the Four Seasons and had a wonderful time there. If you're looking for a remote Hawaii getaway, we recommend Hotel Hana Maui in Hana or the Hyatt in Kauai. We wouldn't return here. It's too long a flight for us for what you get.

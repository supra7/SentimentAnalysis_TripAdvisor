I stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks. The reason why I chose is its location, very close to the centre and tube station. The room and the bathroom are too small. The staff seemed to be helpful and smilling , but t took them 10 days to change the bed sheets and the electric light bulb in the bathroom. The continental breakfast they offer has the least variety I have ever seen. I wouldn't stay here again.

Not a full service hotel Very disappointing stay here in January. Location is not bad - it looks over the entrance to the Halekulani Hotel (owned by the same people), and THAT hotel is fabulous. Had several meals there, so it was a convenient walk across the street.Major complaints are to do with service. The concierge was totally useless in giving advice on which bus to take to various places in Waikiki. Basically gave me the phone number for The Bus, and didn't offer to call himself. There is a coffee maker in the room, and there were two tea bags to choose from - Earl Grey and Green tea. When I asked at the front desk for something else, they said that's all they had. No regular English breakfast or other black tea. There is very limited room service - for breakfast only boxed breakfasts. The restaurant within the hotel is only open for breakfast till 9 a.m.The decor of the lobby is very stark and unwelcoming.The guest rooms were more pleasant but need updating.Bathroom was small, but with nice amenities.Wouldn't stay here again.

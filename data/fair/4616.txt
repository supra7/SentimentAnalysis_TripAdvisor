An okay place if you don't care about sleeping. First the good:Great location in the heart of Waikiki as well as easy to get to the beach.Good breakfast buffet. Especially compared to others close by. Here $13 as compared to $28 across the street. It's just breakfast!Now the not so good:Walls are paper thin. You can hear everybody and everything. Keep in mind then they can hear you too!Extra charge for the safe at $3.50 per day and paking charge $10 per day. Pretty standard practice around Waikiki, but why not roll it in so it doesn't feel like rip off.We were on 17th floor, out of 25 floors, and still heard the trolley staring at 6am every morning. I think it came then every 20 minutes or so. I'm still hearing the 'ding-ding' in my ears. Between the trolley and the elevator 'ding' it got pretty irritating.The beds. Normally I wouldn't complain about this because it hasn't ever been an issue in any other hotel we've ever stayed in. Now, I know why others have complained on this issue. They were only full beds, which I haven't slept in since I was a kid, with the most scratchy sheets I've ever felt. All in all we would NEVER stay here again even though we did enjoy the island. The best part was getting away from the city! Next time, off to Kaui, or Big Island, or Maui, or Lana'i, or etc........ Never back to the Beachcomber!!!! Stay at your own risk.

We checked in fine, the outside is prabably the best it has going for it in terms of looks and conditions. Staff was rude, not friendly, and not helpful. Hallways, elevators, lobby and pool area was plain dirty. THere is no other way to discripe it. We saw a huge stain on the floor as you got off the elevators, we saw several staff personnel go by several times a day, and at the end of the day, it was still there, even after the cleaning staff went by. Rooms are old, the is a constant musty odor everywhere, even in the outdoor pool area. Pool was ok, and the staff at the pool bar and grill were nice. General Hotel staff and housekeeping did not even speak english. We requested a non smoking roon, got the wrong room, had to sleep with the balcony door open, and the screens were all ripped up, like some pet had gotten at them a long time ago. Beds had sunken parts in the middle, and sofa's were smelly, filthy, and worn away. This place needs a major over haul, and the staff needs to take a customer service training couse. This is what a hotel and its staff and managers do, they serve customers, if that is not the purpose , then they should just shut it down. Horrible operation. Do not bother, not too mention that thye charge top rate for the area.

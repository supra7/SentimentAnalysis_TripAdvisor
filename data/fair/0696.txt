As a Hilton Silver and almost Gold member, we have enjoyed hotels in their ownership from Coast to Coast and in between, including Hiltons, Embassy Suites, and Homewood Suites. Ironically, our only negative experiences have been in Seattle -- the Embassy Suites Airport we rated 1 and the Hilton at SeaTac gets a 2. Most others we have ranked 4 or 5, so we are prone to like the Hilton chain. That said, the Seattle-Tacoma Airport Hilton seems like a distant cousin. Checking in at the Honors Desk and using points, I was treated indifferently and with a yawn. The hotel layout is a monstrosity -- most rooms are located much to far from the elevator. Their Spencer's Restaurant charges $28 to $49 for most dinner entrees because the hotel is located so far from walkable dining -- cannot remember the last time I ordered pizza delivered to a hotel, but we did. As my wife and I hauled six bags down through the long corridor and lobby at 4:35 am to catch the shuttle to the airport, the alleged bellhop watched us. We had asked check-in for a 4 a.m. wake-up call, but, being cautious, I checked again before we retired for the evening, and it had not been made. After the remarkable stay and service at Hilton's The Palmer House just a few weeks earlier, I couldn't believe this was the same chain.

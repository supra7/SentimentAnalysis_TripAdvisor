Sad to have to write such a review but need to warn future tourists about staying here. We have stayed twice in this hotel and have found it comfortable and welcoming. The trouble is, it is a top end hotel in a very bad area. Glad to return home yesterday, having been mugged on the way back from restaurant one evening this week. The adjacent streets have definitely worsened. A gang of about seven or eight surrounded us, pushing and shoving, asking us "friendly" questions. Our son, the most threatening for them I suppose, was surrounded while they took my husband's wallet. He had been walking at the back of the group. The wallet had been in a secure pocket but they still took it and he had no sensation of them doing so. I have always been an Hispanophile, loving the country, culture, language and specifically the city of Barcelona but now feel disillusioned and vulnerable. It was not just a chance pickpocketing. This group had obviously singled us out. Yes, we will learn from it but, even so, we are seasoned travellers and had deliberately avoided the smaller alleyways. However, they were very slick. Just a few minutes after it happened, my son was approached again in a similar way! Got the feeling this time that the people in this area definitely did not like us and did not want us there. I spoke to police who drove by and again the next day at the police station but they did not really want to know. So, if you are staying at this hotel, pay extra for a taxi to and from when you go out at night. Despite putting a brave face on it, this type of incident really does spoil your stay.

If you want a bed to sleep in... Needing only a place to sleep I would have to say that our goal was met. I was disappointed with the service (an extreme indifference and lack of knowledge), the cleanliness, and the poor condition of the bathroom facilities. The location is very good with easy access to the bus line, etc. I do believe that we paid too much money for what we did get...which wasn't must at all.

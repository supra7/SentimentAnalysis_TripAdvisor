We just returned from a one night stay in chicago. I have visited Chicago probably 14+ times and stayed at most of the deluxe properties and was looking forward to experience the SWISSOTEL. There was nothing impressive at all about the hotel and I was quiet disappointed. Whilst our friends stayed at the Renaissance and I wanted to experience the SWISSOTEL I wished I had joined them: the lobby is dark and weird shaped, the front desk check-in was not very friendly, the room was average sized - I bought a package incl parking, bfst and pool area. I find it surprising that access to gym/ pool would be assessed with $ 15.00 p day - and had high expectations. We were disappointed with pool area (only spectacular views from the gym) - it reminded me very much of 70' constructions of a non-remodeled hotel. The bath room amenities are sparce and low quality - Hyatt Place or any equivalent 3* hotel provides way superior products. Upon check-out, I had to argue to receive the package I had originally paid for and I was told that they had a misprint and they could not state all exclusions ? I find it disappointing that only after insisting and talking to the manager they reluctantly agreed to honor the package they had sold to me - all in all, nothing to be considered for future stays. There are plenty of great hotels in convenient walking distance downtown CHICAGO in the same price range.

Expected a much higher end clientele (or at least, higher end "looking" clientele. Sometimes felt we were at a Holiday Inn or some such hotel instead of a high end property. Nothing average about the prices, however. Hotel is spottily maintained and often floors are dirty; rooms are clean but tired looking. Walking around you would pass sloppily dressed individuals with poorly supervised kids. The girl at the pool activities desk told me to return the towels at the end of the day; I informed her that for > $900/night (for the Napua tower room) the staff could get the towels themselves. Smoking allowed at the pool despite almost every other lounge chair occupied by a child. Hotel has a rule that you are not allowed to claim lounge chairs which is ludicrous; eveyone does it. Cabanas are $200 /day and for that you are given a map as to it's location; no personal escort by a staff member. Complaints are endured by the staff but don't appear to be taken too seriously. Pool staff looks bored and un-interested; concierge staff is hit and miss as to the type of help and info you will get. Beach was beautiful; you get your own chairs and non one bothers you. Pools/water slide system, giving credit to the the hotel, were clean, considering the vast number of users. Saw a staff individual at the coffee shop mixing salad with her bare fingers. My daughter slipped on a marble stairway going to the ballroom (it was wet) and almost seriously injured herself. Staff did nothing after I informed them of the incident. If you want personalized, "customer comes first" attitude, with a high class, spotless environment, stay at the Four Season next door.

My husband and I came to Chicago on a little extended vacation in the area and I have to say that the hotel at first glance is very nice, but then you get down to it the nitty gritty. The room had a comfortable bed and the staff at the front desk were very kind and accommodating - those are the pros. The water pressure in the shower is awful with variances in temperature throughout the entire 5 minute shower. I mean it will get freezing cold and hot again within 15 seconds without you bothering to touch the knob. The wall paper in the room was peeling in several places and the room extremely dusty (top of furniture, etc.) The halls are very hot and stuffy (we were there while it was cool outside) and the elevators take what seems like ages to get to you - not to mention how small they are. All in all, thank goodness the hotel was inexpensive but I would not recommend staying here to anyone. After all, you do indeed get what you pay for.

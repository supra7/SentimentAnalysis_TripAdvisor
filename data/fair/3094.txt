I'm a platinum starwood member so frequently stay at Westins and other Starwood properties. I was expecting much more but this was probably my most disappointing Westin experience. We had a corner suite with amazing views but the room was run down - I've been told the renovations are beginning Sept '07. Furniture was beat-up / broken, dusty, bedding smelled like bad body order (had housekeeping replace blanket/comforter immediately), high-speed internet hardly worked, shower was as small as a cruise ship with no shelf for products (shampoo bottle on the floor but I believe regular rooms have a shower/tub and not the separate stand straight shower). Check-in was 2-hours late and only after multiple visits to the platinum check-in desk - no call on my mobile as promised. The concierge attempts to get you into a timeshare demonstration after helping you with your reservations/activities. If you want a relaxing Hawaii vacation you probably don't want to stay in the crowded, over developed Kaanapali area. Lastly, the $20 resort fee which pays for the non-working internet, access to the healthclub/steam/sauna (included as a platinum anyway) and parking does not even include chairs at the beach.

My husband and I were coming in to Boston for a wedding and decided to splurge. We did book through Priceline. The staff were all wonderful etc. and our room was small but acceptable, on the 9th floor which,again, was fine. We met our son for dinner and came back to the room to go to bed. The bed was as hard as a rock. We did not sleep...I became so desperate that I lined up the pillows and tried it that way. I guess in hindsight I should have called to see if they had another bed option. My suggestion would be to lie in the bed first and see before going out to enjoy the city. I can't remember having been so uncomfortable.

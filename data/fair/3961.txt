Old Charmer has character I stayed at the Andrews Hotel from 5/18 to 5/22/06. This older boutique type charmer has character. I stayed in Room 406, a comfy queen. The buffet breakfast was a nice treat in the mornings and very convienient. Also ate at Fino's, a nice Italian restaurant.My only complaint about the hotel was probably due to a lack of communication. I could not get the shower to work. I was informed after my stay that instructions are being formatted for the guest rooms. Apparently, you have to pull down on the faucet ring to engage the shower. I reported my shower as inoperable but no one got back to me about it.Why?

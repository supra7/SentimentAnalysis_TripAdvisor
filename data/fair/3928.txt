My friend and I have tried several hotels in SF and were excited to try the Diva because of its alluring website and some of the good reviews on this site. As compared to other hotels in this price range I would say the Diva falls short. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that we had been upgraded. We had reserved a double but instead got one king bed. This was corrected by a discount from $219 to $149 and a cot. Honestly, I think that the room we got and the overall ambiance of the hotel would warrant prices in the $90-$129 range. Our room was smallish with a tiny, tiny bathroom. It smelled of cigarette smoke although we were on a non-smoking floor. We found the front desk personnel stiff and slow. It seemed to take forever to make our adjustment. The beds were comfortable. Our room faced Geary and was very noisy all night. Heard lots of ambulances/traffic until about 2 a.m. One nice touch was the Colobri Mexican restaurant next door. We enjoyed margaritas and guacamole and chatting with the bartender. All in all, if the hotel price had been cheaper and we had gotten what we reserved we would have been satisfied. We've decided not to return.

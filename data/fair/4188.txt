The LES Thompson needs to decide if it wants to be a club or a hotel. We stayed here for 5 nights. During the week everything was great but on the weekend the club kicked off and we could not get to sleep until after 3am in the morning. We were on the 10 floor and thought the noise would not affect us because the club was on a much lower floor, but we were wrong. If it wants to be club - I would give the sound system 5 stars - but unfortunately we thought we were checking into a hotel. We loved the neighborhood (surrounded by unique shops and restaurants), the rooms were sleek and modern, the staff were all really nice and the rate was great for NY. For the first few days we had thought we had found a gem - but then the weekend came.

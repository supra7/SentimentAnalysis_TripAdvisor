I slipped and fell in the shower. There were no handrails and I hit my head really hard, sprained or broke my finger, and banged up my knee. I talked to someone at Hyatt Corporate Affairs. She said she left a message for the General Manager at the Hyatt Place Park Center who would call me back the following Monday. I never heard back from anyone. I am afraid someone is going to get hurt badly before they take their unsafe showers serious.

Recently (July 2011) for two weeks. Our room had 2 double beds which was ok for us and our two children however there was one half size wardrobe and two large drawers which is no where near enough for a two week stay. I asked if there was a room available with more space however they had nothing. The toilet/shower room (no bath) was very small. The room was cleaned daily however the carpet was stained and the window was cracked with tape on it. The small pool was good and the staff were helpful and friendly.

If you come to this hotel BEWARE of the rude, arrogant staff. The front desk personnel is very rude especially ALEX. Several occassions I had problems with my room (the toilet) and went to the front desk. (Alex asked me what did I do to the toilet. He claimed each time I reported it they came and fixed it. I am sorry but I don't destroy others property! I was in shock to be accussed.) They acted like you were bothering them when you expected them to help you. The nerve of me to ask them for help! My sister and I stayed there for 7 nights. On the 4th day, our toilet clogged up. It took me three days of complaining before the lady in charge of maintenance came to our room and told us that we should have called her department to report it. Who knew that telling the front desk was not the good option? Anyway, the night before we were to leave, she came up with the solution to leave the plunger in our room for us to use in case it clogged up again. SERIOUSLY, I AM PAYING GOOD MONEY TO HAVE TO PLUNGE MY OWN TOILET?? I would have put up a big fight except for the fact that we were checking out the next morning. THANK GOODNESS! Needless to say, it got old and smelly having to put up with a broken toilet for those last days and nights. I wrote a personal email to Mr. Hunter's email and after a week, still have not gotten any type of reply. It makes me feel as though he does not believe the horrible experience that we had. I visit NY twice a year and decided to try this hotel this time. I must say that I have never been treated this way by any other hotel in NY. If you are expecting good service from this hotel, you are warned. They do not know what good service is. They should also give their front desk staff training in customer relations as they certainly do need it!!

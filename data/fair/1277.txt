I travel every few months for business and am always looking for a hotel that's comfortable, clean, interesting (no Monet prints on the walls please) with a decent level of service at a reasonable price. When I traveled to Montreal recently, I was excited to stay at the new W concept - Aloft - which seems like a cheaper version of the W experience. Yes. and No. Bliss amenities are nice. Beds are comfortable enough, and the general atmosphere of the lobby is good. But here's the downside - the "loft" concept means lots of hard surfaces and high ceilings - resulting in a loud hotel room that honestly feels more like a combination dorm room/cheap Ikea knockoff. Service is reasonable, but unlike other hotels of the same ilk, offers a very limited menu. The hotel also does not have a business center, which posed a bit of a problem when I needed to print out a presentation (the woman at the front desk offered to print it for me if I emailed it to her, but the size of my presentation did not allow for it). And the springlike pillows (and general hotel noise) ensured a poor night's sleep. So, for the general Aloft concept - I'm not a fan. I could probably get beyond that if this specific hotel was exceptional in service or cleanliness, but the wear and tear of this place was surprising, given the age of the hotel. My room had stained and torn carpets, walls full of dings and dents, torn furniture and the housekeepers' hair on the counters. For the money, I think you can get a bigger and better experience in a Hyatt Place or in a newer Courtyard. All in all, I think I'll be looking for another place to stay on my next business trip to Montreal.

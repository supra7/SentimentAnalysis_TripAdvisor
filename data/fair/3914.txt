Pros: - Good location - Good service Cons: - Mediocre decor. Not what I expected from a hotel describing itself as "boutique". Using an old dirty metal file cabinet as a dresser, even one with wooden top glued on, does not say "boutique" to me, it says "cheap" (see pictures) - Not very clean, well kept. Mold in the shower. Paint peeling (see pictures) All in all I would recommend to stay at this hotel only if it was a very good deal ($100 or preferably less per night) and the location was very desirable. Dirty and cheap in my mind trump hip and sexy every time.

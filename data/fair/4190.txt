This is the third time we've stayed at this hotel because its close to my husbands office. After this trip, we've sworn to never stay here again. For the price you are paying, the stay is incredibly AVERAGE in all regards, and has been frustrating more than a few times. The rooms are relatively clean (aside from the dingy rugs and the smell of mildew in the bathroom) and the door men are absolutely fantastic and helpful. The door men are actually the best thing about this place. It seems like everyone else is either absent minded or just not paying attention. Housekeeping has not cleaned the room once when we've requested service. The restaurant (and therefore room service) is only open for part of the day and closed two days of the week. There have been at least 4 occasions that I can easily recall when people come knocking at the door for turn-down service or some other unnecessary interruption when the DO NOT DISTURB sign is on the door. The concierge doesn't seem to really know the area and could not recommend any decent restaurants on the days when their restaurant was closed. Our stay has been over a week this trip and its been ample time to get a good idea about this hotel, and it has definitely gone down hill. The pool area is completely taken over by non-guests all weekend long so that there was never once an open seat available. It was more like a pool in Cabo during Spring Break with 2 to 3 people per lounge chair. Our room is over $500/night. For that price, there are FAR better places to stay.

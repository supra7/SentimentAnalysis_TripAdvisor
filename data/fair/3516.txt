Stayed for one night last week in a 12th floor suite. Not great: Due to low ceilings, the first impression is that the room seemed very small. Also, the room was dark, even with all the lights on. The carpet, furniture, paint, etc. was tired and worn. Bathroom is small (one person at a time please!). One of the elevators was broken, so wait times were long. I didn't appreciate the Penthouse magazine (I'm not sure if it was left behind or put there on purpose); please just stick with Timeout magazine. Not horrible: I had a great meal via room service. Was met at the entrance by a bellman who helped me with my bag. Desk staff was friendly. The bed was very comfortable (although it is only a double...I cannot imagine two adults sleeping comfortably in it). Molton Brown bath products. Location is great. I would not recommend this hotel, unless the location is absolutely perfect for you or you get a great price.

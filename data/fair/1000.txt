Frommer's writes that this hotel has plenty of old-style charm. The hotel itself is dubbed "The Most Hawaiian Hotel in Maui." But when we showed up for our honeymoon, we found a dirty motel with no charm and about as much Hawaii as Econolodge in Anywhere, USA. The beds were hard and springy- the bathroom scummy and old. There was nothing romantic about this hotel. If you're looking to save some cash and you have a family, it's not a bad stay. But don't expect too much. After one night at the hotel, we left for the Hyatt, a few blocks down. It was only $100 more a night, and was beautiful, romantic and luxurious.

First time I stayed in this hotel was 20yrs ago...thought it was truly paradise. This time was a much different hotel. Stayed in an ocean side bottom level for the view,however,the view was behind some shrubbery so couldn't see much. The room was very musty and the linens smelled stale. The water in the shower never got beyond warm and with the air-conditioner running..water droplets stayed on the bathroom ceiling for quite some time. The free show was also disappointing as they seemed somewhat bored and tended to cater to the elderly people who went to bed at 9. They used to have a fantastic hula show and cook-out with wonderful music and flowers in pots surrounding the area. No flowers to speak of as well.. The show was over at 9 and the Tiki Bar closed around 9 or 10. So that left us with not much to do except to visit the other hotels. Where did paradise go? Won't be back!

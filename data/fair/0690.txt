I booked for 3 nights over the internet, having been very satisfied with Quality Inns other places. This one did not live up to those standards. The room was clean, the lobby attractive, the staff friendly, but the physical condition of much of the building leaves a lot to be desired. The hallways stink and the carpet is filthy! It was so bad that the smell carried into the room; I walked down to 7-11 to get some room deodorizer to cut through it. With a generous amount of that, then leaving the window open, it finally got better by the next morning. No elevators. Lots of physical upgrades needed. The front desk person told me that since they were an airport hotel the standards are lower for Quality Inn there. Ouch!! I've always known what to expect at Quality Inn, but this one has me doubting I'll ever take a chance again!

We were in town for the Arizona R&R Marathon. This hotel is centrally located in downtown and the price was decent. And, this attracted some rude customers. There were two disturbances outside our room in the wee hours of the morning and I felt unsafe. Security arrived after the muckrakers left. Not good right before a 26.2 run. The room was small but the bathroom was clean and functional. The Wi-Fi and TV worked adequately. However, everything was just crammed in - desk, chair, TV chest, etc. Beer or something was spilled in the elevator (wood flooring) and it was not cleaned in a timely manner. The staff was friendly enough but the desk folks did not seemed too concerned for the customers experience. The parking situation was "as advertised" but made the overall value drop even lower. Fortunately, Saturday night after 8pm is free downtown street parking. We were able to park 100 yards away. The property is adjacent to a pub with outdoor seating and it also has street seating. The funny thing is that in the evening, the customer has to walk through smoke to get to the non-smoking premises. I will not be staying there again.

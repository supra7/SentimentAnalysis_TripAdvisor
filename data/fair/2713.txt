I loved your hotel it was very clean and very nice however we were very tired when we checked in at 11:21 pm which would have been 1:21AM our home time. When I reserved the room through my travel agent he requested that we have a crib for my grandson. When we arrived and checked in I asked if there was a crib in our room the lady said no but she would get me one as soon as her driver of the shuttle come back which would be about 15-20 minutes I told her that would be fine we would give my grandson a bath then he would use the crib. 30 minutes went by and I had looked out the window and seen the shuttle was back I called down to the front desk she again said no the shuttle hadn't been back yet and she would get it soon. 20 minutes later I walked out to my car and seen that the shuttle was there when I was going back into the hotel the shuttle was leaving so I had thought the crib was in the room when I got back to the room still no crib. I counted the shuttlle being back at the hotel 4 diffrernt times and still no crib. 1:30am I called to the front desk and asked I am going to get a crib she said yes mam as soon as the shuttle comes back I told her it had been back 4 times and my grandson is tired and so are we could I please get the crib. My son in law looked out the window and the shuttle was in front of the hotel I called down again she said I am sorry mam but I can't find one by then it was almost 2am I said thank you so much for getting me this crib in 20minutes I was very upset my grandson ended up sleeping on the floor what a nice start to a wonderful vacation. If she didn't have one she could of told me right away.

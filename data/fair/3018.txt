My husband and I are here right now, just checked in. We're here for our 3rd anniversary - were supposed to have 1 king bed.. well the room we're in (716 in the beach tower) has 2 small beds, and on top of that the room is not clean! Um I thought we were going to see a major difference in room cleanliness and guest services than our normal hotel of choice (Kaanapali Shores) - but looks like we should have just stayed there!! :( SOOO Dissapointed. Called the front desk and they gave me the whole "We don't guarantee what you request" - UM WE ARE ON OUR ANNIVERSARY and now looks like we have to squeeze on one small bed. She then told us that they are all sold out and she can't move us to a new room... yea right! They promised to move us tomorrow - but this blows, our first night on the beautiful island of maui and it starts like this. Westin I had spoken so highy of you before. Not good. Gave two stars because they have free pulmeria flowers in the Lobby... OH - and let's not forget that cleanliness thing - i can wipe my finger over the night stand and see my streak through the dust...the bed spread has brownish red stains on it too... don't want to know what that's from!!! :(

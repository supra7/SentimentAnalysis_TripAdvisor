Haven't stayed at the Westin in about 7 years until this March. Got an oceanview room on the 9th floor with a very good view. At first you don't notice much except that view but as the days went on the place really starts showing it's age. The room was actually filthy. Everything needs replacing. There is no closet, some sort of tv cabinet with 2 drawers and a few hangers, very sad when you are paying that kind of money. The "bathroom" - so small and the floor has some real grime when you get on your hands and knees and take a look (that was when we were looking for a dropped earring!) There is a tiny refrigerator you are lucky to get 2 bottles of water in. The pools are missing tiles, it's very noticable. They charge a resort fee then another fee for beach chairs and then they tax it all. I don't mind paying for any of it but the maintenance needs to be addressed. ALL they care about is selling their timeshares or villas or whatever. We lasted 4 nights and were ready to leave before the entire room closed in on us. We are Starwood Preferred customers and they did nothing extra. Then we asked for an extra hour late checkout and they said NO. We weren't surprised. There is no warm feeling in that hotel. What a shame. Perfect location and beach.

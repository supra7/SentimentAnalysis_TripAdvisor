The Aloaloa lounge is the brightest lounge on the planet, way too open, no concept of space utilization to create a place to meet, drink, etc....Drinks were below average but when paying Ritz Carlton prices they were awful. The musician setup was poor, acoustics poor. Service was pretentious. Not a place to go for a good drink or good time on Maui. Both the bar and sushi bar were practically empty on a Friday night, which was probably not a new occurrence. Star struck guests will continue to give high ratings solely due to the name, but rest assured any traveler with standards would consider this resort overpriced, stuffy and unimpressive. Not recommended.

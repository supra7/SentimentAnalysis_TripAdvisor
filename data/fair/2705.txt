As a frequest traveler who prefers to stay in Hilton brand hotels, this is perhaps the most disappointing property I've been to. I'm not one who typically writes bad reviews, but the entire hotel is poorly lit and is way past it's prime. It appears they may be just starting to begin some room renovations whch are desperately needed. The heating unit in my room was the loudest I've ever heard- louder than those window-type A/C units and the heater wasn't even that style- it was a central heating unit that rattled and vibrated all night long. The bathroom was tiny, but the rooms were larger than a lot of the other Embassy Suites I've been to which was a bonus. The very worst thing about my stay was the room next to me had their refrigerator die out on them causing a horrible burnt stench for my entire overnight stay and into the next morning. The fitness center is about the size of a walk in closet at best. The only thing this hotel has going for it is a very friendly staff.

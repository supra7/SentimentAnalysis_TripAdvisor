This Hotel had been great and we loved the location, however I kept looking for reasons to try the Fairmount W, and this trip I got the answer. We had our car brought around for a day trip, during the night Valet Parking had rooted thru my glove box, left it half cocked open with stuff hanging out. Only after the second time talking to the Valet Manager did they drop the parking fee.

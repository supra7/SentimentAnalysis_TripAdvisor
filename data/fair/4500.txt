My wife & I often stayed at this quaint little hotel in the city before the change in ownership. Since coming under the corprate umbrella of a "hospitality" company, it has lost the charm and personal service that made it so refreshing. Our last stay was marked by a reduction in quality: food service and offerings for breakfast; room not clean, old carpet, dust, etc.; lack of friendly staff. I only write now because the Petite Auberge recently sent a postcard seeking our consideration of a promotion at the property. The answer is no. We do not intend to return. Anyone who recalls the former Petite Auberge will likely have the same answer. Sadly, it's the large hotel on Union Square for us now.

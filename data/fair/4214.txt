The dream of the founders of the Dunes Manor Hotel would be disheartend to see its tired, worn condition today. While there are a few pleasant features to the hotel, such as the rockers on the porch, the nice restaurant, and the hotel's convenient location, the rooms leave much to be desired. The housekeeping staff obviously does its best to keep the rooms neat. But years of use with no investment in upkeep has resulted in rusting edges, fixtures encrusted with hard water stains, tubs yellowed with time and use and embedded dirt throughout. The room was damp and musty, even though the airconditioning worked continuously, it could not get rid of the dampness. It was an uncomfortable stay that I would not recommend. Surely there is a better caliber of hotel in Ocean City. This vacation was not a delight!

How about for starters,I was getting married in Vegas and was suppose to be upgraded to a larger suite with a centurion upgrade.The Mgr told me to wait a day because they were booked and then they will have something available.I did.I waited until 5PM the next day unchecked in my current room only to be upgraded to a handicap room on a much lower floor (no view) that they assured me was a beautiful parlor suite.It looked like a room from my worst nightmare at $368.00.I declined the room and checked into original suite.The suite could not accomodate both my clothes and my soon to be wife's clothes for 5 days.To make up for us wasting a day they sent chocolate which I sent back.Give me a break.I expected them to take off the 1 day room stay that we did not use and they then offered me a $10.00 bottle of champagne.Told them where to put it.I called before my arrival to see if they had a computer center to go online for my business.They assured me they did but when I arrived they told me it was closed.They had no computers anywhere to use except a Kiosk in the Wynn hotel.When my wife was waiting for me at the kiosk computer ,security came over to my wife and told her not to stand where she was in case someone wanted to use the phone.I told him what he needed to hear as well.DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL. PS try $27.00 for a pot of coffee (room Service)When I get [--] I like to enjoy it.

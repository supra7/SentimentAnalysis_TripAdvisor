Stay at the Clift? I don't think so We stayed for a few nights after a disastrous time down the road at the Adagio. We were greeted by a receptionist who just wasn't really interested. We stayed on the 4th floor with the Guiness Book of Records smallest bathroom but once you got over that the room was nice enough. We went to bed that night and had the worst nights sleep. The noise was unbelivable! from other guests and security knocking on doors. It seems no sooner had we drifted off then the prompt 'Room Service' started. We thought that becuase this was a Saturday night it was going to be a one off but unfortunately this appeared to be the way things were throughout our stay.In addition the redwood bar requires reservations if you would like to sit down in it. We didn't have one as paying guests were offered to sit outside the bar in the reception area with the draft from the front door as company. Come on!

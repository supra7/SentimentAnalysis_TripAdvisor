The location was fine. But the fold out sofa and the cots were THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. I am not a high maintenance traveler; but these mattresses were so uncomfortable, even our 6 and 7 year old kids couldn't sleep on them. Literally, you could take the mattress and squeeze with your hands and it compressed down to about 1/16th of an inch. We asked that something be done, and they brought up another cot and a bottle of champagne. The new cot was exactly the same. I'd say that the rooms are fine if you only get a single room. But don't expect to sleep on the cots or fold out sofas. Hate to speak poorly of the hotel because they did make some effort to satisfy us. But keeping those beds is a tremendous disservice to guests.

My family and I decided to take a trip to Hawaii and wanted to spend a few days in Maui, we had been to the island years before and had stayed elsewhere but had heard great things and decided to stay at The Grand Wailea. To be frank for the price the resort charges for everything (room rates to cans of soda), the experience was not worthwhile by any means. The property itself was beautiful and the facilities well maintained, however the service was sub par at best with the exceptions of any restaurant/bar staff and valet/bell-service. I will say the food at Humuhumunukunukuapua'a was fantastic and the bar menu stellar. I went to the spa for a massage which was a very positive experience- the baths were great and so was the service. I wasnt impressed with the salon services though (mani/pedi and a blowout), the staff was apathetic and what they charged did not reflect their skill-set. The fitness center and shops were top notch. The most disappointing aspect of the trip was the treatment we received from the front reception- we were placed next to a room with several children who were extremely loud and messy (things left in front of our door etc) and after calling the front desk several times to have the situation remedied, we were essentially ignored. Without any follow-ups, apologies of even the option of changing rooms (the hotel was not at full capacity). For the amount of money spent I would have done one of two things: spent more money and stayed at the Ritz Carlton or stayed someplace cheaper and received the same service.

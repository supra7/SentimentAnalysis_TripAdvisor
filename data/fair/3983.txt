Underwhelming; No Reason To Stay Here Again Stayed at the Clift Hotel for an onsite wedding. Two night stay.Overall, a pretty underwhelming experience. As expected, the room and bathroom were small. Bathroom had very little countertop space and the shower pressure was uneven. The room had limited space beyond the king sized bed. The modern design just felt dated. Bed was comfortable though. Below average number of TV channels. Noise was a problem. We could hear music from our room both nights. Also, didn't like having to present our key to get in to the hotel itself at night. The bar was packed - we wanted to hang out there, but decided to skip it. BTW - we did get a couple free cocktail coupons at check-in.In summary, a pretty dated hotel that fails to be hip. I wouldn't stay here again unless I had to. Prefer the St. Regis or Four Seasons for sure.

We just got back from the Kensington Park Hotel and were completely disappointed. We booked a Royal Court double double at $249/night. I noticed on this site that others paid far less than this and I'm not sure where they found their deals...hmmm. Nevertheless, they unexpectedly "upgraded" us to a Deluxe double double when we got there. Oh goody! Except that the room was on a lower floor with less expensive rooms and without the amenities that were promised. It was a corner unit (I suppose to make up for the inferior room). The furnishings were well worn, large scratches on the walls and furnishings and the carpet was dirty. I can overlook some things but the bathroom really put us over the top; it was dated, dingy, and poorly finished with a moldy shower! The next morning I complained to the front desk clerk who was not able to tell me the amenities offered for their better rooms (amenities that we paid for), compared to the Deluxe rooms. I spoke with the manager who admitted that we were placed in an inferior room, that they were completely full the previous night, and that we should be happy because the room had 2 windows! We booked this reservation 3 months ago when they had many rooms available. Why should we suffer because the hotel filled up?? After much discussion, she reluctantly took $30 off the bill. We will never stay here again. We stay in SF frequently and ALWAYS try to book at one of the Kimpton Hotels. This time we were unable to to find a room at one of our favorites (not sure why), the Hotel Monaco. They have far better rooms with wonderful amenities and very professional staff. We didn't find this to be true at the Kensington Park. A word of caution. Be sure to look at the room before agreeing to inhabit it.

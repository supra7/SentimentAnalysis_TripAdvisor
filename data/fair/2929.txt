Napili Kai has a policy of making no refunds over the holidays. I think this is reasonable except that they make no exceptions, even when they are able to rent the room back out - even if you call just 24 hours after making the reservation to cancel it. We booked two rooms at Christmas, calling just 2 days before we wanted to stay there. The next day we realized our parents couldn't make it so we cancelled one of the rooms. They told us it was non-refundable meaning we were out approximately $1,500. The bad part was at check-in time our room wasn't ready. We asked to use the other room (that we were paying for) and they said they had rented it out to someone else. The clerk at the desk said we should ask reservations about getting a refund. I kept calling them and got transferred to voice-mail with no return call until my third message. They still wouldn't give me an answer and promised to call the following week. Still no call until two weeks later when they just said "no", with no apology. I told them I thought the policy was unfair and that we probably wouldn't come back. The office manager just made an annoying "uh huuuuh" sound, and that was it. We won't go back and would recommend you go somewhere else, too. Their policy comes off as greedy, and their customer service was slow, unresponsive and unapologetic.

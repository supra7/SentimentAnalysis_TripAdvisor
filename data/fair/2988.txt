We arrived at The Whaler on Christmas Eve, keep in mind we made our reservations 10 months ago. We were first given a room in Tower 2-ocean front, which was great, except for the next 9 days we would not be able to open our patio door or go outside on the balcony due to the construction. Who wants to spend 9 days in Hawaii without opening a door or stepping outside on your balcony. Back to the front desk. Was then put in Tower 1 but only could stay in this room for 2 nights and then we would have to move. Our view was of construction and had sugar ants in the kitchen when we moved in. We were told at the front desk this was normal. On the 3rd day was moved to another room. We did get a $100 restaurant gift certificate for all the inconveniences. Parking was always an issue, most of the week we had to park at the outside parking lot and walk. Don't count on a beach towel, 2 days there were no towels by 10 in the morning. Housekeeping was just okay, always had to ask for more towels. Location is great though. Overall I am not sure I would recommend this facility, we had to spend 3 days of our vacation getting issues resolved and everything that could have gone wrong did. We overheard many upset individuals due to the construction. We were told construction was suppose to be done the first part of December. It was just a disappointing experience for our first trip to Hawaii especially since we had been planning it for so long.

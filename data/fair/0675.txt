Our friend's Honda was stolen out of the "secure" $18. per day lot. My Buick had the front window broken out and my sister's Volvo was ransacked. It was a rotten experience. The only positive thing was the security guards helped sweep glass out of the car and had duct tape and plastic bags available for taping up broken windows. The valets were always available to show drivers stuck at the exit gate how to operate the confusing parking ticket machine that seemingly only function was to assure that the $18 fee was collected prior to exiting the lot.

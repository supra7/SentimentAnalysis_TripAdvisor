On the face of it, this hotel represents probably the best value that you will get from a hotel in Boston. Location is second to none, hotel appears to be in top notch condition. However, this hotel is a historically listed building - in other words, it's old!! The appearance would dictate otherwise. But what many, including ourselves, failed to realise is that such old buildings have paper thin walls. Which is why, at 3.30a.m (after being in bed for almost 2 hours), I am writing this review! You can hear kids crying next door, doors slamming, toilets flushing, full blown conversations, the windows don't close - the emergency services sirens throughout the city make for some additional distractions!!! In all honesty though, if you are drunk enough that you can fall asleep through all of that, you're laughing. If not, like most, avoid this place. The Radisson and numerous other hotels are on the same block. My advice, pay that little but extra. Trust me, you won't regret it!!

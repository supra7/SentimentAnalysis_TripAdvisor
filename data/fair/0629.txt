Woman at counter was great. Man was rude and insisted that I had to pay more - that I had not reserved a 2 bed room. When he realized his mistake he still insisted that I had to pay for the room - but I had prepaid. Did not check his computer, kept insisting I was wrong, was not apologetic. Room was old, tv really old, location not great.

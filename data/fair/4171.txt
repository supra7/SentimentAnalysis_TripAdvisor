We have stayed at the SeaTac Red Lion many times over the years because it is so convenient for early departures and Master Park parking. Recently we arrived after a long flight, and we're put into room 129. I wanted to change rooms immediately, but we were so tired we just stayed. The carpet was stained, the furniture was stained, the bathroom floor was ice cold, and the door around the lock looked like it had been jimmied from the inside. When we checked out the desk clerk didn't even ask if everything was ok. Avoid room 129. It would be nice when you have a repeat customer you give them the BEST room available. I many re- think my choice for my next visit to Sea Tac Red Lion!

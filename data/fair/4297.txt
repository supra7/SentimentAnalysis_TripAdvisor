Don't bother asking for early check in, because early check in means, checking in later than the other guests. Rooms are not ready, and housekeeping does not communicate with front desk staff. Room first had no towels and we had to basically beg to have towels brought up so we could shower after waiting over 5 hours for our room to be ready. Towels and sheets are stained and torn and still used on for service. There is no one obvisiously doing room inspections, for cleanlieness and supplies. Besides torn to shred towels and ripped sheets, the carpets were not vacuumed, I had dropped dirt purposely and it was never cleaned up in a week, and previous guest items were found in the corners and under the beds. The one star if for the size of the rooms, which are effiencienes and they are large, but since we had no heat during the day nor a/c, we had to turn on the gas oven to heat the room on cold days and open the windows on hot days. The maid would leave the windows open on cold days after cleaning,and the room would be an ice box when we returned. It seemed that few cared about guest services, the remote control didn't work, and it was hard getting elevators at times. Calling the desk and housekeeping was hard, since the numbers on the phone were incorrect, and the only correct numbers were on the key card case they gave you upon checkin. It is a shame that such a great location, cold tolerate such poor service. The only response I got from management was a emailed letter saying how sorry they were for my experience, and hoped I would come back again. I said I would not, and they never responded again. Obviously they really don't care and don't need the tourist business, since they get a lot of the guests from the UN. I was recommneded this hotel by a friends whose corporation used this facility and I hope they move their business to another establishment.

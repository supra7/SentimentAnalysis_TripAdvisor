location is fantastic : good things are starbucks and japanese ramen shop next door. Price : too expensive. not worth it... Room : poor quatlity Bed : extremely very good Flooring : creek and crack/ cheap carpet bathroom : tiny but ok Service : standard, don't expect too much. we were asked to pick up the ice bucket ourselves . Gym : small but good enough for a certain work out ! it is what i like a lot here My friend mentioned to everyone that she was staying at the B&B in San Francisco... I emailed the staff about out room and requirement, the answer was given but not so clear ( ambiguous answer). our extra bedroom is actually the living room... but at least the total size is not that bad...

This hotel is as you expect for how much you pay for. We went to Japanese restaurant which offered only Buffet or Sushi bar. My husband is not so crazy about sushi, so we picked the buffet. For $54 they offered so little. Sashimi quality was good, but the rest were just like regular Chinese food. A big dissappointment for a restaurant in such a good hotel.

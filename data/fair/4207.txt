Everything others are saying is true: the hotel is old, the TV hasn't been updated since 1993, and the AC's off or on settings were annoying. I'm used to air conditioning that kicks on when it needs to cool the room, not runs until you manually turn it off. However, I'd like to add my biggest complaint: THERE WAS NO WATER IN THIS HOTEL. Sure, there are plenty of vending machines that claim they sell water, but they were all sold out, several ate my money, and when I went to the front desk to complain, she refunded my money (after I completed a form) and suggested I either enjoy the tiny cups of ice water available in the lobby OR walk to the 7-11 several blocks away and buy my own. It's summer and I'm pregnant, which means I drink about 80+ ounces of water EACH DAY, and refilling my 6 ounce cup in the lobby was not going to cut it. She was "nice" enough to negotiate the rate of the bartender's supply from $2.95 to $1.50 (which is still HIGHER than the vending machines I was willing to purchase from had any of them worked). I felt she should have given me at least 1 complimentary bottle of water for my troubles, but apparently that cost wasn't built in to the $260 per night we paid for the room.

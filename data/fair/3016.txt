At first you think this is it! They have an incredible pool, a famed spa and a marketing presence that makes you drool with anticipation. Then you get there and the hotel is full of Grouponesque guests who are rude and obnoxious...and we haven't even checked into our room yet. The room was very small, but hey it's a room and we're not living there right? The shower was full of hair (stuck to the wall and faucet) and some kind of goo build up around the edges of the tub (icky!!). We had to have the bathroom cleaned again before we could shower it was so gross. But wait it gets better...The sheets on one of the beds had not been changed before our stay and sadly something we discovered the next morning when I realized my son had slept in blood (YES BLOOD) stained sheets that hadn't been washed. We were sooo tired and had the lights down low when he went to bed, we could not see the spots (Now I check the bedding very closely before letting myself or my family get in a hotel bed). Then I went to make some coffee and there were pubic hairs (at least that's what they looked like) in the coffee pot. That was it...we left immediately and moved to another hotel. For what the Westin Maui charges we expected a far better and cleaner experience. There are much better options (even the cheap hotels are mainted better) on Kaanapali beach. This hotel is gross and should be avoided unless you prefer filth and trashy fellow guests.

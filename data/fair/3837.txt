We stayed there for a week. The people were nice, but the room wasn't clean enough. There was candy left on the floor when we arrived. The room itself didn't have any windows! The bedroom had two windows that looked at the wall of the next building. The nicest feature of the hotel was the roof which had chairs and a lovely view. We wouldn't choose to stay there again.

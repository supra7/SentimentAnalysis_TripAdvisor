I was hesitant to stay at this hotel due primarily to the mixed reviews...I should have followed my instinct. The front desk was nice and pleasant enough although our room was not ready at the check-in time due to a late check-out in the room we were originally assigned to. When we finally got to check in (not the room they originally had blocked for us for obvious reasons) we found it to be nothing spectacular. There was a beautiful view of the Space Needle (which we paid additional for) however the rooms were dated and not the cleanest. The rooms were obviously well used with stains on the furniture and bedspread. The bathrooms were small and funky...a suspended ceiling in the bathroom with stained ceiling tiles...I am 5'3" and I could have easily touched the ceiling. I am in the hotel business and we have a saying...your hotel can be tired or old, but this is not an excuse for dirty. We purchased our room through Expedia and honestly there were other hotels that were more upscale than the Warwick at lower prices.

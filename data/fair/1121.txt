1. They charge 15$ per room to use the swimming pool "THE RESORT" 2. They charge 13$ per minute, incoming and outgoing calls to California. I was charge 91$ for seven 5 seconds call. 3. My wife's foot got slammed by the swimming pool door, when she asked for a tylenol. They said no. (they didn't want to be held raliable) 4. Last but not least, with no Casino in the hotel, its just too quiet for a stay in Vegas. Its also a good 15 minute walk to get to the middle of the las vegas strip

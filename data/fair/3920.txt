The hotel looks great on the website but once past the reception area the place looks a bit cheap and smells slightly damp. It's also a bit too dark and dingy. The location is handy for exploring San Francisco, however be careful if returning after dusk with younger children as there are numerous aggressive beggers in the vicinity, some of whom followed us into diners and shops etc. There was also fairly loud music playing ALL night somewhere in the hotel or maybe from a nearby establishment, so loud even earplugs wouldn't drown it out. Quite expensive for what it was, I wouldn't recommend it.

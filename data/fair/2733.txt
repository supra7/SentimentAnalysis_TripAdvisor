The only positive at Backstage Hotel Amsterdam was its location (it's just a short walk from Leidseplein, the square with the bars). But location in Amsterdam is a relative thing, as we discovered after renting bikes; you can easily move around the city with them: fast, cheap, green and fun way to discover the city. Unforunatley, I can't say anything positive other then that about this hostel-like hotel. The bathroom door was broken, the floor looked really dirty and used, as the rest of place. Wouldn't stay here again....

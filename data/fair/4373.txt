We have been to many great boutique hotels that are reasonably priced. Based on the website, we thought this would be no different. Unfortunately, our actual hotel experience didn't match the nicely put-together website. The room was small, the bathroom even smaller. There were little to no amenities. Several things inside the room were broken (IPod dock, remote control). The staff was less than helpful and not experienced. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone.

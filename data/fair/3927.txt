Overall a disappointing stay. Liked: big room (upgraded king) so-so rate 189$/night cool welcome pack funky reception area Disliked: small small bathroom (you can use the toilet and sink at one sitting; terrible considering the bedroom was so large!, poor quality) upgraded hotel, but rooms still have very old feel, floor boards creaked air conditioning unit very old, noisey and not working properly TV and reception terrible) We ended up checking out after 1 night and into the Westin St. Francis just down the street, 30$ more per night, but leaps and bounds better than the Diva.

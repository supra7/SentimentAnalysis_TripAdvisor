Construction and steep stairs proved somewhat problematic, but friendly staff members helped with luggage and were careful to make sure I maneuvered the steep stairs safely. Room was small but clean and comfortable. Excellent location for seeing museums and sights of interests. And the good news? You burn off all the wonderful calories you consume because you get exercise on the Hotel Smit stairs! Great staff. Would stay here again.

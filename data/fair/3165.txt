Beautiful Interior, Horrible Area, Very rude and unhelpful staff My mum and I stayed at Cova this July.I will say the rooms were lovely, brand new and very clean!Be warned about the area, Ellis St is nicknamed Crackville. We saw Dozens of people partaking in unsavoury activities day and night on the next block down from the hotel. It is very noisy and there are all sorts of goings on outside the hotel at all hours. Do not walk down Ellis St after dark, whatever you do!!The Staff do not speak very good English and are not helpful at all!When I checked out they charged me $20 for a phone call I didnt make, I had picked up the phone, dialed a number and it was engaged. They insisted on charging me for the call anyway. I was grateful we only had 4 nights there, it was more than enough!!!

You get what you (don't) pay for... This place is cheap and you get what you pay for. I don't necessarily mean that negatively.My room was postage-stamp sized. The TV was a 13 inch. The service was spotty. And I'm still pestering the management about a charge due to a problem with their online booking form.On the other hand, it's only four or five block walk from the BART. You can take the BART from the airport to the Powell Station for $4.95. The bathroom was newly remodeled.If you want to spend money on fun stuff in San Francisco and just want a place to crash, then this is your place. If you want something nice, then book somewhere else.

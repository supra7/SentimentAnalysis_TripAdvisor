False advertising  We booked our room via the hotel's own website, specifically because we wanted a package in San Francisco, that included self-parking (with in and out privileges) in a good part of town. As it turns out, we would have been better off simply booking the room via Travelocity, Orbitz, or any number of discount sites, and then finding our own nearby parking. The parking garage offered by the hotel was a long city block away on the street behind the one where the hotel is located. It is a very steep climb back to the garage! In addition, it turns out the hotel lied about the self-parking' (vs. their more expensive valet), inasmuch as the garage insists on only providing valet parking!!! Every time we wanted outrcar, it was a long, hard walk back to the garage, only to hear the complaints of the valets, and the repeated prividing of $5 tips. The room (710) was the tiniest hotel room either of us has ever seen. The queen bed takes up most of the room; the bathroom was sized for a child; water pressure in shower almost non-existent; and they still use old-fashioned metal keys which can easily be copied. The closet was about half the size of the room, but the extra closet space was useless. This tiny room and valet parking for a one night stay came to around $200 with all of the taxes added-on. Although, on the positive side, the room was clean, and the staff friendly, this was NOT worth $200; We would certainly not stay there again at that price! Also, beware...in summertime, it can get very hot in that hotel, as it was almost unbearable even with the ceiling fan --- they have no A/C in the rooms. (This is a Larkspur properties hotel.)

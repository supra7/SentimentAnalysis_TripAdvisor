Lobby is nice. Hallways are quite dingy; holes in plaster, stained carpet and bare light bulbs. Room was advertised (on website) with image showing desk, nightstands and reading lights; our room (Deluxe/$199) had none of these. There was no furniture except for a bed, nightstand, luggage rack and small TV stand. The only light in the room is a single CF lightbulb. This did not meet our expecations. We expected 'spartan' but not like this.

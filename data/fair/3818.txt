My wife's job held a conference at this resort for 3 days. Even though the suite we stayed in was paid for, I thought this was just another average 'overpriced' hotel. There was a ton of construction noise right outside of our balcony which started at 6am. We didn't even want the curtains open, because of the view we had, and the workers had! I thought about having them switch our room, but it was no money out of my pocket, so it didn't bother me so much. It's too bad there is no "all-inclusive" option at American hotels like this. Everything is so rediculously overpriced! Bottle of water $3, Bottle of Pepsi $3.50, Sun Block $15, 2 Eggs & Sausage $25! The room itself was nice, but not worth the $150/night people are paying for. The bed... very comfortable... but the same bed is available somewhere else for $70/night. Bottom line, if you don't care and have money to just burn on the every day average, you might like this place. I think a rich golfing vacationer might enjoy this place, and a rich family with any age kids who loves the water. I'm not rich, so I won't return to this place if I'm paying for it!

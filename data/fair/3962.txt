A room with a depressing view! We stayed at the Andrews for 3 nights during July in a 'cosy double' - little did we realise that 'cosy double' is a euphemism for 'tiny depressing room with no windows'! Well, in fairness, the room did have two windows, both of which looked out into the interior ventilation shaft of the building, up which we got an unpleasant whiff of cigarette smoke periodically throughout the day, despite being 6 floors up!! The room was very old fashioned with a small uncomfortable bed, the middle of which we both rolled into and met on a nightly basis! We also found it extremely noisy with very thin walls and doors - we could hear our neighbour brushing his teeth each night - ear plugs we found were a must.The breakfast was no more than fruit and croissants and I found it a little disturbing meeting the lady next door in her nightie every morning getting her share! The bar was okay, a nice touch offering a glass of complimentary wine each evening. However, one evening we retired to the hotel for a drink in the bar at around 10pm only to be told that it was shut and even as residents we could not get a drink!!On the plus side, the location of the Andrews is good and the laundry next door but one was faultless!

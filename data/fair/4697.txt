We stayed at the Sheraton Maui for our honeymoon for 10 days and it was a huge disappointment. We booked a King Room, they gave us a double with a view of the service walkway. They finally moved us 4 days in to a King with a partial ocean view, which was nice. The staff really seemed like they could have cared less, except for the valets, who seemed to be having a lot of fun. Nobody else really made any effort to make the trip special for us...employees frequently acted bothered to be there. I booked a special Dinner Under the Stars for my new wife and I, which was good, but the restaurant manager I booked with dropped off the face of the earth a week before the dinner and left me with no indication of what I needed to do to proceed -- it created added stress I did not need. The usual Maui tourist truisms hold here...the food is overpriced, mostly underwhelming, and the whole place is very expensive. It's a great location, though, and you can walk down to Whaler's Village for some SLIGHTLY cheaper alternatives. I usually stay at Marriott properties, and will definitely be returning there after my Sheraton experiment. I was very disappointed in the hotel and our stay.

We did not have a very good experience at the swissotel. Just stayed for one night but did not receive the service one would expect from a 4 star hotel. They couldn't honor our early check in request, did not give us a lakeview as requested, several leaks in the bathroom, requested extra pillows & towels (only 3 in room) and it took over 6 hours and 2 phone calls, one phone not working, etc. All in all we were disappointed in this hotel, I know we will stay elsewhere next time. Our last hotel stay downtown was at the Sofitel & I felt the service and hotel were much better.

Clift Is For Only Young People It might be very interesting hotel if you are under 35 years old. It is a modern minimalist style with dark lighting at the lobby and hall way and lots of young people gethered at Asia de Cuba restaurant and bars. It is IN place at night but very laud. Rooms are clean but they did not spend money for the furnitures. I stayed in Junior suite and was not impressed at all. Bathroom is very small and plain. I think it was mistake for me to choose this hotel.

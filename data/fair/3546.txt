Ill advised decision, further to my earlier experiences (see post May 2010) stayed at the hotel for a recent overnight business trip. A week after checking out noticed an additional charge for $ 65. Further enquiry clarified it as parking charge. Given that I flew in from Toronto this must have been my share of the cost of parking the Air Canada plane at the gate in LaGuardia or perhaps the 1 min at the curb that it took a taxi to drop me off at the front door of the hotel... Extremely loud air conditioning unit which couldn't even be turned off.

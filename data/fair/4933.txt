The room is itself was OK and the location is all right, especially for the Field Museum, Soldier Field, and the Aquarium. As has been mentioned, do not plan on taking advantage of the so-called breakfast. If you want a piece of toast and a glass of juice, fine. The front desk, while pleasant, created a major hassle for me. I had borrowed a wireless network card to take advantage of the free internet, at which time my credit card was charged a deposit fee, unbeknownst to me. On check out, the front desk did not inquire whether I was returning the card, but proceeded to finalize my bill and ask for my signature. At that point I handed over the network card. They did not think to adjust the bill. I was unaware of their failure to refund the deposit until several weeks later, at which point I called and left a message for the front desk manager. No response. I sent a letter. No response. Several weeks later I called again, and talked to accounting. They promised to credit my account.

We were not that pleased with our stay because our room was located so we could hear the workers outside. The street opposite our window was very busy. We also found the furniture in our room very unconfortable, chairs for example was made of plastic stuff. The hotel is a bit offside. You have to do a lot of walking getting to nearest subway. The cleaning was excellent.

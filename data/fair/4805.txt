Hotel is in a great location and the recent updating is beautiful. Rooms are small - beds are very comfortable. We did not have working air conditioning in the room. We called immediately upon check-in and were instructed to reset the AC, which we did. Upon returning from dinner, the room was still hot - this time the hotel sent up what appeared to be a bellman who did nothing more adjust the thermostat as we had done previously. A 4:45 AM call yielded no help and no offer of a different room or even a fan. Finally, after a night of no sleep, we went to the front desk. They denied any knowledge of any of the 3 previous calls but said they were full so there was no room to move us. Finally, a day after reporting the problem the first time, a repair man was sent and he opened the master unit and found and repaired the problem. Hotel offered free drinks and finally, $50 off. Too little, too late as a night of no sleep ruined the weekend. We checked out. Most disturbing was the total lack of concern on the part of the employees and the failure to track the problem after it was reported. It appears we were just "blown off".

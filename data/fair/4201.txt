First of all when staying at the hotel do not stay on the eigth floor as there is a club below and your room rumbles to the bass of the club and u may as well go down to the bar because the noise is the same as if you were at the club. The service staff are less than friendly and seem to be very young and inexperienced. The rooms are very dark and it is difficult to see things. The elevators are terrible and you can not see the floor buttons because of mood lighting gone bad. You also have to use your card everytime you are in the elevator and you have no time if you are on the third or fourth floor. The lobby is cold and less than comfortable especially when they leave you waiting as the housekeeping staff fall behind.

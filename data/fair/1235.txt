We have stayed at this hotel twice when my child needed medical care at CHOP. We are going to Philadelphia for pleasure on an upcoming weekend and will certainly be staying elsewhere. I didn't find the rooms to be in as poor condition as others who have reviewed it. The convenience to the hospital couldn't be beat and another bonus was that parking was free. I believe we had to pay for parking at the Sheraton. That said the accomodations at the Penn Tower can be likened to a dorm room. It was a place to sleep with few or no amentities, no restaurants/food, no premium TV, none of the little niceties that we often like when staying in hotels. You are on your own here. Bottom line is this hotel is fine if you need to be within very close proximity to the hospital, will spend little time in your room and don't care about having any of the extras. If you are going to Philadelphia for pleasure or will have some extra time on your hands, choose a different hotel.

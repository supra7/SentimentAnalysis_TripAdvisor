This hotel needs to get over itself. Got great rate through priceline name your own price for $140. I was there for 6 nights and needed to add a seventh and they told me it would be $400 for the seventh. The room is so tiny that you need to walk under the TV screen to get to the other side of the bed. On the plus side, great location, nice staff and nice toiletries from the Bliss Spa on location.

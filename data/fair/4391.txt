After reading the many reviews on this website it was with great trepidation that I travelled to this hotel. My husband and I had won a competition to New York and this hotel was part of the prize - no laughing. I would not have paid 235.00 per night for this hotel which I found out to be the room cost. By the sounds of it we were lucky as our bed was clean. The bathroom was tiny - did not know you could put that many appliances in such a small space. Had to laugh there was not even any hangers to put your clothes up. Luckily no bedbugs or rats as per previous reviews. The bedroom we had was dark and the lighting isn't great but we did not experience any noise from other guests. The only time we heard anything was when the person next door put on the shower. The great plus was the location. I like to stay in hotels where this is an atmosphere when you leave the front door. On your doorstep there was the subway, various restaurants and bars. If you want a breakfast to start the day then go to the Metro Diner about 3 blocks down - great value. We did a lot of walking and never felt threatened in the area. I would not stay here again personally as the price charged was over the top for the lack of facilities.

This hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of much of the New York attractions, However, the rooms were very antiquated and minimal, and the service is highly lacking. I know that New York isn't famous for friendlines, but the staff was downright rude- when I attempted to dispute a wrongful charge on my bill at checkout they went as far as to tell me "this is New York- get used to it," then laughed and insulted me. I have stayed in many Manhattan hotels before and never experienced anything like this. Their continental breakfast is a few old muffins and bagels in the lobby, where there is hardly anywhere to sit. In addition, The hallways are musty and gross, and the rooms are not too far off. For the price of this hotel one can find much better accomodations in Manhattan.

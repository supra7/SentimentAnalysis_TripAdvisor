We heard a lot about this hostel on web sites. But except for its easy to find location near St.Lucia station it had nothing more to offer to mature travelers like us. Mainly a girls hostel converted to hostel for others during vacations have no restaurant , no attached toilets or washrooms. One can find inner garments of inmates drying in the open all over.Internet is on payment ,one euro for 15 minutes. No professional reception. Its not cheap either. You miss morning tea, breakfast and have to find out thus plan in advance to leave this place.

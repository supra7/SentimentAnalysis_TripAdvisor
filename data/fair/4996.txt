Let's go over the good things about the hotel 1st. The rooms are clean, the location is superb, the free parking is great, & that's all. Bad things are: the water pressure for the sink & shower go from low pressure to normal pressure every min or so, and when it does in the shower, the water gets scalding hot. The most important thing in a hotel to me is the bathroom & it was just beyond terrible. They have a soap/shampoo dispenser too, not even actual shampoo bottles & ect. Crazy. Skip this place, pay for parking elsewhere. You won't have people blocking you in where you cannot get out & you won't have these terrible bathrooms. Oh, we also booked a 2 bed room & when we got there, they said we did a 1 king bed, which was BS, & then we had to get a 2 bed smoking room because they didn't have a non-smoking (even though we reserved one). Fail.

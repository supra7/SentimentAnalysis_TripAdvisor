Overcrowded; the pool needs an update; showers with low water pressure; average room; nice beach; noisy music around the pool; the cocktails were way too sweet; breakfast was nice (for every paying adult (around $20) one kid eats free); self parking. Overall feeling - disappointment. I won't return to this hotel. Last but not least - in my view the Wailea area (south Maui) is much nicer/relaxing than the Kaanapali area.

We stayed here as the last part of our trip. We started with the Queen Mary 2 (S'ton to New York) and ended with the Lenox, so were looking for something special. As others have stated, The Lenox is looking a bit tired and worn. We had a great view (11th floor) but the room could certainly have done with a refurbishment, as could the 11th floor corridor. The bed was AWFUL, it was so hard, I found it difficult to stay confortable for very long. The bathroom was ok, again a bit old and tired. Worst of all, the noise at night. The people next door to our room, returned from obviously a fun night and crashed around and laughed for at least 30 minutes, this was at 01:00 am! I nearly rang the reception at one point. There is no sound proofing at all and you can hear every conversation in the corridor and every bedroom door being opened and "slammed"... all in all, rather dissapointing. Boston however was wonderful, clean, interesting and expensive:o)

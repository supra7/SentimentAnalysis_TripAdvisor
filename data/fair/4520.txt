Not fussed on this hotel! good location thats the height of it.. if your allergic to feather bedding steer clear!! The hotel felt too small to cope with amount of visitors. Waiting on elevators took ages!!! when going into the bar, it was like you were in the way.. would not be on my favourite list thats for sure!!

I stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks while my daughter was having surgery, and stayed in the hospital. During the course of 2 weeks, we had to switch rooms 4 times. When we checked in we asked to be near the lobby and the pool, we got put in this dark dingy hole of a room that required walking through the parking lot to gert to the pool or front desk, not very good for our 2 young children. They moved us to a different room which wasn't much better, the toilet wouldn't flush and we kept having problems with the plumbing. When we moved again, they put us in a room in the gatehouse, the room was nicer, but once again we had plumbing problems, they tried fixing it, but we ended up getting flooded out. They moved us to another room in the gatehouse, and we ended our stay without any more problems. The service is bad in this hotel, the front desk clerks are often watching TV, and when we checked in and asked for foam pillows instead of the down pillows, it took us 3 hours to get them. This hotel needs lots of work if it ever wants to live up to it's name.

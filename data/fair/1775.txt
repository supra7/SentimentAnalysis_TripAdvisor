I was very pleased overall on this condo. Clean, attractive and roomy. Then we tried to sleep. 10:30 at night children were stomping and bouncing balls in the unit above, this continued even after repeated complaints were made to the management. each time, after the family above was notified, the noise escalated to a point where it was unbearable. By the 3rd night (after it took 10 minutes for the desk to answer the phone, a definate safety issues since 911 doesn't work on the phone system) the pounding, bouncing balls and stomping was intolerable. Finally at 2:30 a.m. the family was finally moved to another unit. Discussion with the the "manager" indicated that he was not aware of any issue. I guess the night staff nor security go not keep an event log. The management in complete denial of the issue attempted to rectify the problem by reimbursing 1 night of our stay. small consideration for a sleep deprived vacation.

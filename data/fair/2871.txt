This hotel was far from the beachside condo we stayed in the at the begining of our trip on kaanapali beach and we paid almost exactly the same price. For the area I hear it is a good deal, however it is a kind of long walk across the street to the beach. Our room was on the bottom floor in a dark corner and the lanai was unusable beacuse of a large air conidtioning unit and foliage that grew over it. The room seemed a little dirty and smelled smoky as well. The bathroom floor was obviously not washed recently. Granted we booked this hotel at the last minute so we may have been in one of the worst rooms (at least I hope it was the worst). The pool was nice and the open air bar was fun with live music at night time. The TV was very bad, tiny and bad reception. I would compare the room quality to that of a roadside Holiday Inn. Overall I would probably not stay here again and would not reccommend it to a friend for anything longer than one night.

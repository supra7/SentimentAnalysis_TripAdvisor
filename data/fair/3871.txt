The hotel itself is probably 3.5 stars, however the parking situation brought the overall rating way down. Although parking was only $5 (a night) extra, the parking slots were big enough for a motorcycle and maybe a Prius. I own a Honda Accord and parking it was ridiculous. My husband thought he was Austin Powers for a second! Luckily, we got in and out without a scratch. The hotel room itself was clean and acceptable. The staff was courteous and accomodating. The highlight of the hotel is the continental breakfast. It is free and there is a good selection of breakfast items. I wish I could say that we would stay there again, but the parking situation is enough to keep us away.

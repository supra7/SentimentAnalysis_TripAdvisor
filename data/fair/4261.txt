I usually appreciate Marriott hotels, but this is below average. It would be a regular/fair if it was an airport hotel but as a downtown hotel, it needs improvement. Even the staff remember flights: they are polite, of course, but they look like flight attendants with their fake smiles and simulated courtesy. The hotel and the room look old and they definitely need renewal. It was a disappointing experience.

Had pre-paid for 4 nights, otherwise would have checked out. The room wasn't the cleanest. Bed was soft and uncomfortable. Staff generally nice but not much help with respect to tourism activities other than bus tours. They were busy all of the time we were there, perhaps they need to hire some more people.

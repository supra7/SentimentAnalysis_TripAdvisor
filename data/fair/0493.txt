Second time I've stayed here. The pluses have been location - safe, nice area, free parking and good sized rooms. The minuses, both stays - sheets and towels are rough and very thin, below Motel 6, the worst I've ever experienced, bathrooms are very worn looking and a little dirty, ie faucet handle center had not been cleaned. Pillows were "wimpy", bed didn't stay made. Room size good, carpet & fixtures looked much newer than towels & sheets. I like a bargin and don't mind some trade offs for price, but the AAA rate for the room with all taxes & charges (1 queen, 2 people) was $112.87. I'm looking for other places for future stays, but the location is definitely the draw for me.

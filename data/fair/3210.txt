The hotel lists no smoking rooms - this much is true. Unfortunately, the smoking areas are all around the pools and courtyards. So give up the pool if you want a swim, there's too many desperate smokers sucking down butts to even allow access if you're the least bit bothered by smoking. The other bad part is that the only access to some of the rooms is through the courtyard - which was where our room was. To get to and to exit your room - you have to run a gauntlet of smokers. The other part was that you're awakened at 7:30AM by screaming brats who are tearing around the pool and their parents who don't care. Oh, and the drunk, loud people late into the night - just adds flavor to an already spoiled dish. Not a single thing is mentioned about the "day care center" around the pool. The website only shows how nice it looks. Overall, the beds are comfortable.

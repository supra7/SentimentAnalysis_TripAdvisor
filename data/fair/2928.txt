Stayed in June 2008, nice property but its the wrong place and time of year if you're looking for a quiet and relaxing hotel. Great place if you have children. Beach area is nice but it's shared with a host of other hotels, you really can't see that from their web cam, so its pretty packed with little ones playing in water. Forget grabbing a nap in during the day in the summer months. Use the public access beach behind the property which can be accessed via the parking lot. Early mornings and late evenings on the beach are nice as was the ocean view from the room. Had to move rooms, first one was behind the hot tub in the main building and it got loud at night . The staff was extremely nice and helpful. Earlier reviews of their restaurant are correct, quite pricey for what you get.

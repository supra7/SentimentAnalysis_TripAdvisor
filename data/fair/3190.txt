I booked two rooms, for my wife and me, plus my in-laws. We booked three nights, at rack rate (430$ plus each night for each room). Pros: nice location in Yountville. Close to restaurants. Excellent concierge, helped make two great dinner reservations. Very friendly desk. Cons: As other commentators have said, the hotel is really a motel. A good description would be a La Quinta on steroids: similar feel and style, slightly more upscale furnishings. We had three problems: 1) Route 29, right outside the window. This is the main highway through Napa, and 18 wheelers run up and down all night. Not very relaxing 2) It was impossible to mask the road noise using the air conditioner. Regardless of the fan settings, the fan clicks on and off all night (if it doesn't sense movement, I think). 3) We got placed in a room (#48) with a thinly insulated connecting door, next to a bridal party on the night before the wedding. We were awoken several times during the night by screaming women, and then again at 6am as the bride got ready for the big day. The final insult was the cancellation policy: We were called back home a day early so that my wife could perform an emergency surgery. The hotel claims that there is a 7 day cancellation policy, and refused to credit the third night for our room. They offered to resell it, but said that there were 14 unsold rooms that needed to be sold first. So no refund of the third night. My point: if there were 14 unsold rooms, our leaving early obviously didn't deprive anyone of a room. I spend a LOT of time in hotels, and all in all, I don't think that we've ever paid $2400 ($400 for each rom, times two rooms times three nights...) and received such poor value or lack of concern/ respect from management. Not refunding a third unused night in a fairly empty hotel was the final insult. What shabby treatment of generally easy to please customers.

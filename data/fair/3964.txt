Disappointing. Stayed in the Rosenkavalier- very cold room, lumpy/bouncy bed (but the bedding was fair), large bathroom, but small toilet space (coffin like)...it was shabby 1890's meets 1970...strange. The in-room library had a few classics (Milton, Shakespeare, Stendhal), a pleasant surprise.My husband and I may stay again after the renovation.Maybe.

Stayed there for two nights, Sun & Mon on the second week of June 2005. Our room was a non-smoking, and didn't smell funny. but the shower/bathroom space is quite cramp. mildew is visible. some stains on carpet. smell of cigarette smoke in elevator. free breakfast at 6am: package muffins, bagles, juice from fountain. One of their staffs didn't know what toiletries are in stock, she replied that they never supplied shower caps when we asked for another one on the second night, one was offered when we arrived the first night. Overall: liked the location for average price/nite $85. 3-4 blocks from attractions. Near free-ride area, we picked this place because we didn't drive. No problem returning late at night, area is quiet, few pedestrians, encountered only a few wanderers/homeless folks near downtown/free-ride area which is 4 blocks away from hotel, but most metro area have same problem with homeless, not a big deal.

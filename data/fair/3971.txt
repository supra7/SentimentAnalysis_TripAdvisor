Caution --Renovation Nightmare Booked this room after reading numerous reviews from various websites that were positive. Several warned of renovations in progress, but said they were hardly noticeable. Well, that has changed! Every floor of the hotel is torn up and in a big way. The lobby was torn down during our stay. Renovations are due to be completed in May 2008 and at that time the place should be very quaint. Warning--rooms are TINY! But, beds are very comfortable and it is a very quaint hotel.

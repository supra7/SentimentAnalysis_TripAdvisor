Last time I will stay here Luckily we didn't let our experience at this hotel ruin our trip to Hawaii because it very easily could have. It all started by using Expedia to book the hotel. Our package included free parking and free breakfast. Before leaving home, I spent an entire day on the phone with Expedia and the hotel becase the hotel would not honor Expedia's promise of free parking. After that was finally taken care of, we thought everything would be great. The hotel itself was nice and we had a great view of the ocean, but their customer service stinks! On the first morning, we went to have breakfast and were informed that it was not included in our package. Again, after spending forever on the phone with Expedia and talking to the management of the hotel, the hotel would NOT honor the package we purchased for a simple breakfast which was just that, simple. They made us feel like cheap skates for simply wanting what we purchased in our package through Expedia. The assistant manager even said Expedia could promise you a Mercedes but we don't have to give you one. We just let it drop and went on having a great time in Hawaii. I am just amazed that the hotel will not honor the promises made by a service soliciting their hotel. I will never use Expedia again and I will never stay at the Waikiki Parc again.

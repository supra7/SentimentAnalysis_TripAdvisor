I have had the luxury of staying at some top line hotels in Las Vegas and around the world. I was excited to stay at the Wynn complex, what a let down! The lobby is just plain boring as is most of the hotel. Service not up to par at the resteraunts we tried. The only real positive is the room, great big nice room. I would not recommend or stay there again. Charges billed to our room from the Spa, we never even saw the spa! Horrible check out process.

DO NOT STAY HERE. There are many choices for luxury hotels in New Orleans, and the Roosevelt just does not measure up. I booked my stay about a year ago, before the hotel had even opened. I called to confirm our late arrival to the hotel earlier in the week leading up to my stay. Yet, upon getting to the hotel at midnight, we were told there was no room for us, and we would have to go to another hotel. We got a room the next day. During our stay, housekeeping failed to clean up the complimentary fruit tray the hotel management sent (it was moldy). Stay at the Ritz or the Windsor Court, where the service is exceptional.

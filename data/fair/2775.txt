Unless they renovate, do not stay here. This is a motel 6 at least. Oh wait, a motel 6 cleans a bit better. It is so dusty! There was dust on the floorboards and the carpet that was coming up by the edges. The phone didn't work and the light didn't either. The band played until ten, making it impossible for us to put our kids to bed (terrible too). Carpet is old an dirty. Remote is broken. We have stayed in two different hotels and they were much nicer and much cheaper. (Around $400 a night). Big pain of a hotel. I've stayed in 3 star rated hotels in S.F. that is so much better than this.

We booked this through Orbitz. We booked a deluxe ocean view, which showed full view of the ocean in front of our room. This room was like $400 per night. We were really looking forward to our stay. The room showed a separate sitting room by the sliding doors leading out to the ocean view. Upon arrival, we were placed in a "regular" room with 2 beds, crt television - and only 1 at that, no frills whatsoever - like staying in a motel 8. The view outside our sliding door was bushes. We had to walk outside to look to the right to see the ocean. Of course I was very disappointed and wished to be given some kind of compensation as $400 a night was crazy. I could have gotten the same type thing anywhere else for $100 per night so why was I paying this crazy price. I wanted to check out upon arrival due to my disatisfaction and was told my money was non-refundable due to the fact that I booked with Orbitz - I would have to contact them - well - folks - if you have ever dealth with Orbitz - you know how that went! So we spent 8 nights at $400 per night and the whole trip was a complete disaster. My son stayed at a very nice time share condo for about a hundred dollars less a night. So when you go to Hawaii, look very hard and know exactly what you are getting. Do not book through an online travel site or you are stuck! Geez, what more can I say?

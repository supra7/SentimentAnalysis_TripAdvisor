All mouth, no trousers Just back from a week at the Clift. It's nice and central and the rooms are OK but it's way to big and generic to be the boutique experience it thinks it is.First impressions in the uber trendy reception are encouraging, but the styling stops as soon as you get in the lift. Rooms are boring and basic and the overall feeling is more holiday inn than cool.The bar, whilst achingly cool, is way too busy with local drinkers (most very drunk) to be much use or fun for guests. Indeed some members of out party were uprooted from their table for a non resident couple who had booked, this simply doesn't seem right.There needs to be a separate bar for residents - this works at the Sanderson.Whilst the rooms are average value, the hotel clearly aims to pump up income through hugely expensive extras. Breakfast is a rip off, room service and mini bar way too much to make sense (over walking across the road to the supermarket!). Even a movie costs $15!!Staff are aloof, but not rude.I am sure there are better, smaller, more intimate options in a city as great as SF.

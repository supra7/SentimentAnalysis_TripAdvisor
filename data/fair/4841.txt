I was there for a Tax conference in May of 2011. It was the poorest excuse for a hotel. The service was horrible and they overbooked the conference space. The other conferences were eating off the food put out for us with no staff to monitor what was going on. The AV dept. was spread too thin without enough staff to attend to our needs. The meeting rooms were not set up to our specifications and when we called several times before the meetings were to start to fix the problems, we could get a response and had to go on without without flip charts and handheld mikes. The projector didn't work in one room and it took forever to get help. Some of the staff yes'd you to death and never delivered! The only thing nice was the food and the beds were comfortable. Location was accessible to downtown.

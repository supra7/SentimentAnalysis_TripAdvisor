Roaches......Ants........Roaches...... If you don't mind sharing your room with a few ROACHES or taking a shower in a clogged bath tub (and by the time you are finished, the water is past your ankles),then this is the place for you!!!!The hotel has a perfect South Beach location, price was not too bad because I had a discount, but the room is not worth more than $100 a night. The 'clean' towels had someone's hair on it, the fridge smelled, there were tiny ants in the beds some days. YOU CANNOT LEAVE ANY TYPE OF FOOD ANYWHERE IN THE ROOM, BECAUSE BY THE TIME YOU GET BACK, IT WILL BE COVERED BY ANTS!!!!!AS for the ROACHES, I seen at least 3 BIG ROACHES OR WATERBUGS crawling around on the ground first, then I spotted one on the wall. I refused to stay in that room another second, so I went to complain to a manager, and he changed our room to a oceanview room because we were leaving the next day.OVERALL I WOULD NEVER GO BACK TO THIS HOTEL!!!!!

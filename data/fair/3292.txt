First off, I am typing this review on using the internet from my MiFi because the internet connection here is so bad I can't even check my email most of the time. Thats pretty unacceptable to me in this day and age, I don't care if its free if I can't use it. The staff at times has also been a little curt and rude, although some people have been very nice. The concierge lounge is a mixed bag, good food in the evening but they only serve breakfast for an hour and then promptly take everything away. One lady up there didnt even want to see if she had anymore english muffins because they had run out with 15 minutes left of service. gross, its your job to keep things stocked, i dont know what her problem was. THey also kept running out of drinks (soda, water, coffee, etc) The food at night had seafood and was ok, small selection and again, they kept running out of things and taking their time to restock them. on the plus side, they did a great job cleaning our room and everything looks nice and new. I also had a nice view of the river and FQ. overall i was just disappointed, if i come back again i would definitely choose the Pere Marquette down the street over this place. i've stayed there before and its definitely the better place to use my reward points.

Stayed here for 3 weeks, first week of April 2007. Across the street and down a little to get to the beach, and the beach here isn't that great. A sketchy crowd hangs out in the parking lot. The room was just so-so and they even upgraded us to a junior suite. It was nice to stay in the area to hit some different spots because the rest of the trip we stayed in Lahaina. Rooms are just outdated and don't seem so clean. If you do decide to stay here, have the mac-nut pancakes with coconut syrup. The restaurant on site wasn't that bad, though don't go if you are in a rush...one day our waiter must have been on some serious drugs, the other day we went service was fine.

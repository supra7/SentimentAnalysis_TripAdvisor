This hotel is simply too dated to be up to W standards. There is no reason to stay here instead of any of the other Ws in NYC unless you absolutely need to be in this location. On top of that the service is quite poor. In two days we had four incidents of indifferent, lazy staff doing the bare minimum and making it clear that they were doing their jobs against their wishes. There is a "That's not my responsibility" culture with the staff that makes stays very unpelasant. Simply put, this is a very poorly run hotel.

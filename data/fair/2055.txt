We were at the hotel for a wedding on a Saturday night. The hotel made about $50,000 on this large wedding yet they continuously nickeled and dimed their guests. 1. They charged $7.00 for a beer and $9.00 for a mixed drink at the wedding - ridiculous. 2. The entree portions were so small that my whole table went to Champions bar after the wedding to get some $12 appetizers because we were starving. 3. The "special" wedding guest rate was $199 a night - real special. 4. They validated parking which cost $16 but expired at 3AM. So, if you stayed over night, you had to pay double to park. And valet overnight parking for a guest of the wedding was triple. The most disturbing part of our experience happened in the hotel room. The bathroom in our hotel locked while I was inside. My husband called to have maintenance let me out, and he said it happens all the time. So, good luck if there's a fire and you're traveling alone. Overall, we were VERY disappointed.

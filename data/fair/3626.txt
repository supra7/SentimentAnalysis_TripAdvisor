This was our second stay at the W in midtown, and boy has this hotel been weathered and worn since 2005. We arrived on a busy Friday evening and it was a cattle call. No welcome, or anything! (And we had just come from the W in Montreal, which was amazing!). They put us in a really bad room on the 18th floor. The blower was broken and the constant noise was so irritating...no sleep! The chair in our room needed to be sent out to the Goodwill. The fabric was torn and frayed. No closet space...the entire thing was horrific! We asked to be relocated but the hotel was sold out and we got about 5 more square feet in another room. After three nights we spoke to the manager (because they said one wasn't available when we arrived) and the nice woman didn't want our experience to be so negative. She moved us to a suite on the "Bliss Spa Floor" and it was a 180 degree turn. Everything was wonderful, and clean, and smelled good, and there was no noise or crappy furniture. They explained to us that this hotel will get a facelift in January 2008, so I recommend that you request the Bliss floor, or try another one of their properties until the face lift is completed. Another thing...the cocktail waitresses in the lobby bar have major attitude! Go somewhere else if you want a cocktail.

While I was on business and trying to save the company some money I choose a pretty cheap room near SEA-TAC (I think it was 69 or 74 a night). The room was small and awful, everything was cramped and the table was wobbly which made for typing on my laptop a pain. the shuttle took 42 minutes to arrive to the airport to pick me up. Their computers were down when I checked in and then again while I checked out, so I couldn't get a receipt and when I asked if they could email it to me they said to call them the next day they would fax it to me. Spend the 10-15 dollars more and stay at the Hampton

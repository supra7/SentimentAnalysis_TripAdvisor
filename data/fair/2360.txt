We stayed at the Copley Plaza for a medical meeting last fall. It has a beautiful lobby and guest services were okay for restaurants reservations, tours, etc. The room was clean, but very small. The bathroom was ridiculously small with a toilet on an angle which made it difficult to find at night! The TV remote didn't work as well as the TV. There was no internet service in the room, either wireless or ethernet. Everyone was in the lobby trying find a place to sit to use their computers. We were there for five uncomfortable nights.

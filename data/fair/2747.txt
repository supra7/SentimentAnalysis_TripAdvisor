Hotel felt tired, dated and worn. The room we stayed in was depressing, dark and felt dirty (despite decent housekeeping service). Clearly no updates have been made since construction in the sixties. At this point, the best option for the new management team would be to completely renovate (if not tear down) the rooms. Years of neglect, decay & stale smoke have taken their toll. Lipstick on a pig cannot disguise what this place has become. On the positive side, front desk staff were friendly & pleasant and I did like the garden layout of the units. Not up to usual Marriott standards however!

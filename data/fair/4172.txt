The "whirlpool" was locked for no apparent reason when we went downstairs. After they unlocked it, we got in and the water was freezing cold and there was dirt and dead skin settled to the bottom as if they hadn't been running it in days. The bathroom was so disgusting. There was dried throw up on the wall still and somebodys booger stuck to the wall. The room is decent. Beds comfortable. Overall impression? This hotel is dirty and cheap. No parking thanks to the bar next door even though we paid ten dollar plus tax PER NIGHT for parking. Definitely wishing I could get my money back....

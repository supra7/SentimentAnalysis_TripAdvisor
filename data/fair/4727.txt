Our vacation rental wasn't ready in time so we booked a night at the Sheraton Kaanapali. We had an ocean front room, $580 a night, TINY. The bathroom was disgusting - equiv. to a cheap apartment. This place was just really cheesy. However the grounds were gorgeous. They charged $30.00 a day to lay in a cabana chair on the beach. Lame. I would way rather stay at the Four Seasons Wailea......

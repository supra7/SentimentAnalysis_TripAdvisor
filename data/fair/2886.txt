I booked this Hotel for 6 nights. The employes were very friendly and helpful. But we had problems from the day we got to Maui. We booked a Room & Ride deal through the Hotel. We got to the car rental they only had half of the paper work, so we had to sit and wait for an hour and a half to get that all taken care of. We get to the Hotel and not a problem checking in. We had to get tv remotes exchanged twice as they did not work. I now we were not to be in our rooms in Hawaii, but 5 hours difference things were closed early in the morings. Then our termastat did not work, it stayed on all the time got to cold in the room. Then people below us were just talking and it sounded like they were in our room. We even had our doors shut. Just to many things was going wrong. We only stayed the first 3 day of our stay there and spent our rest at another Hotel down the street. The room was very clean, the bed was very comfy & view was good.

Very Excited about Encore we love Vegas and travel there about every 3 months. I love to gamble but the casino area of Encore was such a dissapointment I won't be back. Very, Very small slot area, people were having to wait to play the machines. Not many varieties. Needless to say we played elsewear and won't be back. Very pretty, lots of people to help you but the casino was a HUGH disappointment

The hotel property is very nice, but not very well planned. If you stay in an ocean front view room in building 6 or farther, plan on a ~15 minute walk to get to the lobby, restaurants, pool. The buildings on the property are not connected by one consistent floor. From the 5th floor on building 6, you have to take the elevator down to the 3rd floor, walk through the breezeway connecting to the next building, take an elevator up to the 8th floor, walk down a long hallway, take another elevator to the 1st or 2nd floor, then walk through another long hallway and breezeway, just to get to the lobby area. It's really ridiculous and should have been planned better. The view from building 6 is great if you want an ocean front view. If you book an ocean front room, be sure to not be placed in building 4......those rooms seem more like pool view than ocean front, though you can see a bit of the ocean beyond the pool area. Also, I did see a mouse in the hallway when returning to my building one night. The luau held on the property is very nice, better than expected and worth seeing. The concierge desk stayed pretty busy, so prepare to wait a bit. The spa was closed for renovations, so I went down the street to the spa at the Westin, which I highly recommend! The Westin looks really nice, maybe consider staying there. The Sheraton was OK, but there are other hotels along the same street, and if I were returning to the area, I'd try a different hotel.

I spend 120 nights per year in hotel rooms so it is important that a hotel be welcoming and comfortable. The room (I paid for the most expensive one) was tiny. The shower was so small I couldn't get my hands above my head to easily wash my hair. The service was unwelcoming. The bathroom fan rattled. The heater is loud and is just a window unit. I stayed three nights and I just became frustrated. The art on the walls is great and the look and feel is nice but it's just WAY too small. If it were a $99 European hostel style hotel it would be okay. But, at $200 plus internet and $25 parking I just felt plain ripped off. Come to the hotel to eat dinner at the great restaurant downstairs but if you want a comfortable stay I would think twice.

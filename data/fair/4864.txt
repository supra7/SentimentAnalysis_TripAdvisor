Firstly, if you are going to stay here book directly through the hotel. They stupidly only sell king size beds to the travel companies (expedia etc) no matter how many people you said are staying in a room. Therefore, we had 4 ppl and one king size bed. The bed was not big enough for all of us. We had two men: one over 6'7 and the other 6'3 and two females. Since the hotel was booked completely & we had a wedding we had no choice but to take the room. The staff was quite rude and unsympathetic about the whole situation. They were unable to give us another room or fix our situation. However, The room was clean, well made, and was overall nice. We would have appreciated it had we not had such a horrible mix up with the beds. However, do note it is on a busy street and it does get noisy at night. BUT ITS Chicago. When we asked for blankets and pillows for the other half of our group not staying on the bed the staff put up a horrible fuss stating they should be in our room. The staff was extremely rude and made us feel like we were very unwelcome. However, we did not have blankets & we needed it to sleep. They finally brought us very a scratchy blanket and pillows with black make up on it. Frustrated, we asked for another and they said they ran out and did not have any extra. As a hotel, I am surprised that they didn't. Which means- they probably do not clean the blankets on the bed very often. The morning breakfast consisted of muffins and coffee. Not much of anything. We ended up drinking coffee and getting breakfast elsewhere. While the hotel is close to the sites, just beware of the scam through the travel sites. We probably would have had a nice stay had it not been for not having a bed to sleep on & no blankets. As well, we contacted the hotel management following our stay. They were of NO help. They simply offered us a "discount" if we stayed again. Not very likely, just goes to show you that they don't care much about their guests.

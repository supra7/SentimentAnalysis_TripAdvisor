We had similiar troubles at the pool. I don't know about anyone else, but at 53 and solid non rule breaking citizen, I got real tired of getting the 20 year old college student's condiscending attitude and rule barking. I think the hotel really needs to work on "customer vision" - especially at the so called "Oasis" park. I got so fed up with getting barked at that I finally left the so called "Oasis" for the room for peace and quiet. The food at the pool was a little over priced for what you got and you could not get anything really low calorie. The drinks at the bar were really watered down (and I am no boozer) at 8 bucks a piece. The bar in the hotel wasn't all that much better - the bartender actually used a shot glass to pour. It would have been nice to have a great drink at the end of the evening - especially after getting scolded left and right. Needless to say, my husband is going to really have to convince me to go back next year.

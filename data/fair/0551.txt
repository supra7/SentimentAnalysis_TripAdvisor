We anticipated a small(er) room, but this was ridiculous! The bathroom was smaller than my closet! Our first room had a tub, where you almost had to step over the toilet to enter. Luckily, we are not tall people because there wasn't much room between the toilet and the wall! I mentioned to the front desk to ask the cleaning crew to please remove the mildew from the walls in the shower. They promptly said they would move us to a new room. It did not have a tub, only a shower. I couldn't wash my hair without hitting my elbows on the wall!! In the first room, the water spout was coming out of the wall and the drain stopper would not stay up so we had to remove it. In the second bathroom,the shower head was coming out of the wall and the handle was very hard to turn. There was also mold growing around the this handle. Overall, it was not clean. The walls need to be wiped down. I saw someone's comments about the Aveda toiletries. We did not care for them. We though they smelled awful! Our room faced Stewart Street. It was very loud. The beds were very uncomfortable. I finally asked for a body pillow so I could lay on top of it for more padding! We will NOT be staying here again!

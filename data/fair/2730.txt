We will never ever go back to the El Cortez, a real dump. The food is pure pig slop and the management are thugs in cheap suits. We will pay more next time and stay on the strip. The El Cortez is in a dangerous area and dangerous people wander in and out of the casino at all times. What a nightmare .

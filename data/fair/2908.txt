We have previously stayed at this property and visited again this year for dinner at their Japanese restaurant. The primary tempation for staying at the Prince is that very reasonable room rates can be obtained, either through the hotel directly or priceline. We had intended on staying for our first night due to a late arrival but instead stayed at the Mariott in Wailea. Notwithstanding the price, we found the property as a whole to continue to be very dated and desperately in need of a face lift. The beach and location is so attractive so the potential is there if they were only willing to spend some money updating the hotel. The funny part is that my in-laws stayed at the Prince 20 years ago for their honeymoon (second for each) and constantly rave about how wonderful the hotel was. The reality is that absolutely nothing has changed since their stay, for better and for worse. Hopefully the owner of the property will eventually decide to inject some capital and return this hotel to its former glory. Until then, it will not be able to compete with the other hotels in Wailea.

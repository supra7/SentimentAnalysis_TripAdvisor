Our experience of the Beach Cottages is clearly not the same as other reviews so it must be because we were also on the block behind the crab restaurant...no sea view ..no view at all apart from the back of this building and its parking lot. We had just stayed in beautiful apts in LA and Vegas and had not prebooked a hotel in San Diego...we saw this in passing and booked in a hurry. Not saying it was terrible and the hotel receptionist did get us the quietest room on the block but the room was a little dark and depressing. Very spacious. It was fairly clean and kitchen was reasonably okay but looked a bit like a student flat. The balcony and stairways were a bit scruffy and dusty and cigarette butts on the floor and we had an ashtray full on our plastic table by the door. Had the location of Mission Beach been fabulous we would probably have stuck it out but checked out after one night. Def not worth $200 per night considering what we got for our money for the rest of holiday. Mission Bay is for youngsters and is loud and scruffy. Having said that this hotel is clearly very popular with seniors and families because many were booking for next year so maybe it is not as bad as we think but we were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. When checking out they asked if we wanted to pre book for next year and appeared shocked when we said no so it seems quite a lot of people must say yes. For us, La Jolla just up the coast was more suited and we had a fabulous cliff top apt overlooking the ocean for the same price. Okay hotel just not for us.

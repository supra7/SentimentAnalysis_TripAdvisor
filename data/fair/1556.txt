Stayed here one night because Hilton Bonaventure was full. The check in staff were lackluster and didn't recognize me as a Hilton Diamond though I did receive a breakfast chit which I didn't use. I was given what appeared to be a room for disabled persons and wasn't informed of it. With me you get one chance to get it right. I didn't complain I rarely do, I just don't come back. This place charges for everything that is gratis at most hotels including 1 disposable razor and for a plug adaptor. I think one can do much better for the money elsewhere in Montreal.

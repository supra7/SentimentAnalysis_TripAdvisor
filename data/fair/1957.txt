I never seem to be particularly pleased with any of my stays at Marriott hotels, even their upper-end JW Marriott hotels. I stayed at JW Marriott - LA Live to attend a conference recently. We arrived a bit late (10:45pm) and we learned upon arrival that all of the King rooms (for which we had placed a deposit) had been already given out and all that were available were double queens. I was told that I would be given a high-floor city view that was supposed to satisfy me. I asked for a supervisor and someone named Stephanie came and apologized and offered nothing else more than free internet. She claimed that a paid deposit (with a guaranteed charge of one night if I was a no-show) was not really a guaranteed reservation, because it was at a special convention rate. In other words, they were guaranteeing to charge me for a King room for the night, but they were not guaranteeing that they would actually provide it! She sauntered off and the nasty desk clerk tosses me a room key-card for the 7th floor with a view of a Pepsi sign out the window, NOT the high city-view. It works out bad for you if you complain to management here. Most high-end hotels will provide an upgrade for inconvenience, not down-grade and treat you like trash. As an aside, I walked by the front desk early the next morning and there was Stephanie. She was smiling as her eyes wondered toward mine and, upon looking at me, her smile dropped from her face like a ton of bricks. Real nice. She either works very long hours or has very little time off between shifts. This might explain the hotel staffs less than adequate treatment of their guests. In the future, I will attempt to avoid any conference held at a Marriott and I will certainly never ever stay at another for holiday.

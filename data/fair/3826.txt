As a frequent business traveller, I really look forward to stay in nice hotels when poosible and was really looking forward to the RC in Phoenix. Unfortunately I set my expectations way too high. My room was not that different from a Holiday Inn or Hilton. Service was polite and the staff do try to mae your stay pleasant, but there is little they can do about the physical layout of the hotel. ROOM The room I had on the club level, was very small. Bed was nice with good bedding. Regular TV, 24 inch (no flat screen?) with very limited cable. Standard shower/bath could use an upgrade. CLUB LEVEL Very disappointed. The offerings were sparse, when they ran out, which they did, that was it. When I asked the host what the offerings were, she described them as "chicken" or "fish". I felt like I was on an airplane, non-descript generic offerings. If you stay here not sure it is worth the extra cost for club level. LOCATION Not far from the airport and great if need to be in Scottsdale. Mall across the street with places to shop/eat, etc..

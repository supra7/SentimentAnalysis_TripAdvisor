As others have noted, there is ongoing construction at the Downtown Miami Hilton that involves drilling into concrete from 9:00 am to 5:30 pm each weekday. We were there only one night, but it was difficult to relax in the afternoon, and we definitely made sure we were gone by the time it started back up again. We got a good deal on the room, which was nicely appointed, but heard nothing about the construction noise except on this site. The management did seem responsive, but of course there's only so much they can do short of stopping the construction. The location is good, but Miami is not a very walkable city so the expensive parking at the hotel can become an issue. We walked to Bayside, about 15-20 minutes away, and were basically the only people on the sidewalk except homeless people. Very convenient to the arena and opera house, though. Also, they allow dogs for apparently no extra charge.

We arrived at a very late flight on September 17. The shift employee was courteous (sorry don't remember his name). He sent us to a room on the first floor, down the hall. When we entered the room, I was very dissapointed. Everything looked very old and poorly maintained. The carpet was very, very stained; even though only one of the lamps was on, we could spot all the stains. At first the only thing that looked clean was the bathroom; but when I got in the shower, there was mildew. In the morning we tried to get some sleep and the housekeeping girl kept trying to get in the room and it was only 7:30 am! My husband was very upset because she tried a couple of times. At the front desk the employee was very, very nice. He kept our bags while we went outside for breakfast. We did not want to risk eating there, because everything looked so dirty. I don't like to write this type of reviews, but this hotel is a shame, and the administration should do something to at least keep it a little cleaner.

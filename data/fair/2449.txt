Stayed here for one night on business. The lobby is absolutely beautiful so it's a big letdown when you get to your room. Small, crowded, dark, not too clean and very dated. All for $200 plus per night - no thanks. I can also say quite honestly that the person checking us in was definitely the rudest person I've ever experienced at a hotel check-in. Quite a surprise for a Hilton. There's lots of hotel in Chicago - I'd suggest you stay elsewhere.

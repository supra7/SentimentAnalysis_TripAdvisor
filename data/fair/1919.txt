We just returned home from Dallas today- we were in town for a wedding and my husband was the best man- so our room was paid for...so seeing that we didn't have to personally pay for the place helps....but I was not impressed- the lobby was hot, the elevators were terribly slow- small rooms, tiny bathrooms...our bathroom door wouldnt close and the picture for the TV was very grainy...the place just didn't feel clean. To top things off...the only have ONE, yes ONE luggage carrier for the entire hotel...so we had to make several trips to unload. Will not return.

We were excited to stay here Sept. 5, 2010. Yes, we expected it to be busy with the Labor Day weekend but it was completely crazy. 30 minute wait to check in at 3:30 pm. Room wasn't ready until 7:00 pm. We went for the Oasis Water Park but my husband summed it up best that is was so crowded it was like being at a public pool. Tubes were hard to get for the lazy river (which was the only way you could go on it). River and slide shut down for 30 minutes to chlorinate because there was clearly an overload of people. Wave pool very tame. We thought the Island Buffet sounded like a good value for $15/adults, $9 kid. Not a good value when you can only go through the line once and you're trying to decide what to fit on your plate not knowing what will taste good and what won't. Our room ended up being in the mountainside cluster and was right next to the freeway and had no view of anything. The pool for that cluster was tinier than our play pool at home and again, way too crowded even at 9 pm at night. This resort was a huge disappointment. We are probably jaded because of the sheer volume of people that were there, (they were sold out) but I can't recommend this place. We won't be going again.

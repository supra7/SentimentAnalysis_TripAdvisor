Four 30-something girls traveled to Chicago for a concert and stayed here because of location. Things were fine until we stopped for gas on the way home. We pooled gas money and put the extra in the console. We valeted the car and enjoyed the concert. The next day, halfway home, we stopped for gas. Our money was gone. We should not have left it there - we just forgot about it. It was around $50. I immediately called the hotel, I spoke to the Valet Manager. He said he would see who was working the previous night, investigate and get back to me. Of course he never did and my calls went unreturned. We'll not be back. The hotel itself was fine. No complaints.

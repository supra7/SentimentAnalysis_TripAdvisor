Service was pleasant, but there must be some discrepancy with the room sizes as some other reviews did not mention it. If you aren't one of the lucky ones to always be upgraded, DEFINITELY request a ?larger room or some other room than mine as it was a view of a parking garage, barbed wire fencing, and an old building. The room size was suitable for 1/2 of a person.

The Hotel Griffon is in an excellent location near the Ferry Building. The rates are reasonable ($164 on hotel website). I don't recommend it, however, as there are many nicer hotels in San Francisco. When I arrived after a long drive from southern California, the front desk clerk suggested I go out and park my own car on the street. I had to ask twice for the car to be parked -- I was tired, it was almost midnight and the neighborhood was new to me. There was no bellman, no greeter. The next morning, when 9 a.m. and the end of the complimentary breakfast arrived, the cleaning crew swooped all the food, coffee and hot water away, and took the guests' plates, etc. even though several people were still enjoying coffee with a newspaper, etc. The staff didn't ask if anyone wanted more coffee, or leave the coffee for refills. Very rude. The in room temperature control didn't work, neither did the ice machine. With poor service and an indifferent staff, the incredible location and decent price can't save this hotel from a mediocre rating.

I agree with Mary Chico that this is not what you would expect of a Westin, though I'm starting to doubt Starwood in general these days. I'll start with the positive. First, the location is good, and the common areas are pretty and fairly well kept. The pool areas are fine. The rooms all have balconies, which is nice. Those are really the only highlights. The rooms and especially the bathrooms were pretty gross. Our bathroom had such a strong mildew smell to it I searched for a hidden wet towel that had gone un-noticed. The tub was dirty, the door was institutional, and the decor was just depressing. I have seen nicer bathrooms in hospitals. The cleaning staff did a very cursory job of cleaning each day. Even more shocking was that they didn't actually clean the rooms until the afternoon. On our first full day, our room remained unclean until 2:30 PM. They barely make the bed for you and don't straighten anything, so I am unclear as to what takes so long. There is nothing even close to turndown service. For the first two nights, our cleaning lady's scent- a mixture of soap and bad perfume- permeated the room and the sheets. The service across the board was almost laughably bad. When I complained about the stench in the bathroom and the cleanliness of the room, they said they would have to call me back, but never did. A couple days later, we asked for some cotton swabs and they said they would have them sent to our room. They never did. I'm a Starwood Gold member, so I thought that may invite some concern for our happiness, but it only got us an unsolicited sales pitch for a new property they are building nearby. The room came out to be over $400/ night, so it was a fairly high price to pay for such poor service and a terrible room. I really would recommend looking elsewhere. We thought about moving to a different hotel, but the island was pretty busy. It's just a shame that they get away with this.

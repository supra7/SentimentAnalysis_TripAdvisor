It was quiet, but the interior is rough around the edges, and they did not have maid service and room trash removal daily. Over all, the property could use a paint job, new carpets, and we had rodent infestation in our top floor room. They advertised free continental breakfast, but when we were there, they only served coffee and tea, and instructed us to buy our own rolls from the bakery across the street. They lock the door late at night, but the security is otherwise lax, because when the front door is open, there is often no one at the front desk, and there is no security guard, so anyone can walk in and have access to hallways and rooms. The location is good, because it is very quiet, but close to the restaurants and attractions. But this hotel needs work.

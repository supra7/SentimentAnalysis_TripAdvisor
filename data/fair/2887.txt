I just came back form this resort and had a few comments about this place and the new ownership. I expected what the stars state which is 4 star hotel and really I experienced more 2 to 3 star service. My family decided last minute to take a trip there because my mother in law is terminally I'll and she just wanted to see hawaii one last time so I found this resort which Should Have measured up a 4 star with the likes of a westin which is a 4 star and we love westin properties but sorely it did not. Please keep in mind this hotel was very vacant with really a small amount of guests compared to the size of the property. We went out to the pool area to get towels for the beach and Waited for 5min 10min 15 min No one came so I told my husband to wait and I went to go try the beach front pool service I saw a guy there and asked him for towels he responded with "I can only give you 2 towels " I said I needed 3 his response was sorry I don't have any I stood there shocked that A no one really else was there and B that The cabana guy was not prepared with towels anyways I just stood there and he then said fine here's another towel so he had them under the counter the whole time bur did not want to give me another why I'm not sure. WoW I was pissed but what really got me angry was we realized our flight the last day was a late night flight they would not accommodate us they did allow my very Sick mother in law to stay in here room but the manager I spoke with did not seem to really care about our issue he was nickel and dimming to get an extra 50.00 to stay later which is unacceptable considering they charge a 25.00 a day fee for nothing it's a crock fee they slap on cause they can they give you water and free valet and a tiny gym we never used which should be included in my opinion that's like renting a room and charging for sheets on the bed geeshh!!! One last thing to comment on is in my experience the higher star properties if there is availably with automatically upgrade you but I guess that's 4 and 5 stars for you because although we got a ok room they had ocean front rooms just sitting vacant in this giant empty hotel what would it have hurt this hotel to have made it a really nice experience for us not to mention my terminally ill mother in law to have that type of view. Bottom line don't expect much here and you won't be disappointed. was at 12 we had a small child with us and asked if we could stay

After paying $240 a night plus $15 a night for parking I expected more from the Marriott. We were very unimpressed with the staff at the Marriott. When arriving, the door men watched us as we struggled to get our luggage out of our trunk and into the hotel until my husband asked for some assisitance. In the bar and grill we told the waitress that we were in a hurry in order to get to a basketball game and she proceeded to ignore us throughout our dinner, and we in fact had to physically track her down to get our check. When we departed we called ahead for car to be brought up which it was, but it was parked way down the driveway and as we once again struggled to take our luggage to our car no help was offered. Besides the unfriendly and unhelpful service throughout our stay the bed was extremely uncomfortable - sloped towards the middle. The bedding was beautiful but that didn't make up for a difficult nights sleep in the old bed. I will not be coming back again to stay when they charge this kind of money for what they offer.

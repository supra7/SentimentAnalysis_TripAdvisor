I made reservations here based on the many positive reviews that I'd read here. I wasn't expecting a modern, luxury room and had previously stayed in other older hotels in the downtown area, so I had reasonable expectations. Our check-in was late due to plane delays. We were assigned to a very small room that had an entrance inside an alcove which made it awkward for rolling in the luggage. The room was very dark when all of the lights were turned on and did not have adequate space for unpacking two suitcases. Upon entering, the room was quite cold as the thermostat was off; but the heater did not work at all even when turned on for more than ten minutes. I called down to the front desk and was informed that I could come downstairs to get keys for another room, but there did not seem to be anyone available to check it out. We changed to a room down the hallway which was a bit larger (which then made me wonder why we weren't assigned there initially). This room was more comfortable; but the heat couldn't be adjusted when on, so we had to keep the window open a bit. This made us more susceptible to street noise which sounded like clanging trash bins being collected at night. I didn't mind the small size of the bathroom which was plentifully stocked with toiletries including toothpaste, but the height of the sink vanity was quite low. The alarm on the clock radio malfunctioned the next morning, and we overslept to find no hot water available. TV reception was limited to local stations. The biggest asset of the hotel is its location. The lobby is charming. In the morning there was coffee available, and in the afternoon there were live musicians playing during tea and sherry service. The business center had computers and printer for free guest use. I am unsure whether or not I'd give this place another try. It would depend upon cost and availability of other options.

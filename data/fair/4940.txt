Stayed at the Affinia for two nights on business. I was shocked at how poorly the front desk handled my check-in and reservation. First couldn't find my reservation. Then refused to give me the negotiated group rate I was entitled to. WiFi code they gave me did not work. Took 24 hours for the mess to be straightened out and even then, no apology. Room was adequate, but overall experience was not. Also, as noted by others, elevator service was awful.

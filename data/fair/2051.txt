My family of five stayed at the Marriott Copley Place on July 4, 2008. We had made reservations months in advance and had been promised a room with a view of the Charles River and 4th of July fireworks. When we arrived mid-afternoon our room was not ready, and reception staff were not friendly. We did not get into our room until aroundt 5pm, and with two small children and one pre-teen this did not make for a good start to our vacation. The room was nice, and very clean, but did not have a view of the fireworks, which we had been promised. The hotel was full so no changes or compensation were available. This was very disappointing. Im not sure I would stay at this hotel again, and I am a loyal Marriott rewards member.

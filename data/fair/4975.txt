Constatnt pounding during daytime must be some sort of remodel. Plumbing was a disaster, I had to get maintaince man to showe me how to flush ( takes a bone breaking slam - not a twist or turn ). When anyone in the building flushed, small children in 3 states reached for the mother's hand in terror.

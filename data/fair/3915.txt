i was staying in the city for a few days and decided to book a room at the diva for my last nights stay, but after booking my room i discovered there was a construction company outside the hotel picketing for unpaid amount of $800,000.00 owed by personality hotels. i am in the construction business myself and did not want to cross a picket line, let alone put up with the noise of the picketers, so i promptly cancelled my reservation. i believe that people booking rooms at the diva should be notified that there are picketers outside their hotel.

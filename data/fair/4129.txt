We would not stay in the Inn again. On arrival we where told that we could attend a wine tasting and when we asked what time we where told between 5.00 and 6.30, the time was then 6.10. When we arrived in the dining room there were no staff to welcome you or tell where to find wine glasses or nibbles of which there where very little. This event is to welcome new guests and a nice idea but they only had to check to see that not all the guests for that day had arrived or once they booked us in come down to welcome us. This we found was the standard of customer service in the White Swan, the front desk never spoke to you coming in or going out and they never offered to help with the cases up or down the steep steps to the road. Breakfast was very limited, if you came down at the wrong time the food had not been replenished the selection was not good. Our room was large and the furnishings well warn and tattered with peeling paint. The windows did not all open and one rattled when the wind blew until we put some card in it. The bed was creaky and soft. After staying in a very good Portland hotel just before this one for the same price it was a shock.

Positives of being here: 1. Location ain't bad. It's off Sheikh Zayed Road. 2. Business Bay metro station is 2 mins walk so that is convenient. 3. Average breakfast with reasonable variety of food 4. Helpful reception staff Negatives: 1. Match box size rooms. 2. No Room service (understood since it's Express) 3. Bad house keeping. We waited for more than 12 hrs for 2 glasses to arrive to our room and finally gave up. I will not stay here again.

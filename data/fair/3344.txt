Recently stayed here with my daughter who was having a bridal gown fitting and we wanted to stay close to the bridal shop for early am appointment. First let me say the bed was comfortable however that was the only positive. the room was filthy. Carpet had really bad large stains everywhere. The room itself was small and the windows had no view except the roof with large rusty compressors on top. We had a window unit a/c attached to the wall. Hair was all over sheets and pillowcases had make up rubs on them. the worst was when the commode did not flush. We would put on our warm ups and used the lobby bathroom. We do not eat breakfast it did look ok but we were trying to leave so fast I did not even take my morning coffee. All this for $216.00. when I told the clerk all that was wrong she just said sorry. we LEFT NEVER TO RETURN!!! I had asked for a late check out needless to say I did not want it the next morning.

We were staying only one night and were most looking forward to lounging leisurely next to the beautiful pool on Sunday afternoon. When the elevator opened on the floor of the pool, we could already hear and feel the bass from the LOUD music and crowd. The pool was completely packed with drunk, tattooed twenty-somethings like spring break in Daytona. None of these partiers were paying hotel guests, but they were definitely treated better than any of the guests we saw there. We immediately left. Later that night we returned to the hotel patio and wanted a simple meal. Since the squid and quail eggs on their menu did not sound good, one of our group walked across the street to order some Food and bring it over. We were barked at by the manager twice for bringing in outside food eve though we were buying their pricey drinks and paying for rooms there. They finally were ok with the outside food once they realized we were NOT moving it and were still quite unhappy about the pool situation. On a side note, the executive chef of the restaurant did come out to see us and was the only pleasant person we spoke to. While we will still never return to this hotel, the chef did make that evening a bit better.

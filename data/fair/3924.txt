We spent five days at the Diva. First of all the staff were very accommodating. That part was good. The cleaning staff did a remarkable job each day. Of course, we encouraged that by leaving a tip. We told the front desk during check-in, it was our anniversary. They told us they would upgrade us to the 7th floor at no additional cost. We were delighted until we saw our room. I believe it was a handicap room, for it was small, but had a huge bathroom with safety bars everywhere. The room itself was so small, had we been large people we would not been able to stay in this room. We were constantly running into each other in this small space. The view was the pits too. The view we had in this one window room was the wall of the building. The street people seem to congregate more so on this street too. The pluses were continental breakfast and newspaper each day. The coffee was really good each day. Our room was quiet and the bed was nice and comfortable. Very clean room. The flat screen TV was nice too. This Hotel is within walking distance of the Bart and all public transporation. The shower was not that great either. And there is really no lobby. I would not stay in this hotel again. I think there are better offers for the money. Oh, the Mexican resturant next door Colibri was very good, but remember everything is ala carte. So when you think a $18.00 filet is reasonable in SF, be aware it's the steak only. Oh, yes make reservations. Very busy place. This Hotel is clean, but no frills whatsoever. The only big item is the flat screen TV.

Just returned from 6 nights at this resort. We quickly figured out that this place is VERY QUITE, when we arrived and there were less than 25 people in the lobby, INCLUDING STAFF! Instead of taking you to your room after check in, a "salesperson" is assigned to you to try to get you to set up a tour of the property. After a day of delayed travel, our yawns finally convinced her to let us get to our rooms. The property is nice, however everything is a walk. 1 bathroom in the pool area, only 2 drink areas, only 2 choices for food outside, a grill and a woodfire pizza area (this was one of the better choices). The buffet breakfast was decent. Dinner choices were the buffet (looked limited in choices did not eat here), the steakhouse/asian/italian combo restaraunt (not bad) and the Mexican restaraunt ( would highly reccommend this one). HOWEVER, if you are an active family, this resort IS NOT FOR YOU! Only outdoor activity offered was volleyball at 11am and 3pm. Had a soccer field, BUT NO BALLS!! If your idea vacation is to lay around and do nothing, I STILL WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND this place!! Service is spotty at best. If they are on the same level as the "Ritz Carlton" as the salesperson told us, they obviously have never been to the Ritz, or think we are stupid!

In Summary: Costly to reach & requires taxis to go anywhere. Room with no window or only 6" wide window right by the door. Aircon which will take an average hour to get room down to selected temp as fan speed inadequate. Unhelpful & uninterested staff at reception. Clean basic room (hotels classification deluxe). Basic amenities included (tea/coffee, air-con, deposit box). Minibar available at extra cost but resonably priced. We chose this hotel away from the city in order to have a nice view & quiet stay. The taxi cost 28$S in rush hour and the hotel location is not great because there is no MRT station or transport nearby so you have to use taxis to get everywhere. On arrival reception/hotel is not accesible directly from the car so you have to pull your suitcases uphill & along a paved path (not easy) for short distance approx 20m. Our room was then upstairs (no lift / porter or assistance). The 'receptionist' was not particularly polite or helpful although not rude at check-in. The room was clean with kettle tea & coffee included. Minibar available at reasonable rates. Room was extremely disappointing. The hotel's descriptions state "rooms overlooking scenic views". The views are not particularly scenic & you don't have a window to look out of anyway unless you you count a 6" wide slit of a window by the door. Overall I'd score it 1 out of 5 because it was clean.

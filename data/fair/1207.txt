Not what I expected. Charming from the outside however different inside. No elevators so if you have heavy luggage up the slim stairs you go. Not very safe to leave your luggage after you checked out (like most hotels around the area)(an alternative is leaving it at St Pancras and Kins Cross St. luggage storage). Most rooms had a share bathroom and shower which you share usually with 2 floors (6 other rooms). Breakfast is very basic but it is what you pay for. And the worst was television reception, just awful. No idea why they even have tv's. I stayed in 2 different rooms both with almost no signal. To access the hotel you need to ring the bell at the main door and wait for someone to come at the door to open it manually. There are better hotels in the adjacent streets but ask to see the rooms before you check-in. For the price i highly recommend going to a much better location. For example Bayswater has a hostel with private rooms in a better, cleaner, safer, cheerier location at a much cheaper price for the single rooms. For anyone staying for a few days stay away from Kings Cross hotels. Kings Cross is only for the person arriving at St Pancras to stay for 1 to 2 days TOPS.

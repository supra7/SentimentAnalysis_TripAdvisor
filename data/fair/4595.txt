Overpriced We stayed at Waikiki Parc in the ocean view room for 4 nights ($240/night with one night free). While the view is nice (although not a panoramic view, just a section between two tall building, it is nice nonetheless) and the room clean, about everything else I really have nothing nice to say. The property is not *on the beach* (it is a block away), which is not a big problem, but still there is a difference. And the price is just too expensive -- I really wish we had stayed somewhere else. On top of that, it does not include breakfast, they charge you $10 a day for internet access, and (get this!) $1 per *local* phone call. If you pay more than $200 a day, I think the least you should be entitled for at least free phone calls. The much humbler Sand Villa (where we stayed for one night) gives you a continental breakfast and free internet access for half the price. I would not stay at the Parc again.

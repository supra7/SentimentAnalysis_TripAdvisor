I stayed here as part of a business trip. My meeting was at this hotel. For the price at a "full service" hotel, I expected much more. Granted, it is a historic place, but for $250 per night what we got was the room which was quite small, had a view of the building and a tub that took 10 minutes to drain after a 5 minute shower. Internet access costs around $18 per day? There is a big fee to use the fitness facility as well and it is nothing special. The staff is very friendly however. We didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant...wasn't impressed with the menu for the prices. Walked 2 blocks to a historic italian restaurant and got a full dinner for two for the price of one entree at the hotel. If you do happen to stay here...there is a place called the Corner Bakery Cafe just down the block...great breakfast, coffee, sandwiches, pasta is ok, soups and cakes/cookies...good prices. (Breakfast with coffee was less than $10)

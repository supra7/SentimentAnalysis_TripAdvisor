I was totally looking forward to coming here and visiting. I got a great deal, the room was AMAZING, the spa staff was excellent but...since there will be a but for this review...5 out of 7 people that I came in contact with were HORRID! Checking in and out was a breeze and one of the bell hops was a gem but the 2 woman concierge that I asked help from couldn't be bothered. They were talking about their personal experiences that I don't think would be proper to discuss here. This quality of service it totally not what I would expect from the Trump name. Upon trying to checkout via my TV, since I was leaving extremely early and didn't want to bother them (I guess I forgot that's what they get paid for) the option wasn't working so I called down to the front desk to ask that they square away my bill and once again was greated by an extremely rude and condescending woman who told me I should use the TV option and didn't even let me explain that it wasn't working...maybe it wasn't just wasn't her night (oh right, she gets paid too). The last and worst experience was with the bell hop and his security buddy. They were so rude and mean to me when I asked to call a cab and where the ATM was located that I left in tears. Enough said...I'll NEVER return.

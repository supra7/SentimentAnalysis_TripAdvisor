I have to start by saying the staff was exceptionally nice. Especially the bell men and house keeping. Very warm and friendly, they went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. The room was small, needed some updating. The bathroom and tub left something to be desired although the duel shower head was great. The second day there, we became VERY ill with a stomach bug that had apparently been going around the hotel for quite sometime. We spoke to at least thirty people in the hotel who had the exact symptoms as us although no one on staff seemed to have heard a thing about it. (we flew in with 15 friends and no one on our plane became ill) judging by how often we were vometing, i would say our carpet would have needed a steam cleaning as would the rooms of the other sick people we spoke with. i thought i de post this in case others became ill also

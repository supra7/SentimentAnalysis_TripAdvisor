A lot of room for improvement at Clift... My friend and I stayed at the Clift hotel in early August 2008 for 4 nights, and were quite disappointed given the cost of the hotel. Upon arrival, there was repeated confusion about our resrevation and we were informed that the Clift cannot honor room information from Expedia (which made us wonder why they accept reservations from Expedia in the first place)After the room debacle was settled, we had to switch rooms on our second day after we had been kept up most of the night by a baby in the neighboring room and the paper thin walls provided no buffer. The hotel is very focussed on being a scene in San Francisco, but unfortunately this comes at the cost of service to customers. Upon entering the hotel on Friday night, the doorman asked if we were hotel guests or going to the bar, we answered that we were hotel guests, to which he stepped aside and let us open the door by ourselves...not the service you expect for a $350/night hotel.Overall, for the price, I would certainly suggest that there are far better deals in San Francisco...the walls are thin, the room furnishings while chic appear cheap, the service is so-so, and overall, the hotel has a lot of work to get to international high standards.The Asia de Cuba restaurant is outstanding.

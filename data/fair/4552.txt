sad decline i would tend to agree with the recent negative reviews,,this is a beautiful, but slipping, property,,,Overall, the staff seemed distracted and uncertain, in one case, clearly the uncertainty regarded the future plans of management. The pool is in the process of removing cabanas, resulting in the temporary loss of one third the pool space and a lack of shade and umbrellas. I agree with the reviewer who indicated that the Plumeria had declined. In addition to mediocre food, the staff seemed confused, In fact, overall, their seemed to be a lack of management oversight, resulting in confused and somewhat distracted employees, many of whom we remembered from previous trips. The signature restaurant, Hoku, reopened after remodeling, and once again, although the food was quite good the service was confused and distracted ( how can they forget to open the wine?).The rooms are still delightful, but a major upgrade is in order.

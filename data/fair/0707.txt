Good thing It only cost a base price of $50.00. I say base price due to all the taxes and fees that are added up when you get there. Hope you like walking...super long hallways and the parking garage all the way in the back (you have to pay for that too). For such an high quality hotel I was expecting more. No microwave or fridge? ($4 for bottle water) One cup coffee maker? I drink more than one cup by myself.

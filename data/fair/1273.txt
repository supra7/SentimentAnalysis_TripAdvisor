We came here for my birthday, and the room was tiny, with no window (just a tiny balcony off to the side) and no amenities or extras to brag about. I know they're going for minimalist design, but the room was depressing and the basics were missing. For example, we called down for aspirin when we had a headache and they "didn't have any". To me that's just unacceptable- I would expect that a Motel 6 would have some aspirin for us! Some of the staff were nice, but some were a little surly. This place is not worth the price.

The hotel itself was gorgeous, easy to find - right before Storrow Drive with amazing views of the Charles. However, upon arriving at 1PM for a wedding, we were well prepared to wait until 3PM (check-in) for our room. We sat in Fusion lounge - overpriced and typical, poor hotel food, until our room was supposed to be ready. We went down to the lobby at 3PM to find out that our room wasn't ready - and wouldn't be for another 30 minutes (or so we were told). It wasn't ready until 430PM! With a wedding in a couple hours, it was not a pleasant experience. The rooms were spacious, with a separate bedroom adjacent to the living room with "pull-out" sofa. The sofa did not pull out - it was broken and we tried for about 30 minutes until giving up and squeezing 2 people on the couch overnight. The TV in the main bedroom did not work. When checking out, we had 3 rooms all together. My parents room service was on our bill and our room service was on my sister's bill. Made for more of a headache during check out after minimal sleep on the couch. Although I highly recommend the property itself - I hope everyone else has less of a hassle than we did. I normally stay at Sheraton's and this was actually my first time at a Hilton, and was rather disappointed by our quality of stay.

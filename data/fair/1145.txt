I hesitate to write this review becasue some of this many be beyond the control of the hotel itself, but how the situation was handled was very poor. The staff at check-in was great and the room itself was very good. We also enjoyed our breakfast on the one morning we stayed there. We were booked at the Hotel Curious for 3 Nights, but after our 1st night we had no choice but to check-out. There was construction going on in the building connected to the hotel and the noise in our room was so loud you would have thought the workers were standing next to us. Voices, yelling, hammering, power drills, etc. It was HORRIBLE! When I asked/told the front desk about the noise it seemed as if theyvsimply could care less. Telling me, "Yes, there is construction going on, there is nothing we can do about it." While that may be true, a decent room where sleeping is possible is surely not too much to ask. They even refused to move us to a room without all the construction noise for the duration of our stay. I was shocked by this, especially after reading all the good reviews. The man working the desk, Mateo, was not helpful in the least and refused to take any blame for the hotel renting out this particular room, which was truly unbearable. I am very disappointed with this property, we relocated to the Hotel Turin down the street which was quite nice. It would have been a great place to stay without this happening, be sure to ask about construction before booking!

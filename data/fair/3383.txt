This hotel was the worst point of our trip. We thogth we payed for something better. An the only good that have this hotel is the great situation, very near Times Square. When I went the hotel was full, and shared areas were not enough for many people: the dinning room is ridiculous and the lobby also and when you would want to leave free a table for the people waiting in the door, you cannot stay on the sofas in the lobby because they were full of people. The food also was very bad. The staff wasn't helpful. We went to this hotel because it says that they have free internet access. But the signal doesn't arrive to all places. When I went to claim the girl in the front desk said that the signal was the same in all the rooms (????) and when I say that it was not true she started to get angry with me. Our room was very noisy because of the car traffic. But it not was the worst...

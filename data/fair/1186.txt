I have mixed feelings regarding this stay. It is mixed with some real treasures and some real dudes. Miguel Sotelo in the dining room was wonderful. He took great care in selecting our meals. He is an asset to the resort. Another great addition is the young staff. Particuliarly Corey, Jennifer, and Montego in the field activity's. They were great with the kids and were very enthusiastic in their jobs. Would I recommend this place: Yes and No.

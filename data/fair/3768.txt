I travel many times each month on business and the accomodations here were NOT 4 star anything. Very dirty room (our feet were black within minutes of taking our shoes off), fridge didn't work (drinks stayed warm the whole time) the tub didn't drain (after 5 minute shower you were standing in 4 inches of water) and we found a couple of bugs. :( Very disappointed with the room. The water park was good. The onsite restaurants were TERRIBLE. Never would recommend this place!

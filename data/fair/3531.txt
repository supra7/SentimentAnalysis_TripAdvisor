Many rooms in NYC are small but these are the smallest we have stayed in. The AC was terrible - they did replace the Compressor for the AC but that did not seem to help. We could not wait to leave. Breakfast service was also very slow. We waited about 45 min to 1 hr to be served. We have stayed at all of the other W hotels in the city and have had pleasant experiences. The location is good.

The front desk staff was excellent, but I felt my trip was downhill from there. When I walked into my room, a housekeeper who was getting off work was changing in my room and using my bathroom to do so. She said this was "normal" that they washed up in the last room. Really? But, she had to go grab some more toiletries, towels and laundry bags which she had used to replace in my room. This meant she was in another 10 minutes before I could settle in. Then, things were just inconsistent. Some days I had a bath rug, some days not. Some days I had lotion, some days not. I got a wake up call each day: the first day it was 35 minutes early and no second one (requested) received, the next day it was fine, the last day it was 10 minutes late. Meaning, I couldn't rely on the wake up call. I know this seem like little things, but when paying $400 a night you expect much better (and I have had better in many other hotels in this area). The room is terribly small - even for NYC - but I'm okay with that. It's also severely out of date (but, again, not a big deal). The service issues just really irritated me. Not impressed, I will not stay again.

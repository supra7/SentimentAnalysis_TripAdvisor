Stayed 2 nights, no staff to greet and help with bag, asked for quiet room, gave me low level room with traffic noise and flag that knocked on the window, loudest toilet I ever encountered. I stayed at other w hotels which was great but this is the worst w hotel, more like upgraded motel.... Find other true 4 star hotel.

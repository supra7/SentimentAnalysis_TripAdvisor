The Madras is cheap and clean but if your staying in a room on the noisy side of the hotel you won't get any sleep. Especially not in the weekends. We had to put up with some Indian singer going at it 'till 3 am. The breakfast is toast and jam in the basement. So if you stay here, request a quite room and you'll be just fine. We paid about a 100 Singapore Dollars for a double room per night.

Good but not my no 1! We booked the Casablanca on the strength of the reviews on Trip Advisor. We booked the Super Deluxe room . We arrive d late after an afternoon flight from the UK. Our room was at the front of the Hotel ,seemed incredibly small and very noisy-we mentioned to the front desk on our way out to a late dinner and they suggested we closed the window in front of the air conditioning unit! We realised on our return from Dinner that The Casablanca is surrounded by a huge construction site- we suffered this later as our sleep was constantly interrupted by the sound of trucks reversing into the construction site.. We spoke to the front desk the next morning and they agreed to move us to the back of the Hotel. A quieter room(altho the Air Con still very noisy) but no bigger and the bed squishy with cheap linen.The big positives are the really friendly staff and Ricks Cafe where you can grab a simple Breakfast or return after a hards days sightseeing for Coffee/Tea and Cookies or the highlight of the day -Cheese and Wine from 5.00pm to 8.00pm.Not enough though to make me return to The Casablanca on our next trip.Have to mention the fantastic experience we had flying Silverjet from the UK to Newark-the service far exceeds anything ever experienced on BA Club Class or Virgin Upper Class. The best airline food ever! I only ever want to fly Silverjet in the future -shame they only go to New York and Dubai.

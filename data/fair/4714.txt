Anyone booking this hotel is well advised to double-check what they will be paying for. A resort charge of $17 daily is levied on top of occupancy and state taxes. Our quoted room rate of $405 became $460. The resort charge was supposed to cover 'extras', most of which did not apply to us (ie free kids meals, car parking) and in any case are provided by most hotels as standard. In addition, although the external environment is good, the rooms and corridors were not of high standard. Balconies are too small to take more than one chair. Tea/coffee making facilities are a joke. The restaurant was no better than others on the beach, but the price of breakfast was actually double! The quality of information available was limited to whatever the staff could sell us, and even misleading at times. We felt we were being ripped off the whole time, and very quickly took to using restaurants and facilities off site. We would revisit Maui, but next time we will stay down the beach at the Hyatt Regency, and only visit to look at the beautiful Koi carp in the ponds. The Sheraton is not good value for money.

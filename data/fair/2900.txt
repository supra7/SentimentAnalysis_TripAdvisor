This is a very average and aging resort which could use an extreme makeover. Room was not ready on arrival (2PM Hawaii time). Asked them to please rush as we were tired. Went down to the only place to eat for lunch at pool side!!!!! Were told that they would call us on our cellphones when room was ready. Needless to say we never received a call. Went back to the desk after lunch and had to complain and then received the room immediately. Sound of jackhammers from our Lanai starting at 7:30AM and lasting to the afternoon. Hotel said it had available WiFi that I purchased but it was essentially unusable from my room. Essentially worked well only in the lobby. Small pool with limited restaurant availability especially during the day.

Stylish but overrated Arriving at Clift on Friday evening felt more like fighting your way through the pretentious crowd of local annabes?congregated in the hotel lobby and bars. Once we made it to the reception desk, the checking in was efficient. Room: the standard room we booked was small by European standards. The bed was large and comfortable; the bed linen was clean but showing its age (staining and wear holes) however it was changed at our first request. The bathroom likewise was very small. In fact, shaving was quite difficult because of the restricted space. The bathroom fittings were dated and stained and we did not expect to see a tired-looking bath-curtain in a hotel claiming a reputation for style. We dined at the Asia de Cuba restaurant. The service was attentive and helpful, the setting of the restaurant stylish but the food left us a little under-whelmed ?the quality and presentation did not meet the quality of the surroundings. The Redwood Room: stylish interior but at times ?noisy and crowded and the service was aloof. Bar staff needs reminding that rudeness and arrogance does not necessarily equal style or elegance. Overall, the location is good with Philippe Stark giving the interior some refreshing innovation. But this seems to be a hotel to be enjoyed by aspiring locals out to be seen rather than for the hotel guests themselves.

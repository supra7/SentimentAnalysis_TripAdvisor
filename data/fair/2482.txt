The check-in line was a maze and had ropes to herd you through the process. Not enough staff available. As a result, the bell captains were trying their best and it was hard to get an elevator quickly. The Lobby Bar was busy and very loud due to the crowds not like in the photos on the website. Strollers & suitcases were near various chairs. Tacky. Our room was tiny but renovated. Great bed! Tiny closet. The valet was always overwhelmed due to crowds. I feel that the place looked like they had given out coupons for a cheap rate. Do not stay here!

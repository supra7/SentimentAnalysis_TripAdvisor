Stayed here for a short overnight after a late flight. The rooms are fine and the shuttle driver was nice. But steer clear unless you want to listen to a chorus of trucks all night long. Try to turn on the fan to create some white noise? Forget about it - the fan would come on for a minute or two and then shut down. No matter what settings I tried. Noise insulation? Forget about it - or rather, the hotel designer forgot about it. Bottom line: If you're not sensitive to frequent blasts of noise from downshifting ttrucks at all hours, then you're fine. For the rest, try another Philadelphia airport hotel.

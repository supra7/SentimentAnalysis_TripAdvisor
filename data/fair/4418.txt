We reserved 5 rooms for our family reunion/vacation. Talked in LENGTH when booked them to make sure we could ALL be on the same floor. Was disappointed because they did not have the 1 bedroom suites with the couch that pulls out in the livingroom, but ALWAYS had good experiences @ other Candlewood Suites, so decided to stay anyways. Hotel clerk, ASHLEY, was an IDIOT, had NO CLUE AT ALL what was going on at any time & on the 3rd when we checked in the manager WAS NOT HELPFUL & SLIGHTLY RUDE too!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED in our experience there. We'd ask simple questions such as about the local fireworks & ASHLEY had NO clue. Not to mention they had to move 1 set of our family 3 times!!!! Each room that was given to them was DIRTY & not even done up yet. Mind you too, that 1st set of family members did not arrive until 6:30p.m!!! The floor was dirty in our room too & the other family members complained too. Also both mornings our breakfast selections in EVERY room was messed up 1 way or another. I will NEVER stay @ this place again & I WILL TELL EVERYONE I KNOW, NOT TO STAY HERE EITHER IN MEMPHIS!!!!

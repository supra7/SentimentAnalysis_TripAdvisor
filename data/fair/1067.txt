Stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels before , but this one doesn't deserve this at all. They did not offer normal parking you had to use the valet. Waiting time when you need your car was average 30 minutes. The checkin process was also very surprising since I ended up meeting somebody else with keys for the same room in front of the door also want to getbin his room. The checkin counter tried to explain us that the person who was a stranger seem to be in my booking and we have a room together , which we found very funny. Finally they found the reservation and the other person also got his room. The rooms feel a bit ran down and the furniture seems aged and hot some less good looking white spots on it which let you fantasize what might have happened on that couch. The restaurant in the hotel aren't great either, there was a very limited menu card for lunch and the whole atmosphere at the bar was more comparable to a train way station . Definitely a place you should avoid if you can in case you want to have a nice stay.

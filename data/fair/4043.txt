The room they gave us was near a machine room. So all day and night we heard these weird noises from there. I had to put a pillow over my head so I could sleep. I complained to the front desk about it and they blew me off. All of the workers there seems stuck up and would not even say "Hi" to you when they pass you in the hallway. I will not be staying there again.

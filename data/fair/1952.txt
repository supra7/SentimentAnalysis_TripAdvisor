I'll start off with the positive, becuase the Marriott Reforma is a beautiful hotel with well appointed rooms, a fantastic rooftop executive terrace, and generally friendly staff. Having said that, the management leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, and for that reason I am unable to recomment it. Upon check-in, I was told that because there were a total of 3 people staying in my room, I would be forced to pay a $45 USD surcharge per night. I originally booked my room using Marriott Rewards points (I am a Gold member), and was assured by Marriott that there would be no additional charges. The front desk, however, saw that there were 3 people on my reservation, and told me they had no choice but to charge the extra (and previously unmentioned) surcharge. I attempted to explain my situation, not only to the front desk worker, but also to her manager. They remained courteous, but were completely unresponsive, offering only "This is a franchise, we charge this fee, and there is no way we will take it off, even though it was not part of your original booking." They couldn't even get Marriott corporate on the phone. I will be in touch with Marriott USA, and will be fighting this extra charge, but it will be a hassle and a blemish on an otherwise great stay. Frankly, management should be embarrassed. I love Mexico City, and understand that when visiting a developing country western standards of hospitality and customer service aren't always adhered to. I had, though, expected such standards from Mariott. I was apparently, and unfortunately, mistaken.

Here on business with my airline. Had to come here since finding a room at this time impossible. Hotel looks fine from the outside but insde is as old as the Brady Bunch's house. Furniture and fixtures are from the 80's. My biggest problem though is the dampness of the room. When crawling into bed it is very damp aswhen you wake up from camping out in a tent. There is mildew in bathroom and all vents are filthy. I hd them change me rooms but second just the same. Have tld my airline crew scheduler and said I would rather sleep in termina than tis room. Hopefully will be out of here tomorrow

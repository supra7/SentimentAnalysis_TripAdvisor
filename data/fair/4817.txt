Arrived at the hotel after a long flight from Australia and found the hotel to be in an excellent location across from Quincy Market. Like other reviewers, we found the rooms to be a little drab with the carpet looking well worn and the decor was certainly behind the times (for what was supposed to be a luxury hotel). Generally we enjoyed our stay but for some reason during our stay our room key was deactivated and when we went to complain to the front desk they did not seem to be care too much which was a bit of a shame. The Hotel is relying on its location to get by but with a few upgrades around the place it would be a first class establishment.

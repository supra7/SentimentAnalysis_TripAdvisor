I stayed 2 nights at the Executive while in Seattle on business. The rooms are small but that was to be expected as it is a boutique hotel. I was not prepared for the size of the bathroom, however. I literally had to step into the stall shower to close the door. My room was obviously part of a suite at one time as there was a door to the adjoining room (blocked by a large TV) through which I could hear every word of the conversations my neighbors were having. The hotel offers free wireless which is nice but no desk on which to work. The bed was amazing, however. Very comfortable. Nice pillows. Great down comforter. And the air conditioning worked quite well too. Seattle's Best coffee house in the lobby was a great bonus. Plus you can't beat the location for the price. If these were my only complaints, I would stay here again. After all, you do sacrifice some amenities for price and charm. However, these are minor compared to the quality of the service I received at this hotel. I should have been prepared for poor service since, when I called to confirm a late arrival, they answered the phone with a plain "hello" instead of announcing the hotel. I arrived at 11:00 pm and neither one of the 2 young men behind the counter moved to hold the door or help me with my bags. The lobby is a few steps up from the elevator and, after checking in, neither of them moved to help me get my bags down the stairs either. They literally stood behind the desk and watched me struggle with them. The housekeeping staff was not much better. The room looked like it had been just neatened, not cleaned. The in room coffee pot was not washed out. The carpet was not vacuumed. Hopefully the owner of this hotel will read this review and shape up his staff.

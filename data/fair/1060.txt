The room they gave us was at first floor above the restaurant...First of all it was extremely small and the heat ventilator was out of order..We informed the reception about the problem and after 30min they sent us a "technician" who didh't speak english to fix it!! He didh't!But this was not the major problem....The major problem was the music and the noise from the restaurant below until 3am....Breakfast was mediocre for a 4star hotel and the staff was ok..near taksim square and metro station but not very easy to find...

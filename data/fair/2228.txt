I have never had worse hotel customer service than received from the Boston Park Plaza. After following their instructions, upon check-out, to get a copy of my bill, it has now taken me five long-distance phone calls and a fax to get this sent to me, and I still wait. This should be a routine 1-call procedure that the desk can handle, but not here. Throughout my stay the staff seemed, frankly, overwhelmed. The rooms are very small for the price (perhaps to be expected from an historic building), and varied in quality. Mine was small but recently renovated. Some of my colleagues had rooms they described as pits. I had to refuse one room myself that had not had a remodel in many years, had stained carpets, and reeked of smoke.

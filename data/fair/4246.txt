This was our second stay at the Commander. The first time was great. This time.... NOT SO GREAT!!! We had a clogged toilet 5 minutes after check-in that took two maintenance men over 3 hours to fix (because they disassembled the whole thing instead of just plunging it), a broken sofa bed, wobbly chair, and a hair dryer that shot a flame out of it when we turned it on! And the Skipjack grill is NO better! We went for happy hour. Ordered our first round of food (which was frozen pizzas and hot dogs). When it came out we ordered more for people that were going to be joining us. Waited 45 minutes and it never came! Plus there were only 3 other people at the skipjack at the time! Needless to say this was an awful experience!

We are from Louisiana and had a hurricane coming in our direction. We were issued a mandatory evacuation order so we booked two rooms at the Ramada. I booked the rooms through Expedia; BIG MISTAKE! The reservation was originally a four night stay, but because the evacuation order was lifted after two nights we checked out early. The hotel assured my mother that she could contact Expedia for the refund for the remaining nights. I contacted Expedia several times and received unsatisfactory service several times. Finally, I was able to speak with a rep that was helpful. He contacted the hotel for approval to issue my mother's refund and was denied by the hotel because apparently the rate was a special rate and my mother had to stay for three nights. I told him that she could be charged for the extra night and be refunded for the fourth day. The hotel would not help. Expedia did issue my mother a $50 hotel voucher (that she will probably never use!) in the end. I also tried contacting the Ramada customer service and they were not helpful either. So, my advice is if you are an evacuee for a hurricane or any other act of God, DO NOT STAY AT THE RAMADA. They will not be sympathetic to your situation.

My sister and I stayed in a two double bed room on the third floor (305) We requested a room on a higher floor, but none were available upon check-in. I've read reviews you can hear street noise on the lower floors. The room was very noisy and I couldn't get any sleep. If you're a light sleeper, go with a higher floor if you can get one. Room was nice (at time of walk in), but small. Bathroom was small as well and didn't have enough towels for two people. When we closed the curtains, I noticed several stains. They were dark reddish brown in color. I'm assuming they were blood stains. I was disgusted. The phone's earpiece was visibly dirty and there was a hair in the bathtub, before we used it. I left my comments about the room with management and haven't heard back. Location was great, close to shopping and the market. Parking was $21 a night, but a good deal since other lots are pricier and street parking is scarce. Check out is at noon and parking was good until 5pm. There is a grocery store across the street and a starbucks and seattle's best coffee 2 -3 blocks up on Lenora. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Food was good and service was great! Seattle Times paper was delivered every morning. Internet service is not included in the price of the room and cost $10 a day. If you're looking for restaurants in the area try The Icon Grill on 5th and Virginia and the Pink Door at Post Alley, 1st and Stewart.

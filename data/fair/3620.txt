The W hotel chain has created a magnificent marketing brand. When you set food in the lobby of the W at Lex and 49th the brand is perfectly on display with its energenic and busy bar to its sleek and ever so cool front desk. One can't help but think that this is "the place" to stay and be seen in midtown Manhatten. Wrong. It all ends with and in the lobby. Past the lobby this W hotel might as well be a highway motel. The rooms are old, not particularly clean, dark, bleak and just plain worn out. The photos someone else posted are accurate. There are at least 3 better hotels, The Marriott, DoubleTree and Waldorf Astoria, in the same area. What the W does well in other cities is not duplicated here. The was our first and last visit and was based on an American Express promotion. We will and you should stay elsewhere. You know, one would think someone with Starwood would review the comments on this page and act. That speaks volumes for Starwood and its new CEO.

I arrived on Sunday evening and I was really hungry, the hotel would't serve food because it was sunday. The reception refused to charge my phone (all I had with me was a USB charger and no laptop) At the conference the food was all fish with no choice, starting with raw fish, followed by clam pasta (both I couldn't eat as I am pregnant!) Staff were rude, so much so that myself any many of my colleagues checked out 2 days early.

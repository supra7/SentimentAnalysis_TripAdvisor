We had another nice weekend at the Queen Anne just after New Year's, but we did learn a few things. First of all, never stay at the end of the hallway!! We had people coming and going at all hours of the night, slamming the door. We were also awakened every morning by the garbage truck from the restaurant out back. Way too much noise, especially if you're not used to it. Next time we will book in the middle of the hotel. The hotel was the same as last time--charming, quirky, definitely old-fashioned. The have probably the smallest queen-sized bed on planet earth but oh well. The price is definitely right! And we love the walking distance to great restaurants, shops, etc. Metropolitan Market and Safeway are very close.

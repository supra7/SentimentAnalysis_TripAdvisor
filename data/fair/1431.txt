Located close to all the major sites in Hollywood. We had a king room on the 6th floor that was more like a dungeon. It had a small 2'x3' window above head height that looked out under a stair at a wall. The HVAC unit sounded like a freight train and the bed was sagging in several places. Internet was sketchy at best. All in all, this made for a very unpleasant two nights. Adding to this was our gross disappointment with the "sights of Hollywood". Nothing here I would want to see again.

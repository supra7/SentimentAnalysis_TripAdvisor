My teenage daughter and I enjoyed our stay in New York but probably would not stay here again. If you want to save money and want to be close to the theatres and crowds at Times Square and only need a place to sleep and eat breakfast then consider this hotel. The room was nicely decorated and reasonably clean with the exception of the windows. Absolutely filthy on the outside. I guess with all the pigeons there must not seem much point? There wasn't much to see but still not very nice. Plumbing upstairs makes noise which was tolerable when we were awake but at 4:46am was a bit much. Since the rooms are quite small you sleep near the door and can hear people talking in the hallways. Light sleepers should run the a/c as it helps mask the other sounds. Staff were generally polite; however, one desk clerk wasn't very friendly and when a street person (several sleep next door at the church) followed me in asking for $ he didn't even ask him to leave! Continental breakfast was pretty good and we never had to wait long for a seat. Don't bother taking the elevator down unless you absolutely have to; usually much faster to walk, even from the ninth floor. Two free computers in the lobby were a bonus.

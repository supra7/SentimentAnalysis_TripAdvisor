We knew when booking this trip that it would be crowded, expensive and a big commercial hotel...we took the chance for the water slides and pool for our 5 year old daughter. with a one flight option from CA -the food is mediocre, expensive and NEVER HOT -I had better nachos at Taco Bell then the cold, soggy ones served to me by the pool -it took us 2 elevators and 15-20 minutes to walk to the pool -we had to get up at 6:30am, race to the pool, and stake out chairs by the pool, the pool opens and 7AM and the mad chair rush begins -snow cone $8, bag of popcorn $6 -50M renovation-where, maybe in the rooms, so they must have been real dumpy before? -drinks are $13-15 each -we paid $175 each for a new years casino celebration...the sprinklers came on half way through and soked us and our blackjack table-oh and we got 1 glass of champange! -as a family of 3 we averaged $300-500 a day in extras and we ate out some of the time -breakfast for 3 at a buffet $80 with tax and tip -handles were falling off our dresser in our room -room service dishes sat out side of our room and other rooms for hours even overnight I would reccomend a condo on the beach and come to this hotel ask for a day pass and use the slides and pool-which were fun With all due respect to the families that we met that return year after year....There are many more wonderful warm islands in the rest of world!

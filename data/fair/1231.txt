We found our room to be clean and in order. While the sheets were clean and the mattresses comfortable, the blankets were old & scratchy. There were no amenities to speak of, we chose the hotel for it's proximity to University of Pennsylvania. The heat & a/c worked but they were somewhat difficult to fully control. This hotel was the best price in our desired location. While it was not a great hotel, it served its purpose.

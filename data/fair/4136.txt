We have stayed at both White Swan and Petite Auberge, a sister property, in the past, but not for several years. We were quite disappointed in our recent stay, especially compared to our last stay, when it was still a "4 Sisters Inn." The staff varied from indifferent to excellent. Our room was attractive but very dusty and our bathroom was especially so (corners, towel bars, etc.). We only had turndown service one of our 3 nights there. It was very noisy and our bed sagged in the middle. The morning breakfast was good, but not "like it used to be." Next time we'll stay somewhere else.

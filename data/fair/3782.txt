We are currently staying at AGR and there is nothing resort about thus place!! We are a group of 7 women who wanted to escape and lay by the pool, well what they don't tell you us that their main attraction (the oasis pool and waterpark) is only open on saturday!!! So here we are without a car and there is only a "family pool" open! So that means no service, no snack bar no drinks nothing!! To top it off the sign in front of the watermark say they were open from 11-4 today a gate was open and so we went in then a security guard came in and told us we were trespassing!!!!! Choose a different resort if you are looking to relax by the pool!!

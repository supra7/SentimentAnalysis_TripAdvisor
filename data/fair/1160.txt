So many problems, so I went to front desk, only one worker, she wouldn't help at all. Very strange, there wasn't any other worker there. After our vacation I called and wrote the owner an email, but sadly I never received a response. POOL, BAR and FITNESS CENTER were CLOSED when we arrived and we were told it's only open during daylight. BIG disappointment when you have a child that came to swim. And there is NO BEACH and no water access unless you go to the swampy river area where I saw 2 snakes. NO jacuzzi, no customer service. Upon checkout, we were WAY overcharged. Once again, the front desk worker, said that's what we already charged you.

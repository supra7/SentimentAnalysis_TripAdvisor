Nice but too expensive for what you get Efficient and friendly service, convenient location. Clean hotel in good state of decor. Room fairly small, no bath (just a shower). Ancient TV took up too much of what little space there was. Wine  cheese is a nice touch, but very basic breakfast (fruit, cereal, pastries). Interesting Moroccan theme - some would say tacky but I thought it was quite fun.Bill (including tax) came to almost $1000 for 2 nights. It may be naive of me given the location and the time of year (holiday season), but for this price I was expecting something amazing, and what we got was just a nice little quirky hotel. For that reason I would not return.

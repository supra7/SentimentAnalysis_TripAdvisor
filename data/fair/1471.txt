The trip down the hall from the check-in desk to elevator shows the very dirty and worn carpet. Room furninshings are worn and dated. No refrigerator like in most Hamptons. Location is excellent but try to get a room on the side away from Walnut Grove Road. Breakfast served is very good. They charge extra for a king room rather thatn 2 beds. I stay at Hamptons frequently and this is not one of the best.

here is the verdict: front desk: Two people when i came in. One, would not even acknowledge me room: tiny, but clean bathroom: Water pressure???? bedding: small queen size (me and wife) room service: $39 for a continental with dry croissants and pastries right out of your local gas station restaurant: good experience. i recommend lobby: party central, if you are into it... elevators: slow, small, a general complaint from almost everyone that we talked to. last but not least, there is a cleaning lady in charge of doing the revolving doors. When she is there,she has no problem in not letting anyone through it. Hospitality anyone???? needless to say...after two days we moved to another property.

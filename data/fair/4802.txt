We stayed here for three days and two nights to attend a wedding that was held at the hotel. The weather was hot during most of our stay, and our room's air conditioning (set at 72) only kept the room between 76 and 79 degrees on the second and third days. We called and had service people come three times in attempts to fix the air conditioning, but nothing worked. However, that inconvenience paled when compared to the conditions in the room where the wedding and subsequent dinner were held. Temps felt like they were in the high 80's or low 90's in the room, and the air conditioning had clearly not been working properly for hours before the ceremony. While every couple wants their wedding to be memorable, I doubt this was the memory the bride and groom anticipated. At checkout, I mentioned my unhappiness due to the air conditioning problem in our room and was given a very modest discount on the charge for that day. Some of the staff were very helpful, others were not helpful. The internet charge ($10 per device per day) strikes me as outrageous since even budget motels offer free internet access. Room was somewhat noisy, but given the location I thought that was to be expected with the crowds on the street below.

On our honeymoon we stayed at the Maui Prince for 5 nights. The staff was pleasent and upgraded our room to an oceanview for our honeymoon. We really liked the amenities offered at the beach, however they are for an extra charge. Great snorkling around the beach! The staff was pleasant, and the rooms were clean but really in need for a little TLC remodeling. They were a little "creepy", & we had a hard time relaxing in our room. We expressed our concern, there really wasn't too much they could do (except bring us a plate of choc-strawberries) to apologize for any inconvience to us. All in all, we were happy to leave onto our next hotel (next time we'll stay at the Marriott)

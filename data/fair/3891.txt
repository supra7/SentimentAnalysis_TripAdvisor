I had a completely different experience at the Beach Cottages. It looks like a good place for families if you can get one of the beachfront cottages, however my boyfriend and I stayed in the building that looked over a parking lot. When we arrived there were a bunch of frat boys yelling at each other on their balcony, getting drunk. No big deal except this lasted for most of the afternoon and night. The staff wasn't overly nice, the room was pretty depressing and we had someone from the staff walk into our room twice without knocking. We're both laid back people so it wasn't that big of a deal but I was really disappointed after reading all of the good reviews and having a totally different experience. Since I often check this site before travelling I wouldn't want someone else to end up in my position.

I go to New York a few times a year; I know it is expensive. But this place is just awful. First they allow pets and the carpet in my room bears that out. Second, the room is sooooooo small, like 10x10. No Armwar, just a hanging "port a cubby" in the closet. The restaurant isnt open for lunch and dinner on the weekends. I asked for breakfast room service to be delivered at 7:00 a.m. It finally came at 745 and was cold and wrong. The only good thing about this place is the lobby lounge and the staff. Stay away, if you have to pay $300 a night as i did

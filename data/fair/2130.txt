When you hear the name Park Plaza, you think you'll actually get Park Plaza quality. This was not the case during a recent stay. The mattress was in desperate need of being replaced. The towels were thread bare and everything smelled musty, like an old gym locker room. The amenities cost the same as many of the other Park Plaza hotels I've stayed in, but the quality of the hotel was NO where near any of the others I've stayed at before. I'd skip this one if at all possible.

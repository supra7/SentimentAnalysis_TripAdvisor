The lobby is beautiful, the beds were comphy......Our first night the power in the Bathroom went out, I was told it was probably because everyone was trying to get ready.....Some employees are nice some aren't. The manager at Cascades Bar wouldn't let my kids order from the kids menu because they weren't 12 or under even though we offered to pay more. There isn't a good family restaurant. Take the trolley or walk beachside to Whalers Village it's worth it. Two burgers and appetizers and drinks and 2 side orders of miso soup ran us about $150.00 I responded to a customer survey a few days after I returned home and received the standard "we will look into your concerns" 3 weeks later no response. When we checked out no one said how was your stay, or thank you for staying with us. We couldn't get the kids into the lei making class, they are booked so early in the morning I was told that I had to call before 7am the day of the class. It was a beautiful property, but then they all are. Nothing makes this one stand out from the rest.

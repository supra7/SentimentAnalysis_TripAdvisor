We just got back from a 3 day stay at the GW. Like the previous entry, we were "nickle and dimed" for everything! With the expensive room rates and overpriced, mediocre food, you would still expect outstanding service. Not the case, service was horrid. Even the conceirge and Grande Spa front desk staff were unpleasant and unaccomodating. At one point in the middle of the night, staff was dragging what sounded like furniture across the top of the room waking us all up after midnight and for over an hour. The waterpark was out of control and not relaxing at all. A staff member even hurled a football to his co-worker and nearly knocked down my young child. I would never stay there again.

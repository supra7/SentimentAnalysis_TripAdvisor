I am very late in writing my review, but want to throw it out there anyway. I stayed here with my boyfriend at the end of April. We only stayed two nights, as we were en route to visiting family. Thank goodness it was only two days! At the low rate, I wasn't expecting much. The room was small, but clean. The worst part, as many others have commented on, was the lack of hot water. No one said anything when we checked in, even though there had been no hot water for days, according to other guests. We were alerted to the fact from the signs posted in the hallways. The bathrooms were also not cleaned regularly. The dirty towel that was in the bathroom when we checked in was still there when I left after 2 nights. On the positive side, the location is fantastic. The subway is nearby and the neighborhood was very safe. I really hope they get things together; it would be a great budget place to stay if they can work the kinks out!

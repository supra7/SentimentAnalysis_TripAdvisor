We have stayed at the Millennium Bostonian in the past and liked it very much. It has been two years since our last stay. We experienced unbelievable problems during this stay. We should have been tipped off when the front desk staff, who were normally friendly in the past, did not even acknowledge us when we entered. And we were the only ones waiting. One front desk person was busy with a guest but the other one was just chatting to another employee. 1. The first room we stayed in had a shower that did not work. Unfortunately, we discovered this the morning after arrving and spending our first night there. As a result, we had to be moved to another room that morning. 2. After being out and about all day we arrived back to find out we had no clean towels nor housekeeping service. 3. When we tried to call to report this, the room phones were not working (they worked that morning.) 4. Then the lock to the room failed and took them over an hour to fix!! They offered to move us to another room but we were leaving the next morning and did not want to change rooms again. They solved all of the repair problems and made an allowance on our bill. 5. But the next morning, upon checking out, we noticed a minibar charge on our bill when we never used the minibar. All this in only 2 days!!!!!! The decor in the hotel and rooms is lovely. And the location is wonderful. The lounge is beautiful. The bartenders and waitresses are the friendliest people in the hotel. The hotel certainly did not meet up to its prior standards. We never had problems in the past. This time the stay was almost a disaster. We are afraid to return as guests of this hotel. Who knows? The next stay could be Trouble Times Ten!

Its midnight and my walls are shaking from a quincinera party they have booked on 38 th floor. Also a party in a nearby room with pot smoke. Ive called security 4 times. They say these parties go til 2 am sometimes. Ive had to relocate occupants from one of our 6 rooms and was told by bellman they get lots of partiers every weekend. Im going to write tremaine and write reviews to not book your conventions here if you want to be with decent classy people. I have been trying to sleep for 3 hours now as i have to get up at six. Was told by the bellman that people pay a lot of money to party in those suites. Guess their convention biz isnt as lucrative as their pot smoking and quincinera clientele.

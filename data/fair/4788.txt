I really wanted to like this hotel, but it was so dated. Our first room had a bizarre configuration that was crowded and didn't allow for TV viewing from the bed. The TV's were actually very small and old. No flat screens in these rooms. The decor was dated, not traditional and some of the furniture was stained. The bathrooms had plastic curtains which I do not expect to find at a 4.5 star property. On the positive side, the breakfast and the sheets were great. There are too many hotels in Boston to stay here.

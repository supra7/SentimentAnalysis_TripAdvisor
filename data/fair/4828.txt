We stayed three days in Grand Tahir Hotel in the beginning of May. The best features of the hotel were location and the lobby. Hotel is near Aksaray tramstation and walking distance (1km) from Aksaray metrostation (easily accessed from Atatrk Airport). Breakfast was poor and room was really small. We stayed in twin bed room and I recommend to choose double bed room, while it looked bigger. Bathroom was not 3* standard, more likely 1* (old, sewer smell came into the bathroom, showers were originals, etc.) Service was quite poor as well and it was difficult to get any smiles from staff. If you want to stay in good location and don't mind the shabby settings, I recommend. Othervise, I recommend to choose some other hotel.

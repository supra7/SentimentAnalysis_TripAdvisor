Check in was fast and easy...food was very good....but thats where the good points stopped.After checking in to the prefered club we were we were walked over to another person who started to try to set an appointment for a sales pitch to buy weeks.which we decided not to attend...good move talking to people around the pool who were tied up for 2 to 3 hours of sales pitching.We had checked in to our ocean front room which we found smaller we expected Going to breakfast we selected a spot at the pool to come back to only to find our things moved and others in our chairs..We were informed by the chair guard that we only have 30 min. from the time you pick a spot till they are moved.....a 6 0r 7 min walk to the main building and the same back only leaves about 12 min to have breakfast. The hotel over booked and were offering to take our room back and give 3-4 days to use in the next year...large corporate partys..loud and roudy people doors slaming at night AND GIRLS YELLING we had to call security and found that we were the fourth room to call.we thought we were at the wanker county family reunion....If you are looking for romance,quite,and good music this is not for you! We stayed at a compeditor hotel and loved it for the fourth year in a row but wanted to see if there was some place better...there was not.The night club played ac/dc LOUD ROCK people dancing on furniture not our cup of tea, Only 1 pool for swimming our other resort had seven...very few smiles on the help..we were not use to that where we came from even the gardners smiled and ALWAYS said hola and good day......WE WONT BE BACK!!!!

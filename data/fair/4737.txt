Let me start by saying the property looks great even though it is in the middle of a war zone it stands out like a flower and it is close to downtown and this oxbow market which is great. So my partner and I pull up and are greeted by the valet they were very nice but overwelmed. We went inside and saw a concierge on both sides which was nice. I then went to the front desk to check in and the only thing I can think of is new people. It took 30 min to get through the process and I think the poor young lady sweated through the entire thing. I saw a short hispanic gentlman walk out look over her sholder smile and walk away I think he was a manager by his difference in uniform. I then asked if they were busy she said know I asked if I could be upgraded she looked around and then said no. I said can I speak to your manager she said he just went to housekeeping I said well how about the GM she said he is in a meeting. at this point it was 5:30 so I figured he went home. I said ok went up to my room which was over a loud area I dont know what but it faced the street. I went down to the bar to have a drink before i went to complain. This is were it gets really interesting my partner asked if they had a GM on property at the bar and the guy said "he is at the end of the bar" he pointed at a grayish haired gentleman. My partner was going to go over to him and I said dont worry about it lets have a good time. So after a hour we noticed he had about 6 glasses of wine and was flirting with every woman at the bar. I said i guess thats the meeting the young lady was talking about. All in all nice hotel but the GM needs to work on service instead of working on drinks at the bar. I still would come back especially since the poor girl signed me up for SPG.

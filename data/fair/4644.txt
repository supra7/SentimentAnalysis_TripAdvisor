My wife and I spent two nights at the Maui Lu Sept. 22 & 23, just to take advantage of the kama'aina (Hawai'i resident) rate of $81 a night, and because the property has been sold and will be closing in 3 weeks to be demolished and razed to the ground - a new time share to occupy the site - as reported in the Maui News on-line Oct. 10 edition. Suffice it to say that in my opinion it's about time; and in my wife's opinion it's way past time; to bid aloha o'e to the Maui Lu. So if you're determined to stay at the Maui Lu, do so now - as no reservations can be made after Nov. 11, 2008, the last day of busuness for the Maui Lu. Aloha o'e, Maui Lu. Aloha o'e.

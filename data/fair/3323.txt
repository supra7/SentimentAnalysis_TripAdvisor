I had high hopes for this hotel, but it missed by a long shot. The location was nice and the courtyard was beautiful. But the room was disappointing. We stayed in a room with two doubles. The room was dark, dingy, and small. There was barely enough room for us and our bags. The bedding was old and looked as if it came out of grandma's attic. There was also mold around the rim of the toilet. Won't be staying here again.

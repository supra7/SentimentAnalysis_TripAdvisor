I stayed there for 3 nights! What an experience! First of all the hotel is not for handicap persons. The receptionist -very polite- but most of the times was a kid that he just knew how to say "yes" and "wait", so to call someone else that could understand me. I stayed by the reception on the first floor so I had some noise. My room was cleaned only the first day. The towels and bed linen were old! Very old. Full of hols. There was only one socket for your electronics. They were even turning the wi-fi internet connection off at nights!!!! But the real problem was the cold! I have never been in a so cold hotel room. And people trust me, I jave travel alote in my life! I had to sleep with my coat as there were no blankets and I couldn't find someone to explain me the situation. Even a very economic hotel, I wouldn't visit it again in the future.

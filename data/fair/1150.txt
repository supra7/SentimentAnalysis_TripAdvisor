My husband and I stay in Key West at least 2-3 times a year. This was our first time at Parrot Key. If fun is your aim don't stay here. It is not near the nightlife unless you consider Home Depot and Walgreens nightlife (they share a parking lot with the hotel and we were told if we couldn't find parking we should park in Walgreens parking lot).. It is a completely non-smoking hotel and this is made very clear whether you smoke or not by the threats of fines you were made to sign when checking in. The decor was very "bubble art" mixed with cheap painted furniture. Basically this is a time share with lots of rules and restrictions and a hotel staff that is more hall monitor than gracious host.

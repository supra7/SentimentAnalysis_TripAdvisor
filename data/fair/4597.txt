hmmm That Smells Odd Stayed at the hotel while In Waiki on business, the hotel is located at the end of a dark ally in a construction zone, with the hotel itself being partially under construction (no resturant/bar). Major complaint about this property was when I initially checked in I was given a room that was infested with mold and mildew. Eventually after complaining to the staff I was given another room in which i was not able to detect any mold or mildew odor. Aside from the smell, the hotel itself is generally clean, with a very efficient staff. In the event that you are looking for a hotel for a romantic vacation I would suggest that you absolutely look else where, I repeat do not stay here if you want you want a happy spouse. If your just in town on business for a few days, the facilities are just OK.

I called this place to make reservation because I wanted to book a oceanview room to watch fireworks from our room!! So kids would enjoy and would not be stuck in traffic for hours after fireworks!! The lady assured me I could see fireworks from that room. Once I got there checked in and they told me I can't see fireworks from that room but they will give is free shuttle to space needle but we will have to take taxi back cuz thru don't have shuttle after 10. Space needle didn't even have fireworks this year!!! I paid $350 a night for the room and got yo see nothing and I was gone most of the evening somewhere else!! When I asked why did they give me wrong info? All they had to say is " there's a comment card in the room please write your concerns" wow!!! Major disappointment!!!

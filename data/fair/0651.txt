Stay away At the end of June 2007 we stayed in a smoking room. Fortunately the window opened, which helped for us non-smokers. The settee was burned as well as an iron sized hole on the armoire. There were numerous burn marks on the carpet. This is an older hotel that is going through a remodel stage. Unfortunately, the remodel contractors are doing a really poor job, and the hotel is letting the new improvements go as soon as they are installed. The front desk crew is polite and nice for both the am and pm shifts, but the hotel is poorly maintained and as mentioned before, the remodel contractors are amateurish at best. As an example, when we went to the complimentary continental breakfast, there wasn't much left except a few stale pieces of bread. A guest had taken what was left in rather large bag, and nothing was being replenished, despite the early morning time. The newly laid carpet was buckling. The exercise room was lamentable, and seemed to be a storage area for excess room furniture. I really hope that the ownership really looks at what is going on with this property, as a lot of money seems to be poorly thrown here.

Located directly adjacent to central expressway this Residence Inn is not what I expect from a Marriott property. The freeway noise never stops! We were given a room with an exterior hallway. Not good for those traveling with children. Friends who stayed at the same time we were there reported dirty kitchens, even after housekeepjing supposedly came to clean. We had dirty silverware in our unit. We also ran out of hot water on two occasions. Under no circumstances woul I ever stay here again.

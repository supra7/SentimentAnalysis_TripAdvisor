well, we booked our hotel through Thompsons travel agents, and checked it out on the internet before going. once we arrived our first impressions were that it was very dark and we found it hard to make out the next step up to the lobby. The darkness made it look like a seedy brothel. however the good points were, very convient to subway station. doormen always in attendance. rooms almost clean even though we had problem with our toilet. the water was either boiling hot or freezer cold, no imbetween. The pipes in the room were very noisy and we were woken by them at 4.30 am (not impressed). Loved the hairdryers in the bathroom. towels not large enough and not enough. the bar (once it opened) was very nice, not expensive and the bar maid was very pleasant and friendly. State of the art t.v with plenty of channels , not that you have time to watch telly in NYC. NO BED BUGS FOUND!!!!!!!!

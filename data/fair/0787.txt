Talk about a tale of two hotels: The Good HGI and the Bad HGI. If you're into location and a clean, comfortable room, enjoy the Good HGI. Harbor East is a great spot - literally steps from the best Baltimore can offer. You can spend an entire weekend within a half-mile radius of the hotel and never run out of things to do. It's all there for you: Inner Harbor, Fells Point, Little Italy, water taxis, the aquarium, Starbucks, movies, live theatre, Maryland Athletic Club (MAC) and unique, upscale shopping. The hotel is priced right - even a bit of a bargain for Baltimore, and the smallish-rooms are bright and attractive. The only potential negative is that by Christmas the water view from the harbor-facing rooms may be blocked by the rising Four Seasons/Legg Mason towers. If you need anything, anything at all, from the front desk, welcome to the Bad HGI. The attitude of the employees of the Bad HGI is somewhere south of indifferent. Regardless of the issue, you will be confronted with an unsmiling clerk with attitude. You will never hear "I'm sorry" regardless of the level of problem or disappointment you experience. Need a taxi? Well, we're too busy to call for you, but you can get one over at the Marriott you're told. Looking for a newspaper? No, we don't provide them, but you can get one over at the Marriott you're told. The obvious response is why am I staying here and not the Marriott? Call the front desk from your room for assistance - good luck getting someone to pick-up (although after about 40 rings, we called on our cell phone - holding the endlessly ringing internal phone in the other hand - and the call was answered in one ring. Bad HGI!

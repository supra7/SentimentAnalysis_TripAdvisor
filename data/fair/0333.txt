Stayed here for four days in April. Very disappointed. First, there is a MAJOR construction project going on across the street. They blow the whistle (literally) at 7:30 and the noise does not subside until the end of the day. I am amazed that the hotel did not disclose this. Second, this hotel has no soul. It is constructed of cheap materials...kind of a hotel IKEA, if you know what I mean. Everytime we left the hotel our keys would de-magnetize and after a while we learned to just stop at the desk on the way back to the room to have them re-programmed...a bit of a hassle as we would have to "wait our turn". They did not re-fill the mini-bar every day. And last, when Saturday finally came and they could not do construction across the street and we could sleep in, the maid service came knocking on our door at EIGHT AM (!) despite that there was a newspaper outside our door (we obvioulsy had not opened our door yet). I would never stay here again. There are so many great hotels in Seattle and this is just not one of them!

The hotel is conveniently located near the Vieux Port, Rue St. Denis, etc., but its location right behind the bus station (a lot of bus drivers stay here, by the way) lacks any charm and is VERY noisy, at least if you have a room facing the street, like I did. The staff is friendly (they happily watched my bicycle while I ran upstairs--there's no elevator, by the way--to grab something from my room, and they also happily lent me the desk phone to make free local phone calls), and the place is clean enough, but the interior, furniture, and all details are badly in need of a renovation. The shower rod and towel rod in my bathroom kept falling off, and there were water damage stains on the ceiling above my dresser. The staff told me they were planning on renovating some rooms soon. Breakfast, which is included, is barebones--white bread, butter, jam, canned orange juice, coffee, and that's about it. Overall, despite the pleasant staff, I wouldn't recommend this place for the price (about CAD$ 80 per night.)

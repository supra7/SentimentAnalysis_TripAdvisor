My husband and I booked this hotel as a well priced centralish hotel, in a good area. The price was right, and service great, but we found the bed to be horrid, traffic noise loud (older windows), drafty, and the room bright as the window blinds didn't close all the way, after two nights we switched to a hotel that was more central with much more comfortable beds. The location was awesome, great walks down nice streets, and the neighbourhood felt very safe walking at night. Nice cafe's and resturants on nearby streets (less then a block away). Whatever you value make your choice, but ultimately comfort was ours.

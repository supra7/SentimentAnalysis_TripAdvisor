The lobby is quite grand, but our room was nothing special - beds were AWFUL, doubles that sagged in the middle. Window wouldn't shut, so had a brisk breeze (and it was 30 degrees outside). Handle missing from bureau, so couldn't open it. No refrigerator or safe. Very small room. Columbus Ave rooms are immediately above a nightclub that let's out at 2:30pm. Both Friday and Saturday were awakened by yelling and horn honking that went on for 10-15 minutes. Will NEVER book a room on that side of the hotel again. Also - got a great deal through Expedia, but didn't find out until later that they only have valet parking - for $38/day!! Probably won't stay there again, even if it were $50/night. Not worth it.

I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Encore. Despite having requested a non-smoking room and getting a room on the 63rd floor which is designated as non-smoking, there were ashtrays in the room and people were walking the hallways with cigarettes in hand. Getting into bed at night meant pulling a duvet that smelled vaguely of tobacco over myself- YUCK! Down below in the hotel, people walk around puffing away in the casino, at the coffee shop, at the pool and stroll past the restaurants. I lost my appetite, got nauseous and had a perpetual headache. It is not pleasant at all.

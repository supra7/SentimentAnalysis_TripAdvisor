If you know you're not going to be in your room a lot, don't mind outdated bathrooms and a musty smell and want to be in the South Maui area, this is your place. The Maui Prince has a nice lobby and a very nice staff, but the rooms are not very nice. The carpet in my room seemed newer, but the bed and the bathrooms seemed old and very outdated. There was also a musty smell that we couldn't seem to trace. The pool itself is quite small. I can't say enough about how great the staff is at the hotel, but the accommodations made me check out. If I had a full schedule planned that would have kept me out of my room enough, I might have stuck it out (especially b/c the rates seemed more reasonable than other resorts in the area). My plans consisted of tons of pool time, though, and for that reason I moved to a place where I wouldn't mind lingering in my room at times.

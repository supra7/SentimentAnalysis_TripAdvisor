My husband was out of the country so I decided to take my kids to Orlando. I thought since we were alone we should stay at a very nice hotel. Upon arrival I asked the conciere a question and was about to ask another but I was interupted with O.K. very loudly so I said O.K. and left. He was very rude. Then we went to a theme park for a few hours. After arriving back at the hotel I loaded my 2 year old into her stroller along with some of our things. We had already put some of our things in the room. While walking into the hotel, the parking lot was very dark with no lighting in that section so we continued walking when suddenly the stroller is abruptly stopped and my daughter is screaming. There was a rope blocking another parking area that could not be seen it was red and we were in the pitch dark. I am very lucky it only resulted in minor injury, a small bump on the head. There was no flouresent tape, no barricades, no lighting only a thin red rope. She seemed to calm down after we got inside of the hotel. Then my 7 year old son decided to watch a little t.v.. So he was surfing channels when suddenly I see and adult film, When I say adult I mean xxx they were in the middle of the worst thing he could see. I was horrified I could not believe what he saw. We are a religious family. How can I ever erase my child's memories. What he saw was irresponsible of the hotel. We did not order that movie or the adult channel. Before you take children to this hotel please check channel 23 to make sure the adult movies are not assigned to your room and tell them to block all adult programming.

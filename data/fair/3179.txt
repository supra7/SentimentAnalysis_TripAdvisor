Upon check-out, haggard looking man was working the front desk. They must have needed any warm body; I can't imagine a business knowingly hiring this person. We were checking out 10 minutes AFTER breakfast started and I asked if they had any bananas (they had them the day before and I'm gluten intolerant so I cannot eat any of the other breakfast items). He told me they would get around to putting them out in awhile. Told him we had to leave to catch a flight and you would have thought I shot his first born. In front of myself and other customers, he slammed down the computer mouse, sighed, rolled his eyes and huffed while walking the four steps it took to get the banana. We all stood there in shock. I've stayed at this hotel on and off for 15 years, this guy makes me question if I'll ever return.

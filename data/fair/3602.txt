The rooms were exceptionally small. One side of the bed is less than a foot from the wall. If you needed to get out of bed you would either hit your head on the oversized TV that hangs on a stripper pole or have to climb over the person sleeping next to you. The rooms are also very poorly lit - we turned on every light in the room in order to barely see what was in our suitcases. Speaking of suitcases, there really isn't any room for them except in the closet. Which we actually wanted to leave open to increase the size of the room, but then the closet light wouldn't turn off. I've stayed in a ton of different NY hotels and have never had a room so small and dysfunctional. The bathroom on the other hand, while quite small was nice. And do yourself a favor if you're over 30, don't stay here. The techno music, insence burning and dim light will drive you nuts. I'm a young 41 and felt completely out of place.

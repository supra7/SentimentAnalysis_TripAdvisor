The room was brown, brown, and darker brown. The elevators were so slow that people staying on level 6 and lower usually walked down. The ice machine was in the laundry room on the 25th floor. After the first trip up there, I decided warm drinks were ok. The breakfast buffet was mediocre. The internet service was so bad that I could not even get to my yahoo mail account. Good things: towels and bathrobe were of superiod quality; personal supplies were also of higher quality than many like-priced hotels. The evening cookies are a nice touch.

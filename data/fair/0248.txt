Our first trip to Seattle, booked Quality Inn online because of price, location and other reviews. This was the first time I've ever switched hotels after making a two-night reservation. Let me start with the positive, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was extremely small, had to walk sideways between the dresser and the bed. Very noisy, due to location/proximity to freeway, and the air conditioner was just about as noisy as the freeway. Unable to plug in microwave, TV, and coffemaker at the same time due to unavailability of outlets. Towels were paper thin, and knees almost hit the sink when sitting on the toilet. Elevators were slow, and the overall appearance of the hotel was grimy/dirty. We didn't swim in the pool, but another guest (who I met in the elevator) told me it was freezing, supposed to be heated, but clearly not. Switched to LaQuinta a few blocks away for second night in Seattle -- very pleased, well worth the additional twenty bucks!

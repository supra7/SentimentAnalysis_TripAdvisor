Wouldn't have been so upset, but called a week in advance to request the quietest room in the hotel and was assured all would be well. Upon pre check in once again reiterated my need for quiet room location, ditto on final check in that night. Was assured rooms on 4th floor " well above any street noise"! I beg to differ, at 11:30PM people screaming and shouting, followed by wailing ambulance on 1st Ave first woke us. At 2:30AM was a chopper raping his pipes hard. At 3:30AM an impromptu "drag race" ensued with a couple cars winding up their engines then full screeching tires as they roared off. By 4:30AM I was in the lobby waiting for coffee service to begin at 5AM. My husband who normally sleeps through a hurricane also was "Sleepless in Seattle". Room was exceptionally nice (linens, amenities, etc.), but all we wanted after 8 hours on our feet at the wine show and the drive up from Portland that morning was some sleep. In fairness, front desk was exceptional and did their best to try and make it up to us . After the fact we learned there'd been a shooting near by something the hotel would of course have no control over. Nevertheless, caveat emptor unless you're extreme sound sleeper!

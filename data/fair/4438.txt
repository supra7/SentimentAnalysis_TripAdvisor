My fiance and I spent two nights at the Westin San Diego on a recent weekend getaway and were very disappointed. We chose this hotel for the brand, location and previous experience with other Westin properties. The property is somewhat dated and we definitely did NOT feel like we were staying in a Westin hotel. The pool is extremely small and not staffed in any way, the lobby bar is quiet and uninviting, the rooms are small (we stayed in a Deluxe King Bayside) and the towels in the bathroom are of poor quality. To make matters worse, on our first night we were woken at 3:00 am by the sounds of people running around in the hall, knocking on our door, yelling, laughing etc. When I went to call down to the front desk the phone beside the bed did not work. Security was sent up to take care of the noise but the event was enough to ensure we will never stay at this property again. Additionally, when asked about our stay as we were checking out we told them about our experience on the first night. We were told that it's not uncommon for them to have bachelor parties and weddings that get out of hand. Disappointing response. We chose to stay at the Westin rather than the W to avoid that environment.

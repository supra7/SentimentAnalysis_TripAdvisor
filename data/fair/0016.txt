We stayed here twice in 2 weeks, during our honeymoon. The first time it was just for a night and the experience was average. The parking garage is small, crowded and a nightmare to navigate; the attendants are not much help nor as friendly if you choose to park yourself instead of using the valet service. A week later we stayed for 4 nights and used the valet. The people at the desk are friendly enough, but not very informative. The second time around we got a room on the second floor that had not been renovated. I dont mind that the stuff is outdated as long as it works. The hair dryer was not functioning, the tv (big old tv) was fuzzy and did not have a remote control, the shower had no water pressure and when we took out the old beat up ironing board, a dirty handkerchief fell out of the closet; disgusting. If you have to stay there, make sure you ask for a clean, updated room. The reason I did not rate this as "terrible" is because the restaurant was GREAT (although pricy) and the front desk will mail out your post-cards for you--very convenient!

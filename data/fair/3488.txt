i wouldn't stay here again. the hotel staff seem overwhelmed - our room was not ready at 3pm when we checked in, and one day after being out since 9:30am, we returned at 3:30pm to find our room still being cleaned. they need a system to tell housekeeping when you are out - they don't even have the "service please" door knob hangars. the doorman was missing more than he was there. the staff were nice and tried to accomodate us, but the hotel just seemed to busy for the number of people working (or something). to be fair, it was the weekend after Christmas - so maybe that does not happen normally. it's also not very secure - anyone can walk in on the ground floor and take the elevator up to any of the floors without even being seen by the front desk (which is on the 2nd floor). on the positive side, they did give us a room on a high floor, which we'd requested and made a big difference in terms of noise. it's pretty clean and the room is a decent size for the price and location. bed is comfy and shower has good pressure. if you are going to broadway shows, it is the perfect location - right in the middle of them - anything else, it isn't great because you have to cross times square to get anywhere.

THIS IS NOT A RESORT AT ALL. Beautiful Key West style hotel, well maintained, wonderful landscape, NO ocean, fake beach with nice sand facing the ocean which is complete blocked by trees. Even rooms with ocean view, on the 2nd floor are blocked by the all the trees. Distance to downtown is 0.34miles if you take a helicopter, if you drive or walk is 2.5 miles. We had a great time, enjoyed their great 4 pools but we DID NOT ENJOY a Resort hotel in Key West, which is what we were looking for.

i booked in here with my partner & friend. we booked a one bed suite as there was the 3 of us & thought we would have plenty of room, but this was not the case!!! the bedroom part was nice & the room would have been acceptable for 2 people but wit all our luggage it was far too small.the hotel did offer us another suite for the next night but it was the same size in Sq Ft but had king size bed. the bed was not the issue!!! To open out the sofa bed we needed to take the coffee table out of the room & put it in the bedroom. the bed when opened out was wedged up to the desk & fridge which meant that we could use neither!!! the carpet in this room was very grubby and the mirror covered in dust!!! also our safe was not working! granted we stayed here at a busy time of year, the queues for the lifts were crazy & there was no order with a lot of pushing & shoving!!! i know this was down to the guests themselves but my experience was not the best. be warned that this hotel take a $100 dollar deposit per night you are there off your credit card. this was not explained to me at time of booking so that was a lot out of my shopping budget(ha ha) . We arrived at this hotel at 2.50 but we were not allowed check in till the official time of 3.30!! i know the room may not have been ready but it meant waiting around & there seemed to be no flexibility that we could have checked in before that time even if there was a room ready!! On a plus the doorman that welcomed us downstairs was very friendly ( i cant remember his name). The bed was very comfortable for the one night we stayed. we were due to stay 6 nights but checked out after 1st night because we just were so unhappy overall!! really put a dampner on the beginning of our holidays!! Unfortunately i would not be recommending this hotel to my friends.

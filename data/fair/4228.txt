First time in OC and can't say I'll stay here unless I'm desperate! Outdated, dirty, and not the most friendliest staff. What a vacation. We got the breakfast package and most days was a 30 minute wait. The restaurant could not Baccomodate its 216 rooms. The pool and swimup bar were decent but the water was frozen for Aug. The kiddie pool had icecubes in it and the towels always ran out. Awful. The beds were tiny full size beds and when we pulled out the sofabed there was food under the mattress. The family before us also left behind some fishes behind the dresser that housekeeping never found. Gross. My only kudos goes to Robert, the omelet station guy. What a sweetheart. He was an exchange student doing his masters in business. Hopefully he'll come back and help this dump out!

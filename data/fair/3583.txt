This may have been one of the places where the W Hotel concept was born but they've never been able to get things right here other than with the bar and lounge. So good place to hang, bad place to stay. Service is terrible and rooms, even the ones that have been redone, are small and awkward. When I stayed here last week, they had given away my room even though I had a reservation. Waited for another room to vacate which might have been okay except that I had just gotten off a red eye and had meetings to go to. Manager apologized, said that they would make it up to me by upgrading me to a suite on the 18th floor - they never did... The irony is that the other W's in New York are just much better places to stay at. Staying here is just not worth the money.

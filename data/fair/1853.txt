The room was great and if that was the only factor, I would always recommend The Magnolia. Unfortunately, rooms are not the only element when it comes to hotels and we were unimpressed when it came to the rest. 1) During check-in, the gentleman at the counter clearly thought answering phones was more important than the customers standing right in front of him. 2) the elevator system is an absolute joke. Out of 7 elevators only 3 0r 4 of them work? Consider having half of them go only to top floors (14-26) and half going to lower level floors (2-13). If you can't afford having all elevators running, cut back on the cookies, drinks and other gimmicks and get your house in order. Just a suggestion. 3) I don't valet. This hotel is not very accommodating for that. I know valet is very "Dallas", but there are a lot of us who like to self-park and not having that option is annoying. Even if that was an option, there's not place to reasonably drop off bags, etc. before self parking. 4) A positive, we were there to attend a wedding reception in the Pegasus Room. Didn't like walking across the street in the cold, pouring down rain, but once we were over there, it was a great venue with great catering and excellent service. But again... the parking was a pain. Again, the room was great but the things listed above make me wish we had stayed elsewhere and will prohibit us from staying in this hotel again.

Expedia should not list this as a four star hotel! We had a horrible experience at the Time hotel. Although the location is good for those wanting to be in times square, that is about all it has to offer. Once entering the building you are confused about where to go, no real signage with the name of the hotel and you must take the elevator to a small lobby on the second floor. The lobby itself is very tiny. The actual rooms are just as tiny. The chair was very run down and looked like it was pulled out of the curb and put into our room. There were mysterious red stains on the bathroom walls, and a very narrow stand up shower with mold and cracked tiles. By the window we noticed a huge hole in the wall with chips of the paint/wall still laying on the carpet. The hotel also offers internet but for $10 a day and does not offer any sort of business center. We were so disappointed, we checked out the first night to stay at Park Central which way better! And it was only a 3-star hotel and cheaper!! I would not be so critical of the Time hotel if Expedia did not list as an upscale hotel. If it was a 2-star rating I would consider it decent, but when you are looking for a 4-star hotel it should be represented as 4-star quality!!

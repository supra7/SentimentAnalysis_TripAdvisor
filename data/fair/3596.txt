Stayed there for 2 nights for a business\leisure vacation. Rooms are quite small for 2 people and the price (glad it was company-paid!). First room had a broken a\c which they tried to fix twicw but couldn't. Very accomodating when we asked to be moved to a new room. Nighclub (downstairs) very expensive, $12 a drink. Centrally located in mid-town, staff very pleasant and service-oriented. One bad item: 1 member in our group put her luggage outside her room door for pickup\storage before departure (as she was instructed to do) and it was stolen with all her new shopping items inside. No word yet on the missing bag. Not sure if the hotel will take responsiblity.

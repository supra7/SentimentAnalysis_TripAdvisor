This is a great place to stay for long periods of time on a budget. If you don't mind "Palmetto bugs", I call them cockroaches. The free wine and beer in the evenings makes it easier, but the snacks three nights a week are just cheap: hot dogs one night, nachos with salsa, and canned ravioli. The barbecue available is always disgusting as it in never cleaned.The breakfast buffet is just adequate. It is a goo thing it is scheduled for a renovation because it is getting pretty run down.

Stayed at this hotel while in town for SHPE{ society of hispanic professional engineers}.great location,next to a great mall with several restaurants nearby. Clean and well kept. 2 mildly annoying problems. The air sytem in the hotel is either off or on.At the time we stayed there it was off. Unless you opened the sliding door you had no air circulating in your room. We were on the top floor so we did just that, but for those on the ground floor that wasn't an option as that would be unsafe. I prefer that the rooms have individual control,again a minor thing. The front desk had no knowledge of other places in the immediate area for shopping, spa services etc. I think that this is something that could be easily remedied. Over all it was a pleasant stay.

We have stayed at the Grand Wailea in the past and we were very dissappointed in our most recent stay. We paid $735/night for deluxe ocean view accomodations x 2 rooms. By the time you add the tax and resort fees the amount was over $1,600/night for 2 rooms! Needless to say, when you spend that kind of money you should expect Four Seasons/Ritz quality. We spoke with the hotel manager and we were advised that there have been many owners of the hotel lately. This must explain why very little money is spent on upkeep and service. The room was marginal at best. For the same type of money it is much better to stay at the Cove at Atlantis in the Bahamas. I read the one review that stated that the Grand Wailea had the best pools...while great....they don't hold a candle to the Atlantis!! Everything was dated. The pool chairs were stained and the paint was all chipped off of the frames. The pool deck is not cleaned at night. Many times we would see menus, flip flops, etc from the previous day when we went out to claim our chairs in the a.m. I must admit that the chair game is frustrating. All of the good spots have been stacked out by 7-8 am. The overall impression (if you have stayed at a top resort elsewhere and know what to expect) is one of a tired old lady. Very rough around the edges. The slides were very dirty. There were water lines and scum on the ropes in the water.....again, it simply looked like no one within the organization was tasked to keep those areas/items in a fresh condition. I can go on and on (this is the first review i have ever taken the time to author, but i thought it was worth the time because i would hate for someone who travels less than we do to stay at this hotel and get deeply dissappointed)

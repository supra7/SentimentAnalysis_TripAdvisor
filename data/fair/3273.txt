I stayed 3 nights at the Hotel InterContinental New Orleans, booked through bookit.com. It seemed a bargin at/ $79.00 night. The location was great and I was able to walk to the French Quarters and the museums. The St. Charles trolley line is just outside. The staff were all friendly and helpful, when I complained that the door stuck, it was fixed when I returned to the room. On the top floor is a fitness room with several machines and a heated outdoor pool. I didn't swim in the pool because I don't think it was "heated." There's a gift shop downstairs and a pastry/coffee shop. On the second floor is a lovely European syle restaurant--The Veranda and Pete's--an English style pub. The room was large with a foyer at the entrance, two room marble bathroom and two double beds. The shower was great with a large shower head and plenty of hot water, but the shower curtain always allowed water to run across the floor. Damana brand French tolietries were supplied. Plenty of coffee was supplied with the single serve coffee pot. I personally don't like all the little signs around the room and the water bottles with the price tags and the pricey stocked refrigerator. I like my room to seem like home, not a "sales room." The view from my room was of the parking car garage nest door, I was so close, I could read the license plates numbers. Here's what's unbelievable to me, the mattress was soft and bouncy. A thin feather mattress was placed on top of it-- I guess in an attempt to improve it. I had such a backache that I had to pay for a $140.00 massage just so I could get through the next day. So much for bargain hotels --right? I hope no one actually pays $175.00 a night for this hotel. Also, if you have a car, you will pay &30.00 night to have it parked or $45.00 if it's "oversized." I think next time I book a hotel, I'll try and find out what kind of mattress the hotel has. Sleeping is kind of an important aspect of my hotel experience.

Friendly woman at front desk at checkout, decent free breakfast buffet, okay-sized bedroom, very nice flatscreen TV, good hot shower, good quality mattress. That's the good stuff. As I always do in NYC, I checked for signs of bedbugs under the mattress, and there was a large amount of human hair on the boxspring along the headboard, like it hasn't seen a vaccum in a long time. The worst: Noisy noisy noisy noisy in-window air conditioner that unavoidably blows straight onto the bed. The fan knob had no effect, and It was full blast all the time. Overall it was a recipe for a sleepness night, but I managed to position a chair and a stack of pillows to block the freezing jet of air, and used earplugs to block the sound. It was a hot night, and the windows are unopenable. I didn't complain, and just managed to get by as a single business traveler. However, if I was traveling with my wife or son, it would have been absolutely unacceptable.

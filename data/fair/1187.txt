The hotel is beautiful but I need to warn people not to stay here. The stress of it all is just not worth it. Find another hotel that is just as nice but doesn't come with a cost of sitting thru a sales pitch when you could be enjoying the beautiful beaches. They say it'll only take 90minutes but as I've read in other reviews, this is not the case. You will waste a full day if not more and feel quite pressured. Their sales techniques were distasteful and defintely left us feeling ill afterwards. They will make it sound like an amazing offer but if you read the the details and contracts in hard detail, you will find that it is not.

The hotel was booked in urgency for a work trip and due to some confusion, the booking was for 2 days first and then 1 day seperately for 3 continuous days. The hotel staff could not understand this in 1 go but had to be explained about it twice Inspite of this, they made me shift my room for the 3rd nite The system to call a taxi is not organized either. The interiors have a splash of colors which are not tastefully done its is supposed to be a boutique hotel and you expect the the property to be designed well..it is not! my stay was ok but I dont want to go back there for sure

Staying at Grandmas House My first trip to Wakiki and I am sure it won't be my last, but I will not be staying at the Royal Hawaiin again until the promised remodel is complete. My room looked like my great grandmothers bedroom. It is very old, very dark, not at all what you want when you go to sunny Hawaii. I have stayed at nicer hotels on the Oregon Coast for about $89.95. I am sure back in 1927 when the hotel was built it was very nice, but I don't think they have changed a thing since opening night. It is in a great location but that is the only good thing I can say about it. The food at the bar was very average at best. Breakfast was also just so so. The pool is small and unimpresive. I checked out two days early because I was so disapointed. When checking out the staff did not ask why or seem to even care in the least that I was leaving early. The hotel is set to close in June of this year to be remodeled, It is long over due and I just hope they do it right.

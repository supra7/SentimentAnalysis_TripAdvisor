We paid $150 per night for this hotel and I must say, it was not worth it. When I saw pictures of the hotel lobby online, I figured it would be an amazing hotel with wonderful rooms. This was not the case. The rooms were dated, with approximately 1970's window treatments. Carpets in rooms and hallways were not plush or cozy. Also, the lighting in the room and hallways was dark. My expectations for Hilton were very high, as I have never had a bad experience till now. We paid $150 for night, through Priceline. I am sure it is far more expensive directly through Hilton. It is not worth the money. Go for the Hilton Chicago near the Magnificent Mile instead.

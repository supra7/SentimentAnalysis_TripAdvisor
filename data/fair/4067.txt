My wife and I just got back from our stay at The Encore celebrating our one year anniversary. We arrived on a Wednesday and checked out on Saturday. We loved our room. We loved the vibe and crowd. We even came to love the garish, red decor after a couple of days. This hotel is superb, truly, with one (as we see it) fatal flaw. Most of the reviews cover the pros of this place (which I wholeheartedly agree with), so I just want to share the bad. Fast forward to our Friday night. We got back up to our room around 2am to discover someone had set up a DJ booth in the room next door. Wait, no that's not coming from any of the rooms, that's coming from the pool area. Oh, the club XS has taken over the pool and is blaring the most annoying and repetitive bass-pounding music in the world (like all other clubs on the strip do) OUTSIDE!!! My wife and I could not believe how loud it was from 27 floors up. Well, we are pretty heavy sleepers (we live within two blocks of a train) so we just tried to go to sleep. After more than a handful of false starts, we conceded to the fact that sleep wasn't happening. Called down to the front desk and was told the club will be open until 4am, and they could send up some ear plugs. We got our earplugs quickly, but they were not much help against the super low frequency of the protruding bass thumping. Even asked for an extended check-out time since we had to wait until 4am to get any form of solid sleep, but was denied. I'd sum it up like this: The Encore is like dating the perfect person, falling in love, then discovering they're a closet meth addict. Luxury and decadence can and do coexist in a beautiful way up and down The Strip; they were just never properly introduced at The Encore.

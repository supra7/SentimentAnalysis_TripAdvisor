Well, we were referred to this hotel by a friend and were very disappointed. The hotel comes highly rated as a luxury resort. The rooms are no better than holiday inn. The resort is old and not kept up very well. ie paint carpet etc. I had read various reviews before I left and many off them experienced the same things we did. Just super super overrated and let me not even start to tell you how expensive. We make VERY good money and even for us this place was a huge RIP!!! If you want real luxury go to the four seasons. We went there one day for afternoon drinks,the sunset was incredible from there cliff top lobby area. Please understand we are very reasonable people and are easily pleased so take this review seriously before dropping $800 bucks a night for the room alone. The only plus for this hotel is the pool areas if you have young active kids. It's like a mini water park with slides etc. But if you are used to a high level of luxury don't go here. We left two days early and saved 1600 bucks and now going on a second vacation to a nice resort. Very disappointing.

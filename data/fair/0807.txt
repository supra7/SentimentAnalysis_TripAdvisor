The Eris Hotel is located in an unappealing rubbish-strewn back street, ajdacent to the yard of the railway station. The nearby police station might may you feel safer though. The hotel is tired, which is about what you would expect. However, it really needs to be cleaner throughout (particularly in the bedrooms). The general feeling of uncleanliness makes this hotel unappealing. Front desk staff were OK and there is on-site Internet access (for a fee). It is a short walk to the light-rail/tram line, ad the Bosphorous ferries, but more of a hike to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia.

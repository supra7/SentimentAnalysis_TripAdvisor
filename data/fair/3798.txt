The resort is an ok destination for families, especially with younger children (ages 5-17) due to the water park. Service is poor, which is evidenced by the slow service, but also the number of employees in 'training", which shouldn't occur during the peak season. Appears to be the result of lots of turnover likey driven by lower than market wages (my opinion). The problems could be the result of the documented problems the ownership has with the resort's lender (not that unusual today). Golf course is just ok, lots of blind shots and very tight but a beautiful back nine (nice desert atmosphere) Rooms are suites but are smaller and the bathrooms are very small (sinks are actually in the bedrooms)

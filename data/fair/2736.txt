Let me start by saying I was comped for my stay at Fremont and have no real complaints about the room as it was free. The decor was nice and modern and the room was clean. My big complaint is about the service. It is like they took everyone who had been fired for being rude at all of the other casinos and hired them on at the Fremont. My first run in was at the Players card booth. The lady working behind the counter acted as though she was upset that I asked a question and interrupted her conversation with another employee. Check in was not as pleasant as it could be, it was more like checking in at a public health clinic. Housekeeping was great, although I tend to tip them well. One bartender acted like it was an imposition when we asked about drink specials, but another bartender made up for that later. I knew what it was before I went. We chose to stay downtown because during our last trip we had found the big resort casino we stayed at to be a bit more flashy and showy for our tastes. We were hoping for something a little more middle of the road with the Fremont. I know that downtown is more for an older crowd, but it seemed like unless you were over 60 years of age or a bit on the trashy side, you did not get good customer service. So we spent our money in casinos elsewhere. We spent the last half of our trip on the strip.

Neat place, but definitely not worth the price. This is the kind of place you really want to love, but can't. Cool old building, but the rooms smell musty and moldy --and they are. You pay over $200 a night and get a television smaller than a portable radio and which was made in 1960 and looked like it fell off the back of a truck. And breakfast consists of REALLY old, store bought pastries and granola. Service is also pretty terrible: takes forever to pay for the room and the parking provided consists of six really tight spots for over a dozen rooms.That said, loved the neighborhood and some of the rooms are spacious with nice views. Place would be great for $100 to $120 a night; at $200 and up, I would not go back.

Before booking this hotel we had a look for some friendly advice online so although there were a few bad reviews, these were before their refurb. We were looking for a low-frill hotel to put our heads down at night and we knew we would not be there much with all the sightseeing in place. So we booked without high expectation. Arrival at the hotel was fine, checked in ok and had help with our bags up the six flights of stairs. The room was ok, size not big, not too small for 4 people. The only complaint was the holes in our towels but bed was clean. Fourth night in we were woken up by noises outside our room which was the Police banging on our door and someone shouting down the corridor. We found out the next morning that it was a drunken guest at the hotel and a neigbour had called the Police. That wasn't the hotel's fault but the reason the Police banged on our door was because they weren't escorted by hotel staff and they got the wrong room. On our last night while we were packing, we found that our food was chewed through by mice. We immediately went to report the problem at reception. The guy told us he'll make a note of the incident and asked us to take it up with the manager in the morning. We spoke to Keith the next day but he made an excuse that it was caused by the engineering work on the Metro, at one point he laughed. He didn't offer any compensation or seem too concerned with the situation. We had to ask for compensation which was agreed but we're yet to receive. We're still waiting for them to write to us after a month. I wouldn't stay there again purely because of the mice and how they've dealt with the situation.

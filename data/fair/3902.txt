I have been visiting San Francisco for the past 15 years. I have always stayed at this hotel but after the last trip, no longer. First, the room they gave us had the door handle falling off. When I complained to the front desk about this, they asked if it was completely off or just hanging there. What difference does it really make? Next came the left over Humus that someone had left in the ice bucket from a previous stay. You can only imagine the smell. I brought the bucket down to the front desk and requested another. When asked why, I told them to open it. The cleanliness has really gone down hill. It has gone from someone on their hands and knees washing the bathroom floor to being lucky your used glasses were taken and replaced with new ones. The mattresses are in very poor condition. You would have a more comfortable night's sleep on the floor. Having said that, there are some redeeming qualities to the hotel. It is conveniently located on Lombard Street. There are many places to eat within walking distance and Fisherman's Wharf is only a few minutes away. Parking is free, which if you've ever been to San Francisco, you'll know that's a bargain in itself. There was always parking no matter what time I came in. Overall, I'm very disappointed in the quality of this hotel. Granted, I would never call it a 5 Star hotel, but if you're the average joe on a limited budget, you use to get your money's worth.

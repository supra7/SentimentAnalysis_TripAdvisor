We arrived to our very claustrophobic room to find the "king size" bed we had requested. A king size bed is usually between 6 feet 3 inches and 6 and a half feet wide, however, I am 5 feet 9 inches tall and could lay on the bed width-wise with my head at one edge and my shins fell off the other side. When we asked the front desk if this was the right room, they assured us that this was their definition of "king size." There was no mini fridge in the room, and when we tried to go online, we were greeted with a webpage from the Hilton informing us that the internet was available for a price of $15 for "basic" and $20 for "high speed"... FOR ONLY 24 HOURS! The hand towel fixtures in the bathroom were hanging off of the wall with the holes blatantly exposed, which stayed that way for our entire five day stay. There was no fan in the bathroom, which was unpleasant for obvious reasons, and our "window view" on the ninth floor was somehow about eight feet away from another tall building, making it nice and gloomy in our room even when it was very bright and clear outside. The room service came with an included 15% gratuity (even when it came with hair in the ice cream) AS WELL AS a $4 service charge, making a $9 dessert around $16. The employees were very polite, but it didn't make up for the lack of amenities. All in all, a room costing close to $200 a night was a total ripoff. Why not stay at a significantly cheaper place that provides complimentary internet and doesn't lie about details like the bed size?

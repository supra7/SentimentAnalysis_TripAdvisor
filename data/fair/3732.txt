My family and I love Staybridge hotels because we find them really comfortable and the kitchen is a big plus. But really, this one is terrible. It looks like a motel and our room was so dark and it faced the parking lot at the first floor so every time someone arrived and use the stairs it felt like they were coming right into our room. And the room smelled funny like moist or dust. Bathroom is so small and the safe box did not work at all. We are not coming back to this particular Staybridge.

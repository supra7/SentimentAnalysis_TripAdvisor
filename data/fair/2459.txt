... than this. As a traveller on a short business trip, staying at the Palmer just two nights, I am pretty disappointed. Here's why: 1) Line of 12 people deep to check in at 10:00 PM on a Friday 2) No bottled water available for purchase in the room AND the hotel shop was closed (again, when I checked-in). 3) Tiny room - could have been cleaner, too. 4) $20 for highspeed internet and it's not even wireless 5) Limited gym hours and it costs $10 to use the gym per day 6) Overall, just a crowded place with no room to breath. What I like? I like the location in the city. Would I stay here again? Only if my work travel demanded that I do so (like for a conference). It's an old hotel, which is nice, but then again, it's seen better days.

We arrived to the fantastic location, right in the heart of downtown, to a short valet line. The rooms on first glance looked great - nice decor, comfy beds. Things seemed to go downhill from there... It took three phone calls and 45 minutes for our bags to arrive at our room (they won't let you carry them up yourself because the elevators are small and slow). The bathroom was dirty upon arrival, and on our second day, the hallways were littered with empty beer cans. You're warned when you check in to call down to the valet for your car 15 minutes before you need it, except Saturdays and Sundays when they require that you wait in line outside (40 degree temperatures) for your vehicle, which is parked off-site. While the complimentary breakfast is nice, seating was inadequate for the number of individuals present. Couches and coffee tables tend to be the only available options. I can't speak to the other hospitality events (cocktails and cookies) as we did not attend these. Overall, I was disappointed by a hotel which advertises itself as a "friendly and helpful boutique hotel". The service was poor and when brought to the attention of the front desk, little was done to rectify the situation other than removing the valet charges from our bill.

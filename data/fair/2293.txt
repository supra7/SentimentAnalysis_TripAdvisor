This hotel had HORRIBLE customer service. When we arrived, we were trying to check in and they wouldn't let us leave our car to check in. They wanted our keys or one of us had to stay with the car. The AC in our room leaked and made the carpet soaking wet. The location wasn't good at all if you are looking for a place to walk to dinner. Finally, they wouldn't give me my Hyatt points because I booked through another website.

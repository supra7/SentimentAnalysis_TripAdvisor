This is a historic hotel and the lobby is very nice - however, once you step into your room you realize that it needs major updating. The rooms are very old and not as clean as they should be. The TVs are ancient - for the first time ever, we didn't even bother turning it on. It was quite far from the beds and not a flat screen. The mattresses were old and flimsy. The whole ambience of the rooms was outdated and our room was very moist - the papers in our room even became damp. Would choose a different hotel if you are staying downtown. They also charge you extra if you want to use the fitness center or internet.

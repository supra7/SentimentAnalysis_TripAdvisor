This resort came highly recommended but fell short in many areas. The complex I was in (Sedona) was very far from the reception and fitness center. The suites are decent size but bathroom cramped with chipped porcelain. Bathtub drains were very slow and probably clogged. Maintenence was told but never resolved. Bedroom TV older and remote quit working. The lighting in the catwalk to get access to room was very dark and there was no lighting near my door. Best bet is Camelback complex which is closer to everything and ask if the room has been upgraded. Staff assitstance was patchy. This is such a beautiful setting and good location near AZ Mills outlet mall and many chain restuarants.

A group of ladies were staying at the Resort for a bachelorette party. We were not loud, obnoxious 'party' girls but we did want to have a good time and enjoy ourselves. The Resort was able to accommodate our request for an early check-in so that we could play at the water park only to find out it closed at 4pm. We ordered food and drinks at the pool bar. The bartender was helpful and courteous - the server of our food, not so much. He walked up to our table, didnt say a word or smile and put the tray of food down and walked away. We left the water park and headed to the Adult Only pool. Well, it wasnt an Adult Only pool! There was signage of it being adult only yet families with children were allowed to use the pool as long as the children were not screaming or splashing. Whats the purpose of an adult only pool when there were other family pools? We proceeded to indulge in adult beverages at the adult only pool only to have them taste as though there was no alcohol in them. We called the restaurant back and they assured us there was alcohol in the drinks and that next time we should order doubles. We thought it would be fun to play at the water park only to be disappointed by the hours and service we received. We have stayed at other resorts here in the valley and received more bang for our buck. Its too bad, this is a nice hotel but we wont be coming back.

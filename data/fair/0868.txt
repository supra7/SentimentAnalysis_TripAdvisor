While the resort was beautiful and the pool was fun this resort was way over priced. Keep in mind that the price per night only covers your room and nothing else. You even have to pay $25 a day to use the pool. Also beware that the mini bar and snacks are on sensors so if you pick something up, regardless of whether or not you consume it, you will be charged. The walkway behind the hotel is nice because it goes along the whole ka'anapali beach, however, the walkway is full of resorts so it was always crowded. If you like the busy resort feel you might appreciate it more but they nickel and dime you every chance they get which made me realize from now on, it's condos all the way.

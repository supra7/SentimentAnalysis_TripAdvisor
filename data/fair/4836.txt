Despite advertise as having WIFI, only the hotel lobby provide this facility and yet the coverage was spotty and limited. Although the hotel was close to the airport, it was far from everything else, which caused long taxi trips. Do not use the hotel to arrange pick up at the airport, a service that other hotels may readily arrange, this hotel charged 100 Dirham where a taxi would cost around 10.

I must first state one thing: I love the Hotel Bel Air. Always have. It is a dreamy location nestled in the canyon and who wouldn't love the swans and the bridge over the winding paths. And, I must add that the valet staff is fabulous-always friendly, so eager to run back and grab something you left in the car, help you load children and bags, get you a water, etc. But the rest of our stay was an unmitigated disaster. I should now mention THE NOISE. All day long, trucks are backing up in the street behind the hotel and they must be large trucks because they have constant back-up beeping noises that sounds like you are spending the day in a CostCo warehouse. What was all that clanking in the back alley ALL NIGHT, EVERY NIGHT? Apparently the restaurant is emptying out trash and bottles every hour on the hour. And the restaurant employees were smoking, talking and just being incredibly noisy all night in the alley. The new room decor is OK, although already a bit outdated. The hotel staff is super friendly-but watch out for the AWFUL RESTAURANT STAFF who are mainly just nasty and snippy. The hostess could not have been more unprofessional and rude. Never going back. I was glad to leave. Please let me know when the hotel changes hands once again, and my favorite charming Bel Air can be proud and free of this mess once again.

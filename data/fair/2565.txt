The lobby is beautiful and historic. If you want to be in the Loop, it is a good location. After that, not much to recommend this old horse. The rooms can be tiny and ill-kept. The service is good, but the place is huge and there can be lines for just about anything. The little things don't add up-- for instance, the hotel charges $10 to use the work-out room even though it is in the hotel.

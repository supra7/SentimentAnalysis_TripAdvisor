I've stayed in a lot of Starwood properties. I'm a SPG Gold member and have enjoyed trying their different brands. But for the first time ever, I was sorely disappointed with a Starwood property. The place is definitely showing signs of aging. It isn't too bad, but it lacks luster and polish, something you'd expect from a W. The staff were polite, but only passingly so--just the basics. It felt routine and uninspired. I stayed in a Wonderful room which was...very basic. Small, even by NYC standards (at least for a hotel of this caliber and cost). And the Wonderful rooms aren't the smallest rooms at the W. The shower was tiny and designed poorly--just too cramped and ugly. But what really bugged me was the lack of any acknowledgement of my Gold membership or any sort of upgrade or complementary service/extras. Why bother being a Gold member if you aren't going to do anything special for us? Also, I stayed on Cash and Points and got hit with an extra $16 worth of taxes and fees, including a ridiculous fee relating to...the Jarvis Center, which I never stepped foot in. Really W? How cheap. It's the first time I've been hit with such ridiculous extra fees on a Cash and Points stay and I can promise you, it is the last time--since I won't stay here again. Sure. They nickle and dimed me for a few extra bucks in the short run, but in the long run, they lost my business permanently.

After reading other good reviews, I was disappointed with this hotel. The location was a long distance from the bus station to the hotel; which was not easy to find. We walked into the tiny lobby only to be greeted by hotel staff that seemed to guard the elevator; though the staff was pleasant enough. Our room was spacious but worn out and drab. There was a separate sink and refrigator but no microwave, which we certainly could have used. The TV was tiny and far away from the beds. The continental breakfast only went from 6am to 9am and was bland tasting and stale. The coffee ran out and it took the staff a full half an hour to refill it. There is a $50 "misc" fee for incidentials and since I didn't get anything while in the room, I pray that they don't still charge me. (They never gave me a receipt when I checked out...just said I was all set). Overall, for the price of this hotel it is not worth my time to ever come back. I will definitely pay more and stay at a much nicer hotel.

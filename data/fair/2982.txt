Stayed at the Ritz for a week this past May and let me tell you that for the price, there are at least six better hotels that are nicer and in better locations than the Ritz. For starters, believe everything you here about this hotel being in a bad location. It rains here a lot! I saw the reviews before I went and thought to myself, Ive been to Maui two others times and it never rained. Well it still didnt rain in the other locations I stayed at even on this trip ( Kaanapali beach and Wailea), but boy did it ever rain in Kapalau where the Ritz is located. Everyday there was more rain and wind than there was sun. And from what Ive come to learn, this is pretty much par for the course on this part of the island. Even discounting the poor weather conditions, this Ritz does not come close to living up to the expected Ritz standards. Average rooms that look as though they have not been updated since the hotel opened well over ten years ago. The spa was a complete joke with broken equipment, worn out carpeting and even worse, poor service. My wife made a massage appointment two days in advance and when she showed up they said they had overbooked and couldnt honor her appointment. They did offer to reschedule but since we were leaving the next day, she was, to quote the receptionist, out of luck. Pool area was just O.K. (youll find much better at the Hyatt, Four Seasons, Grand Wailea and of course, the Fairmont). Even the Marriott on Kaanapali is nicer than this Ritz, though more crowded with kids and families. Beach was another big disappointment. If youre looking for a beach front hotel, definitely do not stay here. Kaanapali or Wailea is your best bet. You spend enough (probably more than you should) when traveling to Hawaii. Staying at the Ritz will have you paying a lot and getting very little.

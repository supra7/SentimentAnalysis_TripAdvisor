First, you are two miles outside of town, and could be anywhere USA. To get into town, a taxi costs $12 plus tip. Do the math. A couple of trips into town in a day...The hotel claims it is a four star - where were the amenities? The robe, the safe, not even a pen and paper in the room. No sign posting rates and check out times on the door. (Is this even legal - I'll have to check Florida law). The hotel decided they would change your sheets every fourth day, (ecological concerns supposedly) - other hotels I've been in, let you decide. They turn down their water heaters as well - I had lukewarm showers every day - I asked at the front desk if that were normal - oh yes, said one, that's how it is, the other receptionist seeing my facial expression said she'd send someone to look at it - but there was no change in water temperature. The resort fee of $25 is absurd - what makes it a resort? Are there tennis courts? No. Not even a hot tub! (I was surprised with this). Simply 3 or 4 very small pools. If you have a resort credit each day good luck trying to spend it - the food is awful. They don't have a real kitchen so you can't get a burger for instance. Just paninis which aren't heated through and are ghastly and a couple of "make shift" salads. But really, for this money you could be in the middle of old town - so skip Parrot Key and head to the Westin or Hyatt. As for the positive reviews posted here, I have to think one of two things - hotel staff and friends are posting them, and/or folks coming down from the East Coast where they've been buried in snow, are a bit dazed and confused.

Not my cup of tea Booked a one night stay through hotwire before going back to the states. First impression, the hotel tried very hard to be chick in decoration as well as attitude. The decor seemed to work in the lobby and Nobu restaurant entrance areas. However, once you got inside the guest elevator, you'd feel that the hotel was not well kept.Upon checking, I asked the front desk if there would be any room with a city view. Was told that no complimentary upgrade was available due to internet purchase. We ended up staying on the 9th floor with a parking lot view right in front of our balcony. The room decor was horrible, the white/grayish tile green carpet combo did not look good at all. Chip paints were noticed throughout the room and molds/mildews were all over the tub in the bathroom. In addition, the size of the bathroom was very small.

Booked the hotel for a business stay and was disappointed. Very grand from the outside but the rooms were really quite dated and small. Mine was a standard room but one of the smallest rooms i've experienced at a Hilton. Very dated also. The internet sockets were hanging of the wall and it smelt musty. The hotel is undergoing renovations so when you book ask for a renovated room. Ok but not if your paying full rates.

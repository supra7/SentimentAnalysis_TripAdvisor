I have spent the last year working in new york city and have spent many nights in many different hotels. I had to spend two nights in New York this past week and after reading the reviews for the Comfort Inn Midtown, I booked a room. I spent one evening in this hotel and chose to spend my second evening at another. I found several dark hairs in the bed suggesting that the sheets had not been cleaned, then later found the same coloured hairs on the towels in the bathroom. The room did not appear to have been vacuumed or dusted at all. I phoned reception upon seeing the hairs and was offered a room change or to have my sheets changed. I opted for a sheet change so I could witness clean sheets being put on the bed and they sent someone up very quickly. However in the midst of making my bed the employee promptly left to attend to baggage downstairs in the lobby. Perhaps they were under staffed that evening, I don't know. Either way, I think that for $150 a night I am at least entitled to clean linens. The room was also very small (although which is not uncommon for New York) and the doors are paper thin. I could hear every person who walked by my room. If you're just looking for a place to rest your head for an evening or two, then it does the job, but I'd recommend you bring your own towel.

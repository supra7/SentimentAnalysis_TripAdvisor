recent convention attended at Hilton Bayfront S.D. Not a positive experience. From the poor response from the bell captain and bell boys at the front drive....to the refusal to honor my hotel room upgrade which they had sent me the day before and I had purchased..was supposed to have upgraded to a high floor view of the bay and Coronado Island...instead I was on floor 20 with a view of the loading docs at the factory next door....not even a view of the city.....to the noisy room ( sounded like pigeons nesting outside the room....noisey all night)....to the lack of a variety of restaurants.....poor service in the cocktail lounge.....phones difficult to use in the rooms..... food and beverages served at the meetings were pulled and many folks didnt even get morning coffee? Rooms and food far too expensive for what we got....Conceirge was contacted the day before we arrived to ask for help in finding an AA meeting close to hotel....he did call me back but suggested I look at a site IN THE ROOMS to find a meeting....I know more about that site than he did...other hotels have always had a list of AA meetings....times...distance to them...whether they were in a safe neighborhood or not.....no help here either when I got to the conceirge at the hotel...he seemed "too busy" to really care.....bellmen who brought luggage to and from room were personable...room maid was very efficient and nice....everyone else seemed overwhelmed with thei rjobs and too busy to really give you any sense of personal service.....hotel is in poor location....1-2 mile walk to any restaurants or services outside the hotel....concrete jungle around hotel.... will not stay there again......dave p

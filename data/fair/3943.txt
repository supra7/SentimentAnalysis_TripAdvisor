We stayed at theHotel Rex in early July 2010, as it came highly recommended by Trip Advisor. It is, indeed, difficult to beat hotel location in the city plus its reasonable rates. I made my reservation through www.booking.com for two rooms and two nights . Upon arrival I was told that they have one reservaiton only for one night, but reception staff was gracious to take care of it. When we were leaving the bill contained items that were never used from the mini-bar menu plus each couple was charged for parking ( we had one car for 4 people). I thought that I caught this mistake on time to have it corrected but little did I know that we also would be charged twice for our stay there. I called to speak wth accounitng ofice at the hotel to have this mistake sorted out and after lengthy explanations and quite af ew phone calls was told that they " just changed/upgraded /replaced their computer system " but they will take care of my bill and get back to me the VERY next day. The conversation was handled by the Director of Operations. It has been at least two weeks since that communication , and this is still not rectified. I tried to call 4 times in the last 48 hrs and left numerous messages on various answering machines with promise to get back to me promptly. I would believe when someone will eventually get back to me. I think it is way too much aggravation for two night stay in "charming" Hotel :Rex". I guess I am not coming back

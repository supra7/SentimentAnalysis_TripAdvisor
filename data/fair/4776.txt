At $345/night I was hoping for something a little classier. I don't think my room had been properly aired in years. The paint is chipping; the decor is tired and the lighting is terrible. The tiny room was dominated by a giant flat screen tv but there was no comfortable place to sit. Excuse me, the bed does not count as a chair, thank you very much. And what is it with the loose headboards that crash into the wall every time someone in the neighboring room rolls over?

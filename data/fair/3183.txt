This was an ordinary hotel with large rooms, if you were lucky to get one. But at $350 you get the smallest room available. What surprised me the most is the tight rein they keep on the thermostat. They have a motion controller in the rooms and when you stop moving, that is when you go out to eat, it turns the heat off. Welcome back to a cold room, and keep waiting for the thermostat to catch up with the heat. It takes a long time, the rooms stay as cold as 65 deg. Fahr. Not cool! They moved us to 3 different rooms, and they all got cold as soon as we left the room. I have never been to a hotel where they turn off your heat. This was a big shock to us!

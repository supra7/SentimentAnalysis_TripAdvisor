If you are looking for a civilized typical Hawaiian Resort do not stay here! The place is bedlam and out of control. I have never seen a resort with more security guards then this place. They are there to control the guests fighting for beach and pool chairs which is crazy. You get on a line at 7am to get your own beach chairs and carry them to the beach and then at 8am you have to wait on the another line to get an umbrella. There is not enough pool and beach chairs for the amount of guests!

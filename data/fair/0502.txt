We chose this hotel because of it's location (a few blocks from the Space Needle and Seattle Center). The reviews were very bad, but the pictures looked okay and it said the hotel was renovated, so we booked it. The first thing we saw when we pulled in the parking lot were old, used toilets that were sitting out front. Lovely... The room itself wasn't terrible. Everything was old; I'm curious what was renovated if this was supposed to be the "after". The refrigerator smelled like something died in it many months ago. The bathroom tile was cracked and rotting. The shower pressure was so hard it burned my skin and flooded the bathroom floor, as there wasn't a proper shower liner, just a curtain. The bed was very uncomfortable. The front desk ladies were nice and helpful, but one of the gentlemen was rather rude. The hotel was prepaid, so we just dealt with it. My advice is that if you want to be close to the Space Needle, book the Quality Inn or Best Western down the street. This just wasn't a comfortable stay in Seattle.

Felt I had to write a review on this hotel as the room we were given was so different to any images I have seen on the hotel website and Tripadvisor members photos. It was small, half the size of the any images I have seen. Had one tiny window at the top of the wall that looked out to a brick wall under some stairs. Unsurprisingly therefore the room was very dark. The television was old and when you turned it on was automatically on volume 99 out of 100 everytime, the signal was also pretty poor. The fridge was so loud I had to take the plug out of it, not that it was problem as there was nothing in it anyway! Luckily though the room was fairly clean, it all seemed a bit old and outdated though. The keys to the room had not been activated after we had checked in so we had to go back down to reception from the sixth floor, which takes a while in itself as you have to take one lift then walk through the corridors round to the other side of the hotel and get another lift down. In the morning we asked reception to book us a taxi, they asked if we wanted a yellow taxi or a limo service, we replied a yellow taxi presuming that was the normal LA taxi. Then a Black 4x4 pulled up and the Valet said this was our taxi, we questioned them saying we had asked for a yellow taxi and they replied yes this is it, so having only been in LA a few hours we took what they said and got in. As we thought it turned out to be a Limo service and cost us $25 where the same journey on the way back cost us $13. The driver also explained to us that he was in partnership with the hotel. What a coincidence... All in all a pretty awful stay at a hotel I was thinking would have been one of the safest options of knowing what you were going to get in Hollywood. After looking at other peoples reviews and photos on tripadvisor we seemed to get half the room everyone else got which would have been fine if it was half the price!

The hotel is beautiful, the room was great, and everything was very clean. That being said, I would expect that from a 5 star hotel in Vegas. The service was terrible!!!! When we checked in, the man at the front desk was very rude. I wrote that off as one bad employee. The following morning, after I payed $15 for 24 hours of internet access, the internet was down for 1 hour. I called the front desk to get a refund, and the front desk manager answered the phone. She said there was a power line down, and there was nothing she could do about it and it would be back up in 5 minutes. Not only did she refuse to refund my $15, she hung up me. When my fiance called back in 15 minutes after the internet was still down, she said, "that little girl just called 5 minutes ago, and I told her there was nothing I could do." She again refused to refund the money, and said all she could do was extend our internet for 24 more hours. I ended up having to go to a friend's hotel room to use their internet to send my one e-mail for work. In Vegas you expect a beautiful hotel with exceptional service. I was extremely disappointed by Encore! Also, the pool is very small, and we had to wait 30 minutes before 2 chair opened up. Do yourself a favor, and do not stay at Encore!

I was unaware of this site until recently. I wrote a lengthy review of this hotel after our stay there but Expedia never posted it, so I'll try it here. First the good part. The Sheraton Maui is one of the best locations there is. The beach is awesome and the snorkling right in front of the hotel is better than almost anywhere on the island. We saw more fish and turtles there than we did on the snorkling trip we paid for. Its also great to be able to walk to whalers village for shopping and restaurants. Now the bad part. This hotel is over priced for the quality of the rooms and service you recieve. When we checked into the hotel I noticed the service was lacking. No one offerred to take us and our luggage to our room, we were merely given directions. When we got to the room, which was dated and worn, I went to the bathroom. While standing at the toilet I saw pubic hairs stuck to the wall. Not something you expect to see when your paying as much as we were. When we left the room I stopped by the front desk to tell them of this and the clerk was rude. I attempted to explain where the hairs were and she ignored me, simply calling housekeeping in the middle of our conversation. No surprise, when we returned to the room we found the hairs still there. Later in our stay we saw someone had left a dirty plate of food and their pool towel on a planter box by the stairs we used daily. We thought that was poor behavior by someone but were more shocked when it remained there for over two days. It wasn't like it was hidden. It was right there. How could housekeepers and groundspersons just leave it sit there for two days? Any quality hotel has managers that walk the grounds and would catch something like this. The attitude with the staff at this hotel appears to be they don't have to care because they have the best location. But when you are paying over $400 a night, you expect better. We recommend renting a condo nearby for half the price.

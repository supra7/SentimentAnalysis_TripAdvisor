While this hotel is not as bad as some of the reviews would suggest, it is definitely not worth the price. The hotel has a great location and a nice lobby and bar area. The beds are really comfortable, and my room was not as small as expected, particularly after reading some of the previous postings. The bathroom was actually quite large, and had a great shower. I also liked the bath products. Having said that, the bathroom was also somewhat mouldy, and the rooms were tired and in need of a renovation. The carpet was quite worn. The hallways are somewhat dark, but I guess that's in keeping with the hotel's decor, but the rooms are inexcusably dark. Lastly, the service at the hotel was extremely uneven. While the concierge was helpful in recommending a restaurant, we were met with extremely indifferent service when we tried to have the hotel hold our luggage. Although 10 or 15 guests were waiting to have somebody take their luggage away to be held, staff members just stood around talking with each other. One, in fact, went outside for a smoke! This was truly unbelievable. Lastly, I was woken up each morning to the sound of housekeeping loudly banging on doors and saying "Housekeeping!". I've stayed in hotels around the world, at all price levels, and this is the first time that I've ever encountered this problem. Stay at this hotel if you can get a great rate, otherwise there are far better hotels in New York.

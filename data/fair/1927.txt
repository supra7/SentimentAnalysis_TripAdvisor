In need of repairs I was attending a Gift Market in Dallas and booked five nights stay in the Days Inn on Northwest Highway beginning on June 23rd. I entered the lobby about 8:30 p.m. behind another market attendee from Kansas who was told at the desk that his room that he had reserved a month earlier was not quite ready. He was told that the maid should have it ready in about an hour. He asked why maids were cleaning rooms at 8:30 at night and left very upset to look for another motel. My reserved room was ready and my wife and I unloaded and headed for our room. We had to pass a maid and cart in the hall to get to our room. When we checked out our room we found the bathroom vanity top to be loose and leaning about one inch from back to front. My wife inspected the bath towels and found them to be extremely small and worn. There was actually a hole the size of a quarter in one of them. They should have been thrown away a long time ago. I went to the front desk to ask for better towels and there were two other couples complaining about the condition of their rooms. I informed the clerk that we would only be staying for one night instead of five. We located another motel farther out on Northwest Highway and had a very enjoyable stay.

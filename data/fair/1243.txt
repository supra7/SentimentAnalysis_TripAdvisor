Four college girlfriends wanted a hotel close to Chester, Pa(Casino) Philly and Atlantic City. Using the Marriott's weekend getaway promotion, I was directed to the Fairfield Inn because they have suites. Upon arrival, there was no suite available eventhough my reservation clearly stated it. We decided to tough it out and check-in to a 2 QB room. The front desk staff was VERY friendly and understanding. The room, upon entering had an odor. We thought, ok, Freebreeze. We sat on the beds and thought we were on water beds. We quickly decided the room cost too much for what we were getting. Called around and the Embassy Suites had a vacancy. Fairfield allowed us to check out, for which I am greatful. We checked into a SUITE, for $20 more, but hot breakfasts for four were included. The suite had a separate sitting area with pull-out bed, microwave and fridge. Wonderful bedding and room decorated nicely. I would only stay at the Fairfield as a last resort. They need to upgrade bedding, lower their prices. Keep the hotel's Front Desk staff.

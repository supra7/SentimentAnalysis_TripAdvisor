On a return trip to Maui in March 2009, my wife and I were looking forward to staying in the Beach Tower at the Westin Maui. Knowing the history of the hotel - it was not originally built as a Westin property - we thought that the Beach Tower, built after Westin acquired the property some years back, would reflect the best of Westin - particularly given its location on Kaanapali Beach. We couldn't have been more wrong. The room was just like staying in a Holiday Inn. The room came with none of the standard amenities that would be found in a Marriott in any state. We had to call the front desk for the basics. The heavenly bed advertised by Westin also wasn't. Additionally, the quality of the food at the breakfast buffet - expensive by any mainland standards - was poor. It was like eating at Denny's next to a pool. Yes, the pool area and surrounding grounds are very nice, but in the end you are paying dearly for the Westin name and getting the equivalent of a Holiday Inn on the beach.

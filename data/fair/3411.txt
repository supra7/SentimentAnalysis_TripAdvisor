Stayed here for one night at the end of a 10 night trip to NY/Washington. Probably the most expensive night of the holiday and without doubt the worst accomodation. It's just too run down and the rooms just feel unclean because of it. Didn't help that firstly, the main elevators were having work done, and had to use the one service elevator accessed through a back corridor and secondly that some sort of construction was going on outside and we weren't allowed/able to open our room windows or access the small balcony as a result. Didn't think the location was great either, as was a fair few blocks away from only a 1 or 2 line subway stop and no bars/traditionnal delis in the surrounding area. It was a lot further east than I had assumed. There are a lot nicer/better value/better located hotels (and to be honest - hostels) than this in Manhattan, and although the Helmsley Middletowne isn't exactly a horror story, I wouldn't recommend.

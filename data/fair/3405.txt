I stayed at the Helmsley Middletowne for one night on a business trip. It was booked under a corporate travel contract and was a backup to the hotel the company usually uses. The property overall is quite dilapidated, with peeling paint, aging carpets, the oldest TV I have seen in a hotel in many years, etc. The room was clean but somewhat dank as it was a smoking room. The front desk is manned by a single person. Check-in was fine as there was no one else in line when I arrived at 9PM. Check out in the morning took 15 minutes as several people in front of me seemed to have complex situations regarding their bills. In sum, I would not choose this hotel if I was coming to NY for pleasure and wanted to enjoy my stay. It was OK for a one night business trip, considering the low rate.

Bell staff friendly and check-in okay. Had ocean-view room as requested (and paid for) but, two doubles instead of the requested King. Wife was told no bed guarantee over internet but we were moved to a king, ocean view room the following day. Unlike the first room, this room was in the back of the complex and did have an ocean view if you were willing to stand at the rail and look around the untrimmed vegetation. I convinced my wife to not complain again as I wasn't sure how much further away we would be moved third time around. We were already much farther away from the lobby area than we had been initially. Both rooms are on the small side for this kind of money with very basic (read uncomfortable) sitting furniture but, they were clean with no unpleasant aromas. The beds were comfortable. Room staff was also very polite and friendly. We had an opportunity to endure a dinner in the restaurant. Very pricey and understaffed with slow service and a meal that was similar in quality to the 24-hour stateside chain that begins with a "D". Had gift certificates for the same restaurants buffet breakfast. (Otherwise we were not willing to spend the $50.00 not including tip for two!) This time the "D" chain restraurant had them beat hands down with a better selection and better quality food. The omellette was good considering that the chef appeared like he would much rather be doing anything else but cooking. As this is a semi-outdoor arrangement there is a problem with "guest" control. There were sparrows everywhere. You didn't dare move more than three feet away from your food lest the invasion begin. Eat with one hand, swat at the birds with the other. I'm being very polite and kind. None of this was a problem to the staff or management . It was business as usual for them. We don't intend to stay here again.

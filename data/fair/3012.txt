After spending a 12 days over the holiday season, (6 Maui, 6 Kauai) the Westin Maui just didnt measure up. The resort, rooms, pools, and restaurants are all in need of a major makeover. Considering the high cost per night ($450 + for premium oceanfront), the resort fee ($25), one would expect a world class Westin resort... instead, you are given a 3 star hotel on the beach that is showing its age - badly. Do not recommend staying here until a major renovation is completed. Westin's brand is really slipping in Maui and Kauai.

Not sure what hotel the other good reviews on this place are talking about, the one and only good thing about this hotel was the location- if you want to be by Jackson square. Plenty of other nice hotels in the quarter that have a great location. We did opt for the cheaper room with no windows so maybe that was the reason that the room was so horrible??? Needed major renovations, was tiny, bathroom was horrible- didn't want to sit in the bathtub, carpet discusting. I really can't say anything good about the room, it was pretty bad- really old. The courtyard and pool area was ok, pretty but old and pool filled with drunk college kids. The front desk staff never did or said anything to us that was friendly-just checked us in and that was it. I was so disappointed after reading reviews that said great rooms and friendly staff- some even called this place a gem?? Sorry, far from it. You are better off staying somewhere else, we love the Moteleone on Royal- a little more expensive but you get what you pay for!!

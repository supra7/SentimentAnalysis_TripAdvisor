It was a week before my arrival and I wanted to extend my stay one more day because of a scheduled customer meeting and I was told that it could be done but my rate would jump up over $100 more and that I had to take it or leave it. I went out online and found a cheaper rate at the same hotel. I did not want to give up so I called the hotel direct and asked for a "onsite Reservations Manager and I was transfered to her and of course had to leave a message (this was on a Tuesday) and I never heard back until I wrote an e-mail to the General Manager. It was late Friday afternoon when the Reservations Manager finally got back to me and stated that she was horrible at checking her messages, but I had to make other arrangenments to stay at another hotel and was NOT a Westin property.

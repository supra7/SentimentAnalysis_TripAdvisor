My husband and I are native Chicagoans so we had been so proud to have the legendary Palmer House in our city. We decided to splurge on a 2 day staycation at this 5 star hotel. The location, common areas and lobby lived up to it's reputation however our room was nothing short of pathetic! Old faded carpet, "gray" bedding (which should have been white), peeling wallpaper and broken wood split doors met us. We had an archaic big tv ( no flat screen) in a large cabinet that was full of dust and horrific. Don't do the overpriced breakfast buffet. For $51 for 2 people you can get a better selection at Denny's. The restaurant staff was quite pleasant though. This was so close to a continental breakfast it was shocking. Directly across the hall from our room was a LAUNDRY supply room. It was full of unkempt debris and soiled linens that had the door open ALL day until we called the front desk to ask that someone come up and secure the room and lock the door. Not wanting to take the time and hassle from our day to request a room change, we toughed it out until the next day when we saw a roach in the bath tub. After calling the front desk we were NEVER even given an apology or another option. We requested the manager, Fay..e and her response was apathetic and unprofessional. She seemed bored by the whole account. I am an experienced world traveler and this was one of my most unpleasant stays. This was a 1 star stay.

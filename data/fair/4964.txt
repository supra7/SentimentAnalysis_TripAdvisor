Moderately priced yet decent hotels in Chicago are hard to come by in the summertime, so we thought we'd try this one, which seemed to have overall positive reviews. But compared to some of the other places we've stayed, which cost only slightly more, it was definitely not worth it to save a couple bucks. We splurged on a king size bed, but upon getting up to our room, found a rather small bed. We went back down to the lobby. I said, "We paid for a king bed, but the one in that room looks like a full. Could we get a different room, please?" Would you believe the response the guy gave was simply: "We don't have full sized beds." What sort of customer service is that?! It certainly wasn't a king! Just apologize and say you'll make it right. (We got the king, no problem.) There are only 2 small elevators, one of which was out of service all weekend long that we were there. We took the stairs down the 4 flights every time we went out and noticed lots of other people doing the same. There is no room in the back to store luggage, so it's all right out in the open in the small lobby of the hotel. When we were picking ours up, there was no one around watching it, so we just grabbed our bags. Really safe, huh?? This is by no means a boutique or a 4-star hotel.

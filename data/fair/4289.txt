I stayed here on a Hotwire reservation. (I wonder if substandard rooms are given to Hotwire, etc. customers?) I arrived early for my reservation and the front desk women were very friendly and nice. I was able to get into my room which was a huge plus. But the room was not. It was in the East Tower admittance to which was by two pass-coded doors. There were only two rooms per floor reached by a small elevator - creepy. The good: very large room with a comfortable bed and a kitchen. Front desk people were terrific. The bad: huge scaffolding unit outside my room so I couldn't open the curtains unless I wanted people peering in at me. There was a portable AC unit which was making a weird sound. (I was told they were repairing the room unit.) I thought it would be all right. It wasn't. I almost asked to be switched at 9:30 at night because of the noise from the unit. No internet - they said they charge for third party guests like Hotwire. The front desk woman gave it to me for free which was nice, but it still didn't work. There was no swinging auxiliary lock like (I thought) is standard on all hotel rooms. Old and not-so-clean tub/shower. This hotel was rated 3 stars on Hotwire. It should have been 1 or 2. I stayed at the Helmsley the next week on another Hotwire reservation and that was 3 1/2 stars. No comparison - that was pure luxury.

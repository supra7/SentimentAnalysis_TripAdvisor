I stayed at this hotel for six nights (conference). I would not stay here again. The location is OK and the (important) the mattress is comfortable but this hotel just can not be considered a 5-star hotel. A few simple examples: very small room, mini-bathroom, no coffee maker, no newspaper, very few international TV channels (e.g. only one Turkish channel to watch the 2010 World Cup), no fresh orange juice at breakfast buffet (you can order for 5 lira (!!!))..... There is a mini-bar in the room but contents are prohibitively expensive. The wifi was working fine in my room and daily cleaning of the room was done well. My worst experience however was similar to what another reviewer metioned: taking a taxi back to the airport. I asked the reception about the costs for a taxi to the airport and was told 50 lira. I was told it was 50 TL. This was also the amount I paid when I arrived from the airport to the hotel with a metered taxi. I took one of the taxis in front of the hotel and asked the price. The taxi driver said "meter-taxi" which was fine with me as I expected it would come to 50 TL. He took the same road I took the first time from the airport to the hotel but when I arrived at the airport the meter it was almost 70 TL. Clearly, I was cheated by this taxi driver - so don't trust these guys and agree on a price beforehand. It is easy to manipulate a taxi meter. The guy who cheated me is driving a yellow Renault Megane with a red sticker on the back windscreen with the name of the Elite World Hotel and their website so they're closely connected. Twice I have sent the hotel an email about this, asking for their feedback, but no reply. So it seems they don't really care about their customers - another example why this is definitely not a 5-star hotel! There are much better deals to be had in Istanbul: either spend the same and stay at a real 5 star or spend half and stay in a hotel with similar quality of the Elite World.

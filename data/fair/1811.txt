This hotel was not what I expected from wingate. The staff was very courteous and the location was great. We were 10 minutes from anything that we wanted to do in Dallas. But....the hotel was not as clean as I like. We booked this hotel because of the indoor pool and my 10 year old was very disappointed. The indoor pool was not heated and was really to cool to swim in. The hot tub had an opened box of bar soap, a washrag, and a towel beside it. It appeared someone had used it as a bathtub. Not appealing at all. This hotel was a good place for a business traveler, but not for a family.

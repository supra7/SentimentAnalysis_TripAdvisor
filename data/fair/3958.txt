rooms need a facelift despite a fabulous location and a vintage building oozing w/charm, the rooms need a renovation. we've been staying here 1-3X annually for the past eight years, and our last two visits have been disappointing: mildew in the shower, old carpet on the bathroom floor, general musty feeling, thread-bare furniture. we hope they follow our advice, because we'd very much like to return.

Parked on the top level, level seven and to walk to fifth level to get elevator to the lobby. No signs of where to get elevator. narrow spaces, dead end parking we had to back out on each level and search for an empty space. Dangerous backing out. Room had a terrible view of the a roof and the parking garage, I could almost see our car. We were near the pool somewhere.

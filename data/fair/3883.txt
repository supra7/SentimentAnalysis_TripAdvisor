We just came back from a one night stay at the Surfer Beach hotel. We were in San Diego for a wedding of a good friend. We had heard of this hotel by him (he had heard form someone else) and after checking out the web site, decided to book there. The parking is difficult as they do not have enough spots for all the guests. This would not be so bad if they also did not charge for parking. We got our room key for our ocean view room. We could see the ocean, if we looked past the pool, roof, and our neighboor's balcony. It was quite warm in our room so I went to turn on the air. There is NO air conditioning in the room at all. It was very stuffy and hot in there. There was a fan with dust all over it to use (should be been an occilating fan, but that was broken). We simply had to move it to wherever we were. The sheets had a few holes in them. We had to call down for a hair dryer at one point. When my husband called to enquire if they have one, the front dest replied that they did, but did not offer to bring it up, we had to go get it. When we got back from the wedding, we went to open the slider to get some cool air in, but there were people sitting on the balcony right next to ours, putting them about eighteen inches from our door. For one night, our bill was $300, way too much for this place. We will make sure to stay somewhere else next time. If the whole thing had been less than $100 it would have been worth it. The only thing that they have going for them was that our bed was comfy.

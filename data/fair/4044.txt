Not a "five star experience." made reservations several weeks ahead and called to twice to be sure they knew we would arrive after midnight. They "made note"of the late arrival time and stated "no problem.". After 14 hours en route we arrive at 12:45 am and are told they do not have a room for us and they are sorry but they "overbooked.". The young lady (Michele)at the registration desk was pleasant and apolegetic and said she would call us on our cell phone when something was available. To me this is unacceptable of a "five star" resort. It tells me they are greedy and do not value their customers and trying to get every dime they can anyway that they can. To have a reservation and be told at 1:00 am you don't have a room is not acceptable. Get more housekeepers ! Sixteen dollars for a carafe of coffee is greedy! Ten dollars for a toothbrush is ridiculous! After a two hour wait we are "downgraded" to a handicapped room and told we have to move the next morning. We don't even have the king bed that we booked! We tell the front desk we will be at the convention center all day the following day and not returning until 6:00 pm. They say "no problem." They call us at 2:00 pm and state the room is ready and we need to return to the hotel as soon as possible. We leave early and miss two events but it is still close to five when we can get back to move. Later that night we are riding in an elevator with a very nice handicapped gentleman who relates his check in story. His room was not ready and he had to wait 4 hours to check in. We are horrified and feel terrible; yes the room they booked us into! They knew he had a reservation, and they knew we could not be on call all day to move when they finally said another room was ready! Where is the customer service and the "Wynn Experience.?". Shame on Steve Wynn for his greediness!"

Not bad, but not awesome We stayed in Don Giovanni. Employers were nice overall. But they forgot to prepare our breakfast even though we called them at night the day before. So we had to change our plan a bit because breakfast arrived much later than we thought. Besides, there was a cleaning stuff left at window, which destroyed the whole atmosphere of the gorgeous suite. A peg was also left on the floor, with which my feet almost got hurt.There are two bathrooms and one was dirty with blue marks. So we did not want to use it. The place of the Mansion is a bit way off from downtown and is not located in a convenient and nice place. Free parking is great, though.We will probably not stay here again.

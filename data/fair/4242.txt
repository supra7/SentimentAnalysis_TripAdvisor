Pictures on website look much better than actual hotel & rooms. Hotel looks very dated and is in need of a complete makeover. Carpet was nasty & dirty and was always wet in front of dishwasher. Paid for oceanfront (was told I got an oceanfront) -- but I really got a 2nd floor garden view-- could see water (but not beach) if you looked between trees, tennis court & pool. Read the fine print. Not all rooms have dvd players, room dividers, fireplaces, or in-room safes. Kitchen utensils were sparse. Came back to room after it had been cleaned to find deadbolt on door set so door wouldn't close. Fortunately, nothing was taken. Inquired with management about security. Was told it was a very high priority & would be addressed. Next day, observed maids doing the same thing. Also, had to evacuate the building at 2:15 am, due to an emergency in the building. Although, it's not the Holiday Inn's fault, I didn't appreciate having to take 2 small children out of bed. On a positive side, "kids eat free" was nice and I liked the free fruit available all day in the lobby. This was my last stay at a Holiday Inn.

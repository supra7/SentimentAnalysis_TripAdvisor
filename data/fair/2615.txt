I've just returned from a stay at the Sheraton Downtown Dallas location on Olive Avenue. I was utterly disgusted with my visit, both in the quality of the accommodations and the level of service at this facility. I've attached photos of the bathroom, which seemed to be in a serious state of disrepair, and of the towels that were placed in our bathroom for our use - which I quite honestly wouldn't have used at home for our family dog. There were also other issues, no remote for the TV, unresponsive hotel staff (took over 45 minutes to receive replacement towels and only after 3 calls), intoxicated guests who had a screaming match in the hall at 3:30am, etc. It so happened that the same weekend we stayed at the hotel, the Dallas Margarita Ball was also being held. After checking in to the hotel (around 1pm) and then leaving to visit some friends, we returned to the hotel (at 6pm) where we were told that parking, both valet and self, were full, due to the event being held at the hotel. Even being a paid guest in the hotel, we were made to park almost 6 blocks away and pay $20. When I complained to Leonard, the manager on duty, I was informed that there were 11,000 people coming to the hotel that night and "that's just the way it works". I quite honestly find it hard to believe that any business would treat a paying guest this way and still maintain their customers. I've always enjoyed staying at Sheraton properties, but this recent stay has left me wondering if I'll ever return.

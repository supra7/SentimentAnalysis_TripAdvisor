Wife and I went to NYC for 4 days of shopping, eating, etc. W was the only "4 star" in the 300-400 range. Would have been very unhappy if I spent more. I read the reviews before arriving and was expecting a small room. But this was ridiculous - and we were "upgraded" from the "cozy" room (which I assume means the former broom closet), otherwise I don't think our bags would have fit. Staff was incredibly polite (a misguided effort to make up for the tiny rooms?), lobby is nice in that chic modernistic W Hotel way, but overall the place is really just a 3 star hotel that is coated with a thin veneer of hipness. Too big flat panel TV for the room, an incredibly noisy AC system that could not make up its mind, and an electronic minibar that kept charging us if we even just bumped the items on the shelf added up to a no return experience. I'm usually pretty easy going on hotels, but I seriously cannot recommend the W New York. Sorry, but it's not worth the coin, even at half the price I paid.

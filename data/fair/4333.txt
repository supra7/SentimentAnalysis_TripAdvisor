Poor customer service Asked for a wake-up call, didn't get it. Put shoes out for shining 2 days in a row, didn't get that either, even though I asked the Front Desk to make sure. Doorman and concierge too busy talking to hotel personal to help get you a cab or a restaurant address, respectively. For the price, the attention to detail and responsiveness should have been a given. Not here. Very disappointing.

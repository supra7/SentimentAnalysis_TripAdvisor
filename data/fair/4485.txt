Ok I never complain but this hotel was painful! We drove the coast from Vancouver, BC to San Fran and we have stayed in a few hotels to say the least but this one was not great at best. I understand a city room and I understand a city hotel but this hotel has NOTHING!!! Stairs are the way to go (which is fine with us) you have to go through the restaurant to get to those stairs. After checking in, I could of told you there are better places! After touring San Fran I can say for sure there are tons of better places. Check out California Street or Japan Town, even further away from the water and closer to the Wharf would be better than here stay out of the FD and take in culture somewhere else! This place is dry!. Not trying to be negative but I have used this site for years to book my holidays and I felt I owed it to say this. Hope I gave you enough opinions to enjoy your holiday! Km

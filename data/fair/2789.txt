What an inflated ego this place has. First the pool area is obnoxiously crowded. Was told by the staff if we wanted chairs at the pool, we need to be ther by 7AM - Really? I'm vacation, not getting up to go to work. If you finally find a chair, it is smack up against another chair - Love thy neighbor? Attitude of housekeeping is lousy. Our 10 yr. old slept on the worst sofa bed imaginable. I tried getting a comforter to make the bed more comfortable. They said if they could find an "extra" they'd bring one - that's the answer I would expect at an economy hotel. As far as the food - go to the Four Seasons next door. This may have been "the resort" in its day, but sadly its glory days are over. I cannot in good conscience recommend this "resort".

The resort was very nice in the overall appearance, as in the outside. We were excited to see that the villas were spacious and nicely decorated. However, the problem was that the entire suite was filthy starting in the kitchen, where there was a sticky film on the counter, the floors were also sticky and dirty. The living room sofas were too filthy to even sit on. We reported it all to the clerk who told us that they would do a complete cleaning. They cleaned it alright, when we returned back to the room, it was still in the same manner as before. The maid left her dirty cloth and sponge on the kitchen's counter and forgot to clean. They replaced our towels and gave us stained towels. If this is how they clean and maintain the facilities I wouldn't want to see how they live!!!! This was the nastiest resort ever.!!!! If they were to keep it clean then it would be a great place unfortunately it's NOT!!!!!

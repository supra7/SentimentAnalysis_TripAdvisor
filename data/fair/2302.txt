Simply terrible service at this high priced, poorly managed establishment. The rooms are pretty standard fair, not bad. Be prepared to be nickel and dimed throughout your stay and dont bother trying to request or discuss anything with their incompetent staff unless you enjoy talking with people who could care less about hospitality. There are plenty of options in Boston, avoid this place like the plague.

The room we had was horrible, in my opinion. The space was super small. The room has 3 very small pull out drawers. We were glad we did not stay more than a day, or we would have been upset with how much space we had. Wallpaper peeling in the bathroom. Double bed was insanely small, but was somewhat comfortable. Tub drained very slowly after using, and toilet looked pretty gross. Not dirty...but just old. Carpet looked very old and somewhat dingy. We had a tv, but for the price of the room and 4 star room ratings, we were expecting to at least have an updated tv, not one that we assumed was 10 years old. We could hear a cell phone ringing, several times, in the room next to us, and could always hear people opening and closing doors and walking down the hallway... walls were obviously thin. I felt like our room was a 2 star and not a 4 star. I have used hotwire for hotels several times, now, and have booked 2 & 3 star hotels where the rooms were much cleaner and more updated than this one. I know it's an older and historical hotel, but we were expecting so much more after seeing how nice the lobby was decorated. Can give credit to the beautiful ceilings in the lobby, but that's probably about it. The whole room's feel just felt so outdated and ugly compared to the pictures we've seen on the site and other hotels we've stayed at. My boyfriend and I felt that we mostly paid for the location of the hotel than for a comfortable room, but we wanted to be right in the middle of downtown Chicago, so we were happy about that. We just felt like we were cheated out of something that could have been so much more!

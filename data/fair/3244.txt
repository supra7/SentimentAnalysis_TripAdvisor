I've stayed in some great Intercontinental hotels around the world so I was happy to book into the Intercontinental New Orleans on a recent business trip. I was disappointed. The hotel look and feel is tired. It is in need of refurbishment. Showers were poor. Carpets and dcor were old. The walls were thin and my room had an interconnecting door to my neighbours so I could hear their television all evening and all night. Standards of cleaning were not great. My quilt cover had a huge piece of wax on it when I arrived. I changed it for the quilt on the second bed and that was dirty too. Breakfast was frustratingly slow for a business traveller. They have that annoying system where they make you wait until the (one) server is ready to seat you at their convenience. On the last day of my stay, after waiting 5 minutes for a server to greet me at the door I was told that I would have to wait another 5 or 10 minutes for a table. I was furious (especially as I could see lots of empty tables that I could have used). I think that I was not alone in being annoyed. Eventually the food & beverage manager (Frank Gifford) came to speak to me to explain. Apparently they were "obligated to give excellent customer service" so, because they were short staffed, they had to close off half of the restaurant so they could serve the remainder well. It amazes me that he thought that it would be better customer service to keep people waiting to sit for 5 to 10 minutes rather than make them wait a few minutes longer for a coffee (and a bill).

I made sure to get a courtyard room to avoid the street side noise, as someone else recommended here. Before I got the room I didn't know the hotel was "pet friendly", in particular, noisy barking dog friendly. I have allergies to dogs and I couldn't stand the neverending barking echoing from the courtyard. The stairwell smelled like dog urine too. My room was so strongly scented with cleaning products that I'm sure that's just to mask the smell of the old dog urine which other guests left behind. Thanks dog owners! Why not leave your dumb yappy dog back home? So selfish. Plus there are homies outside of the hotel on every corner just standing there. It doesn't feel safe any time. So between the dog barking, dog smells and the homies...I'll never go back to this hotel.

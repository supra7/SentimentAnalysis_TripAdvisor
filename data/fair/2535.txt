Love Chicago, and the Palmer House is a large hotel with a great lobby - but that's where it ends. Have stayed in a number of other Chicago hotels, but stayed here for work reasons. We are pretty easygoing, but this place tested our patience. FRONT DESK: Hotel had lost our reservations for a 5 night stay, on a busy week, but after a draining experience at the front desk, they managed to accomodate us. Requested two keys, but only one was coded to the room. ROOMS: The first room (14th floor) we had was tiny tiny. Once two suitcases were on the floor, there wasn't room to walk by them. TV was positioned to the side of the bed. After two nights we requested a move, we got a slightly larger room on the 9th floor - with CONSTRUCTION going on in the room next door from 6 am onward. Who needs a wake up call when have hammering and sanding? Yikes. Both rooms we had were modernized and nicely appointed. Desk clerk said they had/were redoing 2/3rd of the rooms. Rooms mainly look across at other wings of the hotel, so you can't really have your blinds open without putting on a show. So no daylight. PERKS: The gym costs $11 + internet ranges from $12 up depening on level of service! at these rates, gym + internet access should be free! LOCATION: good for Millennium Park + Art Institute + theaters. CAVEAT: Cell phones will NOT work in the lobby here - makes it tough to coordiniate are meeting people. So, huge + impersonal + construction + hassels= wouldn't stay here again. Didn't feel the love....

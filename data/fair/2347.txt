I stayed at the Fairmont Copley Plaza this Labour Day weekend. I have stayed at Fairmont properties in the past and had a very positive experience. My experience at the Fairmont Copley Plaza was very disappointing and has impacted my future choices to stay at a Fairmont property. I do not recommend staying at this property. Overall, the hotel appears to be very luxurious. The lobby, main floor hallways, and ballrooms are gorgeous. However, the standard rooms are not a reflexion of the luxury seen on the main floor of the hotel. The rooms are very small and mediocre at best. We had the following problems with our room: 1. Hotel safe didn't work. 2. In room temperature control did not work. 3. Light bulbs in both the bedside lamp and hanging chandelier were burnt out. 4. TV didn't work. The cables were loose and we fixed it ourselves. 5. The hot water in the shower took a long time to heat up. 6. The drainage in the shower was blocked, leaving a pool of water up to our ankles when we showered. We called the reception for help with the safe as we wanted to leave our valuables in the safe before going out for the day. We waited 45 minutes, as security tried to fix it and finally could not fix it in a timely way. Overall, we felt that they don't maintain the rooms to the standard that is expected from a Fairmont hotel. In addition, the breakfast menu was misleading. We ordered a pastry basket for $14. It indicated that there would be a croissant, two muffins and a danish. Based on the description, we expected a full size croissant and danish. The reality was that the pastries were miniature size. It was VERY misleading and EXTREMELY overpriced for what we received. Thank goodness that Boston is such an amazing city! We spent less time in our room and more exploring the amazing architecture and culture.

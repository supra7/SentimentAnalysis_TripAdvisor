so-so hotel The hotel (built in 1905) has its charm and it is decorated accordingly. However, the location is somewhat suspect. Out first night we heard several people shouting or arguing all night on the street below. The hotel is also one street over from a fire station! Yes, sirens go off about every hour or so. However, the worst of it for me was the smell. As soon as you walk into the lobby you pick up the mold odor. We had two rooms - one was not so bad but the other room was very moldy. If you are not sensitive to mold, then this might not be a problem.All things being considered, we reserved rooms for three nights but stayed just one and re-checked into a hotel in the financial district which was much quieter.

We arrived late on a Thursday night at about 11pm. After a five hour flight and rental car pick-up we were hungry and wanted a glass of wine. We checked in, changed clothes and went down to the lobby area. We found out the kitchen was closed and NO food was available. SO we proceeded to the bar area. The waitress quickly informed us that it was last call and we were rushed and hurried out. Not a very nice impression at all. For the money you expect 24 hour room service at least!! Then we get into our room and realize that we overlook (room 243) the front enterance and valet. So throughout the night we were awakened by the goofing off of the valet people. In the morning it was so loud we called and complained. The bathroom lighting was dingy and dark (nice hot shower though). I went out to open the drapes to get more light in the room and was face to face with someone coming down the outside stairs. SO we had to keep the drapes shut the entire trip. DO NOT LET THEM PUT YOU IN ROOM 243!! Now some nice things, the decor is precious and very well decorated (carpet is stained in most places though). Anyway, the Edgewater sent a survey after and I complained about the same things. The Marriott right down there on the water looked so clean, new and nice that would be my choice next trip. Seallte itself was perfect - great food, people, scenery!

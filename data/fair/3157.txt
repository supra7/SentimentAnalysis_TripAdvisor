Great Location Just got back from a 4 night stay at the Marseilles Hotel with my boyfriend. The location is excellent, right near Lincoln and Ocean ave, and directly on the beach. Decent pool area and great breakfast is served at the hotel.The pictures of the hotel on their website were beautiful, but in reality the hotel is very old and the rooms were extremely small. The shower had hot water, but the floor and sink was peeling as were the walls. The air conditioner was very noisy as well, and there was no way to turn it off. The room also had a strong odor of must and mold. Our balcony consisted of a view of an alley, and it was shared by the room next door. It did have a mini fridge which was nice.If you don't mind older accommodations, this is a fine place to stay. The price was good, staff was friendly enough, and the location could not have been any better. Besides there is so much to do in South Beach and the weather is so great you will not be spending much time in the room.

On January 17th my wife, daughter and I booked 2 rooms for 3 nights at the Makena Resort. We have stayed there earlier in the year. This stay was a very unpleasant; one for several reasons. The service from one of the Managers on duty (male) was rude and made us feel very uncomfortable and un-welcome. The front desk staff (supervisor and manager) became very demanding and un-pleasant to communicate with. Our first morning at the resort we had a flood in the bathroom from the sink area that flooded the entire bathroom. We did not receive an apology or any type of compensation for the inconvenience. Over all I would give a very poor rating of the resort staff and not recommend this resort to others. T. Gallegos

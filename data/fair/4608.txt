Yeah right, what's the fuss! I totally disagree with the review given by my travel companion since we both stayed at the same room. Given that it is an old hotel, is strategically situated. and the rooms are bigger, I can honestly say that the service needs a lot of improvement. First and foremost, the sheets were not changed, drinking glasses were not washed or replaced, the paper trash were still in the night tables, even the floor were not vacuumed during our entire stay. The Ohana Maille was just across the street, so we could have stayed there again for the exact same price as it is veryclean, orderly and very well maintained. My companion who selected this hotel was really after a balcony with the view of the parking lot and a kitchenette which we never really needed. Next time, I would probabaly scoop up a few dollars more and stay somewhere else!

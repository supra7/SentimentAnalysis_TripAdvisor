I am writing this review while still at the hotel! I transferred to this hotel from Harrahs as they were booked up (wonderful stay there - see my review) I am a Marriott Rewards member. Pros - great room, great location, nice and helpful staff Cons - tiny, tiny bathroom, internet access - awful (used my phone to access work emails as using laptop took so long), hot water using it for first time was very cool- had to run it for 10 mins for it to warm up, room service for breakfast - if you put out your order before midnight - check that it was taken as soon as you get up - ours was not taken and we had a tour to go on - their recovery from this was fast but when we called down they were not surprised!

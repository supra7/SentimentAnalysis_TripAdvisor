Checked in for a 3 day getaway. I was told we would be upgraded upon check in since we were a member of the Priority Club. Once we checked in & found our room we had not been upgraded The fireplace that was in the room made such a racket we were unable to use it. The refrigerator compressor made a horrible racket each time it cut off & on. We also noticed holes in the wall by the bed & one of the electric sockets were hanging sideways & you could see behind it. My Husband dropped his keys on the floor beside the bed & could not help but notice a chip bag & one sock under the bed. The indoor pool was freezing & when we got in the hot tub and I took my hand out of the water I pulled up a handful or hair. GROSS !!!!! We have stayed here many years & I am sad to say we won't be going back. We could have stayed at several other places & now I wish we had.

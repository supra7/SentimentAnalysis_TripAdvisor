I would not give it a 4 star rating.has a rather nasty smell in rooms, breakfast was not good and there was mould on the bread!!! The area is nice and local, everything is walking distance which was good. Television didnt have big choice of chanels, The steam room was not working, sauna was never turned on had to wait for ages if wanted to use it. There were no towels or shampoo and shower gel in changing rooms and no one ever there to help in the gym!! Not value for money can get much better service elsewhere at this rate.

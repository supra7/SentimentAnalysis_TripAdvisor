Stayed here with colleagues on a business trip for 7 days. I checked reviews here, even though I did.n't have a choice in hotels. Here are my comments: 1. Lobby was modern and nicely decorated 2. Free breakfast daily (only meal served in dining room, no room service but delivery from restaurants is available). 3. Front desk staff was pretty nice. 4. Like others mentioned, due to location there are no supermarkets, convenience stores or restaurants close by. A colleague did say there was a small cafe in the business park directly across from the hotel though. There are also no vending machines so if you want to purchase drinks and snacks, there's a selected variety in an area next to the front desk for purchase. 5. Rooms are on the smaller side, but I've actually had worse lol My room had stains on the carpet where you could tell there was an overflow from the bathroom. There is no heat in the room, just A/C. Though it makes sense because of the weather there, it was actually cool at night during our stay in early March and I could've used some heat. Bathroom is decent size, but shower stall is on the smaller side but still workable. And there are no small amenities like lotions, shampoos etc but they do provide a body/hair cleanser in the shower. Bed was super firm, pillows soft and not flat sheet, only comforter. Again, this is probably due to the hot weather, but I did receive a blanket for the cooler nights. 6. There is NO WIFI in the rooms only hardwire, they provide cable. It was reliable and several colleagues had difficulty with connects. The staff worked on it all week with no success. Wifi is available in the lobby but you have to pay for it. 7. They provide shuttle service that leaves at 10:30am and will take you to either the Dubai Mall or the beach. Pickup is at 3:30pm. There are also taxi's available and the metro station is about a 15 min walk. If I had th e choice, I wouldn't stay here again, but it's OK if you're on a budget.

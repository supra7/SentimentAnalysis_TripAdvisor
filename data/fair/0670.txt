Listen up. This hotel has a big indoor pool in a huge atrium. Typically this would be a big plus for me. However, acoustics are really bad and since most rooms open onto the pool you can hardly sleep. There is always a yahoo or two that stay in the pool really late and go back really early. Their screams keep everyone awake as the sound has nowhere to go and resonates all around the atrium. You have been warned. If you want a quiet night of sleep look elsewhere.

The Good: The room and hotel was very clean and the cleaning staff was friendly. The shower was very nice as well. Great location. Check out was a snap. The Bad: I reserved a room with two beds more than five months before staying there. When I arrived, they said they only had a room with one bed available, due to it being first come first serve. I wound up sleeping on the floor during my stay. Check in staff was inaudible due to the large crowd in the lobby. I just nodded until she gave me the room key. I had to call the front desk to tell them I did not want the USA today (or else I would get charged). Inconvenience, and I only managed to see this by reading the guide in the room. Imagine others who were surprised with a paper each morning and a .75 cent charge each day. I called to have a cot, so I would not have to sleep on the floor, and they stated I could only have one cot and that it woudl be $25.00. The least they could have done is give me a cot free, as they changed the reservation on me without notice. All stairwells were locked, and we had to use the elevator only. At times we were required to show our convention badges to even use the elevator. Other times people were stranded due to crowded elevators and not being able to use the stairs. Room temperature would never go below 70 degrees. It was hot and hard to go to sleep. When I called about my reservation being changed and about a cot, the staff were rude. Pool closed around 11p.m. You could hear doors being slammed throughout the night. No fridge or microwave. There was just too much bad to even consider ever staying there again. Perhaps not during a convention they are able to handle things better.

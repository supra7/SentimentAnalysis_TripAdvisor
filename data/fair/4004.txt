Pass on this hotel We stayed at the Clift hotel for 5 nights in May, 2007. The decor is interesting and funky. The rooms are very small and as has been mentioned, the bathrooms are extra small. Most rooms have only a closet to store your clothing. Each room is slightly different, but the purple, cream and orange tones seem to be consistent. We enjoyed the decor, but the rooms are very noisy. You can literally hear the people speaking next door and no, they don't have to be loud. This is one of the noisiest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in and we travel a lot.Unfortunately we had guests who despite being asked by hotel security to be quiet, continued to party well past 3am. Ear plugs don't do the trick. We asked for a room change. It was handled efficiently and because we didn't have guests staying beside us, our new room was quiet. The hotel staff were helpful in relocating us and in recommending restaurants and offering other suggestions. I didn't think they were as professional as one would expect in this class of hotel, but they got the job done. Eventually. The location is excellent and we felt very safe.I'll be back to SF, but I won't be staying here. I can't recommend it, even for a short stay.

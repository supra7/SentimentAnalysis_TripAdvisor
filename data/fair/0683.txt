I stayed one night using my free points before heading to Whidbey Island. I wondered why I was asked if I would take a first floor room, later to find out that really it's in the basement with windows up high looking out at car guts. The room was minimal and breakfast was so scarce and crowded that some people had to stand in the hall and some outside to eat. It's like an airport factory with everyone waiting for take-off. Pass it by if you can.

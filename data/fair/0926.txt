My wife and I weren't at all impressed with this resort. We went from the Grand Hyatt in Kauai to this resort in Maui on the same trip and were very dissapointed in the cleanliness and atmosphere of the resort. The rooms were dark and depressing. The Hyatt Reghency is supposed to be in the same class as the Grand Hyatt but there is no comparison. We were so dissapointed we checked out after only 2 hours and went to the Grand Wailea in South Maui. We were much happier at the Grand Wailea and the beaches are nicer down there as an added bonus. Is the Hyatt Regency nicer than some of the surrounding resorts in Kanapali? Maybe, but my advice would be to stay at one of the resorts in Wailea and avoid Kanapali altogether. If you've vacationed in both, as I have, I'm sure you would agree.

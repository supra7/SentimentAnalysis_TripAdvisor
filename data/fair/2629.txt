Hotel was crowded but we were there on July 4th so I wasn't surprised. Great location to watch the fireworks. Staff was courteous. The main pool area was packed so we used the 5th floor pool. When we were packing to checkout, I looked under the bed for the kids toys and found a used condom. Needless to say I was shocked. I told the staff when I checked out. They made a note to call housekeeping. Some things I can handle but not this. Won't be staying there again.

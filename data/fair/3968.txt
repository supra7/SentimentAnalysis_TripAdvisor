Beautiful house, unfriendly manager, creepy Well I wouldn't recommend this place. We found the manager to be rude, the neighborhood to be a bit too rough for our liking, and the room to be creepy. We stayed for quite a few days on a business trip and really didn't get a good nights sleep once. I kept feeling like someone was standing behind me the entire stay there, and no one was. The only interesting thing about the stay was I convinced someone to give me a tour after most of the guests had checked out and I got a look at all of the other rooms. She told me some creepy stories about the place and that added some intrigue to the experience.

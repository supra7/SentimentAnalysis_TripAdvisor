First the positives: staff were excellent - very friendly and professional. And the location was good. But, unfortunately there were quite a few negatives... The room was very outdated. Furniture was 'tired'; at least half the lights didn't work or flickered annoyingly; the bathroom was very basic; and worse of all the room was cold. The heater in the living room worked (though was very noisy) but the one in the bedroom didn't. And I'm afraid the single blanket on the bed just wasn't enough for New York in November. A shame, because as I say the staff were lovely, but I wouldn't stay here again.

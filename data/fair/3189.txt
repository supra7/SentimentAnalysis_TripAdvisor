Do not stay here. It is tremendously overpriced, the shower ran out of hot water, there was a strong smell of smoke in the room, the exercise room was tiny, the TV was not HD, and the breakfast was mediocre. This is the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in, $393 a night including tax for a room for two, including breakfast. The room was OK, with a working fireplace and a fake log to burn. We did not use it, but when we returned from dinner there was a strong smell of wood smoke, probably leaking in from another room. Before dinner, I tried to take a shower. My wife had enough hot water when it was turned fully to hot, but for me, the hot water ran out. I called the desk, but they could not repair it immediately and we had to leave for a dinner reservation. When we got back, along with the smoke smell, there was a free bottle of wine, but this did not compensate to having to wash with a washcloth at the sink. We used the exercise room, advertised as a well-equipped fitness room with the latest equipment. It had only one treadmill, one bike, one step machine and one strange machine where you move your feet sideways. It was full and we could not do any exercise. The TV was flat screen, but not HD, and you could not change the aspect ratio. So everyone looked fat. The breakfast had terrible pastry, runny scrambled eggs, and a poor selection of fruit. I would have expected at such an expensive place something better. Save your money and go somewhere else.

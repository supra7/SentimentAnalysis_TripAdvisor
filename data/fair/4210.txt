I just returned from a Christmas stay at the Dunes Manor. Overall, I believe this is a hotel well past its prime, and the decor, staff, and majority of the guests reflect that. Obviously this is the off season for Ocean City, so keep that in mind. Common areas: The hotel has a lounge area with a piano. Some nights a woman does play piano there - and at least during the holidays, expect the sofas and chairs to be full of older folks singing Christmas carols. There is "Zippy's Lounge," which is a small bar on the beach side of the lounge. The bartenders are friendly enough and have a very "heavy hand." The prices are also outstanding, especially during happy hour. Zippy's was the only high point of the visit for me. The hotel restaraunt is old, and the menu selections are standard hotel fare. None of the meals were particularly appetizing, although the bacon is a highlight at breakfast. The service is the killer, however. We ate three meals during our stay; during two of them, wait staff spilled food on us. The staff appeared dirty and smelled like cigarettes as well. Not appetizing. Rooms: Outdated, in desperate need of renovation. The mattresses were old and creaky, and the TVs are old LCD types. The paint is faded and peeling, and the bathrooms look like they haven't been renovated in 20 years. The towels and sheets also appear to be very old. They were clean, but worn and dingy looking. The high points: Bacon at breakfast. Stiff, cheap drinks at the bar. Free, ample parking. The location is right on the boardwalk and beach. Low points: Staff in restaraunt. Outdated rooms and common areas. Linens and towels. Unless you can stay for free, or have some other reason to stay, I'd recommend the Hilton a few blocks North or the Courtyard about ten blocks South. Both are newer, have better service, and are located on the boardwalk.

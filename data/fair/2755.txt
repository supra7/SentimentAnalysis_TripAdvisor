I stayed here mid December 2009. The tall front desk gentleman was lovely; very personable, and he seemed to enjoy his job. Were it not for him, I I would've rated this place lower. The room was clean, but old and drab, as was the bathroom. It might've been a bit depressing, but I wasn't in the room much so it was okay. More importantly, the sheets were clean and it good condition, as were the towels. The bed and pillows were comfortable. I did experience a few irritations while I was there. The alarm clock in the room was not working. The friendly gentleman at the front desk said someone would be by shortly with a replacement. Also, the chain in the toilet broke, so it wouldn't flush. Luckily one of us is very handy and fixed it. We waited about 30 minutes for the clock, but then had to get something to eat. The clock never arrived, but in the end it wasn't needed because the maid was vacuuming the hallway at 7:30am Saturday morning! Ridiculous. Koval Lane is very close to the strip, but it has a lot of VERY seedy looking apartments and derelict buildings which made me feel a little uneasy as we approached the motel. Our cards wouldn't unlock the door to the hotel which was closest to the casino and restaurant, so we had to walk all the way around it was pretty cold, so that was annoying. Ellis Island is a great restaurant-- you can tell by the line-ups and people's willingness to wait up to an hour for food. The portion size, quality and price are one of the best in Las Vegas. Skip Super 8, but have a meal at Ellis Island.

The Time has a fantastic location, great bar (if very expensive) and the staff are very accommodating. The beds are also very comfy. However The Time doesn't merit a four star rating. I would put it between two and three stars. The rooms are shabby and could do with a good overhaul (the lights over the bed were actually held together with masking tape!); the wardrobe door was actually a curtain; the blinds were torn and the cleaners didn't really know the meaning of the word clean. The rooms are also incredibly small. If you complain they will upgrade you to a bigger room but although bigger it may be, better it ain't! About five years ago I reckon this hotel was really special but no investment has been made recently. We paid a lot of money for a substandard hotel so shop around

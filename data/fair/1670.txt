My granddaughter & I stayed here 5 nights in Dec. When I was checking out, I told my granddaughter the hotel is supposed to be 4 star but is more like a 2 star. Another guest behind me said, "you would give them that many stars?". No ice machines or ice buckets, they give you a trash bag & you go to the bar next door. Cockroaches climb out of the bathroom plumbing at night. Blankets were clean (I hope) but obvious old stains on one. Paper thin walls, I knocked 3x on one to quiet them down next door. They charge an extra 2% if you use a credit card, charge $2.00 per bag for storage & you MUST check out by 10 am or you are charged for another day. Good luck trying to check in before 2 or 3 pm. It is a block away from the Central train station, about a block away from the bus pickup, Paddy's Market & the mall are right behind it so it does have the location. Still, there must be better places for the same price. I will check elsewhere next time. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone I know.

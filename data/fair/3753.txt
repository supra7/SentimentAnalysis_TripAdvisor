This hotel is old and tired. The rooms are small like a New York hotel. The bathroom is extremely old. The shower water temp goes up and down and you can barely move in the bathroom. The furnishings are old and the bed wasnt very good. There was a small window with no view and there was no climate control in the room. You can hear every word clearly in the hallways which will wake you up in the middle of the night. There is no on site parking and you have to walk 2 blocks to park. Positives: It was only $40 on priceline. The staff was very nice. It is only about a 10 minute walk to the basketball arena and a 15 minute walk to the baseball park.

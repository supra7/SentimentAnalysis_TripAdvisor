We got this place at a good price for just a couple of days at the end of our trip. We knew the rooms would be small so were prepared for that - and they were, but it was bearable. What wasn't bearable, however, was the simply atrocious service from the front of house staff. The concierge was useless and we were routinely hung up on when we rang from our room with inquiries. One of us became quite ill and we called asking for a list of local doctors and she said the hotel had no medical staff and she couldn't help. It was ridiculous. Front of house staff equally useless and also hung up on us a couple of times. We weren't asking more much - just basic things like an extra blanket and some printing. It is a shame the service is so appalling because the location and the price is great. If you do stay there, you must visit the Shake Shack at madison square park. Oh, they have free internet too which is fabulous.

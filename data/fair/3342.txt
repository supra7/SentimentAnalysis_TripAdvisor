Soniat House does have an atmosphere of storied elegance. However, charging 11+ bucks for a couple of biscuits, juice, and coffee, is outrageous, and especially so considering the high room rates. There are plenty of other B&Bs that offer full gourmet breakfasts or vastly expanded continental included in their (much more reasonable) rates, and with similar attention to decor and elegance.

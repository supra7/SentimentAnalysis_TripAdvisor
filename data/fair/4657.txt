You can hope for the best but you will get what you pay for when staying at this hotel. The rooms are decent except for the shower leaking and the out of date decor and patio. Also, don't let the description of beach front property fool you. If you are staying in the main are of rooms expect a 5 to 10 minute walk to the run down beach across the street. The people were friendly enough except for a couple of exceptions but I guess that you can have that anywhere. If your goal is to not spend much time in the room and get out and see the island it is perfect. If you are looking for a real resort I would suggest moving down the island to Wailea.

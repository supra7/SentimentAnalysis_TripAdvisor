The rooms were clean and the breakfast was decent. The front desk was staffed by people who were rude and not very accomodating to the guests. The hotel is not in a very nice neighborhood however we were able to walk a few blocks to a place where there were lots of restaurants and shops. People were out strolling enjoying food and drinks at sidewalk cafe's at ten o'clock at night. Quite different from my home town. I would not stay at this hotel again and would certainly not recommend it to anyone. I found that most of the people we encountered were very rude and not at all friendly.

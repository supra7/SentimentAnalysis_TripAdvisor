This is a beautiful hotel located on the Gulf side of Key West and has some spacious rooms. Beware of additional fees, such as the "resort fee", which was $75 for the stay and or parking fees which were $25 per night. Even if you don't want/need to use the TV, internet, or parking they charged $25 per night. This is their way of hiding what was a $259 room which was really a $284 a night, making the Marriott cheaper.

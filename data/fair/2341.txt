To start with, there are good chances you could walk past the hotel without realizing the same! The hotel block is barely 4-5 meters wide and you can guess the room sizes. We had booked two rooms and were offered two 2m x 2m match boxes. Word of caution for ones with big or multiple suitcases, might have to step through them to reach your bed! Be prepared to have your bathrooms ankle length drenched while managing to bath. Well for transporting your luggage, you have an option of traveling single with a mid size suitcase or letting your bags travel while you run 3 to 4 floors up and collect them. Check-in was ok. The lone solace was our breakfast with views of the Marmara Sea. However, as realized later, the views are a common feature available in most of Sultanahmet hotels. There are plenty of better accommodation options within 2-5 mins walk; strongggggly suggest to seek elsewhere.

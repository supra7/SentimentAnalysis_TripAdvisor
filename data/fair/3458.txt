This hotel not only had horrible service, but the room was miniature with no view and cheap quality. We called the front desk asking for a bucket of ice and forks to eat our leftovers and 2 hours later, we received nothing. We called back, which resulted in someone bringing us a bucket of ice, but we were told we'd have to call the front desk to call the kitchen to get forks. So we called the front desk again, and guess what....nobody ever gave us forks! Thai food with our bare hands. The ONLY plus to this hotel is that it is prime location to see Broadway shows, but let's face it, Broadway is a subway ride from anywhere in NYC. I recommend somewhere that treats patrons better.

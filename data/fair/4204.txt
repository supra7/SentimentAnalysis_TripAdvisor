The minute you step into the lobby you know this is going to be a different experience. The Baroness lobby is as old fashioned as it gets with a large fireplace and nice woodwork. The elevator is an experience. The door opens like a regular swinging door, and then it groans and creeks all the way to your floor. There are honest to goodness real keys for the rooms, and the doors appear to be the original oak. The rooms are clean but small, the bed old, and the bathrooms serviceable but with the original fixtures. There is no air conditioning in the rooms, and the windows do not have screens, so it was a warm night for my wife and me. If you want nostalgia stay at the Baroness. If you want a nice night in a decent hotel, pick something else.

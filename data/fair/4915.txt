The location is good. The hotel can use some updating worn carpets, bathroom tiles, etc.. The staff is quite unfriendly and unaccomodating. You will get nickel and dimed in this place for every little thing. The hotel's motto is experience some "Swiss Hospitality" if that's the case I will never visit Switzerland.

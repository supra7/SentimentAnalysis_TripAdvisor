WE picked this hotel cause of the free parking.. our room was soo small. We had 2adults and 3 kids..stuff was not friendly. No microwave,no breakfast,pool was not clean. It was a green looking color. They were painting a few rooms down from us so all we smelled was paint. Just not worth it. Wont stay here again. and the layout is crazy!!

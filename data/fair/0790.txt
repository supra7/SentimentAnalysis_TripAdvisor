Too bad, the location could make this a great place. Stayed in a single room (#506) for one night...here's my take... Pros: outstanding location steps from Trevi Fountain, fairly quiet in room #506 (faced back of hotel), affordable, nice small balcony, bed reasonably comfortable, bathroom clean, easy to find & staff helpful when asked a specific question. Cons: my room floor was visibly dirty (not vaccumed), leak in shower hose had water everywhere & all over floor, tiny shower in single room, breakfast looked sketchy so I skipped it (may have been great, but...) and the bed sheets, while clean, had stains. Really wanted to love this place because of the location, but couldn't get past the cleanliness issue.

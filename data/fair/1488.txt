I had a coupon from a book, making the stay only $40. For the cheap price, the room was decent. They were out of non-smoking rooms, so we had a smoking room, that was pretty smelly, but tolerable. The paint on the walls was peeling off in some spots. The bathroom is super tiny. The floor was dirty, cleanliness was a bit of a concern. Don't they vaccum? There was also somebody's garbage under the dresser, it's still there. Ew.

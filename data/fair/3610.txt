My significant other booked a room as part of a package deal that this hotel had offered. As part of the "Feel the Wuv" package, you receive strawberries w/ chocolate. I could have picked better strawberries. I was really disappointed by this considering my high opinions of this hotel, especially it's sister the Westin.

Having stayed at other Westin locations, we figured this was a can't-miss for our honeymoon. As other reviewers have mentioned, they are doing renovations, starting with the Beach Tower, which happened to be where we would be staying. When we checked in, we told the front desk clerk it was our honeymoon and asked for a nice room w/view. We were assigned a room on the 4th floor...and wouldn't you know, renovations were being done on the 5th floor. So, needless to say our first night was spent in 1) an OLDER ROOM and 2) immediately below construction with noise stating at 8AM!!!!! We called the front desk who assured us the noise would stop (drilling started again at 8:30am). After getting absolutely no where with the front desk, we spoke with the Manager (a god-send) who was able to move us to the 10th floor. On the day of departure, our flight happened to be a red-eye so we inquired about a late checkout. We were told that this would cost us an additional $250.00 (for 4 measly hours). The front desk woman then had the gall to say, "Well, I'm sorry we wrecked your honeymoon..." after we questioned the charge. We reported her comments and behavior to the manager. Needless to say, the Westin Maui's front desk personnel left a very bitter taste. Had it not been for management, this review would have been much worse. For those staying in the Beach Tower, I would recommend that you request a room on the 8th floor or higher (ABOVE the construction).

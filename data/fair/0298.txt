This hotel has potential but is far from there. I would not go back until a major overahaul is done. I travel a lot on business so a clean hotel that is well maintained is a must. I do not need a four star hotel, just a reliable hotel. The bathroom shower had peeling paint. There were stains on the carpet and on a blanket.

The people are nice, but the hotel needs a major renovation. The carpet in my room had permanent stains, the elevator floor made weird sounds, the hallways look a bit tattered. There are lots of other boutique hotels in SF in better shape. Also - no fitness center and you need to pay $15 to go to one that is local but not very high-end.

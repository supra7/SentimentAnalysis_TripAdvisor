If you like old worn out things go to this hotel. The T.V. was so old it looked like the one I grew up with. The picture quality matched my families 1970's T.V. If you like broken down beds you will love this hotel. I went to get something in the store at 6pm on Thursday night and it was closed for an hour. I think the attendent was on dinner break and there was no reserve. In fact I saw three staff making time with the opposite sex and three working in the entire two days I was there. I did not rate it terrible because the air conditioning worked well.

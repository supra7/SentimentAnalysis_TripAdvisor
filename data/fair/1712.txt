I attended a party at Rider's Lodge recently and had a bad impression of this place. My friend organised a party for one of her girlfriend and from the start we felt that the service was not good. 1. When collecting the keys, the manager told us no eating or drinking in the room. By the way we booked the suite. 2. When asked for a wine opener, the manager at the desk told us we can't consume alcohol. It seemed funny cos the room had a bar with beer and soft drinks inside. The room also came with a microwave oven. It seem rather odd when we were told not to consume any food or drink. 3. Ok so we gave in and didn't have our wine in the room. So came down to the buffet area to have our drink. The placed with infested with honey bees flying all over the place. When asked the manager if the hotel will be liable for our medical bill if we got stung by the bees, he didn't have an answer. 4, Finally while we were relexing in the room, we had a peeping tom. We were not sure if it was a hotel staff or another guest, but it just shocked us. A while later we get a call from the reception tell us to bring down our noise level. I am shocked by the rules of the hotel and would not recommend anyone to stay there.

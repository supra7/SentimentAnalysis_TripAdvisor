We stayed at the Fairfield, Memphis I-240 for 2 nights during an extended cross country vacation. The location is good with very easy access from route 240 and an easy 15-20 minute drive to downtown. Compared to other Fairfields and other hotels in the same price category, we were disappointed. The hotel wasn't kept up very well. Nothing really dirty, just in need of a remodel. The shower didn't drain properly, the mattress was poor, and the entire hotel had a bit of a dingy feel. The TV's color was mis-adjusted and there was no way to fix it, even with a request to the front desk, and not all towels were replaced when the room was made up. There were some positives. The free breakfast was better than average, and the free wireless Internet service worked very well. Also, with the exception of one person who checked us in, the help was always friendly. The person who checked us in was terrible. As he was checking us in he was ranting about how much he hates Memphis and can't wait until he can leave. This is our first visit to Memphis, so his "welcome to Memphis" ws odd at best. Hopefully he'll get his wish, and find work in a non-service industry. (Note: This didn't effect my overall rating since it was one bad egg, who most likely won't be there long.) Overall, although we like Fairfield's in general, we wouldn't recommend this hotel. You can find other offerings for a better overall stay.

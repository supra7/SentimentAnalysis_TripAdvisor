The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, but the hotel itself is pretty dated. I've stayed at nicer rooms at the new Hampton Inn properties for much less money. The property is probably too large for them to offer great service. We started the honeymoon at a 5 star property in Kauai, which set the Wailea up as a disappointment. I would be surprised if this property remained a part of the Waldorf collection much longer.

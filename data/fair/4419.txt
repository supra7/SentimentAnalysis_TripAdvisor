I recently needed a reasonably priced hotel near the airport, so I chose what I thought would be a chain with a good name. Unfortunately, no matter how nice the people were, it is in desperate need of a makeover. The carpets and hallways were dirty, the elevators take forever to get up and down, the room not clean (paint, carpet, bathroom tiles), but certainly a layover place for travelers. That being said, it was reasonably priced and convenient to the airport with a free shuttle that left very early in the morning. So one or two nights maximum is my advice, and you should survive.

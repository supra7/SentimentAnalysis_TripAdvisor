The true test of a resort is how it manages a crisis. Rains caused power outages during this reviewed stay. Like a chorus, "I'm sorry" rang true from nearly all staff. Beyond power loss, no hot water, limited phone and internet service, and a restricted food menu antagonized guests. The emergency glow sticks placed resort wide to aid navigaing stairs made the stay rave reminicint. The absence of generators to power anything more than emergency lighting and credit card machines proved a fatal flaw in guest satisfaction. One test a critic (me) uses is as follows: I note an item needing attention. In this case, a glass with an inch of beverage left outside a room went unattended for three days. This was in clear view, and ignored while routine housekeeping duties were executed. This chain of resorts changed the Aveda personal care products to Nutragena, a step down to complain about. This is equivalant to renting a luxury car and getting a subcompact. The baseline of care has dropped, noting food quality, upkeep of the property and amenities, generally. While picturesque and beautiful, why go half way. Save your pennies and get a condo, or go full on and stay at the Four Seasons. A savvy visitor to Hawai'i must understand they are basically in another country with different ways. A resort must buffer some of the differences of expectations. Speedy service, low prices, and mainland expectations are thousands of miles away. "Island Time" is the excuse of laxidasical execution of duties, and must be tolerated. This resort is generally acceptable when the power is on, but even then, it is at best par with comperable resorts based on price.

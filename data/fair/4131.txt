I would not recommend this place. The breakfast and wine/cheese offerings were well done, but the rooms did not make me feel comfortable or safe. The first room they put me in had a heater that apparently never shuts off, and in May, although SF is not terribly hot then, it was extremely hot and stuffy; I got NO sleep the first night I was there. I had to ask about it 4 times, have a fan put in the room, and finally move to a different room. I also didn't feel very comfortable because the windows don't have screens on them, so to open the window (which I needed to do because it was so blasted hot!) would not have made me feel safe. Especially because there's a fire escape stairs route all across the back of the building. As a woman alone in the room, I felt very unsafe opening the windows. In short it was a lose-lose situation. The staff tried to be helpful, but unfortunately I think this was just an unfixable problem with the property that could only be helped with some major renovation.

My husband and I went on vacation to Secrets Maroma and were thrilled with resort. Our room was beautiful and clean. The staff are highly accomodating. The pool was gorgeous with plenty of chairs and towels. However, on our second night, we ate dinner at El Patio and shortly after became quite sick. The illness lasted for 30 hours, and we couldn't leave our room since we needed to be so close to a bathroom. We could not eat or drink for the rest of our 5 day stay. I could not shake the disappointment in having our trip ruined and emailed the resort the day after we returned home. And never heard back from them.

This hotel is situated within a 2-minute walk from the train station. This is both a plus and a minus. What we did not like about the location was that it felt on the "wrong side of the tracks" at night and we felt a bit unsafe. The front of the hotel was lit up some nights and not lit up on other nights. So this added to the lack of safety. On the plus side, it was located at a 15-30 minute walk to all the tourist locations in Rome. I payed close to $275/night and got a Journey's End-level hotel room. There were 3 of us in the room, with my daughter sleeping on the pull out couch. When this couch was open, one could barely walk about the room. The lobby and entrance of the building was consistent with a 2 star hotel. Breakfast was typical hotel fare one finds in Italy, average at best. The scrambled eggs were horrible, but the cold cuts, canned fruit and toast were fine. I really appreciated one waitress who made me two cappucinos every morning. Thanks again! What disappointed me the most was the poor service at this hotel. When I spend $275/night, I expect good service. On the first day, I went to speak to the hotel clerk, he continued reading his paper for 45 seconds before raising his eyes and giving me a look to say that I was bothering him. On a second occasion, I asked for a second card key for the room. The clerk sighed and complained that everybody was asking for a second key today. If I returned to Rome, I would try to stay away from the train station and closer to the Piazza Navone or near the Borghese park.

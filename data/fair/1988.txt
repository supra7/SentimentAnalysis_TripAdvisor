The hotel was too far out to be able to enjoy the evening atmosphere of barcelona. We did walk it a couple of times-but its not easy. The whole hotel stank of stale cigarette smoke, including our room, sheets and pillows! The wallpaper was peeling off the walls and the carpets were filthy. The shower did not work properly. The staff were sullen and did not speak. There was nothing hot left for breakfast when we went down. The tablecloths were dirty. The waiter actually closed the restaurant and left while we were still in there! It really spoiled the trip for us

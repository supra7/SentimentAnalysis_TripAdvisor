Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. The resort may look like a postcard, but our experience this past New Years was more of a disastor movie. Hotel looks four to five star, but service rates a two. I usually ignore bad reviews, everyone has an opinion, but this time the reviews were correct. When I asked for bottled water in the lobby, I was told to treck across the resort to my room and order from room service. When I didn't like the drink prepared for me and put it aside, the waiter got mad at us. When I ordered food from the Pizza Fire Grill, and was told 15 minutes , when I returned to get it I waited a further 25 minutes, asking the waitress if it had even been made, which I kept being told yes., After a total of 45 minutes, they finally made my order, but had made at least 15 others which were placed as I stood there, while I was waiting, which was fifteen minutes after my order was placed. AND it gets better. New Year Eve dinner, reservation was for 9, seated at 9:10, drink order taken but nothing brought for twenty minutes, until I complained that another table that had sat down ten moments earlier had their drinks and orders taken. Ultimately we didn't even get our main course served until 10:50. Half the time when we got service anywhere in the hotel, they usually didnt remeber to bring us our drinks, this is not an exaggeration. Did I also mention more than half the time the staff didn't understand English and this was probably one of their biggest flaws, communication. The only bright spot was our room was cleaned well daily. Their is more to say but I think I have gotten my point across. This is my first negative review. I hope it's the only one I ever feel the need to write.

This hotel sorely needs a renovation. French baroque looks neat, but 50 year old surfaces are just decrepit. Could be charming, but really disappointed. Two distinct bed bug bites didn't help. Staff was very friendly. One of two elevators were broken for 2 days, other elevator was very slow and tiny. Room was crampily small. Really don't see the point when better hotels are available.

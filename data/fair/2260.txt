We checked in for two nights in a suite at this Doubletree hotel. When we went up to the room, there were drink spills on counters, general grime on many things that had not been cleaned in a long time, and the room just was not clean. We returned to the counter and were shown another room. As soon as the bellboy and I entered, we saw a washcloth lying on the floor near the door. I went over to the sink and saw that the remains of food that had been poured into the sink. It went downhill from there. By the time we finished, the night manager was checking rooms with me and we went to six rooms. It turned out that the first room we were assigned was the cleanest of the six. He agreed that none of the rooms were suitable and said that if we kept the original room, he would send a cleaning crew up immediately and we could tell them what we wanted cleaned. We waited for an hour and a half and no cleaning crew arrived. I went back to the counter and he was surprised because he said he sent them right away. No cleaning crew ever arrived and we ended up cleaning the room ourselves enough to sleep in it. The night manager was very apologetic and said that he would satisfy us by making a significant adjustment on our bill. Our bill for two nights came to over $600 - he took off $20 for one night's parking! The restaurant was nice and the hotel has the potential to be nice, but the rooms badly need refurbishing and CLEANING! He said that some of the rooms had been refurbished and showed me one, but the only thing they really did was replace a few items and the walls were still dirty. The air conditioning was also bad in the rooms we saw. It doesn't keep things cool and is noisy.

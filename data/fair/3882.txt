We stayed at the Surfer in July 2006 - Great location right on Pacific Beach - in the middle of the all the college party action. It WAS HOT - keep in mind there is NO AIRCONDITIONING! Also, rooms are tiny compared to pics you see online unless you book the suite? Not sure... but for $400 we thought the room should be bigger. The pool was crowed with kids and surrounded by a gate. If you are on the first floor you cannot see the beach b/c of wall around pool. We had requested a beachview and received a room with a view of the back of the restaurant. Also, security was strict, you cannot have visitors at any time. Remember when packing - no soaps in bathroom and no hairdryer. Plus we were warned that you cannot plug more than one item at a time in outlets. We had a great time in San Diego but this hotel was nothing special.

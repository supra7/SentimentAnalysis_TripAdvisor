Booked on a bidding site for a reasonable rate - 107/night plus tax, called in advance to request a King or Queen bed and was told that they could not guarantee it, but when we arrived (6:30 PM on a Friday) we were told the only room available was a double. Called reception (after trying to get through for 20 minutes they finally answered) and was told this was the only option. To be fair we stayed for 3 nights and they did leave a message on the 3rd morning that seemed to imply they would be able to offer another room but at that stage we didn't bother. The room was tiny, could barely squeeze by the bottom of the bed which was jammed up against the TV cabinet. I can't recall many hotels where 1 double bed is on offer - usually 2 single or 1 Queen/King. Room had not been re-done, and was 90's hotel style, dark greens and maroons and old wallpaper, though I see in other pictures there seem to be some rooms that have been done up. Bathroom adequate. Lobby large but crowded. Waiters friendly but drinks wildly overpriced. Seems as though the hotel is two hotels, perhaps a section of nicer rooms for those who are paying full price and a second section of rooms for cut prices. This creates a bit of an odd mix with the crowd as well. Location convenient, a bit of a business area but easy walk to Michigan Ave and other sights.

I just joined Trip Advisor and felt strongly enough to go back to last fall to comment on a disappointing experience at this hotel. As a Platinum awards member, I used points to get a free night and then paid out of pocket for second night to make an inexpensive get away weekend to Boston. In our rush to check out Sunday, we left four nice articles of clothing in the closet, including a leather jacket and a $250 pair of women's slacks purchased the day before on Newbury Street. The tags were still on. (You know where this story is going...) Anyway, we were literally on the Mass Pike westbound not even at I-84 when we called the front desk. We were immediately transferred to Housekeeping and begged the supervisor to go to the room herself and grab the items. She called us right back to say that the room had already been serviced and that no items were reported in the room and there was nothing in lost and found. We were so mad we almost drove the car into a ditch, and if we didn't have a time commitment we would have turned around and created a scene in the lobby to be remembered for the ages. So we went through the machinations of dealing with hotel security, filing reports, etc. etc. all for naught. They dealt with us politely but corporately like they were reading responses to our pleas off of well worn index cards. For them you know this sort of thing happens everyday, but for us we just felt burned so badly. Oh - so you want to know about the hotel? Yes, great location, easy access, tired rooms and amenities, forgettable decor, robotic staff. But congratulations to the Hyatt employee who is walking around with a great pair of designer slacks and my leather jacket!

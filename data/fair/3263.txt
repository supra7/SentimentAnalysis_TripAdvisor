Quite a disappointing stay, the place was understaffed (bar, restaurant,...) and room was worn out (I had a room with balcony), had a connecting room with as a result much noise from my neighour, the breakfast was very poor, the lunch buffet was not even as good as an airline economy class meal, ... I've stayed in other Intercontinental hotels which are much better. I wouldn't stay here again.

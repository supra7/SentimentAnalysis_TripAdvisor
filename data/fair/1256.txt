This hotel is going through a face lift which is giving it a slick modern feel that brings it up to date. The BIG down side of this hotel is the service, breakfast is a nightmare, no evidence that cooked breakfast is available, lucky if asked, tables not set. All cereal, toaster, coffee etc is on one little table meaning times it was impossible to get to for people waiting for toast etc. Evening meals, are poor quality and appeared microwaved and service was poor. On checkout I was asked to pay for my evening meal,this was included in my company allowance, staff need to take care to read information (same happened in Corby Best Western)

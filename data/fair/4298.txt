I got this hotel from Priceline, so I didn't choose it. The website made it look great. When I checked in, I was put in a room, that to get to it, I had to go back outside, down the street a ways, to a separate entrance, where only 2 rooms were located down a hallway. The view (from a hotel called "Towers") was a brick wall on 2 sides. The room was spacious, though needed to be upgraded. The furniture was very old. The mattress, when I sat on it, came up on both ends (I am not a large person). The maid service left a lot to be desired, there was hair (not mine) in the corners of the floor in the bathroom, and on the bedsheets. There were missing tiles on the floor and mildew on the tiles in the shower. The service, including the bellmen and the people taking my reservation, tried to be very helpful. I couldn't help but think being placed in the tower may have been better, but there were no rooms available there. I will not return to this hotel.

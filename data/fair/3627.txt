In an earlier life the current W New York was a 2 or 2.5 Star hotel, but W spiffed up the lobby, turned down the lights in the hallways upstairs so that you need a seeing eye dog to negotiate the place, attracted a crowd of trendy young "club" types to the bar (as well as a few hookers), and all of a sudden somebody gives it four stars? I guess I'm showing my age. We have stayed at other Ws, both in NYC and elsewhere, and generally I like them, but this one is the weak link in the W chain.

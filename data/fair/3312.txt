The good news. It's in a great location to the best restaurants, bourbon st., and Cafe du Monde. It's right on Jackson Square. It has a lovely courtyard and the rooms have some charm to them with the exposed brick. The staff was nice and the price seemed reasonable. The bad news.....it is in some major need of an upgrade. The bedding is old, the tv's aren't great, the decor is about 15-20 years old, rugs need to be replaced. We had 2 rooms since we had teens with us. We had 3 teens (2 were 19yrs and 1 was 13 yrs). Since 3 were in a room, they charged us an extra $20 per day for the extra person . (The room had 2 queen beds so I assumed that it was for accomadating up to 4 people. I was wrong.) The parking was $25 per night....though that didn''t surprise me. We skipped the free breakfast since is was just crossiants and sweet rolls with some fruit. I didn't care too much for the haunted tour they recommended. But what really bothered me was the really bad smell in my room. A very musty smell. It may have been from the exposed wall, but they should really try to figure out something about that. The beds were not so great and the bathrooms were just worn out and old. This hotel has so many possibilities and could be great with a little more work. I just don't get why there isn't an extra effort. That said, unless it is renovated, I probably won't be back. But I did love New Orleans. I will definitely be back to that city. If you are looking for a terrific tour, try The Original Cocktail Tour by Grayline. We did it on our 1st day and learned where the best places to eat and where the fun and historical bars are. We also had some great tours of Private rooms not open to the public. Lots of fun!!! It made my trip.

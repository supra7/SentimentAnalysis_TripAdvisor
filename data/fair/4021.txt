Not worth the $$$ This was my first trip to San Francisco. Needless to say I haven't stayed in any of the other hotels in this area of town, so I don't know how the Clift compares. No trouble locating the hotel, though I was a little more vigilant after reading about others' troubles finding it. Checking in was a breeze. the front desk was not busy at the time and the staff were courteous and helpful. The room was fairly small and had been redecorated, but the furnishings looked rather cheap. The bathroom is ultra-small, it looks like the vanity, mirror, tile, and possibly the shower/tub are new. The toilet looks like something out of a public restroom. The bed was one of the more comfortable ones that I've slept in. The gym was surprisingly adequate, consisting of 4 treadmills, 2 stationary bikes, 2 steppers, a full set of dumbbells (5-110 lbs), flat bench, incline bench, and a cybex multi-station. Overall, I wasn't super-disappointed, but I felt that for the money that I was paying the quality of the room should've been much better. On my next visit, I'm going to explore other options.

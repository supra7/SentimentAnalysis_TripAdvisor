This hotel seemed like a good deal, and it's location is great for sure. The room was nice enough... However, the problems began as we checked in for our one night stay. Rude staff were the norm. For instance, we had a couple of little questions and needed directions, pretty standard stuff, but the staff ignored us and when we did get their attention, seemed very put-out. And we're Hilton Honors members! There were also lots of little inconveniences: - very little sound proofing, so we heard EVERYTHING that took place in the hallway all night long. - no WiFi, just plugged-in internet (so you have to keep your laptop on the desk in the corner when in the room) - the printing services that were advertised did not work (and again, no one was available to help us use them) - we ran out of toothpaste, and found there were no complimentary toiletries if you forgot something, purchase for $5 plus only. And, at the attached restaurant, absolutely the WORST breakfast buffet I have ever had in a hotel. We had to leave early, so it was one of the only places open at that hour. Big mistake. Even at 6:30am, the food was cold, stale and generally bad. The omelettes, made to order, were the only good option available. And this for something like $15. I'm sure it's good for other meals, but avoid the breakfast! I'm confident you can find something better in Chicago for this price.

I'm not a picky person, but considering that you only get one honeymoon, I would have appreciated a little more fanfare from the staff. Nobody seemed to care all that much that we were just married. We even had a beef with one of the pool waitresses, who created a terribly awkward cabana situation with us and another family. We spoke with a manager and all he gave us was a scripted apology. Service gets a big fat zero. We were hoping for a more adult atmosphere as well. To our surprise, there were definitely more families than couples staying at the resort, which was a disappointment. On a positive note, the food was excellent. I highly recommend the Saturday night Japanese buffet and the fish tacos at the pool. Enough has been said regarding the rooms and the pool, and I couldn't agree more. I would not consider this to be a 4-star property by any stretch of the imagination, and I definitely would not recommend it if you're planning a honeymoon.

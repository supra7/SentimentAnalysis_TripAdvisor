Beautiful location but hotel had only just reopened (prematurely), staffing was ramping up and construction/landscaping (read noise inside and out) was ongoing. Pool area not fully open (only one pool at the time we were there and too noisy from ongoing landscaping), and main restaurant not yet open - neither was spa (due to open in May). Completed rooms were pleasant, as were the staff. I would suggest waiting a few months before staying here, otherwise you won't see this hotel at its undoubtedly best. Fly in to West Maui airport - it's only 5 minutes away via hotel shuttle.

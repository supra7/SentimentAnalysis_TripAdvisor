Wanted to introduce some New Orleans charm and culture to my children 10 and 13, so I booked this hotel based on the reviews on TA. I think we got the "party room", the place looked very tired and well used! Wallpaper peeling off wall, lamps that were old and rusted, holes in the wall that the cable TV cord came out of and TV only got fuzzy pictures. Our bellman Nate was very friendly and helpful and the lady at the front desk was cool as best. The room was in the father building from the front of the hotel on the second floor and had a balcony. My biggest problem was that the only lock on the door was the one on the knob. No deadbolt or chain lock. It may have been secured, but I did not feel safe! Needless to say we did not stay and left to find another hotel. On the positive they did refund my deposit on the room.

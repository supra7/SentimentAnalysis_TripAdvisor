This hotel was billed as the hidden gem of the West Village on several websites and travel guides. I booked four nights in the winter and got one night free. The hotel--calling it such is a stretch-- is a tiny building among residential apartments on 11th Street. There is a small lobby, and not much else by way of amenities. I stayed in a closet of a room overlooking 11th Strret, for 3 nights, then was moved to a larger room that had no view whatsoever. The small room had a bed, a desk, and a closet. There is hardly room to walk. A sink is in the corner of the room. The cot is fairly uncomfortable, and the shared bathroom and shower are very small. Down the hall are full-time residents who sit with the door opened. One saw me and followed me down the hallway. It was odd. The larger room was similar in furniture, but the heat was unbearably warm, and the cot very uncomfortable and loud when you move. The doors are adjar so light seeps in from the brightly lit hallways. If you want to stay in the Village, and are on a tight budget, try the hotel Jane, further West, near the High Line. The Larchmont is nothing more than a run down building in a great tree-lined neighborhood.

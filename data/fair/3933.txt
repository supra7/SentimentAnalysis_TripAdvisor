A realistic review by a business traveler. I am in the entertainment industry, and haunt hotels at least 4-5 days per week. When I visit accounts in the SF area, I generally will stay inside the city and cab it so I do not have to be stressed with traffic. A friend suggested the Milano, and for the most part, it is okay. The room and decor is pretty modern. The beds and linens are not that great, and you only have a refrigerator and a small cheap-o TV. Honestly, the bathroom is the coolest part of the room - being mostly large and fancy. Out of the four times I have stayed here, the carpets and walls are a bit dealt with, but, by in large, clean. Tonight, this room is very clean and the best I have had here, except for facing the street w/ construction. There has been ongoing construction work (which they do not tell you about during reservation) and today has been loud. Wireless Internet works pretty quick, most of the time. The gym is a joke with outdated gear, but ?it a heart rate raiser and that all that matters. Overall, it an okay place to hang. The hotel boasts a cool bar in the lobby ?a very nice, but sometimes clueless reception staff, and it a short walking distance to all of the cool shops and sites. Valet parking = return of your car could take up to 40 minutes!! Convenience and acceptable cleanliness is the only reason I stay here, however, always on the lookout for another hotel as this place has not sold me as a long-term customer.

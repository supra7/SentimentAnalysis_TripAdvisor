We tried to check in a 3pm and was told our rooms were not ready. We returned at 7pm and one room was still not ready. We asked for rooms on the same floor (5 people in 2 rooms) and we were given the 12th floor and the 18th floor. We were told because of the inconvenience we would have a sea view - both rooms looked over the City. We were booked for 3 nights, but after the first night, at 9.15am we had a phone call to say "when were we checking out" They had made a mistake with our booking. The corridors and general areas need modernising. The pool area consists of 5 sun lounges. For a hotel this size it is a disgrace. On the two occasions we went, people simply grab the 5 seats available and "hang on to them" One positive note. The Consierge is excellent. Good advice on where to eat, excellent recommendations on places to visit. I give them 10/10.

gross. i hate ocean city, but seeing the castle-like dunes manor hotel made a weekend trip there feel bearable. i was looking forward to some high class service and some luxurious rooming quarters because the outside of the place looks gorgeous! it stank, and when we checked in, the attendant at the front desk told us that he thought we might be set up at the dunes manor MOTEL next door. thank god we werent. we had the very top floor, which, in most hotels, is the very best. the balcony overlooked the ocean, which was nice, but it had no overhead, so when it rained, we stood outside there and got wet. the comforters and sheets were gross. the bathtub was yellowed with age (or from not being clean), and the sink was all stopped up. water pressure sucked. they had a microwave, fridge, and coffee maker, all from 1951. the "palacial" look was deceiving. in spring 2006, a hilton suites will be up running there. thank god. ocean city needs some serious revamping, and they need to add some high-end hotels to that area. its about time that people had other choices than rat-infested condos and nasty rooms.

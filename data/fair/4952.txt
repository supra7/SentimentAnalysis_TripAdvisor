Let me preface this by saying that I have stayed at other Affinia properties and always had a pleasant experience. When I saw that the Fitzpatrick was being converted to an Affinia I was excited, as we often travel to Chicago, our former home. While I don't remember the specific dates I do know that it was sometime in January. We were in town for the weekend and thought we would give the Affinia a try. Great location! After checking into our suite we noticed that the heat wasn't working. In fact, cold air was being blown out. When we left to go shopping I notified the front desk of the problem. They said that it would be fixed right away. Fast forward 2.5 hours. I came back from shopping and went up to my room, only to find that the "heater" was still blowing cold air. I went down to the front desk and was told that it would be fixed right away. The front desk appeared put out by my request. I killed some time in the Irish bar in the basement (which is great) and went up to the room an hour later. The heat was finally fixed. The next morning I was awaken by the sound of dripping in the bathroom. I went to check and noticed that the ceiling was leaking. Our entire counter was soaked, along with all of our towels and toiletries. I called down and they had someone come up to fix the problem. At the time of checkout there were no apologies for the inconveniences that we had to deal with. If I weren't a laid back person I probably would have been pretty upset. Later I sent an email to the management just to let them know of our dissatisfaction. I received a response several days later saying, essentially, sorry. I am not sure what I expected, but I guess I was hoping for more. I have no intention of returning to the Affinia, which is a shame because I had good experiences with the chain previously.

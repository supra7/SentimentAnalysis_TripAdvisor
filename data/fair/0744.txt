I booked this hotel due to the reviews where the majority are good but wshed i had not. I stayed here for 2 weeks and can tell you that this one hotel alone spoiled my otherwise great holiday. This hotel has the nerve to charge a daily resort fee but comes no wher near to being a resort. It is seriousley lacking in facilities. There are no room safes and even no front desk safe for storing valuables. This was even thou it stated there was when booking via Tripadvisor. There are no courtesy buses to any attractions and the pool is rather on the small side in the carpark. The breakfast although complimentry was below average. The rooms here are dirty, dusty and very small. There is nothing you can do about the size but there is something you can do about the dirt. My room on the 3rd floor had not been properly cleaned from the previous guest. The apparently fresh bed sheets had body hair and the toilet rim was soiled.The floor had also not been hoovered. I had to leave a note for the room maid as they had still not cleaned the toilet by the 3rd day. All the worktops / sink and desks were extremely dusty / dirty and these just did not get wiped. The iron board could not be used as it had been stained by either blood or a reddish food substunce. The shower had a nasty build up of dirt and grime on the shower heads/handles and door frames. In 2 weeks the room maid only hoovered once and appeared to just tidy my bed and refold the towels everyday. I got so fed up with having to leave a tip for this poor service that i ended up cleaning my own room every morning. The only positives are that the staff are pleasant, the wifi is excellent and there are no mouldy or other unpleaant smells. This hotel is clearly not designed for anyone on an extended stay.

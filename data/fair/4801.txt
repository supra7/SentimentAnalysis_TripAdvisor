While the hotel was beautiful and in a great location, there were too many quirks and poor customer service that made it an overall nuisance to haved stayed here! I stayed here with my two small children and would not reccomend it for families! First of all there was a "prank" fire alarm that woke us up at around midnight and scared my two children. In the morning no apologies from the staff and I would have thought a "sorry letter" to appear under our door would have been a classy touch to a "4 star" hotel, but no just our overpriced bill! Again no aplogies even when we checked out the next day. Also the street is rather noisy so once we woke up it was hard to get everyone back to sleep. Even still we awoke at 9 am to hear a "squeaky bed" going at it in the room above! Again not really classy especially for children! Another thing I noticed was when our room was being cleaned the service lady washed our used glasses in the sink and once she left you could see our lipmarks still! Gross! Again not very 4 star! Okay so now we are checked out and waiting for our car which we valeted. Not a wise decision perhaps! It took over an hour when the ticket says about 20-30 minutes! Even at the 30 min mark we were brushed off and so finally at the hour it took 3 hotel staff to figure what went wrong even though we were waiting right in front of the front desk the whole time! You would have thought they would have noticed something wrong, but no again, the hotel fails at customer service. They were nice but not too good at their jobs something you would expect for the 4 star rating. So here we are at home and noticed we were charged twice! I called but got a machine. Again not very professional in my opinion they should straighten out mistakes like this right away and so we will see if it will be anything like our car! I already expect the worst at this point! SO PLEASE DON"T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE! I think next time I will stay at the Marriot Long Wharf!

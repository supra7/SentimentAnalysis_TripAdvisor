Umm... No where near as good as it used to be Ohh dear..... I stayed in the Omni Berkshire a couple of years ago and it was truly fantastic. Time has not been good on the omni. The rooms are now looking tired, the restaurant and bar were both closed for refurbishment (we were only warned about the restaurant on booking), the reception staff were down and out right rude, the only staff member I would praise was the Concierge, she was great!! Got woken up at 8.30 by a hotel engineer who just let himself in to my room despite the Do not Disturb sign, and he then did it again when I was packing at 4.30pm!!! This is not a cheep hotel, and has a long way to go if it ever wants to be as good as it used to be. Shame, as I had recommended it to my colleague, and we were both extremely disappointed. Won't go back again in a rush.

My family and I were staying here because my 2 yr old son had a procedure at Children's Hospital the next morining. We get to our room I pull out the sofa bed and find the sheets all mangled and hair and dirt on the sheets. I call to go ask how a the bed is put together are the sheets just thrown in, she said yes so it will fold back up...I told her the bed looked used she said that someone goes in behind the maid to check the rooms and assures me it is fine. I call back and say I want new sheets, it takes 30 min and still no sheets.So i fold the bed up half way and while my kids are playing they find used sex toys....Well long story short we moved rooms only saw the manager once did not get any compensation for all the incovenients. Very poor service I should not have had to communicate between the front desk the manager should have stepped up. Now I have put a complain in to corporate so maybe they will do somenthing now...The room was nasty and service sucked!!

Stayed at Duphine during Mardi Gras 2007, booked through Orbitz. I've stayed in many hotels in Nawlins & this has been the worst. Elevator would get stuck, it was a roll of the dice if you had hot water in the shower and even then the water pressure was very low, we were on our own getting a cab, took forever to check our luggage & then when we came back to get our luggage they just sent us to a closet to retrieve our own! Room was small and the bathroom too. I've stayed in nicer motel 6's. There are many better places to stay.

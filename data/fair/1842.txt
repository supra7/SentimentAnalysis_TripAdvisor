We stayed at the Intercontinental Dallas for 4 days inJune 2006, and there were numerous problems from start to finish. The staff seemed mostly foriegn (which is fine), but their grasp of English was so poor that they could not understand or correctly answer simple questions (like, "Where is the business center?" and one referred to my female friend as "Sir,' and she is quite clearly a woman). The hotel room had a problem with the bath, and they were not quick to fix it. There were other issues I cannot recall now, but the overall feeling was that something amiss happened every day of our stay there.

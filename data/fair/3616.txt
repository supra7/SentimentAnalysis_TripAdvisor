Stayed at the W the first weekend of February. The staff were very nice and helpful upon check in which was the extent of my interaction with the staff other than the occasional hello as I walked in. I had a queen size room on the 8th floor with a view of a parking lot. Given the amount of space we are working with here, I would have to say they did a good job decorating to try and make the room seem bigger. Overall, no complaints about the appearance/cleanliness of the room except that it is a bit smallish. Very little space for luggage and packages. Also, the walls ARE a bit thin. My neighbors were having sex next door and I could hear them quite clearly at 3:30, 4:30, and 8:30 a.m. The bathroom is typically small with some water temperature issues. The hot water came out of the sink VERY hot immediately, while it took me a while to figure out the shower. I couldn't get the water hot enough. I finally realized that if I pointed the knob towards COLD, I could actually get hot water. Best thing about the bathroom is probably the Bliss products.

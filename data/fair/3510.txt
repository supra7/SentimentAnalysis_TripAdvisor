We were first timers to NYC so I'm not sure what is the norm for room size but in saying that although the rooms were quite stylish I did find them rather on the smallish size. The elevators are definitely quite small but this did not cause us any issues. When we checked in at 10pm it was nearly impossible to even hear what the receptionist was saying as the booming music from the bar area was so loud. I imagine those staying on the lower floors would struggle getting to sleep with the noise. The carpet in the bar was heavily stained and looked filthy. We requested a non-smoking room but our room absolutely stank of smoke. A great location and pricing is ok but a bit disappointed overall.

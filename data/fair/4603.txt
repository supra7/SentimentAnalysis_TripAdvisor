Okay, but much better available elsewhere!!!!!! I stayed at the Waikiki Parc hotel for 5 nights. I chose this hotel based on the price and comments that seemed consistently positive. I thought the hotel was not worth the money. When we booked we were supposed to get breakfast with our room, but when we got there they said we didn't qualify. Parking wasn't a nominal fee like stated on their website. The service was fine, they were helpful when we booked extra services or had questions. Our room was very tiny, the pool was disappointingly small and not even fully opened most of the time we were there. The elevator was a pain to use, it didn't always go where we wanted to go, even when the appropriate button was pushed and our cards didn't always work in it.Overall, okay hotel. A little overpriced, but still more affordable than beachfront hotels. Nice location, but next time I'll spring for a better quality hotel.

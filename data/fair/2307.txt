I found this hotel to be below average for the price range. One particularly annoying part is they have no safes in the rooms, yet their front desk safes seem to be designed for jewelery or something and cannot even fit a laptop or iPad. So if you have valuables, you have no option except to carry them with you or leave them with the Concierge (including typical wait to drop and to pick up). You need to take an elevator to get to the lobby off the street, and there are steps in between the city and this lift but not always a bellman. So the hotel is nothing terrible but I definitely cannot recommend it.

I went through Priceline, name your own price. It selected this hotel. The price was fair at best. The hotel charges $30.00 per night for self parking, $13. Per day for internet per computer. I did opt for a $20.00 per night upgrade once I checked in "for a better room/view". The view was OK, nothing great. After all the fee's, parking, etc. I could have stayed at a nicer hotel that was closer to the attractions I wanted to see. The staff, not including the front desk was very nice and accommodating. The front desk staff was just doing their job, no emotions and did not really did not care if I was satisfied or not. To sum this up, be careful on Priceline and the downtown area. Priceline rated this hotel as 4 stars, it is not 4 stars maybe 2.5 at best. Its old and needs to be updated. Prior to arriving in Seattle we were in Vancouver BC and stay at a Coast Hotel property (Coal Coast Harbor" and it was an excellent hotel and excellent staff. Seattle does have a Coast Hotel, However, I had not stayed at a Coast Hotel prior to Vancouver. I will stay at their Hotels in the future.

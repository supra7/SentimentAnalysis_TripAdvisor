Writing this at around midnight, as I thought I might make use of my time seeing as I can't sleep. I can sleep through a lot of things - but as I type the floor of our room on the 8th floor is shaking with the bass from the nightclub directly below us. There is no indication that there is a nightclub in this hotel, and the front desk staff were pointing out that it's a bar. In my understanding a place that plays loud disco music untile 230AM qualifies as a nightclub. I am an unfussy traveller; but I think it's pretty basic for a hotel, especially one that charges $350 for a night's stay, to provide its customers a night's rest (not just coochy lighting and velvet ropes for the nightclub's patrons). Another interesting point is that I'm typing this using a $10 a day wi fi service (compared to complimentary wi fi at most hotel chains including budget ones like Holiday Inn). If you like Eurythmics at ear splitting volume past midnight this is the place for you.

The location is perfectly fine. Having the beach across the street was very nice, although its not a great place to swim. The large grounds help for a quiet sleep. Its just a little to far from town to walk. The pool was so terribley cold and there is no gift shop or coffee shop in the vacinity, that made my stay, a big disapointment. I couldn't even get a coffee after 8:30 from the lobby (where they advertise coffee). So if you like coffee in the morning and your spouse sleeps in later than you, make sure you have the car keys, because there is nothing to eat, drink, buy or do there. Its too bad because this place could be beautiful.

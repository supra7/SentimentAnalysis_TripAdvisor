We booked this Hotel via the Web in reply to an invitation sent by the Kimpton Group to In Touch subscribers, part of their Suite Sale that included a $25.00 daily dining credit,. We asked for an early check in and sofa sleeper to accommodate our 2 children. We arrived @ about 2:15. We were told right away that our room was not ready and wouldnt be until about 4PM. Yes, they knew we asked for an early arrival but Everyone checked out really late today. We were ok with that, what can you do?. The shocker came after the initial check in when the lady that sort of check us in basically said come back at 4.That was about it, she was done. No mention of the dining credit, we assumed instructions woud be included with our room key later. We are in the reception area, 4 bags, not clear where we even are, its pouring rain and no where to go. Not an offer of a coffee, directions or umbrella. I went to the doorman asked for the concierge, there wasn't one on right now he explained but they could give us a map and directions if we needed. He took us back to the SAME WOMAN that sort of checked us in. She now gave us a quick run down on where the Market and shopping were. They would now keep our bags and send to our suite. I could not understand why she wouldnt help us in the first place. Out into the rain we went. We arrived back around 4:45. The first lady was gone. We got our room key and headed upstairs. No luggage. We went back down stairs to find it. Front desk will now send up. We never did get the dining credit or instructions, and when we inquired about it we were told the restaurant was closed. We spent our money elsewhere. The room was lovely. The doormen and desk staff other than the original lady were exceptional. Its really too bad that one person can spoil an entire visit. Not the Kimpton experience we know and had expected.

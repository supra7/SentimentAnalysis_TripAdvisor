Never Again If you are into dark and trendy then this is the spot for you. Blaring techno music from the bar floods the foyer when you walk in. The front desk people have no more personality than Ken and Barbie (which they strongly resemble). The bathrooms are small and the shower curtain cheap (it will keep attacking you and not stay in place when you shower) for 300-400 a night you would think they could get better. The worst part was the valet parking where they fail to tell you it costs $40 a night to park in the garage, I could have gone around the corner for $10. Make sure you check the price list BEFORE you even think of eating anything in the room a box of animal crackers 3.75, give me a break!!! Next time Im in San Francisco I will be staying somewhere else.

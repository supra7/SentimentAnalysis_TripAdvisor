This hotel was one nightmare after another. Let me explain. After a nice day at Epcot, my husband and I checked into the Peabody around 8PM. Pulling up to the hotel, I felt like I was at a busy airport, dropping someone off. It was loud and noisy and chaotic. A man approached our car and told us to give him the key...that it was mandatory valet. Great, I always valet anyways, so we handed the key and waited for him to give us our valet ticket. He didn't. Instead, he ran off with our key and yelled to us about finding him after we check in. Very strange and unprofessional. My husband and I were worried someone would steal the car, so he stayed by it until I checked us in. When we went up to the valet stand, they told us they didnt have our key and blew us off. It was awful. I was in tears over the messy situation. About an hour later, someone finally was able to locate our key and parked our car...for $18 dollars. That really should have been waived for our ordeal. We went inside, un-packed and changed clothes to go out to a nice dinner. We had reservations at Vitos, my husbands favorite. We asked the concierge to call us a cab, he was very rude and told us that there were too many cars out front (it was a valet disaster) and we could either walk to dinner or walk down the street to hail a cab ourselves. He also said that it was getting late and the only place probably open was Dennys or Fridays. Uh, its like 10:00 on a Saturday night in Orlando.everything is open. A 4 star hotel concierge should know better. Needlessto say, we missed our dinner reservation because of the transportation nightmare. In the morning, it took almost 2  hours to get our car out of the valet. Unorganized and unprofessional. Checking out, they charged us another $17.98 for some movie we didn't watch. I think we turned the weather channel on and that was it. The hotel is very pretty and clean but not worth the bad service.

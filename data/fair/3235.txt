Room wasn't ready when we checked in middle of the afternoon. They said they would call my cell phone when it was, They never did. After checking with them several times, they finally had the room ready almost an hour after we checked in. Then it took them almost four hours to bring my suitcase up to my room. And the first time they brought someone else's suitcase. You would think that at the rates they charge, they would include free wifi, but the don't. It is free at less expensive hotels. The restaurant is very expensive. over $20.00 for just an omelet and coffee for breakfast. Cell phone reception is terrible at best. That is something that is easy to fix with inexpensive repeaters. They have wifi access points everywhere, they could do the same for cell phone coverage.

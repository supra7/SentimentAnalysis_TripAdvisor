Location was very good, but I found some of the staff to be rude. When you asked them to do something, it was with an attitude. Concierge and front desk in particular. Rooms were never cleaned until after 3:00pm. We had to call down everyday for the room to be made up. Air Conditioning was not great either. Spa was excellent. Its in the lobby but not associated with the hotel. Ask for Claudia. She was excellent !!

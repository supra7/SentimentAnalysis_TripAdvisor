Would not stay again I really don't understand how this hotel is ranked so high on TripAdvisor. My wife and I (we're in our late 20's) just stayed here at the end of July for 3 nights and were somewhat disappointed. Like other reviews mention, there is no elevator and TON of steps. If you're carrying up luggage, good luck! Check-in was fine, no issues.I know the rooms were described as being small by other reviewers and even the hotel when booking but jeeez man. They were TINY. With both of our suitcases on the floor we literally had no room to walk. Our room was at the back of the hotel with a terrible view. The hotel has no AC and even though it was not that hot, the room always felt stuffy and warm. The bathroom was also very small and found it difficult to move around in (I'm 6'0, 175lbs).The location is the best part of the hotel. Within walking distance to most tourist attractions in the city and there are bus stops located very close to the hotel as well. The restaurant located to the left of the hotel when exiting was terrible. I think it was called Calzones. The following night we had dinner at The House which was only 1 block from the hotel. It was by far one of the best meals I've had ever. Stan, the evening shift front desk person was also very helpful with directions and suggestions for sightseeing and meals. I would not stay here again.

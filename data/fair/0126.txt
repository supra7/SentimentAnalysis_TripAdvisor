This could be a charming stop in Seattle: the location is outstanding, and the period building with wooden doors and real keys took us back to the 30's. However, the total absence of expected amenities was a surprise: no tissues, no shampoo, no clock, no coffee (even in the lobby), no computer access except the one on the front desk--the feel was of a disinterested and disengaged management.

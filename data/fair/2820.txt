I truly hated this place, so much, in fact, that after two days here i ate the rest of the money and went to a different hotel on Maui. Why? Because it felt like I was living in a mall. If you like malls, or you like Vegas, and you like giant waterparks full of screaming, shoving people and you don't mind paying $17.00 so your kids can have two lemonades or paying another 10 bucks to jump off a float in the ocean, then this is the place for you. My kids loved it. It is kind of neat to swim up to a bar in a grotto through a fake waterfall, or go down a bunch of waterslides. If you like spas, it might be perfect, because your kids will be exhausting themselves while you spa it up at this giant tacky spa they've got. Me, I missed Hawaii.

NYC was sold out and I ended up snagging a King Suite here for a $565/night rate. I know New York Hotels and wasn't expecting a palace but boy, I wasn't expecting a room that felt so worn out. There were nicks in almost every piece of furniture and the bathtub was in need of replacement - the grout around the tub was falling off. The bathtub stopper had mold on it. And the shower ceiling's mold had been spackled over, just barely. The elevators are tiny and take forever and the room service is overpriced considerably. Bonus: being able to hear the dumptrucks.

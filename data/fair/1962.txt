This hotel gives Marriott a bad name. Try calling their front desk before you arrive... "Hello, Ritz Carlton" "Sorry, I dialed the wrong number" (dial again) "Hello, Ritz Carlton" (Hang up and try again) "Sorry, I'm trying to reach the Marriott and I think I have the wrong number" "No, we share the same line" Really?! Is the Marriott manager that ^*(#ing stupid? You can't afford your own phone line or operators?! It doesn't end there. During a 5 day stay ordered room service 7 times. 6 times the order was completely screwed up. 5 times the food was very late. No joke. Even after speaking with the manager, after the 2nd room service disaster, the problem was never fixed. And the food quality was poor, at even half the price we paid. The manager eventually offered us complimentary breakfast at the restaurant downstairs, but failed to mention (even after we told her we were in a hurry in the morning and the usless, late room service forced us to skip breakfast and be late for work) she failed to tell us that there's a 30-45 minute wait for a table at breakfast. If a hotel can not get even these elementary services right, it says a lot about the management. And none of what it says is good. These kind of shortcomings are unacceptable for a Marriott, especially a Marriott in the price range of this one. I'd give them negative-one star if it weren't for the nice decor, view, and amenities.

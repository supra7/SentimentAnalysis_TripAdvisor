This hotel was so bad, it was comical. Firstly it's not a hotel; it's more like a youth hostel, and a poor one at that. Fortunately my expectations werent high. I was staying in London for one night to go to the Kings of Leon gig in Hyde park. Most hotels were fully booked; I booked this one a couple of months in advance for 75. Our room was on the top floor, about 6 or 7 flights of stairs  theres no lift and the heat was unbearable. The room was like a furnace, it was a hot day in London but theres no air con. The rooms are tiny, hardly bigger than a double bed, we had to get ready in shifts. On the plus side it was quiet and the bathroom was clean and adequate. Breakfast (tea and toast) resembled a morning at faulty towers. People were packed like sardines into a tiny office behind reception. There were no free seats so we took a tray upstairs. Although we nearly passed out by the time we got to the top. The location is very good, close to the tube stations, Portobello road and hyde park. Should you stay here? I suppose it depends how much you pay for the room and the purpose of your travel. If it's cheap and you just need a place to crash, it'll do - just don't go in the summer.

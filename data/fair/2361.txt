Fairmont Copley's location is great and accessible to food, shopping and the airport. The hotel is old and is badly in need of an upgrade/renovation. It is too bad Harvard always used them instead of the Westin or Marriot which is just beside, and newer.Front desk staff is aloof to requests and checking in the room is always delayed in the numerous times I have been there (8) this year. The last stay I was moved 4 times, the first room had dirty toilets; second was noisy from the construction; 3rd was at the very end of the hotel and the aircon/toilet was defective and finally we got a decent room. Cleaning staff is very helpful the front desk should take lessons from them in customer interaction. Being a Fairmont President's club member does not help in terms of being able to check in early, better rooms and the like you would expect from a hotel of this stature.

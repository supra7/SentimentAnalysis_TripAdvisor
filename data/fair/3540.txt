I was booked in a "Wonderful" room and I ended up in a small and weirdly shaped room overlooking a multi-storey car-park - which meant that every time a car went in or out the headlights would light up my room. My colleague in another room was so unhappy with the mattress that he ended up sleeping on the floor. On the positive side location is very good, bar downstairs is OK, gym and service are good - but given the above I certainly won't be back, plenty of better options at this price (and I got a special rate).

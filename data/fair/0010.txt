I stayed here because I could not access my usual hotel. The hotel's location is convenient however the first impression is not great. The hotel is dated and in need of renovating. I was in a renovated room but the attention to detail was lacking. The wall paper was peeling, ceiling tiles in the bathroom were loose and the heat sensor about the shower was dangling. The service; - embarrassing. Housekeeping man compared his Blackberry to mine in the hallway and Housekeeper returns to the room with facecloths only to "scold" me for something. The entire time at the hotel the internet was unsecure and when I got home, I've clearly received the spam from this connection. The only great I can say is the view.

First I would like to say, if you want the best sleep in the whole world stay here at the Peabody Orlando. That being said, I was highly disappointed in the parking situation at the hotel. It definitely overshadowed the trip. As you may or may not know, the Peabody is undergoing a huge, massive expansion. Complete with a bigger better hotel and other things. I was completely surprised to find out that the parking lot was gone and replaced with an open area construction area. They now charge for parking which is $12+. You can park your car in the garage and WALK not be shuttled but WALK back to the main hotel. I could not believe it!! They are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the expansion and didn't bother to add a shuttle to the budget. If you can take the walk and can find this hotel at a good price then I would say by all means stay here. It's nice, the beds are totally comfortable. There was no construction noise over the weekend. To overcome this I would say stay on the opposite side of the expansion hotel and definitely ask for a high floor.

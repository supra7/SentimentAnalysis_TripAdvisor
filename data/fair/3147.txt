Never got to stay there... Went to Miami Beach for the weekend with my husband, my brother and his girlfriend. Arrived at the front desk around 6:00 pm on Thursday, August 16, 2007, but they had no room for us. The hotel was overbooked (I still don't understand how that happens...my brother arrived the night before, and the same thing happened. However, he was given a 2-floor suite at the Marseilles for the night, and then had to move to a regular room for the rest of the trip. We both booked through Travelocity.)Anyhow, they sent us one block north to the sister hotel, The Dorchester, and upgraded us to a king suite. The room was older, but very clean. A/C worked great (we could control it and it was cold!!), beds weren't too hard, shower was fine. In addition to the bedroom and bathroom, there was also a small kitchen with range, fridge, and microwave, dining room, living room. It was actually almost 3 times bigger than my brother's regular room at the Marseilles. Although initially furious, it all worked out. How much time do you really spend in the room anyway??I was hesitant after reading the reviews, but went through with the reservation. The person I dealt with at the front desk was very sorry for the mix-up. I begged a little to stay, but he said he really didn't have anything. I could have pitched a fit, but what good would that have done? I just wanted a place to put my bags, freshen up, and start my weekend. I only paid $100/night, so I guess you get what you pay for. I doubt I'll ever stay in Miami Beach again - EVERYTHING costs way more than I want to spend. An average meal for 2 was at least $35, and that's without alcohol. The bars were even worse...$18 for a pitcher of Bud Light at the Liquor Lounge 4 blocks south. Next time, I'll stay north in Hallandale or Aventura. It's cheaper and a lot less crowded.

I read and read on Trip advisor about different hotels and decided to choose Place d'Armes. We were taking our grandchildren and since they had a pool and was in an excellent location I thought that this would be a great choice. Well, the first thing we noticed was the pool was horrible and I wouldn't let the childrent get in the whole time we were there(4 days). The next surprise was when we walked into our room and there was a wall unit air conditioner. O.K. That shouldn't be too bad but it was damp in the room. I will chalk that up to the very high humidity in N.O. There were some good things. Staff friendly, very quaint and a lovely courtyard. It does have on site parking but what they fail to say is once the car is parked you might as well forget you have one. You need to give a days notice that you will need it. The continental breakfast was coffee, O.J. and cinnamon roll or crossaint. One of my grandchildren only eats cereal so we went to the A and P grocery which was close, to get the cereal and to also buy the milk. They didn't even have milk. They would keep it in the refridgerator for us. I will say it was in a terrific location. That I wouldn't change for anything. But before you choose this hotel make sure the pool is clean if you would like to cool off. Hope that this will help someone the next time they go to New Orleans.

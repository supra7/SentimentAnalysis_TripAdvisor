Never been to a 5-Star hotel and had a certificate I wanted to use. Enlightening experience. High expectations dashed. Main room and bathroom, while large, were nothing special. Beds (I'll admit) were very nice. Service was decent, but nothing out of the ordinary. Location is at the far end of the strip so be prepared to walk or cab or bus. VERY loud nightclub around one of the pools until late, so be sure to choose a room as high up and facing away from the pools as possible. Gaming rewards points only valid at Wynn and Encore while other properties span several hotels and locations. While hyped for the LGBT "Pride Concierge" at the Encore, none existed and the regular concierge had no information (they did have some information at the Wynn next door). Concierge was not empowered to make things right. If you choose to stay here, also be sure to get the resort package which includes wireless access to smart phone data plans and the gym area (you will have weak - if any - wireless data otherwise). Be prepared to pay top dollar a-la-carte for everything at this 5-star (only a 4-Star in other cities from my experience). Very elitist environment - which I suppose is the point. Example: nicer pool chairs are "reserved" by the pool staff for higher-end guests and they sit empty most if not all day. A "regular joe" who pays only $300-$500 per night for their room will be relegated to the back the rows of pool chairs.... Ahhhhh - only in Vegas - and in America - baby!

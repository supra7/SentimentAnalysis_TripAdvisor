We are a family of four who stayed at the Pacific Terrace for 3 nights. I cannot believe that other posts do not list the overriding fact that the area of Pacific Beach is a complete dump and not family friendly. It is a mix of collge nightclubs, run down motels, surf dives, and delapidated shops. The crowd is college party drinkers, homeless, and way-way out of towners (foreign/Michigan). Our guest's car was broken into the second night and the hotel would net help offset the costs of fixing the smashed window, they did not even check on us for the rest of our stay. The room was late in being ready at check-in, the concierge was completely wrong about availability of road bikes at their rental outlets, the hotel restaurant recommendations are the ones that are closest, and the whole thing has the feel of a motel with an expensive facelift. The price ($350/night) for a premium view room makes it seem as if the area, facilities, services will be high-end--this is not at all the case. BTW, the beach is across from the hotel but you have to go down a 30-foot bluff to get there--just don't get hit by a bike or trip over a homeless guy to get there.

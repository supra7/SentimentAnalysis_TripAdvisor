We stayed here for a weekend. The room was acceptable. It had a slight musty smell, but was very clean. The bathroom was renovated but very tiny- the shower stall was extremely tiny and the water pressure was not acceptable. However, it was a safe, clean, and very conveniently located. If you are planning to spend most of your time on Melrose, Hollywood Blvd, or Sunset Blvd, this is a good choice. The overall look and feel of the hotel was very reminescent of old Hollywood. Hotel would be perfect with a major renovation. Personally, I would not stay there again, but recommend to those looking for a low budget weekend trip and won't be staying in hotel most of the time.

While the location of this hotel and overal atmosphere are great, I have never experienced such paper thin walls in my life. I felt the people in the room above me were going to fall through. I heard every step and coversation. Granted, I am a light sleeper, but this hotel could use some updating. Staff were friendly and knowledgable. But I would not stay here again.

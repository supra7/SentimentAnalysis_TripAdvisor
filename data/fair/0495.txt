+ Great location + Our room was very quiet - Very bad smell in our room (like sewage), but other rooms (of other guests of tour group) were fine. - Incredibly hard to find! It's simply rooms in a large apartment building, no hotel sign, nothing, it's like visiting a friend - Wifi does NOT reach any of the rooms in the 3rd floor (where most rooms are) - For the price paid, not a great deal

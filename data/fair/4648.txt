I stayed two nights here on business. My room was very large and oceanfront which was great, but just very old and dirty in appearance. After my first night I awoke to two dead cockroaches on the floor (that weren't there when I went to sleep). I was in a hurry for work and left them for housekeeping to clean up. After being gone all day I found the bed had been made and the garbage taken out, but both cockroaches were still belly up on the floor - they didn't touch them. I would only recommend this hotel to people who get oceanfront rooms. The location of those rooms are across the street from the main hotel and are really right on the water. The beach is fairly vacant too, which is great. I wouldn't recommend it as it appears incredibly dirty, but probably worth it for the oceanfront rooms as they are affordable. This hotel is definitely not for everyone, but if you don't mind old hotels and are travelling on a budget, get an oceanfront room....but I guess you'll have to take the dead cockroaches out yourself.

The staff were excellent, and the location is good, but c'mon, people, a business hotel without in-room wifi? There's an Ethernet cable but that chains you to the desk -- no putting your feet up in bed to check e-mail. I also wish the reception clerk had asked whether I prefer to be near the elevators -- I do prefer it, and there was probably someone who would have gladly traded for my quiet room with the very long walk.

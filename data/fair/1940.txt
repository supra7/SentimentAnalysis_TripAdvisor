Hotel has a dark, rather depressing feel to it... especially the lobby and the hallways and area surrounding the hotel. Rooms was fine, tho, and the bed was quite comfortable. I arrived at 1:30PM but the receptionist made me wait until 3PM to check-in. :( I waited in my car chowing down on Jack-in-the-Box and did noticed that the receptionist checked other peeps into the hotel before 3PM. Htl offers Texas shaped waffles which I found to be the only real redeeming value of the property... rest of bkfst offering was quite bland. I thought the fruits on offer... the apples and bananas were quite tired. I felt that at $69 per night regular rate was overpriced (I paid $48/nite because of a discount offered on 3 nites)... $35.00 per night would have been just perfect.

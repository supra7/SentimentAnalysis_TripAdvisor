Great Location..that's it Great Location, one block from Waikiki Beach. Stayed in Penthouse..Overpriced..Rooms not clean, Air-con didn't work, housekeeping forgot to replace towels everyday, ceiling fan didn't work, oven didn't work...Not one wake up call came through. Better hotels in same street for same price.Don't stay here. Not family friendly..

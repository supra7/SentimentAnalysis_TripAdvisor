Ok if you don't plan on spending much time in your room My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The location is great, short walk to Union square and cable car, as well as many restaurants and bars. The room was not too expensive, service was good, staff was helpful. The breakfast buffet was ok.However, our room on the second floor was small and the bathroom tiny (you had to step over the toilet to get into the bathtub). Our view was the wall of the building right next to us, so we did not get much light. Walls are pretty thin and we could hear other guests talking in the hallway. Also there is only one elevator in the hotel, which was not a problem because we were staying on the second floor, but if you are staying on a higher floor, you might have to wait a long time.

Don't stay here if emergency safety is important to you! While I was there I jogged down the internal emergency stairs to go to the gym, from the16th floor room to the 4th floor. I was amazed to see EVERY emergency stairwell crammed with in-room dining trolleys, housekeeping trolleys and even a cot bed! All were there blocking up what is meant to be a safe exit for guests and staff in the event of an emergency.I called the hotels reception and the duty manager, promised to look into it for me. She never got back to me and when I left the hotel 2 days later, the emergency exit stairs were still blocked.

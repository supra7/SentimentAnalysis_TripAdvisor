Our stay at this hotel was not pleasurable at all, I know they call New Orleans the city that never sleeps, but I do like to sleep in while on vacation. Our room was located over the parking garage, not sure what they are doing down there but around 6:00 am you will be woke up by very loud noices, sounds as if they are dropping about 10 dumpsters, as well as very loud talking employees, they seem to not care about their sleeping guest at all. I thought I would give the hotel the beneifit of a doubt and not base my opinion on that, The next morning the same thing, very loud between 6:00 am and 6:30 . The air conditioner rattled so bad every time it came on, I was awaken so many times by this, I was about to give up sleep at this hotel at all. I have stayed at various hotels in the french quarter and I have never taken my own bags to my room, which is not really that big of a deal to do so, but the bell hops in the french quarter in my mind have always been known for their hospitility, Not at this hotel. The bellsman acted very rude and aggitated, there was a couple of elderly people in the lobby with luggage asking the clerk for some help with their luggage, she told them to talk to the bellsman and he would help them, at this point the bellsman walked in the lobby and the clerk asked him to help with the guest with their luggage, he replied I'll help anyone who needs help as he walked out the door, with the clerk steadly calling him back. He did not return.I also received an online coupon for $25.00 off a night, in which I presented to the desk clerk at the time of check in, she informed me that was a bogus coupon and does not know why it is still circulating. The website does not mention there is a $30.00 charge per day for parking. The rooms were very clean, but the pictures on the website make this hotel look a lot better than it really does. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone nor will I ever stay here again.

My husband and I stayed two nights here... and it was just "ok". The breakfast was quite less than average, not very good and this is coming from a very optimistic couple that we try and make the best of things. I would like to take this time to warn you about the location and parking....... There is no parking! You have to park in the back of the building on one of those downtown parking lots with NO security!!! And what really freaked us out was on your way to the parking lot theres people harassing you for extra cash..... I dont like being harassed and followed! As far as the hotel.... its pretty old which is charming but they need to remodel this hotel and fix things that are broken or no god. Ive stayed at old hotels in downtown San Antonio and even though they are old they are very clean and remodeled and dont smell like mold (the ways this hotel in Dallas did.) The AC in our room didnt work; it was always freezing because there was no way to adjust the temperature. here are some pictures of the hotel and Dallas Tx http://www.flickr.com/photos/kesiakerendlt/sets/72157627851850269/

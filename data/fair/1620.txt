Unfortunately our experience at the Chicago South Loop Hotel was tainted by the very poor service that we experienced and the loud night club music that kept us up late into the evening. The staff during check-in were very unpleasant, unaccomodating, and had almost no knowledge of the area. When we inquired on a place to eat - which is extremely limited unless you travel North to the city - they had absolutely no idea and were entirely unhelpful. The first night we stayed there was a very loud night club dance going on that could be heard all the way up to our 4th floor room and lasted until all hours of the night. If you want to be a hotel, then don't hold loud night club dances that are very disturbing to the customers trying to sleep. The bartender at the bar was in an extremely bad mood, as was the common theme with all the help we encountered, with exception of the bell hop who was on top of his game and should be asked to teach the rest of the staff customer service skills. Unfortunately I will never stay again at this hotel due to my experience and lack of anything around the hotel.

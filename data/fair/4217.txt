My family have been staying in the regular rooms at the Dunes Manor for years with few complaints. However, because this vacation was going to be somewhat longer than our typical Ocean City weekend getaway, we reserved an efficiency suite. We were VERY disappointed and now are not sure we will ever return to the Dunes Manor. The room was more than twice the price, however, was not even close to being twice the size of a regular room. The bedroom, bathroom, and living room areas were incredibly small. However, worst of all, the kitchen was very poorly stocked (no sponges, colander, dish drainer, etc.) and the appliances were in HORRIBLE shape. Only one of the stove burners worked and the microwave was a dirty and old model from the 80s. The new mattresses and linens were noticed and appreciated, however, they did not make up for the excessive prices charged for probably the worst efficiency I've ever stayed in. I hope management does see this review and renovates the suites. They are a black mark on this otherwise upscale facility.

Recently stayed at the Park Plaza with my daughter for a couple of days of Boston R&R. There was a deal at the park plaza, $89 per night. I thought I would swing out and we'd have some fun in town. The hotel staff was very nice, easy to work with. The price was right. The room itself (and I paid a little more to get a bigger bed) was dreary and old. Noisy, on the 11th floor! The drapes don't completely cover the windows edges so there was a lot of light around the edges of the window which kept me up all night. SO sorry to see a place with so much potential be neglected. Spend some money guys, a little paint and some color would go a long way. And please fix the drapes. For the price, this wouldn't be bad for a business stay. We were hoping for a bit more pampering. I suppose beggars can't be choosers. On the up side, you could include parking for nearly no money. This was a good perk. Bathroom was very small and old, but clean and the hotwater never runs out.

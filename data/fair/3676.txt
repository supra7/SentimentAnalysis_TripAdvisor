Stayed here weekend Dec 2004 and found entrance very attractive, lobby fun. However, when my room had been assigned to me, I was given a smoking room against my reservation specifications, and the view was directly onto air conditioning unit without any view and filthy. I was not informed I had been put into a smoking room. I complained and was shown a second room which stunk of cigarettes. I went back to reception and said could not stay in smoking rooms with worst views ever! They finally put me in a large, well appointed room facing the Waldorf Astoria which was fabulous and after that had no complaints. What I don't like is that you are given the worst rooms first and would be stuck staying in them unless you complain until you get a decent room. Discounts should be offered if client does not change rooms. It is much better to stay here than the Marriott next door! Still, this hotel has a very nice appeal and Bliss products wonderful. The staff could be less snooty and give more respect to clients...they act as if they are the best going and need to learn from European Hotels how to handle clients.

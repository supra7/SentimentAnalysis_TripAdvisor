the main problem with this hotel is the staff. They are rude and un helpful. At frist i thought it was because i was english but i heard the way they treated other people from ireland and france and they got no help from them as wel. The hotel location is ok for the beach but make sure you are not on the street after dark. The hotel is a poor 3star. No bar no room service after 10 pm and if they have a function they take all the lounge area and pool area away from you. Look around there are better cheeper hotels in barcelona

This hotel cost $300 per night and I would have expected more for that price. I can see that it has a certain Art Deco charm but my room looked as though it hadn't been decorated since the early part of the 20th century. Dark and dingy room, old and shabby furniture, sticky carpets, cracked tiles, cobwebs. On the plus side it was a large room (more like a mini-apartment really with separate double bedroom, small kitchen and a living room with dining room table, sofa (with pull out bed) and TV. Bizarrely the so-called 'fully equipped' kitchen had a full-size gas cooker with oven and grill but no pots and pans or any other cooking utensils. There was , however, a fridge and a microwave so I managed to microwave mugs of water to make tea! A toaster and coffee machine were also supplied. For a hotel marketed at business visitors I was surprised that there was no in-room internet access. There was a business center on the second floor where you had to pay 30 cents a minute to use the internet. There was a fairly well-equiped gym and an over-priced restaurant on the 26th Floor (maybe worth it for a drink to admire the views but make sure you eat elsewhere).

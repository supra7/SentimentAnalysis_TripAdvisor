We stayed at the Joule for two nights, and the hotel itself is quite beautiful. Our room was very nice as well. However, the service is not where near other luxury collection hotels, but more on the line of a Motel 6. The cleaning services "forgot" to make up our room, and did not replenish the soap or shampoo. Furthermore, they left us only one bath towel and forgot to remove all their cleaning supplies from our room. I did complain to management and they appeased me with some Starwood points. It is just very hard to fathom such poor service in a hotel that claims to be a luxury hotel. They have a great deal of work to do, so be weary if you book this place now. I imagine most of the kinks will be worked out soon, or this place won't last long.

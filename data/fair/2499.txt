We traveled with our 10mo old daughter to Chicago and stayed at the Palmer House. The lobby is amazing and the check-in was quick and pleasant. Our room, on the other hand, was extremely small, allowing barely enough room for our daughter's pack-n-play. We booked our room at Priceline, so we got a very good rate, which was the saving grace. I would not stay there again - I think I could pay a little more and stay in a true 4 star hotel.

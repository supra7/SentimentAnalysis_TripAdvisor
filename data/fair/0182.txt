The location is good and the price is hard to beat for downtown. From the 6th floor the traffic noise is low enough not to unduly disturb your sleep. The bathrooms were very clean. The high speed internet was free. That being said: 1) The pillows on the bed were stinky, as if many sweaty heads had lain on them. 2) The heads were probably sweaty because the thermostat was broken and all you could get was OFF or REALLY HOT. Fortunately the weather was mild enough that "OFF" was an acceptable option since no one was willing to do anything about it. Which makes sense since the entire 6th floor seemed to be thusly afflicted (a sampling of 3 rooms). Finally, I'm curious as to how disabled people might access the rooms as I don't think you can get to an elevator w/o dealing with stairs.

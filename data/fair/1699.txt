This is a low cost hotel and struggles to provide the basics. It is essentially a B&B. I had a single room with bathroom down the corridor and a shower that didn't work. The room itself was clean and comfortable. It is a 10-15 min walk from Harlesden tube (zone 3) and then 20-25 mins to oxford circus on the bakerloo. There are no restaurants nearby but you can get take away's e.g. fish & chips to eat in your room.

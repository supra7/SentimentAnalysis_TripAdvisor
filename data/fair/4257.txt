This is a very disappointing Marriott! The entire hotel is long overdue for a refurbishment. Furniture and carpets are old and in poor repair. But, even worse, is the poor customer service. No real concierge. Front desk tried to help us with restaurants in the area but weren't personally familiar with any. We sat in the lobby lounge for 20 minutes for a cocktail and were never approached. And, as with previous poster, we were never offered help with luggage. Maybe a visit from Bill Marriott...

My room was dark and smelly. Someone had left their dirty underwear in the closet drawers. The bath did not work. There is no parking and validation is not provided. The staff are unfriendly and unhelpful and tend to shrug rather than respond to questions, but they were nothing compared to the person who ran the breakfast room who was unbelievzably rude, in fact nasty. The room was not bad for the web rate of $158 but it is not at all what the management seem to believe their rooms to be, judging by the self serving pamphlets left on the desk. The furniture is new and so are the mattresses and the fabrics including the curtains, but the walls, closet and doors date from 1927 and smell quite bad. While its location is good, this is a noisy, smelly old hotel with poor service and it's better to find somewhere else even if you have to pay a bit more.

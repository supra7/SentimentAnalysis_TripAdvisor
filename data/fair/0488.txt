I stayed here with my gf and another couple for a short 2 day shopping trip at the beginning of September. The location is very good as it is located in the university village and across the street from a good mall. We stayed on a room on the third floor and it reminded us of an old, outdated apartment. We had read some poor reviews but we were willing to give it a chance based on the great rates offered to us by expedia. It wasn't worth the value. Although the girls were disgusted by the carpeting, the draping and the stains on the couch and the sunken in cushions, it was spacious and the bedrooms seemed adequate enough. However, all 4 of us received a maximum of maybe 2-3 hours of sleep each. The beds were extremely uncomfortable, and would constantly creak at every movement. There was also a construction crew that began working outside the hotel at 6am and that woke all of us up as the paper thin walls allowed us to hear every word said between the construction workers as well as the constant drilling and sawing. I've stayed in some pretty bad hotels, but this one takes the cake by far. Like another previous review stated, unless your homeless..AVOID!

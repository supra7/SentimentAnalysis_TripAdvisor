The first room we were given had totally wet carpet from being cleaned. We were given another room exactly the same. We were there for four nights and were quite high up so view was ok. We had our 9 year old son with us and he slept on a sofa bed. The sofa bed was just terrible. You could feel every spring in the thing and when we complained they bought up a topper pad which didn't help at all. The air con and fridge were so noisy, plus we were on the side right next to the railway line and heard trains about every 15 minutes all night. We had virtually no sleep the entire time we were there. No matter how often we complained they would not upgrade us nor could they shift us the a quieter room. The bathroom was huge and luxurious, even a tv in the mirror. It was the best bit about the whole room. Would never stay there again, and I would never reccomend this hotel to anyone.

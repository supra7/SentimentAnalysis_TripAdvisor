One would think that a hotel called "Swissotel" would pride itself on cleanliness. However, the hotel does not provide toothbrushes if you forget yours (they were out, or so they claimed), and they don't offer mouthwash either (enjoy your hike to Walgreens if you need forgotten bathroom items). Overall, this hotel from top to bottom - service, furnishings, beds, appeal - is akin to a mediocre Holiday Inn. Most Embassy Suites and/or Hampton Inns are nicer and friendlier...and much cheaper.

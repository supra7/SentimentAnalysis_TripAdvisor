Yes, the location is great for tourists but in the same general area is the Marriott Longwharf which is far superior. The room wasn't as clean as I'd like, the carpets were indeed stained, the curtains dirty and the air conditioning unit was in need of repair as it's sputtering all night kept me awake. I didn't order room service food or eat in the restaurant for fear that the lack of cleanliness extended to the kitchen, but I did order a class of wine which set me back 22.00. Mind you, that was the least expensive wine on the list. I come to Boston every 8 weeks for business and will never stay here again.

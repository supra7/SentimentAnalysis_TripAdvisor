It was clean, and the breakfast was good. Every-time someone slammed a door on my floor, my whole room shook. I couldn't shut the curtains on the window at all (and there was a superbowl party right beneath it). The drunk people speaking in the hall way around the corner I could clearly hear in my room at 3am. Went to leave, called in to get the valet car and 20 min later it still isn't there. 20 more min and its not there. My husband went to the valet desk and it had been there for a bit, they just hadn't gotten around to calling our name.....WHAT? 45 min wait for my car in a room with screaming children and you can't call out a name? *sigh*

Stay at the Intercontinental was not a thrill. Checked in and the double beds in the room looked like a pair of twin beds out of a dollhouse. The room that I ended up staying in itself was not the ideal four star hotel. The heat in my room went out and when the front desk was notified it took the (technician) maintenance guy an hour to get to my room and when he finally got there I also told him that I was having issues with the hot water in the bathroom. He was very rude and took his dirty shoes and walked all over my shower towel that I had on the floor. If the hotel was to go thru a major renovation I think that would be a four star maybe even a five star hotel. I was truly not impressed.

Nice location, Poor Management  We have stayed at the Beachcomber on 4 or 5 occassions, but will not stay there again. First the positive: great location, bordered on 3 sides by the International Marketplace, across Kalakaua Ave. from the beach. We had an ocean view room with buffet breakfast that was very reasonably priced.  The negative: incredibly, unbelievably poor management. There was no iron in our room, and the ironing board had one leg that refused to stand. Called the front desk, they sent up an iron and an ironing board, but I had to sign a statement that if I did not return them to housekeeping within an hour, they would charge both to my room! The rooms are small and rather plain, the view is OK, to see the ocean one has to look over the roof of the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. Cleanliness was so-so.  However, what really got me was when my MP3 player disappeared from my room, although I never took it out of the room. I reported it to the front desk, and they were not only not sympathetic, they were downright hostile. They confirmed that no one had been in the room except staff, so the thief had to have been a hotel staff member. After returning to the mainland, I received a letter from them disclaiming all responsibility. Apparently Hawaii has a gotcha law, exempting innkeepers from all liability for theft if the hotel provides a safe and the stolen goods were not in the safe. Of course, they charge you extra if you use the safe, so its a gotcha either way you slice it. Its a shame that a property so well located is so poorly managed. It didn't used to be that way.

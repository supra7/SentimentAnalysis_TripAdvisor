This hotel has full capacity. I tried to get an adapter so I can charge my cell phone but they are out of it. No service at night. For the money you are paying which is around 130 euro. You are better off getting a hotel closer to the city of amsterdam. At night there is no restaurant around the block that is open. There is a 24 hour store across that sells a 3.00eu small bottle water. No activity outside the hotel or sights to see. Expect no service hospitality from the front desk except to sleep at night and go on your way the next day.

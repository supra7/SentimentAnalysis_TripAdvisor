even though my husband and i could have stayed at a myriad of LV hotels for free, we had been waiting to experience the opulence of the Encore. We have stayed at many of the better hotels on the strip and had stayed at the Wynn two times while the Encore was being built. the property is beautiful but it's customer service, or lack thereof, ruined any good rating I wished I could give. To make a very long story short , I had a slip and fall accident in our room on the 4th day of our five day stay. I didn't know if I was going to be able to travel home because of my injury so on the way to the emergency room I asked the front desk mgr. if we would be able to possibly add on another night if I couldn't fly home the next day. he responded with "$319.00 a night" I didn't expect a room for free but i was paying a rate of $129.00 per night for the weeknights we stayed. I had torn my hamstring muscle. We filed a report with security and that's all the personal contact I got from the staff. As i said, I told the front desk, concierge desk [who directed me to the emergency room] hotel mgr. and head of valet dept and several employee what had happen and I received no follow up inquiries while we were there or when i got home. The only contact I have had is with the risk management dept which I called to voice my anger about my treatment. Since that time The hotel manager sent me a very generic e-mail hoping that they will have the opportunity to welcome us back soon. Maybe if he extended a "contact me when you are coming into town", I would go back. But, I think I'd get better treatment from a Super 8 motel.

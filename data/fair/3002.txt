We stayed at Westin Maui for 10 days in January. It was our first trip to Maui and after many months of research finally decided on Westin Maui because of the location (which is great). We arrived from Honolulu after a short 3 day stay there at around 1pm. We had a car and valet was great and very friendly. We were able to checkin early which is always nice. We were upgraded 1 category to deluxe ocean view. The room is typical Westin at first glance, but they really do need upgrading. The worst thing was the balcony. All the cement was crumbling on it so if you go out in bare feet your feet are covered in cement. Also, the view was look hard to your left and there's the ocean. This room was going for almost $600 a night! We didn't pay that, thank god (we used points). So, certainly for that price you go in with pretty high expectations. Very quickly noticed that there is alot of construction at the resort. They were redoing the area where the Luau is held so the adults only pool (another reason we booked here, we don't have kids) was listening to jackhammers all day for 10 days. Not impressed. The breakfast buffet is outrageous at $28 per person. We always ordered off the menu as the meals were plenty of food for more than half the price of the buffet. We did eat at the hotel once at night but the service was terrible. So incredibly slow. I'm not used to that especially at a $600 a night hotel. Another night we went to the "lounge/restaurant" for a nitecap. After waiting for our drinks for half an hour and being told over and over "they are coming" we just left. No thanks, $15 for a drink too! The location is great, right next to Whaler's village. We loved that and ate at the restaurants there every night. Lots of them have great early bird specials if you don't mind eating early. So, all in all we loved hawaii definately and will be back but definately not at the Westin. And it's too bad, I really wanted to love it as I am a huge Starwood fan.

Stayed here for 4 days late April 2009 while my husband had a business meeting in Chicago. Our 2 room suite, a supposed upgrade, was claustrophobic and dated. The 2 bathrooms were tiny in 70's style, bathtub/shower combo and more what would be expected in a 2 star motel. Service was spotty. The maid had to be called several times for service when we returned at 3:30-4pm to find the room not cleaned. Turndown service was also inconsistent. The concierge had difficulty booking dinner reservations for the correct restaurants and the correct day requiring multiple call backs. The restaurant charged us a large party service charge when we sat down for lunch, 3 adults and one child. Would have preferred to stay at Park Hyatt or Peninsula but we were fooled by the "Ritz Carlton" brand. For all the $ we spent here a total ripoff!!!

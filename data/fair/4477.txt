Disappointed the second time around I visited two years ago with my daughter and was pleased with the accomodations...they were cramped but neat/clean/ and safe. This time with my spouse the initial room reaked of cleaner and the window faced a wall. Another room was offered but that was also claustrophobic with a window opening up to another building. When I asked for a room with a view or some air I was on the corner of Lombard and Octavia. It was very noisy but the room was pleasant with two bay windows. Room was clean and breakfast consists of bagels, muffins, coffee, juice and hard boiled egss. Parking was awful and we did get a ticket for not removing our vehicle off the street after exceeding the 11AM limit by ten minutes. I still love SF, but maybe I'll stay elsewhere next time. Parking is ten dollars at an adjacent hotel, take it as parking is horrible.

They refused to give me queen size bed/king size bed because we booked through priceline. We checked in late around 10:30pm, even though the first desk staff said they have one room left with queen size beds, and she was wiling to check for me. The other check in clerk overheard our conversation, and whispered in her ear in front of me. The first clerk then quickly changed her mind and we could only stay in double beds room because my booking was done through priceline. Did not feel valued as a guest, made me felt unwanted. This is the second time I stayed at the Westin through priceline and both times I felt unvalued. If I got to pick the 4 stars hotel in the Seattle area, I would not have stayed at the Westin at all. Terrible front desk staff, if they do not value priceline guests, maybe they should not have allocated rooms to priceline at all. Like the other reviews, be expected to be treated with an atitude if you book through hotwire/ priceline.

My husband and two kids recently stayed at the Westin in Maui. The hotel was beautiful and very family friendly as promised. Unfortunately, while we were there they were painting and we were not able to use our balcony the whole time. In fact we often had to keep our curtains closed as you never knew when there would be five guys looking in. When I inquired at the front desk I was told by a very terse clerk that "it has to be done sometime" and that we couldn't change our room as she "didn't know the workers schedule". Not what you want to hear on your vacation. It was a shame to pay for an ocean view when you couldn't enjoy it. I was there NOV 1-6 2004 so you may want to call ahead to make sure this is not going on when you visit. Otherwise a nice hotel in a great location.

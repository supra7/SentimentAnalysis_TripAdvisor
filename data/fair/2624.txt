As my title suggests, I will keep my review very brief as there are plenty of reviews already stating the rundown nature of this hotel. It's old and definitely dated, although spacious and convenient. I cannot overemphasize the need to avoid eating ANY food at this hotel. From the eggs-only breakfast to the tasteless dinners, the menu is uninspired and bland. I highly recommend Pappasitos even thought it is a bit of a drive from the hotel.

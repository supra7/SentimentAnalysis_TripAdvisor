Buy it or Run We were at this hotel December 12 thru the 14th, 2008The Marseilles Hotel on 17th and Collins in South Beach is a cute property with potential but unfortunately it looks like years of neglect and profit taking has relegated this hotel to a dirty, noisy, irritating experience.The lobby staffs, all but Moses in the bar and one concierge guy that I didn get his name, were unfriendly and seemed bothered by having to deal with customers. The two different men, one older and one younger, behind the reservation desk could not have been worse service representatives.The room was decent and clean considering the age but the hall way and lighting was dark and dismal. The old fashioned doors and locks on the rooms combined with the concrete walls and long hallways caused each door opening or closure to loudly impersonate a jail cell slamming closed on an incarcerated inmate. Because of the proximately to the party clubs on south Beach, the guests come in late so from about midnight through five in the morning, these jail cell door slams go on constantly and reverberate through the dark and discerning hallways. Please do not expect any rest between those hours.The walls must not have any insulation or sound proving because we were greeted by a constant flood of conversation and laughter from both of our next door neighbors.The bathrooms are in desperate need of remodel and the balcony didn really look safe enough to stand on.All of these hotels use the Super Park Company to manage their guests parking and valet service. Outsourcing this service has only given the hotel the license to not have to be responsible for your car or service. Needless to say, the service was completely unacceptable in particular upon our checking out when the desk clerk claimed that he had not been on duty when I called for my car when in reality it was the same guy who just got some queer enjoyment out of seeing us wait knowing that we had a plane to catch. If you have enough money to buy this place and make it something special then it is worth going back or staying here. If not, you and us are better just staying next door or up the street.

My 2 girlfriends and I went to New York City for a shopping getaway. We wanted to stay close to Times Square and not pay too much, so we chose the comfort inn. Location was good. However, when we arrived, they had booked us with only 2 people, instead of 3, and informed us that there were only single/full size beds available and that they have no roll-away-beds! So, one of us had to sleep on the hard-as-a-rock floor in a tiny little room. We were informed that we would get extra blankets for the person sleeping on the floor, although we only received 2 extra (not enough to make the foor even somewhat comfortable!) Also, there is only one tiny elevator in the whole hotel making it somewhat difficult and long to get up or down, as sometimes you had to wait for several trips before you could get on the elevator. On a good note, the continental breakfast was great. As we were leaving to go back to the airport, we asked the concierge to call us a taxi, as we were waiting in the lobby, they told us our cab was "here" as they literally pushed us out the street and made us walk up to times square with our suit cases to hail a cab ourselves! It was very rude. Not sure I'll be back to the comfort inn on my next stay in NYC!!

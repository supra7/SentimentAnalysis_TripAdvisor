I'm a business traveller that spends over 200 nights in hotels a year so I've seen it all. Keep that in mind when reading my reviews. THE GOOD Location. This is the closest Starwood property to my clients / office. So convenience factor plus Starwood points really plays into why I stay here. THE BAD Ironically this was the first W property I ever stayed in, back in 2002. Since then I've stayed at W properties all over the world. This one is by far at the lower end of all the W's, but I still come back because of the reasons I gave above. Smallest rooms for a W in New York. Terribly inconsistent service... front desk is especially bad - sometimes they greet you warmly, other times it's cold as ice. Also if there is a line upfront they won't even acknowledge that you've been waiting for a More often than not I've always found something wrong with my room - Dirty towels, brown water from the faucet, dirty sheets. Plus I have to call multiple times to get these things fixed. Not at all what you would expect or pay for in a W. THE UGLY Did I also mention that the rooms were SMALL?

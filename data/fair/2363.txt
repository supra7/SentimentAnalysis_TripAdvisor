I was most upset at the treatment that I received at this resort. The staff were snooty and unresponsive. Many major problems with the room that didn't get fixed upon request and forced out of the room by annoying housekeepers at 8am, then at 9am, then at 10am. Not worth the amount they charge AT ALL!!

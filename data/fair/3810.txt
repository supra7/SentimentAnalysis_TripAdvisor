After two days of meetings, I was looking forward to an early bedtime and rest before my early morning flight. The hotel thwarted what I think is a reasonable expectation by scheduling live rock and roll music outside my window. What made it worse was that there were only a handful of people listening to the music. It took three calls, two to the manager, before they even agreed to try to quiet or end the music. An hour and a half later it finally quieted down. One hotel employee even said she would not be offended by loud music outside her room (this was at 9:00 pm, and ended at 10:30).

My husband and I spent three nights here earlier this month and were really disappointed in our stay. The bad: broken A/C in our room; no safes in the room and only very small safety deposit boxes available in the lobby (so not big enough to lock up laptops, camera equipment, etc.); the fireplace "upgrade" includes a Duraflame fake log and can't even be used unless the A/C and fan are off and the door is closed, otherwise smoke fills the room (so basically, unless the weather is really cold, it's not usable); front desk was extremely unreliable in making the reservations we requested (they told us they made one but actually didn't; they told us that another winery that we wanted to try didn't take reservations and we could go anytime, but when we got there, they apparently did take reservations, so we had to wait almost an hour before getting in); the hotel is very old and thus extremely noisy--we heard every footstep in the room above us; views are not very scenic--just a 1/4 acre hobby vineyard and the freeway (which is also pretty noisy); pool was not heated as advertised; price--given the above flaws, this hotel was outrageously overpriced, even for high season The good: decent-looking pool area, which was never very crowded; location (on one end of Yountville, so about 3/4 of a mile to the furthest place in town); free wireless internet and free parking

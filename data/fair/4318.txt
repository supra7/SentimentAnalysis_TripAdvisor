Yucky Souvenir From Previous Guest This stay was a disappointment as opposed to previous ones. We were placed in a room on a low floor (I requested high) with a king bed (I requested two doubles) that had not been cleaned properly (dirty socks on the window sill). We received a bad attitude when we were moved and really bad attitude when they weakly offered to move us to a room with requested bed configuration on the last night. The staff we dealt with were less than enthusiastically professional. I will not be staying there again anytime soon. Back to the Sofitel!

The non-water-facing room instead face a diesel freight line. Some of the room are a stone's throw away from the track. So if you want a room that doesn't face a train line, you have to pay a huge premium for a "waterfront" room. The hotel is looking worn and run-down.. carpeting ragged, some of the outlets in the room partially coming out of the wall, marks on the wall. For the price, this should be a Ritz Carlton and it's more like a (unrenovated) Holiday Inn. I would absolutely not recommend this hotel.

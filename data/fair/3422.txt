We arrived in NY at 10:30pm on a rainy night, and found that our reservation had been cancelled (by some strange reason) by staff at this hotel. They didnt have a room for us, and offered one of their partner hotels that was blocks away. As we refused, they managed to cancel someone elses room and give that to us. The room was terrible. Small, dirty, no bar fridge. Not very pleasing for our honeymoon.

As for the room itself, you get what you pay for. It isn't the Ritz, but it isn't a Motel 6, either. The bed is comfortable and the shower is forceful, which can be a good thing after a long day. However, the service really is terrible. The front desk clerks are slow-moving and difficult. They botched a reservation I'd made two days beforehand, and when I tried to dispute it, they did not listen to a word I said. In fact, I caught the clerk in a lie while I was checking out yet he persisted to be unapologetic and unyielding. Unless you have the patience of a saint, I don't recommend staying here.

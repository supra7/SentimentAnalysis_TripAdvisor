The hotel is located in residential area, around 5 minutes walk from either s-bahn or u-bahn (there is a tram stop closer). I did not find the location to be an issue but for people on vacation here it may be not be the perfect location as there are not really any good restaurants or such around either. The hotel feels like it is in dire need of renovation. The reception area is fairly ok but once getting up to the rooms it is apparent that it has not been renovated in many years. I was also a bit surprised of the lack of a/c in the room. Berlin in August is rather warm so would have been good to have a/c. The room was otherwise ok, had a decent bed and was clean. The bathroom was also as expected. There was a desk to work at and it would have been useful if the wifi had worked. The main issue I had was however with the wifi. It was of course not working at all and the staff were entirely uninterested helping me.The attitude was appalling and they could not even bother to suggest a place in the area which offered wifi. They made not attempts to fix anything but simple stated that they could not really do anything. When I explained that I had specifically asked if there was wifi when I booked since I needed to work they merely restated that they could not really do anything but that I could perhaps wait a day or so to see if it would work then (which is an interesting statement since I just checked in and the person knew I was checking out the next day). There are so many better hotels in the same price range in Berlin so will definitely not stay here again.

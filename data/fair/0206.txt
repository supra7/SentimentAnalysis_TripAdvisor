We attended a weekend seminar held at the hotel. The room was OK, the pool was small and too cool. We enjoyed tasty appetizers in the lounge/restaurant, and the severs were very friendly. We tried a walk around the block but the vicinity is not welcoming, a homeless man was camped on the stairs to the service entrance and glared at passers by. On our day of departure I got trapped in one of the 5 elevators, it malfunctioned and the door wouldn't open for several minutes. The prices were pretty high, and they charge a lot for parking, though you have no choice to park elsewhere.

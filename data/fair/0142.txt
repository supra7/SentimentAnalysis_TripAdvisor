I was looking for a better than average Hotel downtown for my wife and I to enjoy a valentine weekend and I thought the price offered was the best deal. We only stayed one night in #423. Well, you get what you pay for. The location is good for being downtown, but you still have the street people present around the area enough to make you feel uncomfortable. If you are looking for roomy rooms, well dont come here. The rooms are nice, but very small. If you are a taller or a larger person the bathrooms within the room are not for you. The door and the wall are about 5-6 inches to the toilet (no leg room to sit properly). The only roomy thing in the bathroom is the tub and even that is only 5ft long. The cleanliness in the room was bad. The bathroom glass door was dirty with hand prints. The bedding looked like they changed the sheets and the pillow cases, but kept the down comforter from the previous tenant. The bed is hard and the walls to your neighbor are very thin. I could have had a decent conversation with my neighbor and understand what they were saying. Plus, the self parking is "steep" in my opinion at $21.

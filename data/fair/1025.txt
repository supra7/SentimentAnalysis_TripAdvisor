This hotel is not a 3 star. We booked online--it was in an ok area-but not real close to anything but the mrt. Half of the rooms have no window and we were on the unlucky side. We also had no hot water in the shower. We kept waiting for it but it never arrived. Since we only did 2 nights--we did not complain. Staff was nice. Breakfast was mediocre. air con still had cigarette smell in it. Budget hotel--clean and new fixtures. $75 dollars buys a lot more elsewhere.

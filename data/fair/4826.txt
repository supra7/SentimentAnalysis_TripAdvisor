We stayed at the Millennium Hotel our last night in Boston. The location is great, but the hotel was a disappointment. Our non-smoking floor smelled of cigar smoke, the room was small and dingy with stains on the carpet, the bed and pillows were uncomfortable and the hotel certainly needs some remodeling. I would have expected this from an older hotel outside the city, but not for the high price we paid. We won't be back.

I agree with the previous poster. This hotel is way too overpriced if it wants to be competitive with other Seattle hotels based on what it has to offer. I thought the sleep quality was terrible-- my sister is pregnant and was in so much pain sleeping on the beds because they are so hard and uncomfortable. Also, the walls are very thin which makes the rooms susceptible to much outside noise so I highly recommend asking for a room away from the freeways. I personally would never select this hotel again and pay full-price. If I was forced to stay here because of a great Name-Your-Own-Price deal on Priceline, I would be okay with it, but that would be because I wasn't paying full price. Either the prices overall here need to come down, or management needs to invest in some sound barriers, comfier beds and more luxurious rooms in order to draw people from competing hotels in the area. I was very disappointed that this is where I had to stay for my two-night jaunt up to Seattle. (Also- valet fees are so ridiculous. I don't care if people say that this is market price in Seattle-- no one should have to pay $40 to park their car overnight. No one. If you want people to willingly stay here, offer free parking.)

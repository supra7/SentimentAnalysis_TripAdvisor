Disappointed but good breakfast We stayed here for 3 nights commencing 27/6 after good comments on Tripadvisor and also frommers. I have to say we were disappointed. Room was small (even though we had opted for a room which could accommodate a day bed). Room only looked superfically cleaned, dusty with inground dirt and general signs of age/ wear and tear. Be warned traffic noise from Lombard street is awful compounded by antiquated wooden blinds which meant that room was always bright and noisy! Breakfast was good, fresh bagels to toast and hardboiled eggs if somewhat messy with paper napkins and plastic knives. I wouldnt recommend to stay here based on quality of room. It is well placed to walk to Fishermans wharf. I would suggest staying closer to union sq and getting the cable car down to the wharf.

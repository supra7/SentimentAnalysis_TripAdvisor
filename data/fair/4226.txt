This Holiday Inn needs to be gutted completely. The decor is dirty and dated. If you have the misfortune of forgetting to specify a non-smoking room you will smell like a cigarette throughout your stay. Even the linens smelled of smoke and the air cuts off automatically if you leave the door open. The front desk, restaurant and pool snack bar are under staffed, and the indoor areas were littered. We will not be returning. As far as the pool bar, it's okay, but expect drunks by the afternoon.

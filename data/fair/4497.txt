Small hotel in great location. Rooms are narrow. If you wish to watch the TV, it is quite an ordeal. You must slide out the shelf that it is on in the armoire until it is in a precarious position and partially blocks access to the bathroom. The bathroom is very small but cute and functional. The fireplace is a nice touch. Room and street noise is moderate..best to bring earplugs. The breakfast room has terribly stained upholstery which is quite the turn-off. We will find another place to stay on our next visit.

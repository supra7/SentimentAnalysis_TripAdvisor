We were booked to stay in this hotel at the beg of April 2010, fully paid in advance. When we arrived, first the receptionist couldn't find our booking, then we were told that the room was being renovated and we were offered a room in a hotel a few yards away. We accepted this, being evening and no time to find an alternative. The replacement was supposed to be also three star - this I doubt. It was small, without enough space for clothes so that we had to keep our clothes in our suitcases and try to manoever around these on the floor, also noisy until late in the evening even being woken at 1.30am with next room's television. Passing the Grand Tahir for the next few days, we could see no evidence of renovations - we were annoyed with ourselves for not standing our ground and insisting we get what we had paid for. We felt we had been short-changed. Location for sight-seeing is convenient.

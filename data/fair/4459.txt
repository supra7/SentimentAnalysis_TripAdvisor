Once is enough Good location, very comfortable beds, good restaurant breakfast, mostly courteous staff, beautiful garden; however, the room was hot (no air conditioning), they charge for Internet use in the business center, television had very few channels, bathroom area not private enough. Glad I stayed there, but will only do once.

My family has stayed at many Ritz Carlton's and this one has been so disappointing that we have spent most our time looking for a house to stay in. We stayed in an Ocean Front Residential Suite and were extremely disappointed. If you come to Maui don't waste your time on this side of the island. Stay in Wailea at The Four Seasons. It was incredible!

This is a warning to anyone anywhere using a Crowne Plaza Hotel, but particularly Seattle. I made 2 very brief phone calls from my room to home (which should have cost about $6 each). I was charged $52 - THAT'S RIGHT - FIFTY-TWO DOLLARS! Read the room's phone rate card, and you'll see why... "can you say extortion boys and girls? I think you can!!!!" Basically, they charge fees on top of fees on top of fees. That's not providing a service, that's gouging!

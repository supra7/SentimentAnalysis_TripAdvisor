What a disappointment. I had a deal for a Fantastic Suite room for 249 a night - velvet couch, marble top bar... From the description on the web site I thought I was in the wrong room and I asked the manager to come up. The carpets were disgusting, the couch was a dirty burlap and the "bar" was a small wooden table. The manager assured me I was in the right room and said the burlap couch was what they call velvet. I told her I know I had a deal but was not happy in this room and have been in regularly price 249/night rooms in NYC and they were much nicer. I was offered an upgrade the next day to a Spa room. I took it because it was nicer and cleaner. Two things happened - after I left the water out of the whirlpool there was dirt all over. Either I was very dirty or there was something wrong with the jets. The second thing was a worker came in to deliver a magazine after two knocks as I stood there in a state of undress. (The deadbolt is engaged by moving the entire handle upward - something I hadn't figured out at the time.) The security laughed when I told him what happened and said there was nothing he could do. Bottom line - I won't stay here again.

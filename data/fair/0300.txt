Photos on web (incl. TA) make it look a lot nicer than it is really. A big block warehouse of rooms has the feel of college dorm rooms that need work. Very friendly staff. Just okay for one night on a quick trip in and out of town, but I'm unlikely to return. I used miles and the old adage applies: you get what you pay for.

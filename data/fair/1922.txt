spend more--go somewhere else this hotel was clean--staff was great--all except for repair man who was very rude. They say it has been remodeled--the appliances are rusted and the frig says frostfree--that was not true. You get 2 ice trays in the freezer--thats your only source of ice--and they were dollar store trays. The mattresses are the cheapest one can buy. The towels are small and thin. The carpet had burn holes and felt nasty and sticky. The mirror on closet cracked--the cable tv had only a few channels--internet worked at times--there are cameras on the entire place to make one feel secure--but staff told me they only worked in a few areas. Never smelled any chlorine in the pool area---cheap plastic furniture around that. No workout room. No continental breakfast ever--told they don't have breakfast anymore. This hotel is only if you want a cheap deal--and it is located around some worse ones all on the same street.

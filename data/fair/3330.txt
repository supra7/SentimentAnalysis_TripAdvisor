The desk clerk might have been pissed about having to work on Thanksgiving...I'm not exactly sure. She took my reservations non-chalantly and then vocalized my room number aloud as she gave me my key. This is a no-no, especially if someone is traveling alone. I diplomatically told her about it and she attitudenally blew it off then shouted it across the lobby to the bellman (that I did not request). The room was uneventful but clean. By day, it's a great location and close to the quarter, Cafe' Du Monde, the Grayline Tour pickup base, 2 blocks from Bourbon and interesting shopping. By night, it is the scariest damned poorly-lit walk down a street that I've ever taken in the quarter. Furthermore, walking through the creepingly dark courtyard to get to the elevator (located in a secluded corner) to get to my room (which was located next to a walkway that anyone could have jumped out of and had me) was nothing nice. If you are traveling alone, don't stay here. You are not safe nor respected. P.S. I told management this in writing and was not responded to.

Petite Auberge is a lovely hotel with a great location. Sadly, when we booked we got a queen room without a fireplace. I said that sounded fine and when we showed up we got room 22. It is right next to the stairs and elevator which go ALL NIGHT. It was very hard to sleep and not a very restful room at all. When we checked out in the morning I let the gentleman at the front desk know it was hard to sleep because of all the noise and he said, "Oh, yeah. We know". I suggested that in the future they inform people of the room situation and he just grunted. Not the reaction we was going for. While we would love to stay again, this behavior and attitude towards feedback is not acceptable and that is why we gave them a bad review. Book at your own risk!!

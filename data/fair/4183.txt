As long time residents of Maui, we decided to spend a couple of days up-country in the Makawao area and do some hiking. We were attracted to Hale Ho'omana based on their website description and the numerous reviews that were very positive. We were very disappointed. This was a rather warm weekend and were surprised that the room did not have a ceiling fan. There was no AC in the unit to compensate for the lack of a fan. Even with the windows open, air circulation was very limited. During this weekend, the owners had also decided to host a large party for friends and neighbors in their spacious backyard. This event went well into the evening and was rather noisy, especially with the back and forth passing of several cars on the gravel path just outside our window for several hours. To minimize the noise, we needed to close the windows and endure the still heat of the room. I wish the owners would have alerted us to the fact that there would be an event that weekend, and that the peace, quiet and "zen-like" atmosphere that is touted on their website might be compromised. As it turned out, it was just a rather expensive, hot and noisy room that did not even allow for a good nights sleep.

I just checked into the Sheraton and although my check in process was hassle free, I was surprised and very disappointed to find that there is no in-room wireless internet. This means that you will be confined to the desk while working/using the internet. If you like using your laptop in your bed, sorry, the cable is too far away from the bed. The wired internet costs $10.95 per day which is not unlike any other business hotels that I've stayed in, so that's completely fine...but no wireless is not fine. In addition, I paid full price for my room which was to be between floors 5 to 30, and I got a room on floor 6. I know I'm nit-picking....but aren't rooms on lower floors typically assigned for those who paid a discounted price for their room? Lastly, I found a strand of hair (not from someone's head...but from some other region of the body which I will not explicitly state here) on my bathroom sink! I should have taken a picture of it but I hastily used a kleenex to get rid of it immediately. Yucky! I'm still giving 2 stars since the front desk staff was very friendly and courteous, and the bed is really comfortable.

I was one of the first guests at this recently restored grand hotel, which has been closed since Hurricane Katrina (when it operated as part of the Fairmont chain). The public areas are beautiful, and great food and drink outlets, but "the boiler" broke during my stay and we had no hot water to shower or bathe with until about noon. A 500+ room should have a back-up system! There was also a "r bug" curled up under my sink that the housekeeper didn't notice for two days, which worries me. Staff is really nice and accommodating. Location is also grim, derelict closed restaurants and theatres outside both entrances. Maybe in a few years the neighborhood will bounce back, and the hotel will be running smoothly but for now I would give it a pass.

We stayed for 6 nights at the hotel. The rooms were clean, maybe we were lucky not to have a visit from the bedbugs ;-). The hotel was only 15 minutes from downtown Manhattan by subway. The guys carrying the bags and holding the doors and the cleaning ladys were very nice, but the people at the reception desk weren't friendly at all. I mean they helped you, but certanly not in a friendly way. Our room was on the 5th floor, meaning you have to walk a lot of stairs every day because there is no elevator. As a tourist in NY you propably walk the whole day as we did and climbing the stairs to the 5th floor is too much, 8 stairs. We wouldn't go back there, because the lack of an elevator and the chance to get a room on the 3th floor or higher is very big. In that neighborhood there are more hotels, clean and with elevator or walkable floors. I suggest you to look further....

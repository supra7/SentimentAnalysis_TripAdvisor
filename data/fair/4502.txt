My wife and I showed up at the hotel to find our Petite Suite was given away to someone with a similar sounding name. Although we were given the first night free (because we stayed in a smaller room than we reserved), our Petite Suite was only an OK experience. In retrospect, we would not stay there again, and not recommend it to friends. I have stayed in many boutique hotels in San Francisco, so I am a fan of this type of hotel, but there were too many problems: 1. both the beds of the first room and the Petite Suite had a bad smell. We could not tell if it was the pillows, comforters or the mattress, 2. the bathroom has a mildew smell, 3. although there was complimentary beverages and coffee, the milk is left out all day and is spoiled at night, 4. make sure you have light luggage - when we checked out, we had to lug our bags up the stairs to the breakfast floor, take the antique elevator 1 flight up and then down to street level, 5. there is no wireless/wired internet service, I had to go to the White Swan Inn, 6. MANY times, there was no one at the front desk of the hotel. I still will go with boutique hotels while in SF, just not this one.

If your idea of a vacation is spent warm and at the beach/pool this is NOT the hotel for you. This hotel well north of the more protected hotels in Kaanapili and Wailea. We had a great few days in Wailea and witnessed a 14 degree tempature drop in the 30 miles drive to the Ritz. Also, this hotel is windy not in a gentle breeze kind of way but more like a small hurricane. This hotel is located in Kapalua and is a good drive from the closest entertainment which you will want if you plan on seeing the sun or being warm. I have no diea why the Ritz would have chosen this locaiton for a beach resort. My wife and I tried to go back to the Grand Waliea (best hotel in Maui) but they were sold out. Avoid this hotel if you want to enjoy any outdoor activites.

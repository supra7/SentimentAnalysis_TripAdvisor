My wife, one year-old son and I stayed at the Paramount for two nights over a weekend to attend a family wedding at the Hyatt across the street. The location is great (ten minute walk from Pike Place Market) but construction in and around the area means you're forced to use valet parking ($25/night). Our first day and night at the hotel were great. Room is decent and clean. The cleaning staff is very friendly; the frontdesk staff and valets are OK. The in-house restaurant is mediocre but not too pricey. Things started to go terribly wrong on our second night. Our toliet overflowed at 11pm resulting in a flood in our bathroom. A cleaning staff person caming to our room and plunged the toilet, but the toilet plugged up again the next morning. This time a real maintenance person came and fixed it, but noone came to clean the floor like we requested. The manager knocked off $50 for that incident. We then called down to have our car retrieved from the valet upon checking out. They could not find our car for about an hour! We nearly thought our car was stolen! Still not sure why our car could not be found for that time. Meanwhile our son was tearing up the lobby. Needless to say we left the hotel very frustrated and upset. We found out afterwards that the manager took off the second night room charge and parking from the bill, but the damage has been done. Even though rates are half that of the Hyatt, maybe go to a better hotel with better service.

When I mean bang, I do not mean a good thing. It was about 5 to 8 degrees that weekend, so heat in the room was essential. The problem was when we turned it on, it began making a loud banging noise. It started around 12:30 am. When I called down to the desk to ask someone to fix it, they were not very responsive and said they could move us instead. I really did not feel like packing up and moving at 1am. So we ruffed it out and got little sleep, not good!! We did enjoy the upstairs bar and breakfast coupons in the morning. I really do expect more from boutique hotels, pretty sure we are "done with the Dana!"

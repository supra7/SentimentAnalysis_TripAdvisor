Charming? Now That's a Stretch! I can't EVEN believe someone would call this place charming. Had reservations for two nights in late June. Everything in S.F. was sold out due to a big convention of some sort. This was about the only place that still had rooms. That in itself should have told me all I needed to know!To be fair, it was spotlessly clean. A big plus in my book. There is NO air conditioning so anything about 70 degrees posses a problem. The location is TERRIBLY noisy and the building literally shudders whenever a large truck drives by (frequently). There is also a lot of street noise, i.e. laughter, loud talking that you can hear clearly if you have a streetside room. The wood furniture needs a bit of Old English cover-up and the blinds were bent and hanging precariously. It reminded me of those cheap hotels in Manhattan that I frequented in my 20's. You don't expect much, and you sure don't get it. Continental breakfast consisted of donuts, coffee and OJ. This is really bottom-of-the-barrell accommodations, but I guess the price is right. I checked out after the first night and moved to the East Bay.

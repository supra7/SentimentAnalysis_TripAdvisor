I just got back from a weekend in NYC, where I stayed at the W Lexington. The reason I chose this hotel was that it was running a pretty good discounted rate. Having stayed at numerous other W hotels, I thought this would be a pretty safe bet. Disappointed would be how I would characterize the rooms. Carpeting needs replaced and the wallpaper it botched in many spots. Room was missing a coffee maker. Everything just seemed pretty "dated." This wasn't something exclusive to this one room, as the poor carpet and decor ran throughout the building. I did see that the Marriott next door was undergoing significant rennovations. Perhaps the W Lexington will follow suit. Decent price, but I expect more from the brand and this one hotel is clearly devaluing their other properties in my opinion.

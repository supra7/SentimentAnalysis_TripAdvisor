We were staying in NY over New Year's Eve, and wanted somewhere in the village. The location is great - close to Union Square. The price was reasonable, but there were just too many negative aspects to the hotel. They don't have any non-smoking rooms (or didn't - I'm sure not sure the law changed). Thus, our room smelt very smoky. After complaining, they gave us a de-ionizer thing, which didn't do any good. There was a pipe that carried hot water in the corner of the room - this was boiling hot at night, to the point where one of us got a burn that blistered from touching it briefly. The room was small, smelly, and the showers weren't great. One of the worst hotels I've stayed in. Looked good from the outside. The name sounds nice. That's it.

We stayed at the Frenchmen Hotel. However when it rained our room leaked horribly and we had to change rooms. The staff was very friendly and helpful, bathrooms were clean, but I strongly recommend asking for a renovated room. My sister and her husband did and were just fine. It's in the French Quarter so it was convenient to the main streets.

For the theater district, the location is great. Our room was extremely tiny and uncomfortable, even by New York standards, and there was no means of circulating air. No fan or AC and the windows were right up against another building so they provided no relief (actually, we weren't supposed to open them but we had no choice). The heat was uncontrollable, making it impossible to sleep. They told us there was no other room available. Quite the disappointment after having booked months in advance. Rooms like ours are the type they should have saved till the very end for last minute walk-ins. Check your room first!

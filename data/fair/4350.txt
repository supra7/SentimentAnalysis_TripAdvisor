Good, but great? We booked our stay for the Thanksgiving week 8 months ago. It's was the least expensive hotel close to the parade route. The service is fine, and the lounge is great (we saved a FORTUNE on breakfasts and two nights we turned our crackers and cheese into dinner!). But we were staying at the front of the hotel in a King suite (room 502) and we found the noise unbearable. If you're a light sleeper opt for a room in the back -- with all the sight seeing to do in New York City, a good night's sleep is essential and we would have appreciated someone advising us about the noise upon booking. (The beds were very comfortable, however).I was not surprised by the size of the rooms as I had read about them on this website. We had a King suite, but the room was so overstuffed with unnecessary furniture (Why do I need a table for two in my bedroom?) that we had to get very creative even to pull the sofa bed out for our daughter. We wound up removing the glass from the coffee table and propping it up by the wall and putting the metal base on end in a corner.We were given mis-information about the parade from a staff member (he didn't even know what street it came down -- thankfully we had done enough research of our own to know better), and we also had to have a very unfriendly staff member unclog our toilet -- it was kind of an embarrasing call to make and a more congenial attitude or a sense of humor would have been appreciated.All and all, Casablanca was nice, but not exceptional and for $459.00 a night, I expect exceptional.

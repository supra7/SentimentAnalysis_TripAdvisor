Choose Another Hotel in San Francisco My wife and I stayed at this hotel in Mid-October 2006 on a trip with another couple. The rooms are painfully small and poorly organized. The bathrooms are so small there is no room to put your toiletries as you get ready. The $10 per day internet is fine, but there is no place readily available on or near the little desk (wedged in next to the bed) to plug in your computer.Worse even is the hotel staff. From the people at check-in who seemingly don't care, to the door man who is more interested in collecting his tips from the towncar drivers and taxi cab drivers then to even hold the door as you enter with luggage. My luggage arrived late from the airport and it was huge effort (imposition) for the staff to coordinate between the front desk and bell desk to get it. Frankly they should have delivered it directly to my room - as I tried to ask at the front desk - but again, they just don't care about you.My read is the hotel and it's staff is too interested in being hip than providing any service. I love hip hotels - try the Hotel Solara in San Diego or the Hotel Andra in Seattle for instance. But this hotel fails in every way. When you call from your room to the front desk, or to the concierge the line is BUSY. Why, I don't know - I eventually just called the hotel from an outside line to reach someone.Lastly, we checked out early - it was really that bad - and the hotel charged us a $50.00 cancellation fee. I think that shows you how you will be treated by this hotel. I won't stay there again and as one that puts a lot of credence in the TripAdvisor, I caution anyone else that might consider it. There are many great hotels in this city - I tried this one based in part on the positive TripAdvisor reviews. My mistake, don't make the same one! Anaheim, CA

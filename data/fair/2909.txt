The staff was very pleasant and friendly. The rooms are very old and need to be updated badly. They look like a motel 6 at best. The view was amazing and the salt water pool was a nice touch. There was an unbelievable sunset! Would I stay here again, probably not. It was overrated for the price of the room.

This is not a five star hotel and not worthy to belong to the leading hotels of the world group. The materials used in the hotel are expensive and it's clear that there is invested a lot of money in the hotel, but the way this hotel is managed makes it not a pleasant experiece. This is not what you expect from a 5-star hotel. Some notes: - The ventilation system does not work very well, because of this you hear a lot of noise from outside, for example a lot of cars from the freeway closeby, a train every hour and - I noticed a lot of things being broken: doors that do not close properly, handles that are loose, a toiletseat that is not fixed which caused me to nearly fall off the toilet, a broken lamp, broken tv in the bathroom, broken checkout computer-system, .. In a real 5-star hotel most of these would have been fixed. - The staff was not what you expect from a 5-star hotel. The bell-boy just dumps your bags right after the door, the concierge does not really help out and when we walked to our hotel-room we needed to show our hotel-key to a doorman that looked like a bouncer from a nightclub. The inside of the closet was really dirty and somebody just walked into the room at 9pm when the do not disturb light was on. You have to pay extra for everything you use. You have to pay a mandatory $15,- resort fee for things like water and newspaper, but that does not included internet (an extra charge) or use of pool (also an extra charge) or overnight parking (I believe a $15,- charge per night which is very expensive for vegas). We also stayed in at the Signature at MGM. They really look the same. Same size room, the same ammendities. But what a difference: the Signature is a pleasure to stay at. Trump although it looks great gives you an unpleasent feel.

This was to be a 13 day stay for business. There were several issues that were not fixed during my stay that prompted me to check out of the hotel and check into another. 1st being they put me in a room with an adjoining door. Because of this I was able to hear everything that went on in the next door. This included conversations, television shows and the adjoining door was being jiggled constantly. On Wednesday, my room internet stopped working. They continued to charge me $9.95 everyday for the service. Even though the hotel had other rooms available they would not move me. I finally gave up waiting for the hotel to do something and checked out on Friday.. walked several blocks and checked into the Fairmont. I would not recommend this hotel for business travelers. Privacy and having reliable access to the internet are too important to compromise.

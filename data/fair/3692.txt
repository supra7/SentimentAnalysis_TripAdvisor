the hotel is super nice location is excellent rooms are awesome everything about the hotel is super nice except for the people that work there i mean i reserved a suite so when the day came to check in they told me the hotel was completely full and that it will take a little time to get my suite clean up! so it took 4 to 5 hours for them to clean the suite really? and when i asked they would just be completely rude! also the air conditioner doesn't get too cold! i didn't like the customer service at all deff not going back there i rather stay at the ritz carlto or jw marriot.

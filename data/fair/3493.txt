We arrived on Dec 23rd and checked in with no major problems. I was actually surprised that the room was pretty big. We booked a king size bed and we chose room with a bath. Since we had friends coming over we really did not spend much time there. When we got back the room spelled like a cigarette smoke and my partner went to change it, it was 1am and I really wanted to sleep. They offered us room next to our on the 16th floor, I did not like it, because it was smaller, but after checking out two more rooms we stayed there. The other rooms as well smelled like cigarette smoke and the floors were more dirty compare to our 16th floor. The heat did not want to work for us and he wind was blowing and the windows did not seal, so we had kind of chilly night. At least the water was warm in the morning. I was thinking to change the room, but I had no energy to do so. We needed the internet, the connetion promised was boradband, but the speed was a snail one and luckly the charge for it was taken of the bill. Next dissappointment happen on Boxing Day when we order a room service for breakfast and it did not arrive and the reception was looking ofr excuses instead of taking care of it. We were very happy with concierge and bellboys.

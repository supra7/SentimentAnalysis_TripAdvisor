If you dont expect much, this is the place for you. Very old complex. Needs some serious update. I kinda knew what I was booking myself into. I just needed a place to relax for a night. But it was one of the worst nights I ever had. Appearance was the first thing I noticed. Awful. I mean, its an old place, so what else is there to expect. Dingy carpet, smell of urine, moldy air conditioning, dirty walls and etc. Thank god I booked just one night. I would never return even if it was free.

I had stayed at this property many times over the years but not recently. The public areas are still impressive, but the parking has never been great; it has turned to awful. There was no place to park to register and the bellmen were rude in requesting that we move our vehicle. The card readers for actuating the gate to the parking area for which there is a hefty charge did not work. When returning to the desk to find out why, the bellman told me that the card readers hadn't worked for some time and that I needed to push the green button. Yet, there are no instructions that indicate such. The directions on exit were inaccurate (the West Exit Booth was not open and it was difficult to backup and exit). The parking charge was eventually comp'd, but not without considerable effort. The room rate came with a $25 Chevron Gas Card. No card was presented. The service at this property has definetly slipped. There are lots of other hotel choices in the airport area. The rate was $174and overpriced for the services. The checkout time of 1:00 p.m. is nice and the breakfast buffet remains excellent.

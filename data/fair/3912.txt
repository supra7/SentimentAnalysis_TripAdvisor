Don't know where to begin... The nasty disinfectant smell the permiates the entire hotel, including our room. So bad I went out and bought a scented candle to mask the smell. The place is a DUMP. Tired "hip" design that looked old and worn out. I can't beleive that Design Within Reach allows their name to be associated with this place. Mold growing in th shower. A sad dorm room fridge. The "hip" metal filing cabinet meant to be a dresser for your clothes... A sorry jumble of electrical cords all running over the bathroom sink which is in the room with the bed.... Brought back memories of youth hostels from my time as a student in Europe. Can't stress enough how bad this place was. Staff was pleasant enough with the exception of a surly old concierge how was a jerk and yelled at me when I called with a question about turn down service (which never did happen).

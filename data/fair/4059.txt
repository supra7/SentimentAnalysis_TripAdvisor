We previously enjoyed stays at the Wynn as a childless couple. Now that we have a little one we decided to go back and try Encore, which we thought would be newer and better. In addition to their regular resort fee, we were charged for items that would have been complimentary and free at other hotels for families. Roll Away bed - extra $50 per night Crib - another extra $50 a night A/C - Didn't work Humidifier - free but was loud like a motor boat, housekeeping came brought in another one that wasn't loud but didn't work either. Bathtub faucet leaked water all over the bathroom floor when we tried to bathe the kid. After one night at Encore we decided it was newer but far fro mbetter. The poor AC and loud humidifier made our stay very uncomfortable and baby kept waking up too. Next day we checked into Four Seasons bright and early, walked into a room and saw a beautiful full size crib perpped with fresh bedding and bumpers. There were baby wipes, baby shampoo, diapers and the whole suite was baby proofed! What a difference. Service was impeccable, Four Seasons took it an extra mile and prepared everything we didn't think of. We all slept like a baby.

IF you're going to go here for the LOCATION, be sure you are not on the west side of the bldg. There are two restaurant/bars where people congregate even after closing. Car alarms going off, people yelling etc...Just when you think you can get some sleep, delivery and trash trucks start about 7:00 a.m. let's not forget the people who are rummaging for bottles and cans. All the while your slider is open because it's too hot and there is no air conditioners in the rooms. We Paid $160 a night. After taxes and fees it ended being $200 a night. The staff at the desk said they could move us to another room but it would cost us another $80. HUH??? Great location on the beach, but the hotel doesn't even have blowdryers in the rooms. Rooms are very basic and you are asked to wash your own dishes. I should have listened to the other review about the rooms being stuffy and hot.

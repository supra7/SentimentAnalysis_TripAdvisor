Whatever plus points there might be about this hotel, they count for nothing when ongoing renovation at the hotel means that during our stay - and over the weekend - workman at times carried on drilling until 9.00pm and then started again at 6.00am with the noise reverberating loudly up to our 13th floor. To be fair, the manager did give us a $75.00 voucher to spend in the hotel on the night we complained at 9.00pm about the noise. However when the drilling commenced at 6.00am - yes 6.00 on a Saturday morning! - it seems they hadn't taken on board our concerns but simply tried to pay us off. When I asked to be moved I was told they were very sorry and I would be contacted later by the duty manager. I didn't hear from anyone after that. Don't stay until they've finished renovating!

We used this hotel just to stay for one night on our way to Tenn. First thing when I opened the door was a smell that about made me pass out. Smelled like a stinky armpit had been living in the thing for a few months!! Second was that out air condition was not on and ready for us to enter the room so it was hot and musty in there till it cooled off!! Last thing I want to do after driving many hours is lay in a hot stinky room!! Third there were someones nasty socks on the side of the bed when we walked in, where did they come from!! The remote was sticky too!! Yuck!! When the air finally cooled off and everyone was ready for bed it was ok!!

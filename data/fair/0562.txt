This is a remodeled 1920's hotel in the heart of Seattle. Great location, but the rooms are so small and confining that you have to be a person of smaller stature. We're both tall and over 200 lb, so bit of a challenge with suitcase storage, and general space! We had a king, and there was less that 18" between the edge of the bed and the wall. Thin walls. The bathroom - nice, but if you were in the Wizard of Oz as an extra Munchin - it'd be fine and spacious. Even with only one person in the room, it was confining. Also make sure you get a room on the street side as garbage trucks roll in about 3 am in the alley behind the hotel. High expections - but they werent met.

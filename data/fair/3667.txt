If you can get a deal on this hotel, it's not a bad choice. You'll feel like you're staying in the hotel because you got a deal, though. This hotel is much the worse for wear, especially when compared to the other Ws in town or in other cities. Beneath the veneer of decade-old hipness, it's clear this was a renovation of a much older hotel. Not much attention was put into details -- an air conditioning unit that looks and sounds like it belongs in a cheap Motel 6 from the mid-'80s was simply covered up with a box. The lighting's terrible, and the bulb in the flimsy lamp on our desk didn't work. While it's true the rooms are quite small, they are not as small as in other hotels in the city, like the Hudson. There's space to unfold a small carry-on rollaway on the floor but nothing larger. Having a shower rather than a bathtub is very disappointing when it's clear the bathroom's big enough for a simple tub. The one shelf in the bathroom was fixed at a slant, so nothing stayed on it. Bliss products are nice, but what's the point unless you can bathe with them? The location's okay, but for tourists interested in the Times Square scene it's a bit out of the way (on the other hand, being well away from Times Square can be a good thing).

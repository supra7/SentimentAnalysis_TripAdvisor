It is off the Strip and is a little old. The restaurant has limited items and the waitress who served us was bordering on rude, but the food was very good. While most of the breakfast was good, when I reached for a doughnut I found fruit flies climbing in or out of it. While the layout of the room was great, the tile in the shower was cracked and broken in one place. As a platinum member, I was asked if I wanted the space of a lower floor suite or a suite with a view on a higher floor. I chose the view and ended up with a suite that faced away from the Strip. For what I paid, I was expecting much more. Just a little disappointed I guess. I think this would be a great place to stay in if you are visiting Vegas on business.

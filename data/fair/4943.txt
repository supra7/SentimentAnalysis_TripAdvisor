My family stayed at the Affinia for 3 nights during our visit to Chicago and I must say that we were not pleased! I initially chose stay at the Affinia because of the good reviews , price and the nice photos on their website. The pictures online make the rooms look bright, clean and fresh. In reality the room we stayed in was dingy and smelt musky and mouldy. The first night when I lifted the comforter to get into the bed I noticed a large stain on the bed sheet. On the last day there while bathing my kids in the bathtub I notice that the water was slightly green and I had to immediately take my kids out. The people working at the front desk were not very friendly which didn't help in the aura of this experience either. Also- the parking is Valet here and is $48 a day here plus tips so it is very costly. I wouldn't recommend this hotel!

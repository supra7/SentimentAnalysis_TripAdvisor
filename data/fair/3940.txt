If you're into character and charm and wish to be located near Union Square, this is a good choice. The lobby and bar lounge feel of the re-modelled hotel are both quite good, and while the rooms are a bit small, the room on the seventh floor was quiet which was good. The room service food was also good. Where the hotel failed to impress was with the air conditioner being very old and loud, the room was unreasonably hot, and the bed was very uncomfortable. After a few nights there, i wish i would have chosen differently for a hotel stay, to get a better experience for the cost of the room. While the staff were friendly and amenable, Concierge assistance was not made available during the 5-night stay, and would have wanted to know about health club or gym access.

The service here is terrible, the pool is very crowded with limited pool chairs available. You must pay a resort fee but that does not allow you to sit on a chair at the beach. If you want a chair plan on paying for it. The food is okay but nothing fanastic the flank steak is extremely tough and chewy. If you are planning on a luau don't book it through the hotel as they don't provide you the right information and forget to tell you everything. At 6pm the pools closeup. The walls are paper thin and the maid service starts at 8am so don't plan on sleeping in. Checking in can and does take awhile, beware if you room is not ready when you arrive you maybe waiting several hours. The deluxe ocean view is a joke. We called room service for over 30 minutes and finally had to walk downstairs to the front desk to get our order in.

We returned this week from Spring Break at the Grand Wailea. This is our fourth trip in as many years. While the kids continue to love it, I confess I'm sick of the fact that, at every turn, I seem to be "nickled and dimed." There's the resort fee. The valet fee, and then the $35 a throw for beach umbrellas. I'd much (much!) rather pay an extra $100 (or more) a night than be nibbled to death. I can't help but to feel like a sucker everytime the hotel gets the better of me. Like many others have noted, service is on the decline. Staff was a bit thin, lines were long, and delays were the rule. Granted it was Spring Break, but the hotel knows this too and it didn't seem to do anything to take account of the extra population. One day our room wasn't made up (despite a call for housekeeping and a promise for correction), the bed's sheets had holes and don't get me started about the bizarre and irrationally enforced rules re: saving chairs at the pool. I also keep waiting for the hotel to get serious about the gym. Equipment is postively antiquated. If I had my druthers, I wouldn't go back. Gotta teach the kids to see through the flash/glitter and realize that Mommy and Daddy refuse to be taken any longer. The adjacent Four Seasons is far more elegant and service-oriented solution.

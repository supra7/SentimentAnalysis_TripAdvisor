Stayed at "The Peabody" over the 4th of July weekend after having visited the Memphis property several times...Memphis is truly an old world elegant experience. This is a "property out of control" trying to fill its 1600 rooms each night. Very nice rooms but the concierge was arrogant and unhelpful when asking what time an outdoor party would end on Saturday night. His answer was it would end when it ends. I asked him if things like that weren't scheduled and then asked to speak to the manager. While waiting on the manager, two "young adults" strolled through the lobby holding thier pants below their cheeks with their undergarmets showing! No one said a thing! When the manager arrived, I first asked what time the party would end and was advised 10PM...fine. I then asked if the hotel had any decency standards and was told there was "nothing he or anyone could do!" I told him I was dumb founded that a private organization couldn't require people in their public places to "pull up their pants!" The Memphis Peabody is so nice; but this Peabody demonstrated no concern as to the decorum and/or decency of those walking through their lobby. The rooms are extremely nice but the "guests" they will gladly welcome in order "to fill it up" are no more than 2-star! While walking in to the hotel, one individual overheard on a cell phone indicated that he was stopping by because he had heard that there was going to be a good party going on that evening....heard; not invited? And management doesn't care about your experience! Could never recommend and would never stay there again!

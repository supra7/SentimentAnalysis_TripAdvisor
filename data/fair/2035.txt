Decent enough hotel - location, rooms, bedding, TV, breakfast. The weakness is in the staff from rude (front desk, bellmen) to incompetent. Conceirge gave out incorrect information, took two hours to get bedding for a sofa bed, dinner trays left in the hall were not picked up by 9 the next morning - smelly, ugly sight. There is absolutely no excuse for a hotel to be run so poorly.

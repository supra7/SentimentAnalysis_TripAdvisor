Front desk staff was great and the location is good. However, the rooms were a huge disappointment. We moved after discovering mold and cigarette smoke in the first room. The second room had mold in the bathroom and large brownish red stains on the sheets, lampshades and drapes. This hotel desperately needs to be remodeled. We sent a letter to the management company and have yet to receive a response.

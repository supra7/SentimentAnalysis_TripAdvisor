We were put in this hotel when the conference hotel filled up and couldn't accommodate us. We stayed on one additional night and were shocked to learn that the charge for that night was $486! What did we get for that charge? Not much! Parking was an additional $29/day. Wi-fi was an additional $10/day. Local calls were $1 each. Rooms were comparable to our later stay at Ayres Hotel (at less than 1/3 the price!) in terms of room size and furniture. There was no turn-down service; only one robe in the room; towels were well worn and there was only one towel per person. I had to use the same towel to dry my long hair and my body. The toiletries were "Ritz Carlton" and not special. The shower was very weak and we had to call for service since the tub faucet shot water sideways, causing a wet floor. The carpet was very dirty. The dining room prices were outrageous! Finally, the hotel puts blankets on top of the mattress (under the bottom sheet) which get bunched up during sleep resulting in a lumpy bed. Both my husband and I woke up with sinus reactions leading me to believe that dust mites are a big problem. Frankly, I wouldn't pay $150 a night to stay in this hotel. There are simply too many other, good options in the immediate area.

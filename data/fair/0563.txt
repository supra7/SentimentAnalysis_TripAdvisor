Read positive reviews online of Hotel Max and was excited to stay at a funky, centrally-located, upscale(ish) hotel. I reserved a room with two queen beds (visited for two nights with my sister) and got a better rate by pre-paying (about $160-$170/night) a couple of months in advance. Of course, this didn't cover the parking (they only do valet) which was an extra $30/day or internet access ($12/day). I know this is typical in large cities, but it doesn't make it any easier to swallow. Once you factor in all of the misc. taxes, you're well over $200/night even when you've gotten a "deal." I might not have minded if the rooms were worth it, but our room was TINY. I could barely find a place for my suitcase. There wasn't even a chair, just two queen beds and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was even worse. -A small stand-up shower and a sink that was not even big enough to wash your face in. What's more, you had to step up to get inside, and there wasn't room to move once you did. I mentioned this upon check-out and was told that a room with a tub and shower (i.e., larger bathroom) could be requested if I ever were to return (not likely). The room also did not seem very clean, the street traffic was very noisy and the 'mini bar' items looked like they were 50 years old. The location was decent, though I'm not sure you could walk to the Space Needle (we didn't have time to find out). We enjoyed Seattle but would definitely recommend that folks look into other hotel options, or at least make sure you get a room with a 'real' bathroom!!!

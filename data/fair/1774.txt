The property we stayed in (a 3 bed unit) was dated; the kitchen equipment was totally inadequate. The air-conditioning was not working (fixed on the 4th day of our stay). There were seven burnt light bulbs, which made to apartment feel dark most of the time. Light is a real issue in these apartments, with very little natural day light on one side as well as inadequately serviced lighting. Access to the apartments is from lobbies that are open to the elements. Two of the bedrooms windows look onto this area, which because it is set back is very dark - you also have to keep the blinds shut all the time because of privacy. Furthermore, there was a constant level of noise that emanated from the traffic from the highway. The security is clearly non existence as anyone can drive into the complex - during our two weeks stay I only was only stopped asked for resident information. Because of this, you constantly see various people wondering around the lobbies posting flyers for the numerous pizza take away companies. The pool is well kept and there was plenty of sun beds, however the water is not heated. For the third week of our vacation, we decided to change accommodation and found an apartment in a much better resort that cost less and was truly superior in every way.

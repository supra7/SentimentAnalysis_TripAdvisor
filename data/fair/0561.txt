I would not recommend this hotel. When we checked in the lady behind the counter was not friendly-we were excited because it was for my daughters b-day. The rooms are SO small-I noticed a $75 charge on my credit card when I called the Hotel 4 times the front desk lady kept transferring me to the Manager who NEVER got back to me. The 5th time I called I was told that the $75 was a deposit for incidentals and that I shouldn't be charged. I wish they would've explained this on checking in to the hotel.

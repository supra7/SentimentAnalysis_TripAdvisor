The hotel is nicer than expected but the staff are very unfriendly ESPECIALLY Manny at the front desk. My husband is a platinum member of Coast and stays at their hotels minimum 100 days out of the year so he's a pretty good judge of customer service or lack of in this hotel. Manny is hostile and defensive to guests, (we saw how he talked to other guests at the desk.) On the upside it it is good value, clean and updated rooms. Just don't expect that warm friendly feeling from the staff. My husband will be switching hotels after this stay as we felt the service or lack of was so bad.

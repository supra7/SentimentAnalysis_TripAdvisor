hotel was dirty! used condoms next to night stand, broken sink stopper in sink, and in bathtub. $25 to park and you can not get your car until you check out. valet driver pulled my car out of the parking garage like a mad man. i will not stay at this hotel ever again! this is the first time in years that i did not stay at a hampton inn so i guess im use to every thing working and being clean with free parking.

Pros: Beds are very comfortable, great location, and Starbucks is next door. Cons: Rooms and bathrooms are extremely small. Similiar to cruise ship size rooms. The elevators could hold no more than four adults, and even four is pushing it. The ventilation in the room was horrible. It was either to hot or to cold. We could never get it to a comfortable tempature.

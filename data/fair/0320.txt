Be sure to verify reservations before arrival, fortunately we did. Even though we made ours on their website and were given a confirmation number, they had no record. When we first entered our room there was a very musty smell. Then we were surprised at how stained the carpet was. The furniture was all chipped and worn, the walls definitely needed painted. When we entered the little bathroom the paint peeling from the ceiling was quite obvious. I sprayed perfume in the room so we could stand to stay there. The one bed was apparent that most people slept on the left side, you rolled that way. I did bring it to the attention of the front desk and he said we could move the next day. The next morning while my husband was showering, he came out very unhappy. The obvious peeling paint was from the tub above our room, as it drained cold water on his head. We were then transfered to another room that wasn't much cleaner. When you opened the bathroom door it only opened half way as it got caught on the floor. Big tripping hazard. Will never stay there again. Spend a little more on another place, it will be well worth it. This place is WAY over priced and very unkept. Erga in the lounge was great though.

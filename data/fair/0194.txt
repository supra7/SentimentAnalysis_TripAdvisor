Wow, their are so many positive reviews, sadly my experience was quite the opposite,here goes... 1. To begin with $30 parking fee - No issues paying it, BUT, if I am paying I expect to be able to park there! We were there on a Saturday and there was an event so the hotel opens up the parkade to daily parkers in addition to hotel guests. Due to this we could not find any parking after going in circles for 15-20mins. We let the valet know the situation and they said they would take the car for us which helped at that time. We did speak to the manager about this and about the parkade safety since they had cars all over the place including on the ramp (which was a major safety hazard since we almost got hit twice ) The manager waived our parking fees and gave us the whole I understand speech (that is why I rated the hotel 2 stars, the customer service shown by the manager) 2. The beds in this hotel were by far horrible, for lack of a better word the beds were ``springy`` I have stayed at other Marriotts but never had beds like this. To boot the pillows were very very hard. Did not get a good night sleep at all! 3. The hot tub jets were not working and the front desk claimed to not have known about this, which was odd since there was a sign stating that they did not work. Spoke to a housekeeping employee and they mentioned that the hot tub had been like that for sometime. Overall it was a horrible experience and I would never stay here again.

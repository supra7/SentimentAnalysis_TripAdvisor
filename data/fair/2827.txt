If you are looking for a high-quality, hassle free luxury family experience, keep driving past the Grand Wailea. The place is oversized, impersonal and overrated. We were told that the water feature at the Grand Wailea was not to be missed if you have children, so we booked a couple of nights there during our trip to Maui. Our room, by no means the least expensive, smelled of mildew and mold and was outdated and small. The bathroom was antiquated with none of the conveniences you would expect at a 4 star resort. But let's assume that the room quality didn't matter because your intention was to be at the beach or "water park." Well, those were a let down, too. The pool was so crowded, you could see oil from people's sunblock and beach debris in it. The lines for the slide, water elevator and rope swing were long and not worth waiting for. And forget about finding a chair, much less one in the shade. The lounge chairs were packed in rows, with people crowded together, their towels and magazines all over the place. And there were no pool attendants in site to assist. The cost of a Diet Coke? $7.50! So... we moved to the beach where we found much of the same. The Grand Wailea reminded me of Disneyland on a filled-to-capacity day. Some people swear by it, but for our famiy, we'll stick to something a little more upscale, service-oriented and serene.

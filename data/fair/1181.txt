We just came back from 5 nights of stay at this resort. All I can tell you we will never ever go back there. The food and service was below average. I got sick there and spent 2 days in bed throwing up!! This resort is nothing as they advertise and brag about. There are flies all around the food in their restaurants and especially around their breakfast buffet food selection!!! Although they claime they have 7 restaurants, they all share the same kitchen and the food tastes the same in all 7!!! The only nice thing about this place is the kids acitivities and the rivers around the hotel. The ocean is dirty and the entire time we were there not one person was in it.

After having stayed at many Westins, I decided to check out the hype of the "W" properties. While it certainly looked "cool" and the room had some cool amenities like an iPod dock, there was really nothing else to distinguish it from a run of the mill 2-3 star place. Certainly not worth the 4 star price. What particularly annoyed me was that I needed to wait for long periods every time I went to the front desk. There were never enough people working there, even at predictably busy times (like check-out). It's close to the subway.

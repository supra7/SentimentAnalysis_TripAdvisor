Good : The Soniat House is a nice example of historic New Orleans architecture. The doormen and waiters are extremely friendly. The hotel is conveniently located in the French Quarter. Bad : The rooms are a bit dingy. They could use an interior decorator and a paint job. The AC unit in our room was very loud during our stay (but essential in the New Orleans heat). The breakfast (two biscuits,coffee, and OJ) is a joke at almost $13 per person, and at these rates, it should ABSOLUTELY be included in the price of the room. The $15 surcharge for a bucket of ice is even more ridiculous. I walked around the corner and bought bags of ice from a local grocer during my stay. Sometimes the doorman was hard to locate when I wanted to either park my car or get it out of the garage. There are no in room safes. The closets in my room both times I have stayed here were small. The cortyard is ok, but I have seen much nicer (and better kept) at other places I have stayed in New Orleans. All in all, you will get much more bang for your buck at other hotels in the French Quarter (Monteleone, Royal Sonesta, and a myriad of other places.). The bottom line is that the Soniat House would be a decent place to stay at much reduced rates. I would look elsewhere for accomodations in New Orleans.

The W hotel is another botique hotel with small rooms and cool bars. The staff is pleasant but hard to understand a simple problem. For example, the presence of a street fair closing Lex and the difficulty in locating the Hotel on 49th.Tthere is no signage to speak of on 49th and the Hotel is between 49 and 50th, not 48th as the concierge told us as we circled in heavy traffic. The doormen also who were needed to valet the car were also in front of the hotel out of view. This created a situation where we parked our car in another garage and had to have the Hotel move it to their lot. To their credit they did deduct the cost of the lot from our room before we left. The small room ( we had the King size bed) is clean the bathroom too small for two people to occupy and the T.V cable reception was pitiful. The A.C. was all too effective and louder than the T.V. when it kicked on, but did I mention the location? Walking distance to everything on Fifth and the Hotel Bar and Lobby were also very Metropolitan, so all in all a good weekend get away was had even if the hotel was just okay.

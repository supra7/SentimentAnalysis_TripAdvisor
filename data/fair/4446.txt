I have stayed at Westin hotels in other cities and was very satisfied. However, I was somewhat disappointed with my San Diego experience. The "Heavenly" bed was far from heavenly, and I actually started experiencing low back pain from sleeping on it. Also, the pipes in the bathroom were so loud that whenever my next-door neighbor used the restroom, it sounded like I had a fire alarm going off in my room....I actually even poked my head into the hallway the first time to make sure that I wasn't supposed to evacuate. On top of that, the dining opportunities were minimal, there was no mini-bar, and the lobby furniture was worn and tattered. Though it was a decent rate because I was attending a conference...it was still over-priced for the experience.

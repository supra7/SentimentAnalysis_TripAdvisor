American Flophouse: is a place that offers expensive lodging, generally by providing only minimal services. Couple this with the fact the Commander Hotel has no affiliation with the local BBB and a no refund policy, it supports the label of an American Flophouse. Very little available parking on the premises, worn out furniture and beds, and nappy carpet. Soap dispensers on the wall, rationed toilet paper and tissues. The Commander Hotel once represented the standard of a non-chain hotel on the boardwalk. Now it represents the Motel standard on the boardwalk. This hotel puts too much emphasis on youre paying for the privilege to see the ocean and uses this as an excuse for charging high rates for a worn out room. The last time I looked at the ocean from the Commander, I noticed there were a lot of other rooms up and down the boardwalk. I recommend you check out some of these rooms and respective rates and you will be surprised what you get for your hard earned dollar.

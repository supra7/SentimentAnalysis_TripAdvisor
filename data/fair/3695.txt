They lured us in with a one night stay with a 150 dollar spa credit deal for 269 dollars a night. I feel like my wife and I did not get what we paid for in value at this spa. 25 dollars for pleasant smelling massage oil each person? The two massages ended up being almost 400 bucks. Not even the Ritz Carlton charges that. 20% automatic tip? What if someone wasn't happy? They would still have to pay that? By the time we had one dinner there and we both had a massage the total bill was almost 900 dollars. When they brought my car around they had parked it next to a reclaimed nasty water sprinkler and it dried on my car. They made no effort to do anything about it. Nice hotel with neat rooms but beware of the bait and switch method there at this place.

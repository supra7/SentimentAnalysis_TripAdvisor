I have stayed at this property 20 or so times in the past 15 years since its opening. For the adult luxury traveler looking for service and sophistication this property is not for you. The service is poor, the housekeeping is poor and the property is CROWEDED and overrun with kids!!! Now, if your a family and that's your thing, you'll enjoy the property. The pools are fantastic and that is the appeal for families. My problem is that there was a time in the early 90's that this property catered a high-end guest and that kept the occupancies and crowds to a minimum. Then the infamous KSL hotel holding group bought it for a song in the late 90's and with a "heads in beds" attitude sucked the life out of this beautiful place. KSL destroyed the flavor of the grand. Anyways, Hilton bought it earlier this year and might improve things but as of late Sept nothing has changed yet. Go stay at the Fairmont Kei Lanai or the Four Season next door...you'll thank me.

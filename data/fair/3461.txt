The hotel staff were fantastic... AS I said the STAFF.. Assistant Front desk Manager "Dana" Was completely unprofessional... I had arrived on a Thursday night and ALL day Friday we had gone exploring the city! It was a beautiful city but when we returned and we (my travel partner and I) assured that our DND was on the door... When we returned to the room, a housekeeper attendant had gone into the room without anyones permission and didn't even give proper cleaning service... She/He replenished just THREE face towels, they took two used glasses flipped them upside down and had them as if they were fresh and clean on the dresser! Disgusting! I had accidentally left my safe in my room open, one of my rings went missing... I had immediately requested for a manager to come to the room ASAP... It took them 30 minutes to respond... They sent me a young child that had again no professionalism in her and she was playing with her hair while she was "struggling" to answer my questions... Housekeeping manager was called up the day after, applied a smoking fee to my room when we hadn't even smoked in there... Was very rude and although there are more details, I won't bore anyone... I work in a hotel, and no policies and protocal... I definitely intend on returning to NYC as it's a beautiful city but most definitely DO NOT intend on EVER returning back to this hotel.... Mind you again, the staff are super sweet! the management? The owner needs to re-evaluate who he/she hires to represent them! I rate employees @ 5 star, great job... Miguel the door man was FANTASTIC... The management, extremely poor! My ring was never retrieved, found, nor did anyone contact me to inform me on the status and how the investigation went! It was a family heirloom! Very devastating!

The hotel itself was OK. The staff was terrible. Upon checking in I inquired about breakfast and was told that there was not a free breakfast even though as part of my Gold Elite benefits it was supposed to be. On Saturday when we were getting ready to leave I asked for a late checkout of 2P (not very late) and without even checking was told that they could not accomodate my request.

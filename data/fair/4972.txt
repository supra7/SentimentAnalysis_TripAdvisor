The hotel, although obiviously vintage, has a great location but is showing its age. The room we had was very dated with a king size bed that was in very poor shape. The amenities in the room were damaged and the hair dryer was broken, which we all know was the major issue prior to getting ready for a night out! The hotel has a nice bar and dining area, but the lobby is cramped and frustrating. I hope you dont have a family of five that wants to travel up the elevator together... you will need two trips. The front desk staff was not plesant and very short in their abiltiy to carry on a conversation. The best I can say about this hotel is that it offers you a nice location and a good place to have a drink after shopping all day.

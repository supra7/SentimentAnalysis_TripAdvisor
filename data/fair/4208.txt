I wish I could have given this hotel a higher rating because there were a lot of things that I enjoyed about it, but there were also a lot of negatives too. The Positive: This hotel is generally clean, has nice staff, free internet, free parking, and I like that all of the rooms have an ocean view with a balcony. The Negative: Location: If you are visiting Ocean City because you want to enjoy the boardwalk then this hotel is not for you, especially if you are not keen on walking a lot. This hotel is all the way at the end of the boardwalk and is pretty far from even the first boardwalk restaurant. The main amusements will take you at least 15-20 minutes to walk to. There is a tram so the location is ok if you want to be on the less crowded quieter end of the beach, but you will need to pay $3 per person each way on the tram to get to the other end. Loud, Because of the gaps under the doors joining the rooms you will hear everything everyone says in the room next door. I was woken up by talking in the next room every single day of our trip. I could hear everything they talked about like they were sitting right next to me, and i'm sure they heard me as well. Uncomfortable Beds, I have been to so many hotels in my life, and I have never encountered a bed that was so uncomfortable that I lost sleep over it, until I came to this hotel. My boyfriend thought the beds were fine, but I just couldn't fall asleep in them. They have weird bumps that dig into your back that kept me tossing and turning every night. Also the blankets are made of some cheap felt like material that had my scratching myself all night long.

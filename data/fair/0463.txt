I called the hotel directly to make the reservation and discussed the fact we would need a room for four of us, two adults and two pre-teens. I specifically requested guarantee for late arrival. Our flight was delayed and we arrived in the middle of the night. At first the desk clerk said they didn't have a room for us at all. Then he found one for us. When we went up to the room we found that it had one bed. We waited quite a while for a rollaway from housekeeping. The next day we had to pack up and leave our bags to be moved while we were sightseeing, and did get a room with two beds. The rooms were dusty and not oversized. On the upside, the views were nice. Members of the wait staff in the lobby restaurant were very friendly and helpful at breakfast and tried to cheer up four jet-lagged, grumpy Midwesterners.

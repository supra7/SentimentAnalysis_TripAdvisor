We stayed in The Lenox for three nights and what we saw completely contradicts many of the reviews on this site. Let me put it this way, the bathroom was so small that you had to maneuver onto the toilet to avoid injury and hitting the wall. The reviews that say you can hear EVERYTHING from your neighbors are spot on. Happy to be back home where sleep is possible.

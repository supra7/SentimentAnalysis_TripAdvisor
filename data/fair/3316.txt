The good things about this hotel is that it about this hotel are the location which is right between Jackson Square and Bourbon Street and that it was clean. However, for $230 a night I expected a nice bed, TV, light etc. I havent stayed anywhere else in New Orleans, so I dont know how it compares to other hotels in the area price and quality wise, but I can tell you that Im used to spending $70-100 a night and getting a much nicer room. First off, the lock on the door is key only and there is no key for the deadbolt. When I entered my room it had no windows and had a low ceiling. We turned on all three lights in the room but it was still so dark that it would be hard to read or really see what youre doing when youre packing your bag etc. The desk was old and scratched, and the TV and alarm clock were at least 15 years old. The TV was 15 CRT with a faded picture. The bathroom was also dimly lit and the faucets make a train whistle sound when you turn them on. Where was my wife supposed to put her make-up on? Are we supposed to travel with flashlights when we go to a hotel?

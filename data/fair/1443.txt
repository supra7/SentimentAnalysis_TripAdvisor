Small but clean room with full size bed (we requested Queen or King) . No hot water after 9am during our stay. Our sink was round ten inch pot almost too small to shave in without splashing everywhere. Gym hot and airless and half the equipment was out of order. Not well equipped anyway. No tea in the room and staff was unable to locate any but never got back to tell us that. Coffee machine and microwave in the room. Safe was on the floor and free standing so not especially safe. Breakfast is complimentary which is good because I wouldn't have paid for it. We prepaid so no refund when we left early to go to another hotel. But we were happy to move to a nicer place.

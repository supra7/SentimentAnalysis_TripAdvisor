Its not 4 star hotel, maybe 2 or 3 star. Worst thing was dirty floors and walls and cleaners didnt change dirty towels or sheets. Poolarea was dirty too (we was there only one time). Breakfast was ok, but Indian customers (families) was very noisy. Location of the hotel was quite bad, metrostations are far away (always have to take a taxi). It was still moneyworthy (9 nights/380).

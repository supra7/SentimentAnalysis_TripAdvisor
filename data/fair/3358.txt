I just stayed at the Frenchmen with my boyfriend, and several other family members also had rooms there. This place is decent by day; cute old house on a hip street known for great music, the rooms were nothing special but had period furniture and an authentic feel, the shower was literally a stand-up stall but it is New Orleans, we didn't plan to spend too much time in our room other than sleeping. Therein lies the problem. A new club has evidently opened within the past month DIRECTLY across the street from this old house converted into a hotel. I would not wish the sleep experience we had there on my worst enemy. At about 12 every night, this HORRIBLE music began. It wasn't jazz, it wasn't rock, I couldn't discern vocals, and there was no break - i.e, it wasn't songs just loud, horrible ongoing music!!!! Like a marching band. It was so loud that things in our room were vibrating - no lie. I tried earplugs, pillows on my head, turning the fan on - this club (VASO was the name) was unbearable. Sunday Vaso was closed - however the room (101) was still quite really noisy. You could hear the front door slamming all night, and folks coming home after a night out. Icing on the cake is the bed we nicknamed the "half-pipe" - it was so overly soft that we rolled into the middle. Not nice. So, my suggestion is if you are planning on staying out until 3 or 4 a.m., go ahead and stay here. Otherwise, DO NOT STAY HERE until they tell you that Vaso has been shut down. It is well worth the extra money to actually be able to sleep more than a few hours a night. Finally, the day clerk, Keesha, was really helpul, lovely and kind but the night clerk couldn't be bothered to even give us the time of day or get us towels.

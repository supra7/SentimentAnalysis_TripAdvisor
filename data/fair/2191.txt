We booked the Park Plaza Boston Hotel and Towers weeks in advance and paid 106.00 a night for a 'European' room which turned out to be very small and shabby and there was absolutely nowhere to hang any clothes so we had to live out of suitcases for three days. We asked to be moved but were told the hotel was full and no further action was taken by the staff to remedy the situation. Also the fire alarm went off in the early hours of two of the nights (false alarm) and this appears to be a frequent and ongoing problem. The third night we had to be up early anyway to catch flights! Staff are on the whole friendly and the location is quite good, only minutes from Boston Common and also the underground station (Arlington). If we stayed in Boston again we would definitely choose an alternative hotel.

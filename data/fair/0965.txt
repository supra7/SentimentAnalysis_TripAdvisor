I surprised my husband with an extra night in Maui, by booking an oceanfront room for our first night there. After the long trip over, we couldn't wait to get to our room. I was so excited to surprise him. Oceanfront, King bed, paying $300 + for one night, you'd expect something nice. To my chagrin, we had 2 double beds. The room was dated. I called and there were no other rooms available with the view (which was great) with a king bed. We decided to keep the room and went to dinner. Upon return we went to shower, and the bathtub was dirty. After seeing that, I looked at the toilet and found hair and urine around it. I called the front desk, who sent a cleaning person to clean. (This is now 7:30 Hawaiian time) She came, cleaned the tub but not the toilet. I called again (I NEVER DO THIS) and asked for the manager to come look.Instead she sent housekeeping and the cleaning person (probably at least 60 years old)and another man whose position wasn't disclosed. I showed them and was told that the dirt was probably stains. I was never approached by anyone to resolve this. Instead we were told that there were 5 weddings there that evening and the next evening. Since I PAID IN ADVANCE some weeks prior, I don't believe they cared what they gave us. THIS IS THE MOST DISAPPOINTED I HAVE EVER BEEN, AND WAS A TERRIBLE BEGINNING TO OUR TWO WEEK STAY. I do want to add that the valet personnel were exceptional, friendly, and accommodating, the best part of the stay.

I stayed at the W New York for 4 nights after Christmas 2005. The hotel itself (or what I saw of it) was pretty nice, I thought. Not super hip, but definitely nice and comfy. The trouble is that place is just not managed properly. I booked a king bed room online, but when I showed up they gave me a queen. (Call and confirm!) I had to go to the trouble of printing out my reservation ($4.50 to use their computers!) to straighten it out, which I had no time to do for 2 days. Meantime, my girlfriend got bedbug bites from the queen they gave us! They did eventually compensate us for all that, though -- $100 towards the restaurant and room service. (Though even that was sort of a pain to get out of them.) The king room we finally got was excellent -- spacious, and with a proper tub. (I recommend the king rooms over the queens at all costs.) The place could be terrific if it were managed properly.

Booked a Concierge Club Suite. Was meeting son's fiance for first time and wanted space for visiting and also for entertaining in the Club Lounge. Very disappointed to find that the Club Lounge was on the 27th Floor of the North Tower and my room was on the 28th Floor of the South Tower. It was a long distance between my room and the Club room. Could not believe the Club Lounge was so far from Concierge Suite! The snacks provided in the Club room were also very disappointing - cheese and crackers in evening and we walked out after checking out the breakfast -- a couple of slices of cantaloupe and some very unappetizing looking small muffins. Also we very disappointed to find my room at far end of dark hall next to an extremely noisy ice machine. Also the doors on this floor of hotel all had to be slammed to close -- this loud bang going on all through the night. The keycard was a problem and had to be changed twice. It was a problem everytime tried to open door. Learned it had to be slid in and out four time before it would "connect" and open the door. It is unnerving to be in room at far end of dark hall, alone, and have trouble getting into your room each time. Also disappointing was the fact that was charged $12.95 a day for internet connection. No hot water one morning - but everyone in this area of hotel was given a coupon for one free drink. This is an old hotel - geared for large conferences - lots of problems - did not seem Starwood quality at all!

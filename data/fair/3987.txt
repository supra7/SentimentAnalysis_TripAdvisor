Lobby very nice....hotel is a dump. Aside from the lobby which is pretty funky and very nice(only because they want to draw the bar crowd) the rest of the hotel is a dump. Someone got the bright idea to take either an old motel or old apartment building, paint EVERYTHING purple, shrink the tv, and stock it with REALLY CHEAP Ikea looking furniture. I've stayed at boutique hotels before in San Fran and NYC (The W) and was very impressed so I was expecting the same. Along with everything above the lobby level being crappy, the views out of most windows consist of looking directly at other room's fire escapes. We had been staying at the Park 55 around the corner and moved to the The Clift because of reviews we had read but checked out and back into the Park 55 first thing the next morning. If you are looking for a retro feeling dump filled with 21-25 year old trendy peeps dressed in all black from NYC.....AND....you want to pay too much....then this is the hotel for you. I WILL SAY that the valets and doormen were very very helpful and on the ball (even though they look like secret service that takes themselves too seriously.) If you want a boutique hotel in San Fran go to The W. The Park 55 was very nice too.

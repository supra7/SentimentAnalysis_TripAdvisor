I was very disapponted with this Ritz. Seriously, it should not be called a Ritz and it's definitely not a 5 star hotel. The rooms were horriblly out-dated; the curtains had holes in them. They had no cover on the comforter - disgusting. We checked with housekeeping to see if they forgot to put it on and they said no that's the way they do it...they put a blanket on top of the comforter but no cover. Oh, the TV was literally from 1970; it is seriously the oldest TV I've ever seen in a hotel...it was ancient. The service was average, nothing special. The grounds were big but again nothing out of this world. The pricing of food, etc. was ridiculous and the food was bland. At a buffet, they mis-labeled a meat as beef and I ate it but we later found out is was PORK - which I do not eat for religious purposes. I was very angry obviously. They apologized but that's it; you would think they would comp a meal for such a serious error, especially for a five star hotel. Anyway, there are a lot better hotels in Maui - avoid this one. Oh, the location is not great - it is kind of in the middle of nowhere. If you like more action then again do not stay here.

Being a Starwood member and having stayed at this property twice before, we were extremely disappointed and felt "duped" by the outrageous rate of $439 per night, not including a room tax of 9.25% per night, a 4.16% sales tax per night AND a resort fee of $26.04 per night. All this for a DELUXE OCEAN VIEW room on the third floor overlooking Whaler's Village rooftops and indeed listening to trucks backing up on the street below. It was impossible to enjoy our "private lanai," basically a small balcony with two chairs, because of the noise. After waiting until 4:15 pm to check in to the room, we were horrified, but remained polite in calling the front desk and subsequently speaking to the manager on duty, to try to get a room change. Nothing could be done. We asked that they keep us in mind if a room should open up during the five night stay. We left a message with the manager two days later and never received a follow up call. The concierge we asked to make dinner reservations wasted no time in trying to get us to consider a timeshare presentation. At that point we were never going to stay at a Westin again! The poolside food service was grumpy, the breakfast buffet overpriced. We did learn by accident that we could request an ocean view for breakfast and that was a delight. We stayed mid-February. Had it not been for the whales and the weather, the money we spent would have proven to be an even bigger disappointment!

This hotel was clean and nice. However, we would have been much better off to just stay on the edge of Boston and ride the T for our exploring. As with many downtown hotels in major cities, the rooms were definitely small. The bed was very comfortable. The TV appeared to be a 36 or 40 inch flat screen. The bathroom was VERY small but nice. The hotel was located near good shopping and restaurants, but not much else of interest in the area.

okay that headline is pretty tacky but oh so true! lol upon arrival i was greeted outside by a couple who were waiting for the police as they said there wallet was stolen right out of their room...i didnt bring anything valuable that i would leave in the room, as i had heard there is a problem with pick pocketers on bourbon..our room was just okay, the hotel itself was pretty run down...the staff were semi friendly...that said we wouldnt stay there again, the area is really run down & the people loitering outside were pretty scary...i say spend a little bit extra to get a better New Orleans experience, good luck travelers :o)

We spent two nights here for part of our honeymoon, and we could not wait to leave. The best part of the trip was the room upgrade; we were also given a bottle of champagne. The rooms are clean and nicely furnished. The hotel has an elaborate pool area that makes it very popular for families, so don't expect a romantic experience. If you like walking the beach in Waikiki, with hotels jammed up against each other and people everywhere, then you may like the beach in Ka'anapali. We drove past the Ritz Carlton in Kapalua, and the area was much more secluded. We also spent two nights in quiet Hana, and cannot wait to return. So it all depends on the kind of trip you are looking for.

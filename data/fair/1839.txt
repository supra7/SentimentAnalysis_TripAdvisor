Hotel was nice looking on the outside. The inside smelled like a mausoleum and the pool was DISGUSTING, there was junk floating around inside of it and it looked like it hadn't been maintained in a long time. The beds were very small and and the pillows were lumpy. Our comforter also had a blood stain on it. This is NOT a 4-star hotel, we have stayed in Holiday Inns WAY nicer than this place.

This used to be my favorite hotel in Chicago. However some recent stays with some issues has caused me to change my thoughts. You can't beat the location just a few blocks off Michigan Ave. Right across the street is a Jewel/Osco grocery store. Tons of restaurant options and the Red Line EL stop is right outside the front doors. They've also done some remodeling with new carpet and wallpaper in the hallways. Plus they've installed 37" HDTVs in the rooms. However all they have is standard definition, and it looks bad. Plus the AC/heating units are showing their age. It's hard to maintain a comfortable temperature plus they are extremely loud. Plus the internet (both wired and wireless) was down. The front desk didn't apologize and said it would be fixed in a few days. Lastly getting our room serviced was an issue a couple of times even though we were gone by 9am and didn't return until late.

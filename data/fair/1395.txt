...and I'm NOT sensitive towards noise. The hotel is located right next to / under the Manhattan bridge and in the daytime every 4 minute a train runs by and the building is almost shaking. Add to this the terrible and constant smell of fish in Chinatown and you definitely do not have a boutique hotel experience! I haven't lived other places in New York, but compared to the experiences of friends and family, I would say that you are better of choosing a more centrally located hotel - the few extra dollars will be well spend. The upside of Hotel 91 is that it's clean, has comfortable beds and a nice clean, spacious bathroom.

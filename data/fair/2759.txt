After being closed for two years, it is wonderful to have the Grande Dame and the Swans back, but why oh why did they use IKEA-looking outdoor furniture in some of the forest areas? Metal at the Bel Air? Why did they ruin the bar with vile modern art that looks like Aaron Bros? Why does the patio have ugly metal fire lamps that don't give out heat? Why are the guest rooms black and white (with some pink, thank God) looking like the Viceroy Hotels? The dining room is way too small, and the outdoor patio is way too big with wasted space. The service and food are excellent. But how sad that they blew the decor everywhere.

We stayed at the White Hall Inn and had problems with the AC, plumbing issues that I would liken to Old Faithful and our friends who were booked for a king size bed got a full size. While at breakfast, we overheard several other guests complain about similar problems. Management refused to do anything other than comp the breakfast, which they did a lot that morning.

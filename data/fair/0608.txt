I expected more from a higher-end hotel. I have traveled extensively with my husband on business and leisure and this hotel was a disappointment. From the parking fee, to getting our name wrong the reservation, to parking under a tree (for a fee!) that wept all over my car, to the small details like charges for internet use (usually free in other hotels) and just two creamers for 3 cups of coffee... all added up to a one-time stay. We will not repeat the experience and will look for other accommodations for our all-too-precious time together.

What a disaster. I spend about 150 nights a year in hotel rooms & I am used to being treated as a valued customer in the various hotels I visit whether for the first time or for a return stay. This hotel, while it's supposed to be a top notch venue, falls way short. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS! They gouge you every chance they get, for example, I need to refrigerate some medication. Until I complained to the G.M. of the hotel, they wanted to charge me $40.00 PER NIGHT for a refrigerator in my room. The staff were arrogant, they couldn't be bothered with my needs. They stood around joking with each other rather than take care of guests who were waiting to check in or check out. Yes, there were a few people on their staff who were great; the doorman;the bellstaff;the houskeepers, but they were the few. All in all - GO TO MARRIOTT, THEY TREAT YOU RIGHT!

Hi, I stayed in Hotel Diva for 4 ngts. Its a budget hotel in afantastic city but I wish i had paid the extra and booked another hotel in Union Square. I was deceived by the good reviews and its website when deciding which hotel to book. Its in a really good location in San Francisco..the cable car on Powell St is literally 10mins walk & the main shopping area is only 5 mins walk where u find all the high designer boutiques, Saks 5th Ave, Macy's and more. The downside of the location is there is a Jazzbar next door located above a fast food place- its really loud!! If your a night owl & enjoy going out late in the evening then its fine...but not if u invest most of your energy sight seeing & shopping during the day. The check in was very fast and staff overall are friendly. They are happy to assist in anyway possible. The room is OK but not what I expected. It has creeky floor boards, thin doors/ walls and basically looks like someone's rented a room out in their flat. The decor is OK but has strange metal chest of draws. The bed is not that comfortable, mattress very soft and dipping in the middle. It is clean and the staff do a fine job of making the rooms up each day. If u do decide to stay in this hotel, ask fir a room away from the road..every night i can hear traffic, sirens, people singing and shouting. My husband & I werent impressed with this hotel. Despite the lack of sleep, we still had the energy to get up & spend time sight seeing.

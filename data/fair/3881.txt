we booked a king room but all that was availabe was a double. the room was clean, however we did not have HBO in the room. the shower head seemed really low, we had to bend down to use it. The worse part was hearing everything in the room above us, we were in room 202. If I stayed here again, I would want a room on the fourth floor.

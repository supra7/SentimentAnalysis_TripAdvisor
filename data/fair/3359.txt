My boyfriend and I stayed @ The Frenchman for 5 days @ New Year's Eve. The room was dirty and lacking in basic maintenance. I reserved and pre paid for a loft bedroom not the single queen. It costs more, but I liked the layout of the room. When I arrived they said it was taken, but offered me a double queen, no additional costs. I didn't need 2 beds and didn't care if the price was the same. Additionally, everyone in the hotel had dogs that barked late into the night. Staff was nice, but for the price of $150 a night, definitely not worth it.

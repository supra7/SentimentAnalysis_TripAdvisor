I was really looking forward to my stay in this hotel, and am just not impressed, considering their typical rates. Luckily I had a conference discount so I didn't pay an outrageous rate - but I was still expecting a certain level of quality. What was good: 1) The view - even in a standard room, beyond the humongous Dole shipments, there's a peek at the bay, which is wonderful. 2) They have a UPS store in the hotel, which was a lifesaver since I have no car 3) It appears to be a pretty convenient location - not far from the airport, easy/safe to walk around 4) Clean rooms What was bad: 1) I am thoroughly disappointed in the room service. I sincerely felt like they had cheaped out on the food, which again, from an "upscale" hotel, I was not expecting this. The first night, it was a bento box whose largest portion of the box contained nothing but cherry tomatoes. It had about an inch of hummus (no exaggeration!), two pieces of chicken kabob, and a small salad. I was starving and had to run down and get a snack just to fill myself up. Tonight I decided to give up on being healthy so I ordered the pizza from downstairs. The chicken was barely on the pizza, and the cheese was absolutely terrible. 2) The rooms and bathrooms are okay, but again - i've seen much nicer in less expensive hotels 3) The shampoo/conditioner they provided actually dried my hair out - which has never happened! I always use the hotel shampoo and conditioner, even if i'm in a cheaper hotel - and have never had a problem with it. My hair is brittle and dry thanks to the hotel amenities! Considering how many hotels are in this area - I would recommend looking for another one, that might be less expensive and may have better services.

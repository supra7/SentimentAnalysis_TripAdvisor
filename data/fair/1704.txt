this hotel advertise parking but they only have 5 parking spaces so there is never any available the closest parking is a 10 min walk away which is pay and display 20p for 17 mins max of 2 hours which is also not good. The room was extremly small and when we complained about the parking to reception he carried on like we was lucky to be staying at the hotel ?? over all room was clean but to small and double bed was also small, toliet and shower in one but was tiny i would not stay at this hotel again not worth the money or the hassle

The hotel is an easy walk to the Convention center via Freeway park. Lovely beds and bedding, quiet despite being located in a hospital district, courteous and helpful staff, but overall disappointing in room appointments, and valet parking was a whopping $35 per night tax included, even for guests staying 5 nights. (Non-valet parking really isn't an option in this area). Historical status aside, the rooms and furniture are in need of some TLC. Our room varied in rate from $279 to $379 per night for a "suite" that was cramped on closet and bathroom space for two business travellers. We were left feeling more ripped off than pampered for the price. The Sorrento could really be something with the right attention to detail and value. They would do well to pay attention to the rooms and service available at other "vintage" hotels such as the Sutton Place Hotel in Vancouver BC and the Davenport Hotel in Spokane.

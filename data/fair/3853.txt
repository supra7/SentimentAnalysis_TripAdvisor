This is a beautiful location at a compromise. We stayed in the Executive suite room. The neighbors on all three sides were audible. It was disturbing to hear the upstairs occupants walk the length of their room at night. When we stay in a hotel quiet only comes second to the bed comfort and luxury. Unfortunately, this hotel left much to be desired. The bed was too firm and pillows too large and hard. The bed sheets were very scratchy and stiff. The brunch/breakfast was completely inedible. The pre-made "omelet" was a salty nightmare, the waffles were rubbery under the heat lamp, and the fruit was fermented and soggy. For a hotel with only 4 levels (including the garage) the elevator was excruciatingly slow, at least the stairs were somewhat accessible. The hotel does not even come close to having the right number of bike for it's occupants to rent. The only redeeming quality of such an over priced hotel was the friendly staff. Needless to say we will not be returning.

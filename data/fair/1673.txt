For a hotel that is classed as four star, it is such a shame that it does not live up to its name...there is no 'great' about it. Firstly, the two positives about the hotel......the location is great, (being only a couple of minutes walk to the Central Railway Station, a ten minute walk to Crown St in Surrey Hills and a short jog to the Botanical Gardens and the Opera House) and the reception staff were generally very helpful. Now the negatives.....the room we stayed in was tiny, the smell of sewerage wafted from the bathroom pipes, there was no view whatsever, the alarm clock and fridge had to be turned off due to the noise coming from them and the furniture looked as though it had been purchased from a garage sale in the 1970's. The worst aspect of the hotel was the noise levels....we couldnt hear any traffic noise, however, on the first day there were renovations being carried out and from 7.30am each morning all we could hear were the cleaners/ cleaning managers talking on their walkie talkies. Our room was also right across from the office of the person in charge of the cleaners, therefore we had constant background noise of people talking, people being interviewed etc. I would not recommend staying here unless you check out the room first or you are only concerned about location. Four stars.....I'm not sure about that!!

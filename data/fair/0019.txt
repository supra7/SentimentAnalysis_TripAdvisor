Sorry we stayed here. Wish we had stayed at another hotel. We would have paid more for a better one. One of the things that was upsetting was that we had a rental car which we had to pay to park at $30 per night. The rooms were old and dank. Prices at the restaurant were high and so we went out to other restaurants.

Having stayed at The Grand Wailea previously (about 5 years ago - good experience), we were excited to return with our 2 1/2 yr old son. Needless to say, it was disappointing. The main attraction is the pool and slides. While we enjoyed that aspect, the grounds and pool need some overdue maintenance and attention. Management should take a dip and go down the slides and floating river (trash and missing tiles on the slides). The hotel is incredibly large (700+ rooms) so be prepared for long distance from your room to meals, etc. Also, meal prices will compare to Disneyland - they're high and it's difficult to go anywhere else. The rooms are okay, but again need attention. Between the pool / rooms / mediocre service / and public areas, the hotel just looked a bit tired and unkept. Given the prices and amenities, we'll opt to try The Four Seasons Wailea on our next visit (next door to The Grand Wailea).

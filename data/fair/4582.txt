Not worth it Stayed in December, 2003 for the Honolulu Marathon. The room left much to be desired. It was small, dark, and very moldy with old peeling wallpaper. Frankly, the room felt like a dumpy motel. However, the beach is fantastic, and the reserved lounge chairs with towels, umbrellas, and food service were a nice luxury that we took advantage of daily. The outdoor bar at night with the music and cocktails is also wonderful. All-in-all I have to say that for the cost of a luxury resort, I expect my room to be acceptable. I wouldn't stay again.

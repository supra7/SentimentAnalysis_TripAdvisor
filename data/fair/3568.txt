It all started when I walked by three employees upon entering the hotel and was greeted by the welcome sign projected on the floor-not the employees. The receptionist seemed to be in a bad mood and not very helpful at all. When leaving our bags, we were pointed to the "end of the front desk" and waited for several minutes before getting helped. The gentlemen helping with my bags, when they did arrive, were very nice and helpful. Later in the day, we asked if there was wireless in the room, I was told there was only a cable internet service available. This seemed odd to me, and a big disappointment since I was planning to work out of my room. I decided to use the hotel's business center for internet service, very expensive printing but at least the service is provided. When I returned to my room and got back on my lap top, I noticed that there was wireless available after all! How does the front desk not know the type of internet provided! As other reviews indicate, the room is small and the air conditioning unit is super loud. Even when I tried to turn the a/c off completely, the fan was still working and kept me up most of the night. However, the bed is very comfortable. For two people, the queen size room is WAY too small! Nothing that is really W's fault, but no AMC out of the 40+ channels they provide! Missed Mad Men, but that's a personal complaint. No complaints on the bathroom, it was clean, plenty of bath products and towels were provided. An extra towel request took about 15 minutes. Don't get me started on the sensor in room food, the sign is not very clear at all and I am sure causes a head ache for many guests. Overall, I would recommend the lobby if you want to hang out and get a drink and then go check in to another local hotel nearby, plenty of options in the area!

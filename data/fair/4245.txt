Basically, a subpar hotel compared to the other hotels I've stayed at in Ocean City. The room we stayed at had 2 beds and a kitchen. We wanted a kitchen cause we wanted to be able to cook there. The kitchen looked kinda like a bathroom. It's not as clean and neat looking as one would have expected. I suspected there are some hidden pests there judging from the looks of the cabinets inside. We stayed for two days and it was good enough for our needs. It's not waterfront but it's not that far away from the boardwalk either. There were a bunch of us sharing the room but sleeping wasn't a problem since there were a lot of other couches. We had a balcony, which is where we basically spent most of our time while at the hotel. The room inside does not look welcoming at all, like it's such an old and unkempt place. Overall, it was ok and tolerable for a two night stay especially because it's the cheapest one we've found on a short notice.

This hotel was OK, just OK. The scenery is nice. They have swans on the grownds, and a bunch of exotic birds. Be careful, they are currently doing construction in the hallways, and you will smell paint thinner, spackle, paint, etc, and see large equipment outside your door if you go there now. This is not acceptable. I am only giving them the 2 stars because of the nice birds. They were full when I got there, so they didn't really care about me since I am only a gold member. This hotel is not recommended. I was just there on my honeymoon, and you can get a better value at one of the hotels next door. Feel free to contact me for recommendations based on what your interests are. Also breakfast was included, but the tip wasn't. They're not as good as starwood or hilton. I just found that distasteful since we paid so much for the room. The beach chairs on the ocean aren't even included, you must reserve them. The beach in front of the hotel has rough water. Do not swim there, walk 1/2 mile on a path to the real beach at Whalers Village, or stay at the Sheraton 1/2 mile away on a beautiful private beach.

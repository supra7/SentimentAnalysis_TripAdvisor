Would NOT stay here again. Filthy rooms...carpet was dirty and had not been vaccuumed for quite a while. Nasties clung to my feet after I took a shower and walked across the carpet and got in bed. The room smelled an awful funk when we arrived, nauseatingly so; very noisy throughout the night from both upstairs and in the same hall. The bathroom tile floor had not been mopped upon arrival...dirty spots on floor. Disgusting. Cleaning lady was a grouch and would not move her cart for us to go around in hallway. The only pluses were continental breakfast in the a.m., an airport shuttle, and Ruby Tuesday restaurant across the parking lot. Did not feel safe here AT ALL. Would never stay in this dump again!

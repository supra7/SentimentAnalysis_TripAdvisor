I stayed here for 4 nights in May and was so excited to stay at the Ritz. My excitement didn't last too long. Though the check-in process was smooth and everyone was friendly, all I had to do was walk down the hallways for the disappointment to set in. The baseboards were scratched, the wallpaper was coming off, the upholstery on the benches were stained, the carpet was worn. Not what I would expect in a $500+/night hotel! Then I got to the room...the linens were MAYBE 200 thread count. The matresses were uncomfortable. The furniture was possibly stylish in the '80s. I was actually surprised that a TV that old had a remote control. The carpets were stained, the iron was a $10 model. I honestly felt like I was staying at a Marriott or something--except that Marriott hotels are usually near civilization. The Ritz, however, is far away from everything except golf courses. Even the beach is a walk. It rained most of our stay, but the pool and grounds did look quite nice. There was bocce, tennis courts and, of course, golf. Room service rates are insane (as expected), but there is a nice General Store just beyond the parking lot. Bottom line: stay elsewhere--even if you get a great rate--until they remodel and it becomes a TRUE 5-star property.

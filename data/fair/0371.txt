It took over 1 hour, 2 follow-up calls and an angry appearance in front of the front desk clerk (he has a European accent with a very condescending attitude) for a repairman to show up and fix a broken AC. After assuring us that the AC has been fixed, we spent the entire night in a virtual sauna. My wife and I ended up sleeping outside - in the small balcony, to be awakened every other hour by a freight train. Then the following day, the toilet stopped flushing. Rather than disturbing the hotel staff from their hubris, I fixed the toilet myself. It now works. Overall, the room has a musty odor and it looks like the cleaning staff failed to remove remnants from tne previous occupants - there were dirty glasses and napkins in the sink when we came in. This hotel just made my list of worst places to stay. Mercifully, we stayed only 1 night.

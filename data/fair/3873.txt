After a great 3 nights at the Embassy Suites in LA, we were rather disappointed with how outdated and in need of refurbishing this hotel was. Our first room wasn't all that clean on checking in, so we asked for another suite. The staff were accommodating, but the second suite, although cleaner, had the surface of the shower stall flaking off and some mould. The most disappointing aspect though was the fold-out sofa bed. Very hard to sleep when you have metal rails or whatever sticking into your back all night long. We cut our stay short at this hotel, and wouldn't go back there. The one positive was ample parking.

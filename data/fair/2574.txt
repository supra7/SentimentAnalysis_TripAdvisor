I guess I was expecting a well designed luxurious hotel. The service was good, but there were some very frustrating factors. Our room was as big as a closet. Really!!! It was about 12ft X 14ft with a full bed, a tv stand, a desk (with chair), and 2 night stands. Not much room in there. THe second most frustrating thing was experienced by all who stay there. The first 8 floors of the hotel are actually used up by buisiness people, weddings, etc... This causes an unbelievable elevator jam. We waited 18 min. one night to catch an elevator and go to dinner. I heard many others complaining about the same thing. Actually, it was usually the topic of conversation while waiting fo elevators. This one killed me. The fitness area is an extra charge to hotel guests!!!!!! They want to charge you $10.00 a day extra when you enter the fitness area. You can use the pool free of charge, which is very small for a hotel that size. Finally, I really did expect CHicago to be expensive, but the hotel eateries and bars are unbelievable at $6.00 for domestic draft beer and $8.50 dollars for a mixed drink, not to mention the bar staff was a very rude bunch. I will not stay at the Palmer House Hilton the next time I go to Chicago.

I just came back from an extended weekend stay and wanted everyone to be aware of the pros and cons of staying here. Needless to say, the valet parking is big problem but there are others. I've tried to summarize the likes and dislikes below. Pros: 1. The hotel is very nice and rooms are clean and comfortable. We especially love the mountains of pillows! 2. If you're staying at rooms facing towards Disney, you'll get a nice view of the Disney fireworks at night. 3. There are two nice restaurants within the hotel - the B-line diner and the posh Dux restaurant. More on this later. 4. Proximity to I-drive a great Chinese restaurant called Ming's Court. I've dine at alot of great Chinese restaurants in NYC's Chinatown and Hong Kong and this one ranks near the top. Cons: 1. Nickel and diming! We were charged a $10 per night resort (service fee) for wireless and pool access, 2 bottles of water and I-trolley vouchers. To add insult to injury, we were also taxed on the $10 per day fee! 2. No shuttle service to the theme parks so we spent alot of money on Mears shuttle service. Expect to pay $10 RT per person to Disney parks and $14 RT per person to Universal Orlando/IOA. 3. Construction next door. The Peabody is expanding so there will be alot of construction going on until 2010. Be warned! 4. Restaurants in hotel are expensive! At the less expensive B-diner, it's $3.50 for one plain bagel with butter or cream cheese and $3.75 for cup of yoghurt you can get at Shoprite for 50 cents! Outrageous! We ended up walking the 5 minutes to have breakfast at Denny's. All in all, our stay is pleasant but we wish we had booked at the Crowne Plaza or some other hotel with free shuttle service instead.

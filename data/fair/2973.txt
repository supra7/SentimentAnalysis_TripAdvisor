My husband and I stayed at the Ritz in Kapalua for part of our honeymoon. I have to say we were very disappointed. The hotel itself and the grounds are beautiful, but we felt the service was very poor. The front desk staff made us feel like they thought they were better than us, when in actuality they should have been servicing us and making us feel like kings and queens, especially at the prices we were paying! The other guests also seemed to be pretty uppity and not at all friendly. The most annoying part of our stay was our inability to use the pool area because it is situated in some sort of wind tunnel. People lounging by the pool were often wrapped up in their big white Ritz-Carlton towels trying to keep from freezing to death from the onslaught of the deafening wind. We tried on several occasions to use the pool area, but everytime was the same. The beach, which was within walking distance, suffered the same problem of rough winds and, thus, rough currents. If you want to escape the winds you need to drive to the beaches further south on Maui, so I would recommend just staying at a hotel down there. With so many beautiful hotels and resorts to choose from in Hawaii, you'd be better off choosing a hotel that will provide you with better service.

Great Location! The gates make me feel safer! You can't beat the location of Becks, in the heart of gay San Francisco. The price was reasonable considering the pricing of other hotels in the area. Yes, there is a new gate that locks but that keeps someone from off the street from just walking up and breaking into a room. I have stayed here many times and I felt safer with the locked gates. It is true that on the weekend, people staying there are partying and cruising. Its a GAY NEIGHBORHOOD for Christs sake. It has always been like that. Overall, my stay was ok. The couch needed cleaning. There was no airconditioning in the room I stayed in and it happened to be a hot week in SF. The staff werent overly friendly but no real problems. If you want to stay somewhere cheap, in the heart of gay SF, and maybe cruise a little at night, then stay at Becks. Otherwise, stay somewhere else and stop complaining about how bad Becks is. It has always been bad.

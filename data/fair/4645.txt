I got my wife to agree to stay at this hotel due to the fact that I got a rate of $63 per night. If you are an airline employee they give you this rate with ID. I could not find any other rate close to this! We already used our Hhonors points for a full week at the Hilton Waikalea on the Big Island. The Hilton on Maui wanted over 70k points per night! Sure the two hotels were night and day. We were on a tight budget, and the cost for three nights here was equivalent to one night to the next competitor! I was prepared for the worst. My wife's family owned a one star family hotel in Idaho as a kid so she was open minded. I read the reviews and thought this could not be that bad for $63 a night! The grounds are actually well kept. The pool could use some resurfacing. The location is great, right on the beach. We stayed in the garden room as we read that the beachside rooms were noisy due to the road traffic and the ocean. I would not have minded the ocean, but the road traffic may not have been good. I did not have any problem with the room per say. However, my wife wanted our daughter to keep her shoes on in the room at first. The carpet could have been steam cleaned. There are three locks on each door, and look pretty well used. This is a hotel I would love to own! All it really needs is to have the rooms redone with new carpet, paint, furniture, doors, and the bathrooms completely renovated. The staff does not put on a happy face for you. So, to answer your question,...For $63 it is a good deal. If you have to spend $99+ , you might want to check into a renting someone's condo on Craigslist or elsewhere! Here are my photos.

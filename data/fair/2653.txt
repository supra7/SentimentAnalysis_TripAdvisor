It is a Hilton. It is clean. The rooms are nice. The view is nice. The pool is nice. Its right in the middle of Daytona beach..... there again nice. But...... the neighborhood gets down right scarey at night. If you have kids I would not let them roam around at night alone. Also, in our room we they had a double door that conected to the next room. I guess to make a suite. The sound proofing was like zero so we got to listen to the couple next door fight and cuss at each other. So much for a romantic get away. Also the valet people move your car to the north valet at night so you have to hike it back and forth to find your car. The room service girl had gold teeth..... guess it fits with the urban theme. Front desk people were nice. For the money try the Hilton in Clearwater Beach. Much nicer.

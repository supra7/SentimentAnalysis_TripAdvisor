I stayed at this hotel for business and I'm really glad I wasn't paying for it. The public areas are nice. The rooms are not good. They need to be redone. Mine was tiny with a really old-fashioned bathroom. On the plus side (looking at the other reviews) I saw no bugs or vermin! I ordered room service and it was mediocre at best. I definitely would not recommend this hotel.

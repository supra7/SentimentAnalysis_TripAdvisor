This is the first hotel I stayed at during my vaca in Maui. I opted for the oceanview room which is $40-50 more than the standard rooms (which are located across the street from the ocean). The good - You can hear ocean waves at night while you sleep -- even with the sliding door closed. - Parking is free and there's a lot right next to the oceanview/oceanfront hotel rooms. - There are two, nice small private beaches. There are about three old lounge chairs strewn about. So if they're not taken, you can relax on the beach, which is quiet as long as the waves drown out traffic from the nearby road. - The room has a fridge and coffee maker. - The hotel hosts a luau throughout the week. It is smaller and less fancy (and albeit less expensive) than other luaus in Maui. But it is convenient to just walk across the street rather than driving to Lahaina or another hotel. During the luau you can make your own lei and there are other kid-friendly activities. The food leaves a lot to be desired, but the entertainers are fun and you can tell a lot of them are related. It's truly a family affair. The bad - The room is out of date and not really worth the price (definitely not a resort). - I was shocked to find ants living it up in and around the sink in my bathroom. - The room didn't really scream cleanliness and relaxation. I wore my flip flops all the time and even TP'd the toilet seat. - The shower pressure was sub par. All in all, if you're traveling during the off-season, I'd recommend staying at another hotel. There are more to choose from in Maui than you'd think.

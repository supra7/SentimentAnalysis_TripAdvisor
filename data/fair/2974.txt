I've never stayed at a Ritz before, but have stayed at Four Seasons, and I guess I was expecting that type of service. Yes, the check-in was great and the people at the concierge desk were helpful, but the staff was not overly friendly. Very few "alohas" when out and about on the resort. No tropical garden areas, minimal vegetation. The pool area is very windy, which is evidenced by the plastic shields strategically placed around the area. The beach is a 5 minute walk away and small. Cocktail service at both locations is poor. The rooms were a bit shabby and definitely need to be updated. Mini-bugs were everywhere and the towels were very thin. I'm sure there are worse places to stay, but if you are looking for a luxury Ritz-Carlton experience, this is certainly not it. Hope to hear of a renovation real soon!

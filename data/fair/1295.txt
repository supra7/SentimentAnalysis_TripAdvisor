We stayed here one night due to its location to the train station so we could travel home.... The rooms ate basic but clean, the biggest problem with this building is the noise. There is a fire station and major bus route outside, and whenever a bus waits at the lights (3-5mins) the noise is so loud even the loudest headphones don't block out the sound. The air con didn't work, neither did a lift. Worst night sleep.

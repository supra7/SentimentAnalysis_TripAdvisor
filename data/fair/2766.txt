This hotel didn't work out for us. It was clean, well maintained, front desk was helpful and the location is terrific, even though it is not walking distance to a beach. The problems we had were with the air conditioner and with folks in the next room sleeping out on the lanai. In most of Hawaii, we often don't need airconditioning where the trade winds are cooling. However, if you've ever been to Lahaina, you realize quickly that it gets very hot. Being located in the heart of the city doesn't make this location cooler. So you will use the window unit. That's would be ok, except that it works by cooling for about 3-5 minutes then clanking off extremely loudly. Kept us awake most of the night. Also, like a reviewer wrote a while back, it has a motion detector feature where it gets very hot in the room while you are asleep (at least it stops clanking), so you wake up sweating, get up and move around, and then the cooling, clanking begins again. In the room next to ours, they moved a roll-away bed out to the lanai and slept there. We thought maybe the hotel didn't know about it...no, the next morning we sat out on our lanai, the rollaway bed sitting unmade next to our lanai. During the day, the maids made up the bed--outside ready for the next night. The roll-away thing might have been ok if we'd paid hostel prices, but at $150 we're not expecting bunking outside! The air conditioner is a deal breaker for us no matter what, because if we can't sleep, there's no point period. We really wanted to like this hotel, it's got so much going for it.

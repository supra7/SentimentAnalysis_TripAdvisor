Our overall experience at the Grand Wailea was okay, but not as expected for a five star luxury resort. When we made our reservations, we asked for and were guaranteed high speed internet access by the person making the reservation. We subsequently booked two rooms for four nights with the fifth night free. Upon our arrival we were greeted with fresh leis and taken to our room. The actual hotel itself, as we walked to our rooms was in need of some cosmetic repair, paint, cracks, etc. not something you would expect from a five star resort.The high speed internet that was guaranteed at the time of reservations was now no longer avail. They said all of their terminals had been checked out.The standard room sizes are nicely sized and the bathroom has a very large shower, tub and dual sinks.During our stay the mini bar in one of the rooms did not work and one of the toilets broke. The tile in the shower looked liked it could have been cleaned a little better.The hotel has its own television channel promoting their restaurants. We saw a dish we really liked and went to the specific restaurant to try it out. After sitting down we did not see the item on the menu, and asked the waiter. He said the video we watched was three years old and the items we saw on the menu has since changed. Again, not something we would expect from a five star hotel.The pools at the hotel are expansive and very cool. The beach is located right in front of the hotel which is also a plus. Would we stay at this hotel again ? probably not.

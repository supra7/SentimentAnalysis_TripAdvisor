I stayed at this hotel for 5 days to attend a professional course. I counted at least 13 problems during this time. The main issues dealt with so many extra charges and poor maintenance. Examples are: hot, stuffy halls; conference rooms were freezing; dirty windows; bird poo on outdoor table and chairs, etc. The best part is its location -- on the beach and near most everything. Howvever, the numerous issues made stay not worth the money charged.

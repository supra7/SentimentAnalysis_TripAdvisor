The hotel is in a good location, right across from the Public Gardens. They advertise and charge like they are a luxury hotel, but believe me, there is no luxury here. Rooms vary, I had a big room with windows that open but the smallest bathroom ever. One tiny little shelf to put your stuff on and had to close the door to be in there. My room also had a pull out sofa (with a big stain on it) so I guess if you are bringing the kids, $259 wouldn't be that bad. TV didn't work, light bulbs out, nasty carpet. Good breakfast though. Also be aware that the charge for overnight parking is $38 per night!

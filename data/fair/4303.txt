Booked this hotel from Amex.com, it said this hotel is 3.5 stars. Comparing this to other 3.5 stars, it doesnt match the standard. The kitchen was clean, however the bedroom was not satisfactory. Bed was not in great condition. The bathroom was too cramped. Top of the tower restaurant didnt accomodate walk-in even though there were 8-10 empty tables.

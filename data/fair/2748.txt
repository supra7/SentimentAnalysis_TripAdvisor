I stayed at this place with my family for two nights 12/24 ~ 12/26/09. My main issue with the place: it is dirty! The carpet looks dirty and worn out. I found hairs on the sheet and the blanket. The towels smell bad. I am a loyal Marriott member and normally stay with Marriott property at least 20 nights per year. This property is probably the worst I have ever seen. I understrand some places may be old or outdated, but I cannot tolerate dirty places. I have other issues with this property. The pullout sofa bed is very soft and uncomfortable. Breakfast runs low on food. On my second day there were no yogurt or bagel. The only plus side is the staff. They are very friendly and nice.

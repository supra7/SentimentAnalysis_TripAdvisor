Went for New Year's eve. Hilton Diamond member. Hotel is decorated very nice. However the customer service was terrible. 1) Extra rollaway bed was placed outside of our room. Upon going to dinner, asked to have it placed inside and set up and to refresh towels. Return 2 hours later. Rollaway was placed inside room, still standing on end and wrapped up. No towels. Had to inquire again. 2) Restaurant service - non-existent. Drinks made wrong. Can't find waiter. Excalate to manager. 3) Private party on 4th flr resulting in ALL people to have room key shown at elevator (to prevent non-Palmer-House guests from crashing party). Requires ALL guests to go to reservation desk to get keys for all people in family. Huh? One private party inconveniences ALL guests at hotel? Whose idea was this??????? Escalate to Manager 4) General questions to employees - met with general responses. Overall perception of unwillingness to help. Valet parking service confusing - took 3 people to finally explain the different drop-off / pick-up location/process. General - rooms very small. Fitness Center is excellent. Good location. Valet parking at $55/day. Extremely disappointed. Easily the worst customer-service experience I had at an upscale Hilton hotel.

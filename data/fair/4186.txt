the hotel is very bad... room was small - smells yakki - dirty bath - the worst view ever from the window - poor breakfast. the hotel located in Laleli ( wholesaler Market) where you should buy minimum 5 pieces of the same dress!! and most guests were Russian merchants. Our stay in istanbul was 6 nights & we where obliged to stay 2 nights until we moved to another hotel. i have been there once and my advise is: find another hotel.

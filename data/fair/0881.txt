The hyatt should be ashamed of this property. It's very old and run down. Despite many calls to the hotel prior to arrival, they never once mentioned the construction that was taking place. The entire lobby view is covered with scaffolding and beige tarps. Our ocean view room had a view of the scaffolding and the huge grey tarps at the front of the hotel. Our room was dark and dirty, with huge wood chips cut out of the doors, tons of bird droppings on the lanai, and a mystery substance stuck onto the sliding doors. We also had to wait for almost an hour at check in (after 4pm) and then waited for another 30 minutes for bad food at the pool restaurant. There was one day that we had to call for our room to be cleaned after returning in the very late afternoon. The only reason I gave this hotel two stars was because my kids had great fun in the pool. The toddler area was great for our four year old. We could sit and enjoy our drinks while watching our kids safely. However, we were only approached ONCE in three days for poolside service. We had to go get our drinks/food. There were so many people in the pool area that I felt like we were competing for space. We weren't the only unhappy people. I've never seen so many people complaining or unhappy at a hotel in a beautiful area. We checked out early and will never be back. Go to the Grand Wailea, Four Seasons, or some other resort. Very disappointing.

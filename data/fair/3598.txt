I stayed at the W on Lexington last night and actually got used to the small rooms. They reminded me of Europe rooms and although they're a bit too modern for my taste (I prefer the Westin), it was still fine. This morning, after my shower, I was greeted by the largest cockroach I've ever seen (and I lived in South Florida for 4 years) as it scurried right past my feet in the bathroom. I ran into the bedroom to pull my suitcase off the floor and onto the bed so he wouldn't climb in and figured the bug had run into a corner and wouldn't be back. Well, about 5 minutes later the same cockroach comes running toward me in the bathroom again! I managed to flip the opaque trash bucket on top of the roach. I finished getting ready and when I mentioned the incident to the front desk (and how it was still there under the trash bucket), all I received was an "I'm sorry"--no explanation, nothing. Needless to say, even though my work is keeping me in the city another night, I went a block and checked into the Doubletree. It was a much lower rate (even as a walk-in) and the rooms are more comfortable and the staff so far is very friendly.

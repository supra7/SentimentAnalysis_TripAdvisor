As someone who enjoys historic hotels, I found the San Carlos to be a major disappointment. The hotel does have some interesting copper-plated elevator doors, but other than that I really saw very little in the way of historic charm or original detail. The public areas are fairly nondescript and do almost nothing to recall the hotels heyday. I had no major complaints about my room itself, though the bathroom was quite small and the shower had a little sign about unpredictable hot water. I realize that some quirks are inevitable with historic buildings, this is really more a question of deferred maintenance and the hotels misplaced priorities. The best things I can say about the San Carlos are (1) the staff were reasonably friendly, (2) there is small outdoor pool that was a nice surprise, and (3) the downtown location was very convenient for walking to the Convention Center. However, downtown Phoenix is quiet at night, with only a sprinkling of shops and restaurants. People coming for a vacation would probably be better-served by staying in one of the more lively resort areas.

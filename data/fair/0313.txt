I stayed at the Sixth Avenue last night. The checkout clerk was very friendly with a great smile. Location turned out to be very good--I could walk to make the meetings I had, no problem. They charge $10 for parking, which I wasn't expecting (I'd called and they said they had parking, but didn't indicate at an additional fee). The bed was hard, not particularly comfortable. I couldn't get the Wi-Fi to work, though didn't ask for help--but this was frustrating. Checkout was effortless. Overall, I found the room imminently forgettable, but adequate for the purpose.

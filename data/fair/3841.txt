I suspect that it would be easier to write a review if we had stayed for only one or two nights, but we were there for 2 weeks. The location is great, it's close to bus and trolley stops and there are a lot of fabulous dining choices in the area. The front desk staff is also very friendly. The rooms are average. The couch and bed were both extremely uncomfortable which gets miserable after 2 weeks. The breakfast is all white processed stuff - bagels, bread, two kinds of cereal and sugary pastries and donuts. I imagine that we could have sucked it up for a couple of days but that too got tired after two weeks. I would have loved a piece of cheese or yogurt. A couple of morning we went to a nearby restaurant for breakfast. Overall, it's okay but no, I wouldn't stay there again, especially after I learned how easy it is to get around San Diego!

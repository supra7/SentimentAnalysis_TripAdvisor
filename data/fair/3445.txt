stayed here for 4 nights recently in march.dreary is the word i would use and paid 149 per night per room.there was a party two nights in the cupboard next door . never got to meet reception staff as they are behind glass at reception. lots of locks everywhere which adds to the hostel type experience. breakfast was in a little room in basement with paper cups and plates and consisted of coffee and pastry.reception staff helpful when i rang about anything and doorman friendly but overall we were glad to leave.i would say pretty tacky for the price.

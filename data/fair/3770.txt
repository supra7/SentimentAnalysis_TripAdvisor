This resort has the potential to be nice, but fell short in many areas. We were here this week during busy spring break, and I will try to avoid that in the future. First, you had to get in line to enter the pool area about 45 minutes before it opened. Any later than that and you would not get a chair anywhere. Then once the oasis pool opened, people literally RAN to get seats. If you didn't wait in line, well you were out of luck...no seat anywhere all day. Top it off with ragged tiny towels and absolutely dirty, brown chairs...well best to just spend your time standing in the wave pool. Kids enjoyed the lazy river, but your were tube to tube with hundreds of other people floating! Room was big and adequate, but smelled musty and old. Property overall was dingy and unkempt. Needs a major $$ upgrade and all staff should make a trip to a nice resort a la disney or something to understand what quality, cleanliness and service are all about. Staff ALL are a bunch of college kids and under 21s. Food was totally mediocre and expensive by the pool. Better to pay the extra money and go to Biltmore or another quality resort unless you just have a big batch of young kids/toddlers who just want to sit in the wave pool all day.

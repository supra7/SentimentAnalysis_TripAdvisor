I was sorely disappointed in my two night stay at the Arizona Grand Hotel. The first room we were shown had been left open, smelled like cigarette smoke and the living room light bulb way on the counter. The hotel quickly accommodated us in a second room that smelled vaguely like vomit. Ugh. Neither remote worked for the television, there was no channel guide, the extra pillow didn't have a pillow case and the bathroom garbage can was dirty. And that was just the first hour! The second day we were very disappointed to find the water park over run and no available seating to be found within an hour of opening. Disheartening when that is part of the reason for the trip. This was my third stay at the resort and will be my last.

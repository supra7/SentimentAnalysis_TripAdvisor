I stayed at the Seattle Westin for two nights in Seattle. The property is of typical Westin quality. It had a great bed, amazing views and a convenient location. However, I once again felt sort of screwed by the Westin's policy towards people who redeem reward points. The hotel is now a non-smoking facility. However, it obviously wan't always this way. I can't remember in which tower we stayed or on what floor, but I believe it was around the 21st. While I our room was nice, it has a DISGUSTING SMOKE SMELL. In fact, I sometimes smoke and was offended by the smell of the room. Of course, nothing else was available, so we had to deal with it. We bought some candles at Bed, Bath & Beyond and the management did send up an industrial air-scrubber, which worked pretty well while it was there. Once it was gone, it was back to that awful smoke smell. I understand that Starwood is in business to make money, but it's really embarrassing to put patrons in that room in that condition. I would recommend looking elsewhere until they fix that problem.

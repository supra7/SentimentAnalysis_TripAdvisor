I've stayed in many travelodges and I would like to think I am not a snob when it comes to hotels. However, in this hotel I was placed in a disabled room (though I didn't choose to include this in my room search) the room was on the lower ground floor. It was dark. The drain for the shower smelled disgusting. I had two single beds but each duvet rather bizarrely had a double duvet cover on it. It was just a depressing room. Stay here if you don't plan on doing anything in the room except sleep and ONLY if you get a very good price. Location was great however.

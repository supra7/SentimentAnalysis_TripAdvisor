I did not enjoy my stay here. If you are on a budget and the other hotels are too pricy - Fairmont, etc - then this will work for you. But I thought the staff were unprofessional and I was uncomfortable with the men at the desk. I was put in a room that just didn't have the feeling be being fresh and clean. It was dark, dirty, and noisy from the construction right outside my window. The only food available is from a Chinese restaurant that is in the hotel. I didn't try it, but it doesn't look appetizing. Based on my overall experience I could not recommend this hotel.

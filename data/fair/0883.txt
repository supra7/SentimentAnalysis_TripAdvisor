Let me first say that the staff were helpful and pleasant to deal with....and my young daughter thoroughly enjoyed the pool & waterslide. However, I cannot recommend this location based on the many other negatives we encountered during our stay. As this was partly a working vacation for me, I purposely chose the Hyatt based on brand name/recognition, figuring there would be decent business Internet service provided (after all, it is part of their daily $25 resort fee). Nothing could be further from the truth...the wireless signal was non-existent in our room, and the staff candidly told me it wasn't much better elsewhere on the hotel grounds. Given the high cost we were already paying the Hyatt for our accommodation, we still found surprisingly high prices for breakfast, snacks, etc....and the rooms themselves just looked old & tired. There may have been some renovation done recently, but I certainly didn't see it. We'll look elsewhere for our next stay in Maui.

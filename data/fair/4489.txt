Classic bait-and-switch. The room rate they charged me was $20/night more than what they "guaranteed" when I made the reservation on their reservations website. I disputed this with the front desk clerk (showing him a copy of the original confirmation), who asserted that he couldn't do anything about it because there was no manager on duty until 8:30 a.m. He "promised" to raise it with the manager, but as he wrote down notes I could see that we was lying and his notes had no resemblance to our discussion. The facilities are pleasant enough, but there were at least two other problems: - the "free wireless internet service" doesn't reach the 3rd floor; and the old T-1 wiring connection has been disabled - Housekeeping isn't particularly thorough--there was a gross stain on the brown bedspread (blood? coffee? semen? mucus?). Yuck. At the originally promised room rate, this might be a good-enough lower end value-for-money hotel within walking distance of the Embarcadero. As it is, I'd suggest that it's unwise to patronize hotels that bait and switch on room rates. On most weeknights and with enough advance planning, the Hyatt Regency down the street has rooms for comparable rates (to the actual higher charged price) that offer more consistent quality if less funky atmosphere.

Great beach and pool. Everything else was mediocre and far below what I expected for what we paid. Food was very low quality. Service was terrible, particularly at the pool cafe and pool. Slow (over an hour wait for appetizers with longer wait for food), never got orders right, pool servers only came around once every hour/hour and a half, checks were never right. Beach staff was rude and annoyed that you were there to get chairs, umbrellas, snorkeling equipment. Because we booked late, we had Thanksgiving dinner at the hotel, where we were rushed through dinner. Bussers repeatedly picked up plates as people were eating off of them and took full drinks away. Hotel rooms were only marginally better than a Marriot Courtyard (albeit with better views). Public areas were not cleaned regularly. Saw the same trash and spots on the floors for days. We also did the luau. Don't. For the price, terrible food and show comparable to others that are less expensive. Bad buffet chicken, potato salad, etc. Go to Wailea. Stay at the Four Seasons or the Fairmont. They have to be better.

I booked this hotel for 1 night because I was attending an event in London. I have booked almost 3 weeks before arriving. The area is really nice and the hotel is located near the Notting Hill Tube station. That is I guess the only positive thing I can come up with. To stay in this hotel for 1 night is ok, but only when you check in, visit London and come back exhausted and directly fall asleep. Hotelstaff was ok, the reception is a tiny desk where the most of the time the guy is on the internet and minding his own business. I had a terrible small room, where I couldnt even open the door properly. On top of that was, that the room was in the basement and had a tiny window and when looking out of the window you were looking at a staircase. The room was quite hot and had a fan mounted up the wall and unreachable without the usage of a chair. Bathroom was clean but very small. The sink had the same size of my sink in my toilet at home. And then there was this bed. If you're slim then 2 persons can fit here, but the matras was just horrible and some spots you could feel the spring. They defo need to replace the matrasses. I would not stay again in this hotel, you can find something better, a bit further from Central London and even cheaper.

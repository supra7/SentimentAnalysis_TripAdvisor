My partner and I arrived here for a large conference, 3 night before, and two nights after it finished, along with many colleagues. The room rates went up to over 270Euros per night. For that, we had no mini bar facilties (only water), the same breakfast every day, cockroaches and silverfish in our bathroom, and no airconditioning, plus a bed that rolled away from the wall if you sat up in it. Also no iron. The wi-fi is a joke. The breakfast was exactly the same everyday, and they would always runout of something and not replace it for maybe 20-30 minutes. The aircon was turned off because it was winter, but the rooms were quite stuffy, and if you had the window open you got the road and construction noise. When I showed them the cockroach, the two front office people just looked at other - no apology, no offer to change rooms, nothing at all. We could not get the bed fixed, so I put paper blocks under the wheels to stop them moving - however the cleaner removed them every day!! On our last day, I asked for a late checkout, 2 hours after the normal time. I was told it was an extra 20Euros - this was the last straw, especially remembering they were offering rates the day before for under 80euros, and we were still paying 270+. The CSO very ungraciously waived the fee only after I asked to talk to the absent manager. All in all, not a good experience - a 2.5 star hotel trying to be something it isnt. Things will go wrong, but it is always how people react to fixing it that matters, and these people didnt have a clue.

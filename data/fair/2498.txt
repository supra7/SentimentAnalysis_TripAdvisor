My husband and I were in Chicago for the weekend and found this pretty cheap on Hotwire. Unfortunately, the $90 room didn't include the $50 parking and the $20 internet. The lobby is gorgeous, very old and ornate, but the rooms were in desperate need of a cleaning and redecorating. We were given the disabled room (I guess because we checked in late and maybe that was all that was left??) so there was no real shower, just a handheld sprayer. Even worse, the metal bars in the shower were all rusted. The wallpaper was peeling off in several places, the corners of the room were dirty, and there was mildew all over the tub. We called down to the front desk to complain, thinking they would move us to a cleaner room, but they just offered to have someone come up and clean it. The bed was saggy in the middle (so much so that we were rolling into each other all night. The most frustrating part, though, was the lack of internet or phone. Neither of our cell phones got any reception in the room, and to use the internet was $20/day. That would have been annoying, except the fact that it was as slow as dial-up. We tried twice and spent about 20 minutes with tech support before giving up. To the hotel's credit, they did refund our money. Overall... the hotel is gorgeous in the common areas but lacking in the rooms. It's a great deal if you don't need parking, internet, or phone, but all those extras add up and there are lots of better hotels in Chicago in that price range.

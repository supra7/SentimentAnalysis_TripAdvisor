I read reviews that said this was not a good experience, but I had to see for myself! Internet did not function in room (they said they would give me a pass to Internet use in the Lobby), in-room movie function broken, carpets stained. Strange place...in hotel food very expensive and nearest reasonable foods at least 3 blocks away...nearest drug store also quite distant. Pluses? Green line train is a short block away if you exit the right door. Do not stay here if you cannot walk or weather is too cold to do so. Price (through aggregator) seemed right but amenities did not follow.

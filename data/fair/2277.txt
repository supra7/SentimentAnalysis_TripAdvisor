Through PriceLine we got a room at this hotel and even with the discounted rate through priceline this hotel did not provide good value. We were treated like third rate customers when we arrived because the hotel agent knew we recieved this hotel at a discounted rate. She was snobby towards us and we got the worst room in the hotel. It was on the 4th floor, right next to the ice machine and the housekeeping closet and through our window we had a view of the dumpster outside. Not to mention that the toilet did not flush properly. This hotel also nickels and dimes customers for everything. They charge $36/night for parking, $1.25/minute to use the phones in the room even if you are calling a local # or using a calling card and to use wireless internet they charge $14.95 for 24 hours. The worst part of all is that when we checked in, the agent did not even bother o tell us that they had 4 computers in the lobby that customers could use for free to access the internet. The only reason we found out about is that we saw people using them when we left the hotel. Had we known about it we would not have needed to pay the 14.95/month. On top of that, even though the internet in the lobby is free their computers use old versions of Inernet Explorer and it takes about 3 minutes for anything to load. The only positive thing I have to say about this hotel is that the beds are extremely comfortable and the air conditioning works really well. These are things many other hotels also have.. I would recommend any other hotel in the Back bay Area as the Hilton really disappoints!

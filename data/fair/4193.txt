We travel frequently - this is the 3rd trip to NYC in 3 weeks. We were just in Rome and London. We've been to this hotel 3 times. Each time we have terrible service, but we love the location so we keep giving them another chance. During this current stay it's clear we should only ever expect the poor service we've grown accustomed to here. There are two of us in a room. Today, we realized they removed the one robe we had been sharing and only left us with one medium-sized towel. We called three times to get a second towel that never came. This was after we left housekeeping a large tip yesterday. Apparently if you leave a tip, they don't want you to shower again. We tried renting a movie, there was something wrong with our TV, we called the front desk, they asked to send someone up to the room - who never came. So, we asked them to remove the movie we couldn't watch from our bill. They couldn't do it. We had a friend come stay with us at the last minute. We asked housekeeping if they would make up the extra bed. And of course, we left a tip for this. They never made up the bed. We called that night to ask for bedding to make the bed ourselves, they brought up one sheet, no blanket, no pillow. Don't stay here - there are plenty of options nearby with better value that will make you feel much more welcome than this place.

The location is about the best thing about this place, except for a few friendly staff. The rooms are pokey, unless you pay top dollar. The first room we were shown wasn't even large enough to put two suitcases on the floor. I thought our room was meant to have a lounge, so mentioned this, then was put into a "larger" room of the same value? This room was only a little wider than the bed (with a lounge) and has a curtain behind the bed, pretending to cover the window....that doesnt exist. By the end of our stay we both had some sort of cold or sore throat from breathing the dank recycled air. The included continental brekky was very basic carb-loaded rubbish, but was in a nice location on the roof, which was also a nice place for a sunset drink (byo). This seems like a nice old hotel that needs a big upgrade into the 21st century.

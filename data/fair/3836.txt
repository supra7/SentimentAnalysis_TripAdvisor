This has got to be one of the strangest places around -- attractive, quaint cottages right over the beach and/or ocean, UNBELIEVABLE views, well located for restaurants, etc., but has the worst front desk/reservations people I've ever encountered at a hotel. Unfortunately, it's not just a problem of the owners not knowing-- one of the rudest people you'll talk to is one of the owners. They know they have a unique property, with many people coming year after year (despite the attitude) so they don't have to improve their customer service. If you can overlook that aspect of things, this is a wonderful place to stay.

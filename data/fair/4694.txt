I have just returned from a stay at the Sheraton Maui and wanted to warn others who are unaware that they charge an extra $26.04 per day for a "resort fee" on top of already high rates. And the fee is barely disclosed on any of the booking informtion. I am fully aware of resort fees and have avoided hotels that charge them. The Sheraton Maui tricked me though. I disputed the charge and have been given the standard corporate lines about what extra services I am receiving for that fee and that the fee is mandatory. They are services that used to be included in the regular rate. So it really is just an extra hidden fee. My unhappiness with this fee overides whatever other review I have of this hotel. I would encourage others to join in my protest of this questionable resort fee practice.

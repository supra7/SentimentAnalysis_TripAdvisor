With the hotel newton you get what you pay for. It's a cheap, budget hotel with a decent location near the subway. Bathroom - Clean and small. The linens were fresh, the toiletries were basic, but it was clean and that's all that really mattered. Room - Small like most NYC hotels, bed was lumpy and the pillows were okay. My boyfriend did have to kill a bug, but didn't tell me he did until after we left (thank god!). There is an air-conditioner in your room if you visit during the hot summer months, but it is loud and inefficient. Didn't really cool all that much. There was no view, we just faced into a concrete courtyard. Staff/Hotel - Staff were all really pleasant, the elevators were really really slow. They do have pay-lockers there that are really handy as well to store your stuff after you check out. Factor in $25 for parking each day. All in all, the hotel was cheap and not all that bad. If you can splurge an extra $50/night for something better, I recommend it. I can't wait till I graduate from University so I can avoid budget hotels in general.

The Lenox scores highly on some counts, with a few key problems which I will come to later. Free bottled water, while undoubtedly an environmental disaster for a hotel marketing itself as 'green', is extremely welcome when it's 85+ in downtown Boston. Likewise, free bananas and cookies are a boon upon returning from a day out. Staff are helpful and professional and the location is A+. Where it doesn't score well is in the 'noise' category: doors don't fit fully into their frames (the historic nature of the building, I guess) and you can therefore hear everything going on in the corridor, including idiots singing at 2am on Sunday night... Noise between rooms, on the other hand, is very well insulated. We were on the 9th floor and you can also hear shouting from down on the street throughout the evening. The air conditioning is effective but sounds like a 747 coming in to land. Likewise, older plumbing means that you are bombarded with a cacophony of toilet-related gushing every time somebody goes to the bathroom. Further, The Lenox evidently thinks it is wonderfully 'cool' and this can attract a very strange crowd: women on roller skates wearing neon gloves and a mini skirt exiting the lift with a suitably odd gaggle of friends at 11pm anyone? The bar is unbelievably dark: if you can't pick up there you're in trouble.... The restaurant looked great but we didn't eat there so can't comment on the food itself. Overall, a mixed stay. Too much of a clash between authentic and hip for us, resulting in an odd compound of elegance and oddity. For a hotel in this price bracket I expect at the very least a good night's sleep, relaxation, and a door that fits into it's frame.

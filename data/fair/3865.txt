We stayed here for three nights in October with our two children aged 4 and 9. Whilst the saff were very friendly we found the standard of the accomodation disappointing.We paid a high rate for a family room and the first one on the ground floor was quite shabby, fridge on mini bar did not lock. To be fair we complained and were moved to a second floor executive room which was much better. Breakfast was disapponting. Small area to sit in(better to take to your room.) Communal areas in stairs needed refurbishing and according to the children smelt( altho I do not have good sense of smell). As I say staff friendly, location good, hotel expensive for level of accomodation offered in the experience of our trip (four differnet locations)

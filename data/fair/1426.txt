I am a platinum member with Priority Club and usually receive great service from any of their hotels. This hotel was not one of them. It took about 30 to 40 minutes just to check in cause the guy at the front desk said there are no clean rooms in the hotel - not one. I was booked for a suite, but since I had driven there, I wanted to shower and change clothes - so I told him I would take any room. After going back and forth for about 30 minutes, he said, well ok, I do have a clean room. Really? After all of that, he actually did have a clean room?!?! Then, I had to go up to the 5th floor, walk to the back of the hotel and take another elevator up to the 7th floor. Very odd hotel. There are many other hotels in the area that you may want to try.

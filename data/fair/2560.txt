This is a splendid old early-C20th hotel, but there's the problem - it looks great and the lobby is spectacular... but at these prices there are other, newer, better hotels available. The location is brilliant - right in the loop. The arcade is good and the lobby is awesome, but the bar is extortionate and the elevators are torturously slow. Some of the old ballrooms are evocative, but the modern conference rooms are airless, artificial and uninspiring. The bedrooms are OK, but not as large as others in this class and price-range. Visit the lobby, but don't stay here as a first resort...

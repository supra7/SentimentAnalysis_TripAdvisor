I arrive Singapore pretty late and by the time I got to the hotel, it was almost midnight, so their free shuttle bus was no longer avaliabel. The hotel is a bit of a walk from MRT station and you have to walk through a park - which can be scary at night. (Taxi cost $SG5 to get to Outram Park MRT station cuz we couldn't be bothered to walk the next day). The front desk lady can be a bit rude as she kept saying "what? what? what?" I don't understand - May be she really couldn't understand, but the way she said it made her sound really impatient and it's not just to me - I heard her on the phone to many other guests and she said the same thing. The room is nice on their own though and the flat screen tv is big with free wifi.

Don't expect the staff here to go out of their way to help or provide customer service. They act like it's below them. The biggest concern is the neighborhood. All of the streets between the hotel and La Rambla felt really unsafe. Lots of working girls and desperate looking predators. My wife and daughter would not leave the hotel after dark on foot. Would not go back !!

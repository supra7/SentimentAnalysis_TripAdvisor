Prince Maui Hotel is the last hotel on the Wailea resort strip but there is a construction site next to the hotel. It is noisy and the noise could be heard from the room that we had and more importantly, it could heard at the pool and at the beach. After one night, we contacted our travel agent for re-location since the purpose of our trip was to relax. We relocated to Kaanapali beach which we were happier with (better beach and no constructions nearby). Prince Maui Hotel was clean but with slightly old fashion decor. We wanted to eat after the restaurant had closed, saw the room service prices which were too expensive to us so we got in the car and drove up the road to find a restaruant. The hotel offers free parking. The pool is on the smaller side.

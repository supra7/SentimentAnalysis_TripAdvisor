We traveled on the AMX Platinum card and received an upgrade . . . to a room right next to the service entrance on the floor. After a few hours of jumping every time the service door slamming shut we requested a room change and were put in a very nice room . . . except the water in the shower turned on in the middle of the night for no apparent reason. Management apologized profusely, but did nothing to alter our bill. This year we had an minor problem at the Boston Four Seasons and they gave us the night for free! We have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental New York and San Francisco and had a wonderful experience each time so it made our Boston experience that much more disappointing and surprising. For my money (and it is my money) I would choose the Ritz or the Four Seasons any day.

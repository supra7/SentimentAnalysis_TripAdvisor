We arrived at Hotel Re to be told they wouldn't be able to accomodate our booking of a double room and we would have a twin room. This was the last couple of days of our honeymoon and we'd booked this hotel (due to great reviews on this site) over five months previously. After arguing that we'd booked a double room and when we said we'd go somewhere else they miraculously found us a double. Very strange indeed. It then however took another 30mins to get the key for this room and into it. This was all incredibly frustrating. Upon arrival at the room we discovered that it could well be the smallest room we have ever stayed in. It was clean enough but beware the pictures on the website must have been taken with an incredibly wide-angled lens!! The location of the hotel is not bad to be fair as it's near to a MRT stop. Although strangely they shut the quickest route to the MRT after midnight so if you return after this time you have to go the long way! All in all this wasn't a great experience and I'd pay twice as much to go elsewhere in future.

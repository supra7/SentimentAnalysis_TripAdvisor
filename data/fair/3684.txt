The only reason why this hotel gets 2 dots is because it had a cool lobby, nice shower head and a heavenly bed. Other that this hotel sucked. First the room was so small that my husband I both barely fit in the room. The room is only big enough for the bed which was only a queen size. We had room service for breakfast and I had to sit sideways in the desk chair with my husband on the bed to eat. Simply absurd. Also the rooms need to be remodeled. The bathroom had peeling wallpaper and the carpet was pretty thin and the heater was loud and old/dirty. I will never stay at this W again. I'll try the Tuscany again while in NYC or go back to the Penisula which is an amazing hotel.

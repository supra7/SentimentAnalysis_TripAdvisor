This place is kind of a mixed experience! The rooms are big, but outdated, the complimenatary breakfast is hard to get hands on because people just grab all they can get, but if you get a hand on it, its free and ok, the lobby is small and very outdated too, but the staff is great and very serviceminded, and so on! The biggest problem is the elevator, just one, and always occupied. But, the location is great, the rooms are big for being in NY, and the price is ok if you get a bargainbooking on the net. Rooms are clean, but outdated, papers outside the door in the morning, but there sure is a fight to get coffe!Its budget, and it means budget! Safe, clean and in need of some updating!

I stayed at this hotel with my mum last year and thought it was quite pleasant. I had previously stayed in the lexington, next door; and actually thought, although it is not as modern; it is just as clean and friendly and the rooms were larger. We had a few problems; the sink in the room got blocked and one of the socket points broke, but when I alerted the receptionist the problems were sorted immediately. The door to the room was problematic at times. I found that you had to slide the key card in and immediately shoulder barge the door to enter! I suppose that could anger some people, but we (especially my mum) found it funny!! Overall, I thought the rooms were a very good size, they were clean, warm and quiet, and the buffet breakfast was nice. The bell boys were really funny and talked to us everyday. I possibly would stay again, but I prefer to try different hotels each time I go, just to get a good feel of the city. I would recommend this hotel. Also the location is great as there is a train stop a couple of blocks up and everything is pretty much on your doorstep, including a general store (opposite) were you can buy fresh fruit etc. Really recommend the liberty helicopter ride. Its not scary and you will get brilliant photos of the city. That really made our trip!

Had to stay there for one night in early August for work. The staff were very helpful, but there were long lines. The free wifi is excellent, but the atmosphere is rather rundown and needs help. The elevator is very slow, especially in the morning when the various group tours were getting together. I ended up taking the stairs down to the lobby, only to find the free breakfast all gobbled up already (since their restaurant was still closed it was just coffee & crossiants in the lobby). Luckily I found Eleven City Diner around the corner and got a wonderful breakfast there.

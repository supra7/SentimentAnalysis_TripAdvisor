Checked in only to find out that the two dbl bed room I reserved/paid for was "under maintenance" I was given a room with one bed. All the prior visits I stayed in a one bedroom suite just like the one pictured on the website.. not this time; a very small room which looked like something from the 1970's, very old and out dated and small. I was told that all or my prior visits I must have had "the luck of the draw getting one of the rooms pictured on the website. I feel cheated and that Sommerset was/is very deceitful. If you MUST stay in Hillcrest, OK, if not... RUN to the numerous hotels in San Diego that offier much better room at better prices.

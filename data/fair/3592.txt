We stayed in the W on Lexington Avenue on 8/8/09 via Priceline. The common areas of the hotel are fine, the coat check and maids were nice, and the location is good.The front desk people never responded to our complaint of having a room that must have been 150 square feet. It was smaller than the cozy rooms they have on their web sight. The room was dark and the view was of a rusty garage. There was even scaffolding outside of our window. The W caters to 20-30 year olds and the noise levels in the hotel are extremely high.Priceline has this as a four star hotel but is by far the worst hotel we have ever stayed in in the city out of 25-30 visits. There are hundreds of better places to stay and I would avoid this part of the city if you use Priceline.

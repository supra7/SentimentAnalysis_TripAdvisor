What a difference between our stay at The Time in New York two years ago and our stay last week. In 2003, this was a stylish concept hotel. There was a high-energy vibe going with the sleek interiors, the time-oriented decor, and the fun color-centered rooms. The funky and highly functional rooms made one overlook how small they are. We had a great time there. Now The Time is grubby and worn. The fun decor remains, but looks neglected. Our room reeked of mustiness and mildew and we found part of our carpet was soaked from an air conditioner leak. The hotel was sold out so we couldn't change rooms until the next day. Our next room was dry, but the phone didn't work and the shower had barely enough pressure to run. We felt the less time spent in the room, the better. On the good side, the location is great, the staff is helpful, and the rooms offer very useful amenities.

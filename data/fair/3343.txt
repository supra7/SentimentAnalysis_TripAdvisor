I've stayed here before (in the cottage) and had a lovely experience but this visit I was pretty disappointed. We booked a suite for $425 a night and were put in a room with a tiny sitting area with one chair and steps up to the bedroom area. If we had payed less money and asked for a deluxe room, I would have been more pleased, but as booked, this room was not a good value. I can only assume that the rooms are pretty irregular. The bathroom was only okay. Small bathroom, large but acrylic tub. No coffee or even water in the room at turndown. Laughably tiny little TV's on TV tray. Newspaper was placed outside our room on rainy morning without a plastic wrapper. (it was soaked and unreadable of course) For NO, $425 is a lot of money, I expected more. I will not stay there again.

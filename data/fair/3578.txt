Stayed one night on a business trip. Funky place, modern, cool furniture, but ... noisy air conditioner/heating unit, coud not be turned off; worse, a few days after coming back home there was a separate charge appearing on my credit card statement for $ 18 and cents, follow up call provided an explanation it was a hotel bar charge (never went near the bar), still waiting for a refund 3 weeks later. This is actually not an uncommon ocurrence in NYC hotels, had similar experience a few months earlier at the Waldorf. Perhaps a revenue enhancing initiative - throw in an extra charge and see if it sticks ...

Good service at reception and and the auto area at entrance. Entrance area and reception are well appointed and modern-looking. The floors on which the rooms are located look tired, and are not up to my expectation of an Intercontinental hotel. We stayed two separate nights, in different rooms. Our room the first night, on the 12th floor, was "fine" but showing its age. 525, our room on the second night, was of a shape that suggested that it originally had been something other than a regular sleeping room - the TV console was at an angle to the wall with all the wiring for the TV and fridge exposed; there were electric wires and TV cables taped to the floor; furniture that did not match appeared to be randomly placed around the room, Both rooms, particularly the second one, were substandard to what I expect from an Intercontinental hotel.

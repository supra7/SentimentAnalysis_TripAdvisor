The rooms are small and have relatively old furniture and appliances. The gym facility is completely outdated. The mud bath was great but the one hour massage left much to be desired (not worth $100 by a long shot). My husband burned his foot in the steam room and when he mentioned it to staff, they said "Yeah, that's happened to a couple of people". Well, if that's happened to more than one person, they should fix it, no? Dr. Wilkenson's across the street has a similar mud bath treatment and a much much better massage. The pools were very enjoyable but at times kind of crowded. Room service is marginal. They just do your bed and change the towels. They did not do our dishes (the few that there were) nor did they really clean the shower. The day we were leaving there was no hot water (although we did get a small discount for this). I think the best thing about this place are the pools and the fact that they are kid friendly. However, for $200 a night, which is what it comes out to be with all the taxes and tourist fees, it is completely not worth it. If the rooms were around $120-150, then yes, I might consider coming back. Speaking of which, I though the rooms would be around $150 a night but because it was a holiday week (a few days before and New Year's eve), it turned out to be much more expensive. They really should advertise holiday prices on their website so that people know what they are going to pay. The total bill was a bit of a surprise and left a bad taste in my mouth. That did not need to happen if only the website would say ..."New Year's week = $184 per night".

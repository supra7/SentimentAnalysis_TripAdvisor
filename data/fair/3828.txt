Three nights at this hotel were marred on the last day by a hasty departure: more on that shortly. This hotel is adjacent to the Dolphin Mall and a number restaurants are located nearby and in the mall itself (P.F. Changs was pretty good). The rooms are spacious and clean--as one would expect from Marriott. The front desk staff were friendly and welcoming. Shower (with tub) was clean and hot water plentiful. So far so good--the problem with the hotel is in the details. There was no fridge in the room, and though there was a coffee maker, the hotel staff left only decaffeinated coffee, not the real stuff. There were complimentary coffee pots in the hotel lobby, but no coffee was available, at least on morning of departure. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was buffet style, but, again, no attention to details: there was no whole milk available, no chef at the eggs/omelette station, and to get refills on tea and coffee you had to chase the wait staff down. The main reason we rate this in the "not-to-be-repeated" category, though, is that on the morning of departure the in-room smoke alarm went off for no reason and, despite calls to front desk, no one showed up to shut it off after twenty minutes, at which time we could stand it no longer and beat a hasty (coffee-less) departure with the sound of the smoke alarm still ringing in our ears. We will stay at Marriotts again--we know they can do better, but we won't be staying at this one.

The room did not have a microwave or a refridgerator and for the price we paid, it should have had both. The balconies are shared, separated by a metal gate. Furniture in room was damaged and should have been replaced. There is no wireless internet in the rooms, you have to go to the lobby or the lounge. There is "high speed internet" in the rooms that you can plug into, but you have to pay by the hour to use it. I would certainly not stay at this hotel again. The only thing they really had to offer was a single chocolate chip cookie at check-in. I'll be spending my money more wisely elsewhere and buying my own cookies.

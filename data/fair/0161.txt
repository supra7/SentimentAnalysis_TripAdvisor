Emails to guests after their stay from an executive (Maglaris) ask for positive feedback to be posted on this site and negative feedback to instead be sent to the hotel. Standard hotel ventilation vents in bathrooms are in place but are not connected to anything operational. Rooms are therefore very stuffy as there is no through ventilation. The ability to open the window about 1 inch does not help much at all. One of the elevator doors a faulty so 1 out of 2 elevators was not properly functioning.

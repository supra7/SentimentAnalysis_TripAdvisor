My first impression when i came into palmers was " this is beautiful i am going to have a great stay" That feeling died when i got to my smaller than average room and minimalistic bathroom. Since i was there for business, i needed internet, Which wasn t complimentary and my port was out of service the second day. No complimentary breakfast and each time i called for assistance, i was put on hold for 5 minutes At least since they were busy. Great looking lobby And location but that is it

This room was so small, me and my partner could barely walk around and we are not big people. I travel to NYC frequently, but I've never seen a hotel room this small! The hotel does have a great lobby and a wonderful bar attached...The Whiskey Bar. The Bliss Spa is also now open...heard it's great, but didn't go by. Also, internet in the room will run you $15 a night. I would not stay here again on my next trip to NYC. I would recommed the bar and spa, but not staying in the hotel! Try one of the other W hotels!

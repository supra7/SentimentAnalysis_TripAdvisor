Good Price for San Francisco, but no where to park! Visited the Marinna Inn during our August 2007 trip. Good value for San Francisco. Smallish rooms on busy Lombard Street does provide some noise. If that is a problem for you, then look somewhere else. It wasn't for us, we are hard sleepers. The only real problem with this place is huge! There is No place to park. There are a few street parking spots available, but they are never available! We had to go park in a parking structure about 3 or 4 blocks away for $20 a day! So any money we saved by finding this place, we paid even more after paying for parking. I would recommend this place if you have no car to park, because it is a good value for this pricey city. But, if you have a car, please do not waste your time. There are many, many places on Lombard Street that have parking garages at there location for free.

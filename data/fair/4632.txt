Initially driving up we were kinda scared. It is a very old outdated and termite invested. This place needs a major uplift. The pool isn't very nice, the rooms are outdated, the bathroom was dirty, but it was cheap. So if you trying to save money I guess it's okay, but would not recommend it to anyone. The staff was super nice though.

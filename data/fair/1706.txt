Hopefully of help to would be patrons - the Hotel is ok for spending the night in London. Generally it looks clean but there was a layer of dust on the TV and in the wardrobe of our room. We also found a 'Rentokill' box hidden in one corner of the room which tends to make you think that there is an unseen problem. The water pressure was almost non-existent from the sink but luckily the shower was reasonable. Sleep maybe possible if you take a room in the upper levels - we suffered from people going outside to smoke at all hours (and I mean all hours as the last crowd finally went in at around 03:45). The room doors have a nice gap a the bottom so the light streams into your room when someone walk down the corridor - and speaking of that, we had a drunk shouting at the top of his voice at 05:15. Breakfast starts at 07:30 which was our alarm clock due to the continuous sound of tables & chairs being moved around on the upper floor. Breakfast was sparce and described by the person showed us to our room as "continental and not much"! There is very little room to squeeze between seated person on the 6 available tables. Overall our trip to town went well but I believe we'll stay somewhere else next time!

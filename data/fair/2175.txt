I just stayed on the 5th floor. The room was small, which I have encountered before in another Boston hotel and which didn't really bother me, since I was out most of the time. What really did bother me for the 2 nights I stayed there was the noise level, which was incredibly intrusive. Outside the window, in the interior of the building, was an exhaust fan that blew 24 hours a day. At night, it even went through periods when it would accelerate to the volume of a subway train. I awakened at least 4 times a night. I left a voicemail in the system regarding this noise but did not get a call back or a requested room change, which is really unacceptable. The phone system for this hotel is very substandard. I left a message in the concierge desk system before I arrived at the hotel and never received a call back from that, either. The wait time to get through to an actual person on that desk was close to 10 minutes.

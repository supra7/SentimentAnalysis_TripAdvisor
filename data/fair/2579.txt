If you are a regular Ritz Carlton customer you will be disapointed in this property. From the entrance level with the dirty stained carpet to the hard upsell at check in (not complimentaqry upgrade) you realize something is amiss. View is great as well as Mag. Mile locaiton--but unless a view is worth $800 you should choose a different property. In the area I have taken a look at the Pennisulia, the Park Hyatt, and the remodeled Hiltion Suites (looks like great value, space, location, view, and family friendly)--MUCH better properties for the same or less money. Our room has outdated and worn "hotel" feeling furniture. The couch is stained, there was hair in the bathtub the sink does not drain. There is a serious lack of attention to detail---no fresh ice at turndown, dirty glasses left where they were, two things of cold popcorn left with one glass and a sprite for the three of us and then not removed the next day--I could go on, but they can do better, much better. Nothing like fresh like flowers in the room, chocolates at turn down---absoutly nothing special--the same service you would receive at a basic Marriott if not less. If it were not for the hassle of moving I would change hotels (only here 3 nights). Things are just not right with this property--dosen't have the RItz smell, personal service, and the small details in place that make for a five star suite experience. I am not a big four seasons fan--except for thier spas and Vegas location but someone from their hotel (they own the property) needs to walk across the street and see the tarnish this property is putting ont the Four Seasons name. To me this use to be the place to stay in Chicago--times have changed.

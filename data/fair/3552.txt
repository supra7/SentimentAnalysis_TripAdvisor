We have stayed at many W Hotels before and they were great but because of our room and service... made for the worst stay. Born a New Yorker myself I know New York has smalls spaces but the room was so small and it was across from the cleaning staff who were so loud starting at 6am. Sounded like they were banging pots outside are door to wake us up. The front desk was not at all friendly or accommodating. The Concierge desk was not help ful in the least. This hotel gives NY a bad taste for the Big Apple.

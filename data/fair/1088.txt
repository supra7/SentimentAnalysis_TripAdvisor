I did not stay in any of the rooms but I did use valet service for parking and I was a guest of the spa. A very lackluster spa, at best! Unlike an earlier reviewer, I found the valet service to be typical of Vegas- 10 to 15 minute wait for my car. It was mid day; I would expect a longer wait in the evening though. The valet was very friendly and asked if I needed directions or assistance upon exiting the area. The lobby area was very nice and clean. My disappointment is soley with the spa. The personnel were mostly friendly (the front desk staff were a bit stuffy and uppity). I absolutely LOVED my therapist Morgan and spa attendant, Christine- they were incredibly friendly and the only positive things going for the spa. The spa only has one small sauna and one small steam room and 4 shower stalls. The changing area/locker room is very small (10x10). The spa lacks a vanity area, as well as such amenities (hair dryer, etc). I also noticed that the towels are not restocked frequently- for example, there are ice towels just outside the sauna area; there were only two face cloths left when I exited the sauna and they were wet cloths, as the ice had melted. The co ed relaxation room is also very small and is only stocked with apples and cucumber water; there is more than enough reading material though. The amenities offered (and lack thereof) is not commensurate with the prices charged for services. I have frequented other spas on the Strip as well as at the off Strip/locals' casinos and this spa is by far the most disappointing and most lackluster of them all.

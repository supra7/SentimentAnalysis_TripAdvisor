It was our 10th wedding anniversary and we booked this Seattle hotel. We were aware of the noise factors by taking a room on the non-ocean side as there are enough other reviews to cover this - but in hindsight we should have listened and paid whatever it took to avoid the parking lot/railroad side. We barely slept because of it. We did try to upgrade but the hotel could not accomodate us. My main beef however was the dining room where we did enjoy a lovely wine at a window table overlooking the water. We ordered a bottle of red wine for which we paid $52.00. We liked it so much that the next day we searched for where we could purchase it. Imagine our shock to find it at Cosco and web order wine sites for less than $9.00 per bottle. Two to three times mark up is something we are all accustmed to but almost six times is surely a rip off. We complained at check out but no action taken.

Checked in at 9pm. Went to my room to find it was tiny (I know, it is New York, but I expected more from the W). I opened the shades to find a sticker on the window with one of those pithy W hotel slogans, it said "Size isn't everything and to make up for the small size of the room, you get free Wi-Fi". Great, that's just what I wanted (not). After resigning myself to the small room on the 3rd floor, I ordered room service. It came quickly and the food was good. As I was eating, I heard what sounded like someone taking a hammer and hitting the water pipes (about 6 times). The noise went away and then returned 20 minutes later. I called the front desk and an engineer came promptly. It appears as if he was familiar with this problem and said he could fix it by running water through the main. This is annoying as it means the hotel knows this room sucks and would be impossible to sleep in. Anyhow, at 12:15 in the morning, the clanging returned and woke me from sleeping. I called the front desk again and they again offered to send the engineer. I demanded a different room and they moved me at 12:45. Needless to say, I wasn't bright eyed and bushy tailed for the next day's meetings.

Stand in the middle of this $400 room and swing a dead cat by the tail and you could hit all four walls! The 'hotel' is a dark, rabbit-warren, of mazes, hallways and rooms. My tv barely worked, no music or DVD, NO CLOCK, and a tiny window looking at a wall of another building. Based on the line of people, including a colleague of mine, standing in line at the reception desk with complaints of reservations being dropped or lost, I'd say I wasn't alone in thinking this place is a HUGE RIPOFF! Oh by the way, they should force the 'designer' of this place to live in this dump as punishment for his sins.

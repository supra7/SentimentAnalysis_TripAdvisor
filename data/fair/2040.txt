The Marriott Copley Place is a convention hotel. There is no reason to stay there unless you are attending a meeting. It is a warehouse for people. The most pedestrian decor I have seen in a major chain hotel in a while - not even a whiff of style. The lobby is dominated by a huge "open air" sports bar with multiple massive screens. The hotel entrance is also the mall entrance so there was a huge crowd coming and going all the time. The front desk and bell staff seemed frazzled and inattentive. Other than the sports bar, there is no restaurant so we had to go out even for breakfast. Apparently they also have a rat problem. I was early for a meeting in one of the ballrooms on the 4th floor and arrived while the room was still being set up and found the back corner of the room was filled with baited mouse traps. When I returned later, a folding door had been closed blocking off the corner and obscuring any pest control activities from view. Since there was a convention in town when I was there and space was tight, the rates were high. The "discounted" conference rate I paid was $342.20 after taxes. For this princely rate, I had a plain room with a tiny bath. The one really nice feature in the room was the bed - very comfortable, lots of pillows, and you didn't even have to ask to get the sheets changed daily. The location is great but at the other end of the same block (via the interior mall) is the Westin - so for the about the same price in nearly the same location you can have a much more upscale experience and better service.

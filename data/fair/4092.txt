I spent a weekend at the Encore for a bachelorette party in May 2009. After reading the reviews and seeing photos of the suites online, it seemed like a great option. The "all suites" hotel was dissappointing from start to finish. The rooms had a sitting area, but it was very small and cramped. The hotel decor itself was nice, but the customer service was horrible. We also dined at the restaurant switch, which also had rave reviews, but was nothing better than a below-average steakhouse. From check in to check out, the staff was rude and unaccomidating. We requested a late check out since some of us were not flying out until the afternoon, and they were not able to accomidate that on a sunday. And to top it off, we were charged $12 for OPENING the minibar, not for USING the minibar. The minibar is on sensors (as are the snacks on the dresser) so even if you open it to see what is inside, they charge you! After we checked out, my friend and I sat in the hotel lounge to rest after walking around, and we were rudely approached by the server who said there was a 1 drink minimum per person just to sit in the lounge (which, by the way at 1 pm was EMPTY). Overall a terrible experience...with so many great hotel choices in Vegas, save your $$ and stay somewhere where they appreciate your business.

We had a very memorable stay 9 years ago having booked by recommendation. The Hotel has changed somewhat, and now accommodates a Spa of which we did not use this time. As the Cottage was booked we had used in the past, we decided to stay in the Hotel. In comparision not so good. The bed was small and very uncomfortable, the corridor outside our room was very nosiy morning and night time as the walls were thin. The breakfast was provided by room service which means you hear everyone's breakfast being served at the time requested. A lovely service only if you don't hear the delivery. We found the Hotel was overpriced for what it had to offer.

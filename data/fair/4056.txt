First time staying at the Encore. I was impressed with many things about this hotel. Very clean and nice. However, I was very surprised when we were heading to bed at 2am and the music from the nightclub XS can be heard EXTREMELY loud all the way up to our room (18th floor). Every night the music would be blasting until 5am seeming to get louder and louder as the night went on. I understand that Vegas is a late night city but I would like the option of sleeping when I am here for a convention and do not want to stay up that late. Had to ask the hotel for earplugs our last night and could still here the loud music over the earplugs. I will NEVER stay here again. I have never had an issue like this at any hotel in Vegas.

Location is magnificent. Rooms and facilities are good. Service is really poor and subpar when compare d to Westin standards. As a platinum guest i often stay at starwood properties there including several Westins and only rarely have I found such an unfriendly staff. I wanted to discuss this with the manager on duty tonight. She really did not care (which largely explains the poor service). Avoid the hotel

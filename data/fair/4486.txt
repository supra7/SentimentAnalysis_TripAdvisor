The Griffon is a small boutique hotel in a great location in San Francisco. If you're into small boutique hotels, you might really like this place, but it's not for me. The rooms are exceptionally small, and mine afforded a view of a brick wall. My closet had exactly four clothes hangers. The fuzzy TV had surprisingly limited channel selections (e.g. I couldn't find CNN or CNBC. Air conditioning was weak, and the slow elevator can really only accommodate two people with luggage. On the plus side, everyone was quite friendly, and the location is great. So, if you're only in town for one night, this would be an ok place to land. But, if you're going to be here for a few days, the walls could start to close in on you.

We stayed at the Marrakech for 3 nights, it is dark, dingy, smells funny, has noisy pipework and has too many stairs and the staff are miserable. On positive note it seemed clean and the bed was comfortable. The worst thing about this hotel is it's security - we paid for our luggage to be kept in a secure room after we checked out as we had a later flight. We returned at 6pm and my case was still there, by 8pm when our cab was due to return us to the airport my bright pink case had gone missing. The staff didn't seemed bothered I asked for the manager who was not on duty and it took the supervisor ages to show her face. We eventually had to call the police, even though the staff told me they wouldn't be interested, well they were and asked about lack of CCTV and the why supervisor didn't know their insurance details, (even the police had to ask 3 times before she showed her face) It turned out my case had been put on shuttle to the airport with complete strangers, so much for the security ticket number I was given. The staff desperately need customer service training, it's not too much too expect a receptionist to smile is it??? NY is a fantastic place just chose a better hotel.

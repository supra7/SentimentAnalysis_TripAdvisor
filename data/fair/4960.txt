This is the worst 4 or 3.5 star hotel in Chicago. I travel alot and can say they are not even good enough to be called a hotel. Front desk is poor on check in and rooms are a closet. Restaurant is poor service and valet will take over 20 minutes to get your car. Find another hotel so you can enjoy your stay in Chicago.

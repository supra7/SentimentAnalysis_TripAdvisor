Free internet didn't work unless you were in the lobby. I had to get a contract done at the last minute so I had to sit in the lobby for an hour at 11 pm at night to get it done. The room was a room, nothing major. The parking lot had the occassional drifter walking through. I was happy to be on the second story where I felt more secure. If you have to stay near downtown, this site is inexpesive but I would probably find someplace else. Oh, and the road noise is a bother.

Went to check in and front desk clerk told me my reservation was for one night only and I told her that was corrected and I had been sent a new confirmation by the booking company handling the convention. She went and got a supervisor who continued to tell me there was nothing they could do for me. After dissappearing to the back for quite some time, he once again came out only to tell me they would not have a room for my second night. So here I am travelling with my small children and all they could offer me wa to go find the convention people and ask what they suggest. After pretty much causing a scene in the lobby, they offered to call the booking commpany for me and find out what happened. Now the thing that really mad me off about this whole situation it that the hotel offered someone else beside me an upgrade for $100. So obviously the hotel had rooms available and just did not want to go above and beyond to provide excellent customer service as I would expect from a four star hotel. In addition, WiFi is an additional $9.95 a day, and pool usage is $15 per day/per person. Now that is what I call ridiculous. I mean you can go to almost any hotel in the day and age and get those amenities for no charge. Indoor pool felt as though they had the air conditioning on and not so clean as I saw clobs of hair in the water. Beds were nice-that is the only good thing I can say about Swissotel Chicago.

Wouldn't go back Stayed with my wife and kids on 25th and 26th March. It's overpriced as all hotels seem to be on South Beach. Room was big but not especially clean and the bathroom needed a major overhaul. Main problem was the noise. The airconditioning sounded like a wind tunnel and the controls didn't work so you couldn't turn it off. Added to this was the noise from the road and the hotel next door which I guess isn't their fault. The hotel next door blasted out continuous 'music' that consisted of a loud throbbing bass line that scrambled your brain and someone shouting over the top with no discernible tune or melody. It made it impossible to relax by the pool without industrial ear protection. The only good point was the pavement cafe for breakfast.

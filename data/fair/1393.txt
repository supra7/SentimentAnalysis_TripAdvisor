The Hotel 91 is located on the outskirts of Chinatown bordering the Lower East Side. When you enter the hotel, you have to walk a long desolate corridor and then take an elevator to the second floor reception area. The walk was a bit creepy and without security could be a little menacing. Anyway, when I took the elevator the the reception area, there was nobody there. So I waited and waited and waited. After 15 minutes, I called the hotel and heard the phone ringing, but nobody answered. So I waited....... after 24 min (I was checking) a guy came down the hall and mumbled something about being busy. When I informed him that I had been waiting almost a half hour to check in, he had no response and in fact refused to even make eye contact with me. He rattled off the perfunctory hotel information and put my key on the counter without telling me my room number or even acknowledging me at all. My room was tiny and had a musty smell. The bathroom floor was spotted with grime. The room was next to a subway track, but I am a deep sleeper so I wasnt really bothered by the passing trains. Many of the TV channels were unavailable (WCBS, WNBC). The next morning I got the heck out of this place ASAP. A really awful experience.

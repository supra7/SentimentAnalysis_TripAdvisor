Ok, so we should have known that karma would win out when we heard that there was a boycott/protest going on over the recent firings of the entire housekeeping staff. But the location was perfect for what we needed, so we stayed. I stayed there for 2 weeks. I'm not really sure where to start, but there were so many little annoyances. The concierge was just rude, no other way to say it - very uppity. I only had housekeeping service my room a couple of times during my stay, but I called for random items (towels, extra coffee, etc) probably 5 or 6 times during the 2 weeks, and not once did we actually get what we asked for. I had a couple of friends visit for 3 days, and every single morning we were woken up very early for unneccessary reasons. The first day was by a wake-up call that we didn't place. The second day was by someone knocking on the door asking for the room service tray that we had ordered the night before. (with the "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door, btw) The third day was by an alarm going off because the hot water pipes had burst on our floor and there was an evacuation -which I fully realize is out of anyone's hands and is nobody's fault...cut to later that night when a woman in the elevator overheard us talking about it and said the same thing had happened a few months prior when she was there before. And speaking of elevators, they were broken for about 3 of the days we were staying at the hotel. I don't mind taking the stairs occasionally, even if I was on the 11th floor, it was better than waiting for the 1 working elevator to make it's way down all 20 flights. Oh, and 2 people in our party got stuck in an elevator for prolonged periods of time, on 2 separate occasions...On the plus side, the location is fantastic - it's really close to the T and within walking distance of almost everything on the Freedom Trail. And the beds were really comfortable. I just doubt I would stay there again.

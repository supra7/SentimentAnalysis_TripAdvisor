I booked this hotel because of the awesome reviews on this site! I booked a King suite. Upon check-in, I was notified the suite I booked was not available. They ended up giving us two adjoining rooms. Traveling with two toddlers, I was looking forward to the extra open space and a living room area, but didn't have time to object nor had time to dispute. The customer service was great, but booking rooms that aren't available is unacceptable. Pros: good customer service, comfortable beds, nice breakfast included, location, relatively cheap for a downtown hotel. Cons: VERY loud (I slept with the TV on though which tuned out all the noise), dirty hot tub, "heated" pool was too cold for my kids to even want to be in, booked room wasn't available, expensive parking (although all hotels are like this downtown)

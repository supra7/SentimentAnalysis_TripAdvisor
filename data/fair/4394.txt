I never tend to write reviews of hotels, but felt compelled to comment on this one as my boyfriend and I were really quite disappointed. We booked the Marrakesh having looked at their impressive website, and went in with a fairly pragmatic 'let's just give it a try' approach, having read of good and bad experiences on this site. We certainly weren't expecting the lap of luxury, but felt we were splashing out on something over and above our usual budget basic room...We are very used to backpacker accommodation, and believe I we are by no means fussy or demanding travellers. However, HUGE amounts of noise in room 42 (*repeatedly* loud slamming doors, perhaps by the domestic staff), and unfriendly staff left us feeling disappointed in our choice. I also have picked up 3 very distinctive bedbug bites!! The room was completely livable, but the squashy lumpy bed and bizarre decor was by no means in keeping with what the website seemed to promise... The location is great, the bar is atmospheric, and at the end of the day you can't expect miracles without spending a fortune in New York, but if you're looking for a comfortable spot to splash out a bit I think you might be better off elsewhere... Happy trip!

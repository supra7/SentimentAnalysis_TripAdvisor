The hotel is new but the price was very high with no breakfast included. The shuttle took forever to come to the airport and get us we almost gave up and took a cab. But worst of all is the location, it was just plain scary and downright unsafe. We left after one night and moved to another hotel a few miles away where we enjoyed the rest of our 10 days in Miami. Skip this place, theres plenty better.

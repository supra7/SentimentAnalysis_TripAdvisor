Reading the last review (October 9) has left an even more frustrated feeling about the Frenchmen Hotel. I reserved the largest suite available from their hotel website which sounded very nice from past TripAdvisor reviewers, and made the reservations two months in advance, so I got a very fair rate ($109 a night) for my 5 night stay. This seemed like a very good value for a suite that could accommodate up to 5 guests. Calling a day before I would arrive to confirm my reservation, I was informed that they would not be able to put me in the suite that I reserved two months earlier, nor would they have a room for me on the Frenchmen property, rather their adjacent inn -The Lamothe House-. The room given to me was larger than your typical hotel room, but not one as spacious as expected, plus we had a myriad of maintenance issues (i.e. bathtub faucet leaking, bathtub drainage, wi-fi signal too weak to reach suite-only available in lobby, door separating us from the next suite had a broken latch--we wound up moving the sofa in front of the door to give us a little security). Despite the disappointment that we were in a different hotel than reserved, in an inferior room than expected, & had to pay $15 a day for parking, which I just learned from the last review was free at the Frenchmen, we were charged the full room rate & the full parking rate. Can you say "Bait-and-Switch"??? I urge TripAdvisor readers to support a more reputable operation. I will echo other writers on this site and say that this hotel is located in an exciting neighborhood with lively bars, restaurants & activities that certainly made visiting New Orleans unique & memorable. Certainly visit New Orleans, be careful about the Frenchmen Hotel.

We booked this hotel since they allow dogs and we wanted to be near the strip. Sorry Donald. This hotel is a major disappointment. The lobby is disorganized. The room had no soap. We had to ask for it. The carpeting was worn and stained in the room and in the elevators. The mattress was old and kind of creaky. The furniture is getting worn and really needs replacement. This is NOT a five star hotel. We will Never stay again. I think we will go back to the Palazzo and leave the dog at home.

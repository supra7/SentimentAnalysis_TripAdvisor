The location was good if you want to be on the beach. However it was too far to walk to the boardwalk. The hotel needs a lot of TLC. The carpets are spotted and the rooms need some updating. The shower curtain had mold stains and there were cracks in the shower tiles. The hotel entrance is hidden to the left side with no signs directing you there. We went in through the convention center entrance and walked around for about 10 minutes before we found our way to the lobby.

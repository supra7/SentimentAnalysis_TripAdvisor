The best thing about this hotel is the location, That is the reason my husband and I will continue to book it. But, this hotel is filty. The bathrooms are very dirty and the rugs in the rooms are hardly vacuumed, the sheets are wrinkled and I question just how clean they are. Where is the manager of the cleaning crew?

I had thought it was safe to assume that all Helmsley hotels would be nice. After staying here, I would say never assume anything. First of all there is no lobby, you walk in and go to a window where you get your key. The rooms were FILTHY and there were huge stains on the carpet. The furniture was extremely worn and old and I was hesitant about even sleeping in the bed. I definitely would not recommend this hotel for the cost. Find something better.

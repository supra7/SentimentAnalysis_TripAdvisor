I booked this hotel on hotwire getting a room for $88 a night. I would be furious if I was paying the rack rate. When I stepped into the bathroom, I realized it was missing a tub. There is a tiny stall shower, 4-6 inches from the toilet separated by a curtain. Not what I expect from a three star hotel. Its in a great location, so worth it if you are just here for a few days.

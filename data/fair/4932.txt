This hotel is in a pretty good location, directly across from Grant Park & easy walking to shopping & buses. A tired hotel, but comfortable enough. Basically our only choice for somewhere to stay as there was a huge conference on in Chicago, so we paid far more for the room than it is worth. Biggest downfall was there was no laundry. They did offer a cleaning service, but at a large cost. Also there are no self service laundromats anywhere in the vacinity, which we found out the hard way after checking on yellowpages.com & then lugging a bag of dirty clothes across town only to find a laundromat does not exist in the location. So my biggest tip, do all your washing before moving on to Chicago!

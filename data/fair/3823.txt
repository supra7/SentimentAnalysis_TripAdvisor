Everyone who worked at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix was professional and very friendly, but the facilities themselves are outdated and I would not recommend this hotel: - internet service was awful. Slower than dial-up, and sometimes inaccessible at all. This is not a hotel where you can work reliably after hours if you need to be online. - Execu Car service that the hotel recommends for guests to use for local transportation is very bad. Sometimes they don't answer the telephone at all (so you can be stranded without an easy way back to the hotel), and the one time I did ride with them, the driver texted and took his hands off the wheel while we were in traffic. - Water pressure in the shower was very low. Very few rooms actually have proper stall showers. Most are old fashioned tub showers.

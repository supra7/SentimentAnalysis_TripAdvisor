We stayed 9 days at this hotel during Christmas 2008. I was disappointed by the housekeeping service they provided. First off, the housekeeping lady did not replenish the coffee, popcorn that supposed to be in the little caddie. I finally left a note to remind her the 3rd day. She refilled the caddie up the next day. Our kids finished the popcorn and we made a pot of coffee a day later, and run the dishwasher. You would think she would have be a little bit more cognizant about that little caddie and checking the cleaning supplies. No, she did not refill the caddie, again. That was our 6th day. I finally give up on her. So for the rest of our stay, I just go down to the hall to get a cup of coffee. Secondly, our rooms were not made and fresh towels were not provided on Christmas Day. Is that their policy that no housekeeping on Christmas Day? I even noticed the little crumps my kids left behind was still there on the day we left!! On the positive notes, the rooms are big and beds are comfy. Breakfast is just fine. We are making another trip in 3 months. I guess I will stay somewhere else next time.

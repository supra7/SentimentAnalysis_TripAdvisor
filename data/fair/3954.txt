The pictures on the website are misleading and show the Hotel in a much better light than we saw it in person. It was inexpensive but everything about it reflected that. The corrider and rooms seemed border line clean and the decor was out dated. The bar/lounge only served one kind of wine for the "tasting" and the front desk help was friendly but could not answer any questions we had about San Francisco, where to find weather info (which any decent hotel should post anyway) or where to eat. I would not/NOT stay here again or recommened it to anyone.

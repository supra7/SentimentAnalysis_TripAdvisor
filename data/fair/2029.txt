I am a frequent visitor to the Boston area for business as well as pleasure. I began using this hotel over 20 years ago but in the last three years had opted for a change of hotel. Given the rates I opted to return to the Marriott Copley. Checking in after a long drive I was informed there was no valet parking available for hotel guests as there was a holiday party. I left my luggage with the one and only doorman and headed for the adjoining self-park garage. My daughter began the check-in process. Upon returning from the garage which took some time given the minimal number of spaces available there, I observed our luggage unattended in the lobby in the midst of random people from the party who it was clear had imbibed too much. (In the interim while checking in my daughter commented that the response she received to the parking situation was, at least its less expensive. I called my daughter, mentioned the luggage situation to find out that she had been informed there was only one bellhop available that evening. The evening did not end there as we had to call security twice given the noise level on our floor. Lastly, amenities that had been above par on past visits were fairly invisible in our room although when housekeeping was called, they did arrive. Upon arriving home I dashed off a note to the manager detailing the dissatisfaction, I have yet to receive a response. The situation and stay was unfortunate to the least and the term guest a stretch to say the least.

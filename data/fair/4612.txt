Loud, Lacking in many areas...AVOID Let me start with the good: Waikiki, location location location. Although it is not located oceanfront it is across the street from the beach and conveniently located in downtown shopping district. Front desk staffs were extremely friendly and attentive to guests needs. Although the parking garage is usually packed by non-hotel guests the contracted parking attendants are attentive to ensuring that all vehicles are parked. Unfortunately for myself and the ten day stay there were way too many negatives. The elevators (four of them) were entirely insufficient for the volume of guests. Wait times for elevators exceeded 5 minutes throughout the day. To add to the already outrageous delays the hotel shuts down two of the elevators during their Polynesian Magic to allow access and from the lobby to the street level. The physical building itself is under construction and the sound of jackhammers and constant construction takes away from the Hawaiian relaxed feeling. At night the noise continues as the Bar located in the international village thumps its music into the wee morning hours. Don let their advertisement of broadband and wireless internet fool you. Their internet is normally not working or inadequate for email. If youe looking for a relaxing hotel in Waikiki avoid this one.

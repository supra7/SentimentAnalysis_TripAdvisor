I booked this hotel on Priceline for 140 pounds.My heart sank when I read the reviews on Trip advisor. We stayed in the so called cozy room.It is a tiny box room with a bathroom which is so small that one person is a tight squeeze.I understand that space is premium in New york ,but come on. The bath products are lovely as is the location. The ladies at the reception are glacial,a far cry from the warmth and hospitality of the Waldorf across the street. We were lucky we got away with one night.

This hotel is convenient and is located uptown. It is very close to bus lines 1, 2 (express) and 3 that gets you everywhere. I rented a room with 2 double beds and the room was small. The bathroom was relatively small, too. When you open the door from a day of doing touristy things, the room smelled like vinegar. I bought an air freshner to mask the odor but did not help. There is a great diner downstairs and a vietnamese restaurant. There is mcdonalds and dunkin donuts across the street (open 24 hrs.) Though the hotel was inexpensive, I will not stay there anymore.

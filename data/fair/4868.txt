From the time we arrived, Mr. Personality greeted us and took our luggage with a tip for a short trip to the room which we could have done easily. Lobby very outdated. Desk clerks social. Decor not at all classy. Very outdated and dull. Rooms ok. Small but nice. Distance to shopping very far for walking. (about 20 blocks to the north district) Continental breakfast very disappointing. Very small with limited selections!!! Coffee,tea, fruit, muffins on certain days, is about it!!!! Would not stay here again. Nice, safe, cheap parking two blocks $23.00/per day vs. $44.00 with the hotel. We left car for three days and all was ok. Under a roof. Chicago has much better to offer!!!!

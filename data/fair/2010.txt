My very good friend booked a room at the Joule for her birthday last weekend and invited a few friends, myself included, to celebrate a safe and enjoyable evening. We began the evening in the hotel room, then walked a short distance to a nearby resturant for dinner. When we returned, we waited in line to enter the PM Lounge, a club on the bottom floor of the Joule. The doorman refused to allow us entry and we ended up waiting for almost an hour in the Texas heat while other folks would simply walk off the street and were immediately allowed in! My friend finally asked why we were waiting while everyone else was allowed in and the man very rudely announced that those folks were hotel guests. The birthday girl informed the man that she too was a hotel guest but he only said he would look into it. I was appalled that we were treated that way. The birthday girl waited for another 45 mins to speak to the hotel manager about the situation, but he was preoccupied trying to iron out a situation for some honeymooners who had made reservations that the hotel couldn't locate. (Apparently we weren't the only guests to have their evening botched by this hotel). After such a long and sweltering wait, the b-day girl's guests began to just leave out of frustration. The guest who remained were forced to go across the street to a dive bar where the b-day girl began to cry uncontrollably over her ruined special evening. It was insulting that the doorman/management were so disrespectful and unwilling to take care of their guest. I would never recommend this hotel or their club PM Lounge.

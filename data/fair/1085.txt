I stayed at the Trump International in Las Vegas for my Wedding and was beyond disappointment. We have 4 rooms for us and extended family. The rooms were broken down, literally. From the broken sink to the broken armoire and the lights that were burned out. There were so many thing wrong... they changed our room and then apologized by sending a bottle of wine and strawberries to the wrong room. We had several "managers" try to solve these issues and I believe they were mostly inexperienced and could not solve problems. I was so disappointed, I wrote a letter (4 pages) and sent it (twice) to the Trump Organization in New York as well as the Hotel in Las Vegas. No response. Very Bad experience. Surprised the "The Donald" puts his name on it. I do not think he would like to stay there.

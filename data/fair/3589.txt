Stayed 1 night as part of a longer business trip. Was excited by the name and the reputation (and hadn't checked any reviews), but was disappointed by the experience Room was extremely small, and didn't have a bath. I think the room was for people with disabilities given various bits and pieces in the bathroom. That said, anyone with a disability could not have gotten through the bedroom into the bathroom, given the lack of space. Shower-only meant the bathroom got flooded when shower was used. Air con unit was very noisy, and to turn it off meant the room was too hot (I couldn't get the window open). I had to make a call to the taxi company and i used the W phone in my room to call the freephone number - i got charged 2 dollars... not a lot of money but it's the princple... Woman at reception agreed it was out of order, but didnt offer to remove it! A constantly busy reception area, lots of people hanging around...the bar staff were totally unfriendly, i waited ages to ask to see the wine list and got it handed to be by some surly wannabe who was looking in another direction as she passed it over... then had to wait ages again to order the (mediocre but expensive) wine Also a lot of rooms had left meal trays and plates outside their room which were there when i arrived at my room (7pm or so) and were still there 4 hours later. Overall impression pretty poor I'm afraid.

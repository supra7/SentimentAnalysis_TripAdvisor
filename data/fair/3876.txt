After leaving the Sheraton we called around to find a hotel and this one was recommended as a wonderful hotel. When we got in the room I about passed out. It was so small and the pull out bed wouldn't even pull out because it hit the bathroom wall. We had to move the bed sideways and it was like sleeping on wire. The handicap bath was almost as big as the room but the showerhead kept falling off and water was getting everywhere. We told the front desk who seemed less than interested. The next day the shower head fell off again and my son fell and hit his head. There is no airconditioning so it is very hot in the rooms at night and the beds are terribly uncomfortable. The only great thing about The Surfer is the beach is outside your door!

Lets see, where to begin: - The housekeeping crews were awful. On most days we would return to the room around 4:00pm to find the room un-serviced. Inevitably they would arrive while we were getting ready to go to diner and we would tell them to come back in  hour. This was mistake since they go home at 4:30pm, they dont bother to tell you this. I had to call the front desk a few time to get to room serviced - The rooms were very small for the price. This was the opinion of most people we talked to by the pool. - The mountain view rooms should have been called parking lot/construction view rooms. The mountain is being torn apart to build more timeshare properties. - One of the two waterslides they mention in their literature is only about 10 feet long. - The $25 breakfast buffet was a waste of money since almost all the food was overcooked. - The parking lot was so small I could not find a place to park. And when I did, I would find my car parked-in by the valet service the next day. - The quality of the TV signal was terrible. All the channels were snowy and on two occasions the entire system was down. I know you are not supposed to watch TV when on vacation in Hawaii but the kids still want their fix of Cartoon Network. - The pools were so crowded that you could not find two chairs next to each other. I was watching people arrive at the pool at 7:30am to claim their spots.

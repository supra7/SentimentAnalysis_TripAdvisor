We booked our room on priceline so that's always a big surprise ($75). This hotel is completely decieving..the lobby appears impressive but after you get off the elevator on your floor - its like a third world country. the walls are in need of a good paint job and its just pretty dingy. the rooms have these funky doors. we, like everyone else, had a room mix up. they accidently assigned us the same room as another couple. the room we got was OK, but it was so humid. the a/c didn't really work and they had left the window open to cool things off, and its too noisy in boston to sleep with the window open. the furnishings and bathroom we weren't were decent and tasteful, except for dirty spots on the walls. in the end, we wish we had driven back to burlington to stay at the their very nice marriot - which we paid $40!!!!

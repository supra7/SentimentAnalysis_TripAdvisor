Well, I stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks. I would say the hotel is nice but nothing great. The staff are very polite and helpful. Pros: Fully equipped kitchen (it might miss some utensils ask the frotn desk) LOCATION (just 1 min walk to Hollywood Blvd) Good deals on the nightly rates Cons: They renovated it but the rooms look very old and archaic TV is aged and channels suck Laundry room sucks even more No b/f

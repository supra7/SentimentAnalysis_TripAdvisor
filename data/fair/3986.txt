Disappointing and watch the final bill I've stayed at quite a few of the Morgan group hotels and whilst most of them are starting to look a bit dated (given the price) I've returned as generally the atmosphere makes up for it. I wouldn't return to The Clift; the Redwood Bar is fun and the concierge/front door staff are all good but that's about it. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen (and I had a loft suite) - and for the price other hotels offer more (no flat screen TV, ineffective air con). What really irritated me was when I checked my credit card they had charged me an additional US$185 for late checkout without any notification (I had used their express checkout service and left the room by 11.00am). E mailed the hotel twice - no response and finally had to phone to obtain a refund - which they made immediately but with no apology or explanation.

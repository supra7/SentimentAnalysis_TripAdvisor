One can overlook the worn appearence of the hotel. It's supposed to be a Grande Dame of Boston. More about the history than about modern convienences. What I don't appreciate is the misrepresenation of the rooms. I booked a Junior Suite based upon the photos availble on the web site and din't get ANY of the "perks". The hotel boasts a higher level floor for suites...I was initially put on the 6th floor...THIS IS NOT TOWER LEVEL as indicated in the description. The room description indicated a comfortable sitting area accompanied by a photo of a nice sitting area, couch coffee table ...NOPE the room just 2 hard straight back chairs. Not a place to relax at all. When I checked in there was a knock at the door from housekeeping looking to take the chairs and bring in a roll away bed for the rest of the guests assigned to the room. WHAT? There was only one guest registered for the room, and I didn't plan on sharing. The upgraded bath, contained an industrial toilet that could be found in any public restroom. ick. A tub that had a weird mushy bottom. and NO SOAP...sigh...small detail that may not bother some travelers, but when it's 4:30 in the morning and have an 8am flight, it's really a sticking point. Then watching the valet bring my car around at 50 MPH down Stuart street sealed the deal. With so many great hotels in the city...this one is a pass!

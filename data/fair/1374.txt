At best I would say this hotel is average, something I would expect from a lesser chain and especially from a hotel that claims to have been updated recently. My first room was next to a very loud ice machine, but to the hotel's credit I was moved to a lower floor and away from the area of the machines. Personally, as a honors member I thought I would be given a higher floor or at least some preference of location. My second room had a television of "little green men" The set was terrible, the colors were not adjustable and the set was of vintage age. Again, unacceptable for a hotel recently updated. The interenet connection did not work either and wireless is only available in the lobby. I complained to the front desk at 6:30AM however, at 7:30PM the problems had not been addressed. I eventually received another vintage tv that favored the red colors rather than green. However, the internet problem was corrected to my satisfaction. Housekeeping varied. I had one person who did clean the room well but the majority of my stay had a person who did not even bother to wash out the coffee cups. The bartender had a habit of charging several of my group for an extra drink that was not ordered. At first I thought it was a mistake until others complained of the same problem. Minor issue, as an honors member, I hoped to receive a morning newspaper, that did not happen once during the entire stay. The hotel also charged me for valet parking daily even after I explained that I did not have a vehicle much less parking in the garage. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and the lobby area clean. The staff was also friendly.

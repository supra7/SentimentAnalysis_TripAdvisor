we stayed at that hotel in last november. at first everything was ok. t s really far away from the centre but ok. however, on our last they all our belongings were stolen, even some of our clothes. the manager did not help us except reminding us that it was our fault??? how I really don't know. because there wasn't any problems with our door and it was locked. she claimed that we could have been left the window open, which is a very stupid idea in winter time in Amsterdam. so ok t s really affordable and we learnt its reason in an annoying way

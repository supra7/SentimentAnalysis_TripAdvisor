We had numerous luggage bags with small children and no one offered to assist us. Front desk never greeted us night or day within a 4 day stay. Rooms were noisy-you could hear all of the street traffic. When the only request was made-which was for a taxi van to go to airport-REQUEST DENIED!!! Front desk stated we did not have disabilities so they could not request a van for us. We phoned the taxi service ourselves and a van was ready for us as requested! Also, we had 4 people in our room and 2 washcloths everyday. Poor, poor service. Will never stay at another Kimpton.

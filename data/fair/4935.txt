The hotel is not as bad as reviews had made it out to be. I arrived and was greeted by a friendly woman on the front desk, and all staff were always very helpful and always smiling. The only problem I had with my room was with a light which broke, and the guy at the front desk said he'd have someone fix it. I had been in the room less than 2 minutes when an electrician showed up and fixed the light. That was good service. The hotel is also really well located. It faces Grant Park and Lake Michigan, and its location on S. Michigan Avenue is wonderful - only a 10-minute stroll into the Loop, or, if you're lazy like me, one stop on the El from Roosevelt station, which is just 1 block away from the hotel. The free breakfast was also great, as was the coffee on tap. However, there were some problems with the hotel. Firstly, the temperature control in the room was done by a big, clunky and old fan unit. Which means that every time the temperature drops below the thermostat level, the whole thing shudders into action and really noisily pumps air into the room. This was sufficient to wake me up several times per night. Secondly, the thermostat controls did not make sense. When I tried to use them, they came apart and I found that there was an unhealthy-looking little vial of mercury strapped to the inside with tape. But the one thing which was not welcome was the fact that soaps/shampoos were not replaced. I was at the hotel for several nights and found that after the first night, hotel soaps and shampoos which I used were not replaced, meaning that every night I had to walk down to reception to get soap and things.

As stated in other reviews, there is currently construction going on at the property, but other than the inconvenience of rerouting, we heard no noise and the workers are all professional and focused on their jobs. However, the whole building needs complete renovations... After checking in (with a very courteous front desk staff I might add), we took the elevators up to the room. Before even getting to the room, we had to walk down the hallway where the floors are so off kilter that there is the constant impression that it will collapse at any moment - easily 5-10 degrees off level down the length of the hall. The door to our room was warped and would not close completely (you have to use your body weight to push the door enough to close the security latch) and the layout of the room was horrible - if you open the front door all the way, it bangs into the table that is in the kitchen area (and dont even get me started on the way that the bathroom is designed). Speaking of the bathrooms, it was very disappointed to see old, frayed towels being hung in a Holiday Inn - we arent talking slightly used...we are talking ones that have long since been donated to the local community college since they are no longer presentable to company. Just embarrassing. The hotel does offer breakfast vouchers for their guests, so we tried Reflections one morning. Only one morning. We were there during the week so it wasnt the buffet and it was highly disappointing. Eggs: overcooked. Potatoes: old, soggy, and tasteless. Bacon: cold, coagulated grease. I am hoping that it was just a poor reheat, but regardless, it was so nasty that we left it on the plate and drove down to McDonalds. Depressing. We wont stay here again and we were very disappointed with this hotel. Stay somewhere (anywhere) else and you will be much happier...

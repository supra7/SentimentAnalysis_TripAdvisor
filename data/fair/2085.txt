Upon arrival, we set up the luggage rack and found a dirty sock! The walls are paper thin and the light of day blinded us in the morning, they only have old-fashioned roller shades to cover the windows! This hotel is tired and in desperate need of a facelift. The pillows were either too hard or too soft and the bathroom was very tiny. Loved the location but we won't stay here again.

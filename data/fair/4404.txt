This should be a budget hotel for the poor quality of service offered, old rooms, small toilettes, old furnitures, old windows you cannot even close ... But I paid 100 pounds for a single use room. Hotel gave me a quad room but most probably because they did not have single rooms ... Breakfast is very very poor in a small room of 9 square meters, a continental breakfast very bad served ... Butter left on the tables with no ice, chees standing on a table to the air not protected from bacterial .. Receptionist are very kind and offers good service but I cannot promote this property at all. Price should be the half, breakfast should be reviewed and management should look better about many things like staff lefting cleaning products and instruments on the entrance to the bakfast room near the food! Location is good and easy to find just 300mt from Notting hill tube.

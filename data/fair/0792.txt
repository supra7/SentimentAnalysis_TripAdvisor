This is not a Boutique Hotel. It is a small Hotel, with no Public area, lounge or bar.Our room was small although nicely decorated. Over priced and over rated. They double booked our first night of our honeymoon and put is an inferior sister hotel.We were only in Rome for 2 nights, so 1 night in 2 hotels. The staff could not have cared less - go elsewhere!

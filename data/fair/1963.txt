The area is dicey especially at night...no on sight parking. The hotel has no air conditioning in the rooms. When I asked the manager, his response was..."Most hotels in Seattle don't have air conditioning because we have such inclement weather most of the year"... well I suppose these were a rare few days that it was rather warm or maybe I looked like I just arrived from Mars. We had two fans brought to our room just to have some air flow going. The rooms were basic and somewhat clean... smells from other guests cooking... dicey looking guests. Would I stay here again? No...don't think so. However, I might add the nail salon a few doors down was handy.

I was impressed with the hotel grounds, all the pretty lights in the trees as you arrive and the tour of the birds was great for me and my 3 yo but the service for the most part was awful. We had a massive ant infestation in our rental car on day 3 of our 7 day trip due to the valet parking our rental SUV right on an anthill and after repeated requests they still never cleaned it out. I did not expect such lack of care at what is supposed to be a nice hotel chain. I asked for help on the 2nd day the car was brought to me by the valet full of ants(how could you not see them they where EVERYWHERE even my 3 yo was squishing them while in her car seat) and after waiting for 15 min I just drove off and wiped the car down myself. the next day we were assured they would clean out the car, but again thy brought it back full of ants. Finally they offered to just drive us to our dinner reservation, which they booked for us(yes we did tip the concierge for that) and upon arrival we found out they hosed up and booked us for two nights later(we were leaving the next day). The beds were awful as well, my back still hurts! The kid pool needs some upgrades/replacement of the turtles and dolphin which all showed wear and tear exposing the foam inside(yuck and not sanitary). The only thing I can say we liked is the Cobb salad, the gourmet PB&J we kept ordering from the poolside cafe and their BLT&A was awesome although both were way overpriced. We did have a few nice encounters with the in room dining gentlemen and housekeeping ladies. They were all very kind to my 3 year old and left her lots of chocolates and bird cards and were very fast to respond and thorough to clean up a broken glass in our room which was totally my fault. We also liked the bird tour and feeding the Koi everyday at 0900. I would not stay here again,we only did because my husband was attending a conference there.

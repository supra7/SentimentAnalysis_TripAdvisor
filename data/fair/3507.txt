First of all, the location was wonderful, can't complain a bit about that. We arrived in early at around noon and were told we'd be able to get into a room by 1:30-2:00. We came back at 2:30 with still no room available. At this point, they asked if we'd be willing to be in a smoking room while admitting that if you're a nonsmoker, these rooms have a pretty strong smoke scent. We agreed to take a room on a lower floor that what we originally booked just so we could get into a room. The front desk girl acted like we were really asking alot to get into a room. I'm not sensitive at all to attitude, but this girl had a really apparent one. She knew that we were rushing to get into the room as we had to get over to Letterman by 3:00. We waited for 20 minutes before our bags got upstairs and had to make two phone calls before we got them. Once insdie the room I was not impressed. The hotel definitely tries to be hip as we had a blue room with several other blue references. Unfortunately, they forgot the simple things like cleaning/replacing the bedspread (significant white stains on the bedspread and area headstand and holes in the bedspread), fix up the bathroom (huge crack on the side of the sink going all the way down to the floor). We stayed one night and couldn't get out of there fast enough to move to a nicer hotel!!! The cheap price definitely corresponded to the quality of the hotel. The only redeeming value was the location.

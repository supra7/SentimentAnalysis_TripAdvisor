Great Location, Not so Great Staff nor Hotel Itself Just like all of the reviews said, the location is great. Lincold Rd, Collins Ave, Ocean Drive and of course the beach are all very close to the hotel. You dont need to rend a car at all. The hammocks in the hotel are great and very relaxing. On the other hand, the hotel is pretty old and it definately feels like it. The staff was unattentive and even a little rude. If you don't speak Spanish, they completely ignore you and first service those people who do speak Spanish. The staff does not dress in uniforms, never smile, and all seem like they hate being there. Not friendly at all.

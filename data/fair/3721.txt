Our family stayed four nights at the Peabody Orlando. The bedspread in our room was soiled. The drain for the bathtub did not work properly and forced us to stand in drain water while showering. Although we brought this to the hotel's attention, it was never corrected. The staff were polite and helpful. The whirlpool was out of service while we were there. The hotel's website advertised complimentary towels and sunscreen at poolside, but we found only the towels. The sunscreen lotion was in a glass showcase and was offered for sale. This hotel is in a nice location if attending the Conference Center in Orlando. Otherwise, I suggest people shop around as there are nicer hotels in Orlando for less money.

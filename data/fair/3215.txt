We stayed recently for one week on vacation at the Dauphine. Security is a very big issue. On our last night, I was awakened about 6:00am hearing my room door opening. I could see light coming in from the hallway. Scared half to death I froze in bed, soon the light went away...maybe i had coughed or something and scared the person out. When I was able to get up, I looked out the peephole and saw a mans face looking back,his hand was reaching for the door again so I hit the doorknob,he jumped back and took off. Mind you the deadbolt had been locked when I went to bed. Maybe someone has a pass key?? Management was informed, but did not seem too bothered by this. The rest of the stay had been great. Beds were comfortable, gracious staff and wonderful extended breakfast. The stay would have been perfect except for the probable thief. Next time I would stay elsewhere.

The best part of this hotel is the location - near Downtown Crossing and an easy walk to Fanieul Hall and the North End. This is a 3-star hotel at best. The bed literally sagged in the middle, even with the extra "topper" they used to camouflage the poor mattress. The pool / fitness room is accessed via the 6th floor. However, once on the 6th floor, you have to walk down 3 flights of stairs to reach these facilities. The walls are incredibly thin - as in you can hear your next door neighbor cough, talk, etc. There are too many other great hotels in Boston - even at a discounted Priceline rate - to waste the night at this one.

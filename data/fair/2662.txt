This is the best location any hotel has to offer in Daytona Beach Fl. However you have to get past the snotty staff, the bell hop that is 80 and is nasty to you if you pick up a heavy bag because you don't want him to get hurt, you have to be okay with an air conditioner that has a mind of its own, a bed that will leave you with a sore back, wallpaper coming off the wall in the bathroom, house keeping standing outside your room 1.5 hours before checkout waiting to clean your room, how about the concert directly out of our room that was so loud it made the lamp rattle, and did I mention that they have pulled off the sleaziest don't open this envelope until after you have eaten your dinner to see if you get a discount on your meal at the hotel. I call it the dinner lottery. In short we have stayed at many Hilton properties and I would rate this the worst Hilton property ever. If this was a days inn I would have never said a word but this is not the Hilton standard that their clients have come to expect.

Newton Hotel is conveniently located in a not-so-fancy section of Upper West Side, less than half a block from 96th Street metro station. From there you can get to midtown in less than 15 minutes, which is more than OK. The property is a little bit outdated. The elevator iwas kind of old and somewhat slow. Our room was quite big for NYC standards, but the furniture, curtains and carpet would surely benefit from some update. Bathroom was clean and spacious, but it looked like taken out of a tacky 70s movie. Front desk staff was helpful, and we could get to our room at 12 pm., what was quite nice of them. However, the night shift guy was not as friendly, and when I asked for a razor blade he instructed me to go to next-door convenience store. It was a rather minor issue, but as we had a pretty expensive rate (290 USD for a double room for a night), that comment added insult to injury. I know that NYC hotel prices have gone crazy, but we left there feeling that we paid much more than what the room was worth. Sure, we had a good nights sleep, but the rate should have been less than a third of what we paid.

I can not say that you get what you are paying for, couse this is Maui. The same standard in California would cost about 40 dollars and we paid 120 dollars + tax. The first night we had problems with bugs in our hotelroom. I phoned the servicedesk and it was okey for me too change room the next day. He told me he was sorry about this and everything felt good. The next day when I went down to the Desk I didnt get the same treatment.. The lady who was working was really really rude! She treated us like we were buging her!! Crazy! The rest of our staying was good but I dont think I would like to go back to this Hotel.

The location is good - really good since its downtown Lahaina. Plus it was cheap. The air conditioner was really really loud - that said we didn't actually notice until it was late at night and all the exterior noise from the people outside the hotel died down - and we didn't complain to the hotel, I'm guessing that we could have got another room, but we only stayed one night so we didn't give t much thought. As for a previous post I read - yes, no elevators, but one flight of stairs is not going to kill you. Parking is kind of far, best to drop your bags at the hotel and then take your car to the lot - no valet parking here.

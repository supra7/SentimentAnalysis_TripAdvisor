my friends and I decided to do a quick weekend trip to vegas, and booked the Trump through Priceline for a very good rate. I had read all the reviews, and thought I could live with it. Well, we arrived at 3:30 (check in time was 3) only to wait in the check-in line for almost 40 minutes. W hen we arrived at the front, they told us they had no rooms that were clean and we would need to wait an hour. So we left our luggage with the bellman, and walked across to Nordstrom (the only good thing about this hotel). When we came back and finally got into our room it has a giant soaking wet spot on the carpet between the bathroom and bedroom. about 10 minutes later, the housekeeper opened our door without knocking and told us our room hadnt been cleaned still and we needed to leave. She said she would come right back and never did. SO GROSS!!! when our luggage was finally brought up, we realized my friend's camera was missing from her bag which was partially open. The bellman said they didnt have it, so we figured maybe it fell out in the car. The valet said they didnt have it, so my friends camera was stolen by someone, probably a hotel employee. After goig out that night we arrived back at the hotel just before 3am. at 6:30am the housekeeper decided to come back (but this time she rang the doorbell about 3 times) which was so itrritating because we were trying to get some sleep. We didnt even bother checking out because we figured the staff would probably keep coming into our room unannounced anyway and they would figure it out soon enough. Overall, this hotel has a 5star lobby(not including the check in process), but 2* everything else.

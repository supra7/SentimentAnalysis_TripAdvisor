I was aware that this is a 2-star hotel, but maybe it's because of all the glory reviews that gave me the impression that this must be a hotel better than 2-star. I was wrong. This is exactly a motel with old buildings and furniture. Our first room was a garden-view room, and had a strong mold smell when we first entered. It has 2 full size beds, and my fiancee is 6 feet tall and his legs were hanging outside of the bed when lying down. I called the front desk, who were very quick to give us a queen size bed room with an ocean view. I was thankful for that. The 2nd room it felt a little bit cleaner. Though upon a close loo, the couch is very dirty and has turned black, but they covered it with new fabrics, but most of the "black" arm areas are still showing. The worst thing is the noise from the air conditioner and the traffic. We stayed at 508, and it is right on the side of the road. Normally I am a deep sleeper, but this time round, I couldn't even fall asleep. I tried to turn off the air-con only to find out that the noise from the traffic is continuous (busy road) even at night. I decided to leave the roaring air-con on so that it covers the traffic noise. Bed is too soft for my liking, and luckily the bedsheets felt clean (or so I told myself). Maybe the first room would have been better noise-wise, but it just wouldn't have worked for me and my fiancee. Front desk did try and give us a "better" room w/o the extra ocean view charge. There's a microwave, only it is behind the front desk to be shared by everyone. I have never seen this before, even other motels I went to have microwave in each room. TVs are old, and maybe 13" big. Picture quality was poor (i.e. snowing effect on tv). I have to say it is my first time in Maui, so I had too much hope for what I was going to get. Though I didn't come to Maui to stay in the room, I like to come back to a place where I feel comfortable in at nights. I am disappointed with my own hotel choice this time.

Do not stay here if you have kids. I wouldn't expect a hotel to offer cribs for babies if the rooms were not large enough to accomadate the crib. The only logical space for the crib leaves appx. 6" of space to exit the room... Total fire hazard. When I called the front desk to see if there was a larger room option, I was told all the rooms were the same size. This is a total falsehood because our aunt stayed on the same floor with a much larger room. I then went to the front desk and was told there was no other option. Very dissapointed. Don't waste your money!

Upon departure we wanted to inquire to send our paremts here next year, only to learn that all the rates are going up because the hotel is remodeling, so I guess we all have to pay for it!!! That's too bad because the hotel needs A TON of work done if you look all around. The best things about the hotel are the MOST EXCELLANT staff ( although a shoestring staff at best), the location (if you like been away from things ( quietness). Also, the breakfast is very good. The in room dining menu and food is just unacceptable. We had to call the Four Seasons drive out dining and take out from there. The pool bar food is okay at best and the drinks at the pool will put one in a sugar coma. ( look at the ingredients they use) Also, the pool area is very small and outdated. We know in these uncertain times we live in, that there will be other places close by that are competitive to their current rates. Hence, we will not return to pay for their 20 year over due remodeling .project To the top mgmt, that's just the cost of doing business. There is a lot more mgmt needs to do other then add some paint and new furniture before this becomes a 3-4 star hotel.

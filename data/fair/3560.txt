My husband and I have stayed in many New York City hotels and we chose the W because we had heard good things about it and it offered a good location. Upon check in the lack of service was evident. There was no one available to help with bags and lead us to the room. As we opened the door to our king room we were shocked at the small size of it. Only one person could be in the bathroom at a time, the bath had no room to stretch out your legs, the room was dark and offered very little lighting, and the bed took up the entire floor space. In the morning there were very few staff around to say good morning or to ask questions of. Upon leaving we made our way down to the lobby carrying 3 large bags and it was evident we were struggling to open the door to get outside, three staff were standing at the concierge desk and none of them came over to offer help or even hold the door. This hotel is clearly for the younger, party crowd and was a huge disappointment to us.

The hotel is in a very good location and also seems to be affordable. The view from the hotel rooms can be magnificient provided you get a room closer to the top. Unfortunately, the service was during some occasions poor. Breakfast in the restaurant downstairs was for a fee, but that could possibly be related to the type of accommodation (with/without breakfast). The hotel staff was rude and imposing. On one occasion I was waiting for my friend downstairs in the lobby. The receptionist started to interrogate me about the purpose of my waiting and needless to say the questioning was done rather rudely. One night I was awakened by persistent knocking on the door. As it turned out, one of the hotel personnel brought back the laundry but mistakened the room! As a result, night sleep ruined. But the other night I was again forced to wake up at night because someone came to fix the safe! After I checked-out and came back home, I realized that my credit card was charged additional $6. There was no explanation for what I was charged. I never touched the minibar. Somehow I have a feeling that either a cleaner took something from the minibar or the money was simply taken very arbitrarily. It is a too small amount of money to actively fight for, but this was really the last drop that spoiled all my impression about the hotel.

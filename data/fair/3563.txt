My husband and I spent the weekend in NYC to celebrate our wedding anniversary. A friend suggested the W Hotel on Lexington. We won't be staying there again. The rooms are TINY and the bathrooms are even tinier and nothing special. Our two suitcases were always in the way because there was no where to put them due to the small size of the room. Our 9th floor room view was of a parking garage and a brick wall. I could live with the view because we didn't spent much time in our room however the service wasn't very good. While we were given free internet access in our room, according to the front desk, it was spotty and didn't work well. The telephone in our room didn't work the entire weekend, even after stopping at the front desk at 9am on Saturday morning to ask them to have someone look at it. So if you wanted to contact the front desk or room service, etc. you couldn't. Check-out time is 12pm. It was raining hard so we were sitting in the front lobby lounge and wanted something to drink, like a coke. The bar attached to the lounge wasn't open yet and there was no where in the hotel to get a simple coke. Hello, ever hear of a vending machine? The hotel lobby was generally very noisy with loud music coming from the adjoining lobby lounge/bar. You are not walking into a relaxing oasis when you come in from the street--it was like walking into a dance club. I'm really glad we didn't pay the full room rate for the room because it wasn't even worth the reduced rate. We will be returning to NYC but not to the W Hotels.

This may work for business travellers, but it had nothing to recommend it for my wife and I on a holiday weekend. The room was nice and spacious and very clean. I was shocked to find myself pressured into paying over $40 for parking. This is at the top end of market price in this area of Seattle, but the staff do not offer any realistic alternative upon arrival Very poor front door service! Everyone else was fine mind you. Also, this is a climate controlled hotel, and we could not find a comfortable setting for sleeping. As a result we both slept very poorly for the 2 nights we were there. I would not stay here again. nor would I recommend it to anyone.

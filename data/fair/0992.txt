Reviews are accurate. Excellent beach and location. Hotel has some renovated and some non renovated rooms. I heard overheard numberous guests at front desk complaining about their rooms and wanting a change to a remodeled room. We had an old room. Was terrible. Mold in the closet, old beds, nasty carpet, 1960s bathroom, no fan, and a half working AC. However, Hotel was kept very tidy, and the grounds was very nice. The hotel is somewhat cheezy/kampy. It reminded me of an old folks home. The staff--very very friendly. I believe this with coupled with the location and price is why people stay here. Also, the lunch buffett was the nastiest buffett I believe I have ever seen....and I'm serious. It looked like leftovers from our Luau--3 days prior. We turned right around and ate somewhere else. (There are numberous places to eat just yards from the hotel). I honestly can't give it a terrible rating because of the staff, location and grounds. If you're used to a Hyatt/Sheraton,etc...then stay there....you will be very unsatisfied with this property. The Whaler next door is an excellent alternative as well.

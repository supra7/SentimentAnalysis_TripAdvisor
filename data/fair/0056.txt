Enjoyed the hot apple cider on the first 2 nights in the lobby and missed it tremendously on the 3rd night. Good location next to the pike market. Front desk staff are friendly and try to be helpful. Room smelled of tobacco though it is supposed to be non-smoking room. 2 glasses in the bathroom were chipped or cracked! Quite unexpected for a highly rated hotel. Didn't find the bed all that special too... Didn't find the deck very fantastic....maybe coz it's winter and the winds were too strong to stay in the deck for long.... Room-wise it is a very average 3 star. Hotel wise it has a great location next to the market but that's about it. Was expecting more for the high price....

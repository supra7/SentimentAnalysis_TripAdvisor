Considering the amount of money charged per night, my boyfriend and I were very dissapointed with our three night stay at the Lenox in May. Negatives: It seems that all a hotel needs to be rated 4 stars, is some Aveda hair care products. When we arrived, the hotel had overbooked the king sized bed that we reserved and gave us a room with 2 double beds ( We were able to switch to a room with a king bed the second night). The room itself was dark and faded. The mattresses in the first room we stayed in, were horrible and sunk in the middle. Pillows were uncomfortable, unless you like those pillows you buy at the price club that have absolutely no support for your head. Requests for extra pillows to be brought to our room were not met. No one answered the phone at the reception desk 2/3 mornings when we attempted to pick up our car, so we had to go downstairs and wait for our car. There was also no coffe maker in the room. Positives: Location was great. Hotel room was clean. Lobby was nice, Hotel bar was popular. Aveda hair products. All in all not worth the money

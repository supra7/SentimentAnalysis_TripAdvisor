as we walked into the hotel the reception staff started laughing very loudly, they didnt say hello ...etc. the staff at the front desk were very rude and need more training in how to speak to guests. a lady infront of me wanted to make a complaint about her booking, but the receptionist informed her that there was no managers there and she'd have to complain online. the receptionist didnt apologise for the error in her booking. the room was fine, only complaint was that there were no phones in the room

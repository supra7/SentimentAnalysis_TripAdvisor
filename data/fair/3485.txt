The one saving grace of this hotel is that is very well situated, right on Times Square and close to all the Theaters; but the hotel's appearance and their service are bad. To begin with, there's the doorman who stood outside all day and night smoking and chatting with girls, not only he doesn't bother opening the door for you but he just stands there blocking it! I thought it was very rude and unprofessional. The next thing you find when you go to register on their mini reception area is that is across from their restaurant/bar. We arrived at night and the music was so loud we could barely hear a thing! not to mention that the bar crowd look a bit sketchy. The room was small and the bathroom even smaller! I mean tiny. The view was the back of other buildings but I guess it's NY and not everyone can get a view, I understand that. The bed was comfortable, but whoever cleaned the room before we got in didn't do a good job. There was garbage in the floor! First impression was terrible and I just didn't enjoyed the place the rest of our stay. I loved NY but I will never come back to this hotel.

The pools were outstanding. My son of 7yrs old loved them. But to find a chair or shade was not easyly done. I had to pay 150 a day to have a cabanna with service, which seemed alot since we paid alot to stay there, with a 35 $ service fee for the resort. The rooms were large and nice seperate bath and seperate shower but smell of mold through out the room. The rooms where very weathered and outdated linnens. The burgers were good at the pool and the beach is the best. Next year I would stay on that beach, but at another hotel with better service.

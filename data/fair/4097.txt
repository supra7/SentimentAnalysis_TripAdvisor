I have stayed at every nice Las Vegas hotel for business reasons, since the Mirage opened in 1989. And while Encore is the newest large property, it is among my least favorite. Virtually all the hotel public spaces (except some gambling) are located a good distance away in the Wynn. Therefore, if you want to want to eat after 10 pm, play poker or see a show, you will need to walk the long way under the street through a never-ending tunnel to get to the Wynn. Once you get in the Wynn, you still need to find the attraction you are interested in, further in to the casino. Not great if you have someone with even slight problems walking long distances. Our group went to see a show and returned about 10 pm. The Encore staff told us to go to this restaurant or that restaurant at the Encore, not knowing which were opennone where (on a Saturday night). No one wanted to walk all that way AGAIN so we went to lobby bar, receiving the worst service in Nevada: One hour wait to order, one hour wait for food, wait staff arguing with us on what we ordered. Why cant they just say they are closed? While all the rooms in the Encore are suites please keep in mind, this room will be below expectations if you have ever stayed in real suites. The room is on the large side, with a flat panel television dividing the sleeping and sitting areas. A true suite has a separate sitting room with partial bathroom. That way you can have friends or associates visit or meet and not tromp through your sleeping area. Like the Wynn, Venetian, and Palazzo, Encore sprays scent in all the public areas. I am not allergic to anything and I am home for more than a week now and cannot speak. I started getting sick before I spent the first night and it only worsened. Alas, to get a cough drop, you need to leave the Encore/Wynn, so I just left town. DONT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT THE EXERCISE AND YOUR WHOLE GROUP IS UP FOR IT.

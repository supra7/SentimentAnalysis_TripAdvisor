I am a business traveller coming to Dubai a lot and stayed in many hotels here. I have no idea how the others are recommending this hotel over and over. For the price you can get much better deals in Dubai. We paid around 100 USD per room/night. Here are my honest points: - Rooms: The rooms are ok and within the 4 star standard of Dubai. Good are the washing machine, microwave, cooking plates, fridge etc. - for a family who stays longer here and need to cook etc. This is the first hotel room where the TV can NOT be seen from the bed. The TV is in the living room part of the room. - Internet: You have wireless in the room (the internet is very slow, I made a speedtest and had around 180 kbs for download). This is enough for a very low quality skype connection but not more. Sure not appropriate is the 450 AED they are charging me for one week. If you need a wired connection the cable you have to use will reach maximum the couch - not the bed. - Food: The breakfast is really horrible. Please see the pictures for more reference. So you can see the evidence The selection is very very small. Nearly nothing is there. Only one juice (package), one type of bread, small and try sausages, the scrambled eggs were already gray. So sliced cheese, nothing. I have never seen such a small selection in any hotel - whereever I have stayed in the past. Only plus - if you ask they cook a omlette for you. by the way: If you are muslim take care. There was ham served inside sandwiches without any special sign in front of it. General: The hotel is close to the emirates mall, this is a plus of course. When I arrived the code card was not correct programmed so I could not open the door. When I came back to the reception the worker there offered me to send somebody to show me. She was behaving like I am a complete idiot. I am very dissapointed about the price and what you get for it.

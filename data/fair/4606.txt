when in Hawaii, go for something better than this! The Hotel is well located and that is about it when it comes to good things. They dont even have a bar!!! We spent 8 nights there and had 3 days of heavy rain and you can not even get a drink without leaving the premises. Rooms are ok with little balconies which are dangerous experience. According to hotel clerk, we got the best room with the best view, so if that is the best I can only assume how the rest looks. For the price we paid for high season (new year) we still regret we did not spent extra few bucks for a resort like Hillton or Mandarin (the difference was cople hundred, but we booked late and this hotel was only available.) Concierge was quite bitchy when she realised that we are not from US. She did not bother to recommend us a decent restaurant and tried to sell us some ------ show. I wouldn't go there again.

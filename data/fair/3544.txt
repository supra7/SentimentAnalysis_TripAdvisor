A strong brand and parentage of the Starwood group drew me to the W. Add the fact that its a business hotel! You would think you can't go wrong with that but think again. The rooms are tiny. I was upgraded and still the room was so small I couldn't walk without bumping in to something. The lighting is very poor. Being in Lex, the hotel is surrounded by taller buildings, hence, natural light is obviously low. However, the in-room lighting is so low it only adds to the dingyness The staff was surprisingly unprofessional. I was in my room changing when they barged in for room cleaning, without knocking. Apart from that though, the staff was just fine. The location- 49thy on Lex- is pretty depressing given it sees no sunshine even in the middle of July. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. I love the W and stay frequently at the W in Boston, New Orleans, Hong Kong, but nay, for New York. For a price of $250 per night, never again.

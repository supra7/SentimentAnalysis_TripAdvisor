I agree with the others that the staff is very rude. I had a bigger problem. When we got home lokking at my credit card bill i realized they had over charged me by $156.00. I called and everyone gave me the run around. I left messages on4 different people's voice mail and no one has called me back in 10 days. I called back and said I wanted to talk to a person and no voice mail. The second in command said the finical person would called my back either that day or the next morning. Guess what? Five days later no one has called me back. The people it did talk to were very short with me. I repeat DO NOT Stay at this hotel

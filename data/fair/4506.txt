Skip it It wasn't terrible but there are more than some problems. There are great inconsistencies in the rooms. One in our group had new carpet while others had carpeting ready for the trash. One room had no bedside lamps and another had two. There was no alarm clock and with no one at the desk, a wake up reminder was impossible--unless the noise of the trash trucks count. You'll need glasses to see the tiny television which is mounted high on a wall. While the location is good and the attached restaurant ok, this is a place to stay only when there are no other options. The most redeeming quality was the person at the desk and the waiter in the restaurant who were friendly, cordial and helpful.

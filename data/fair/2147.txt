The Hotel is very nice, however we rented a room on the tower level and it sucked! When you took a shower, the bathroom floor flooded, this was due to the poor workmanship of installing the shower doors. "They don't close all the way". The mini fridge did not work! Come on people, when your paying $400.00 a nigt for a room, you would think these things would not be an issue......People are friendly and nice area but not worth the money at all.......

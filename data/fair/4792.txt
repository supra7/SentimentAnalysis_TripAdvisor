The website told that the hotel was perfectly located in "downtown Boston", instead I found out that it was in the heart of the financial district, only surrounded by high buildings filled with offices and banks, in a nest of small roads and very difficoult to find each time I walked back to it. Aside from that, the Hotel itself was filled with buisnessmen, so at the Caf Fleuri,the refined restaurant, it turned out to be that I was infact seated at the worse table, not being rated as an A costumer, wearing my shorts and sandals, instead of executive dresses. Also the reception was rather uptight and seemed not easy with the fact that I was travelling alone. It all seemed very unconfortable to me, considering that from the website this Hotel seemed to be the perfect place to stay as a tourist for a pleasant visit to Boston.

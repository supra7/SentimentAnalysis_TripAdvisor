Daytona beach is sort of a weird place to begin with, but I was hoping the hilton would be an oasis of sorts. It really was no better than a hilton garden inn - in fact in some ways worse. Giant building, long lines at checkin, long lines at the elevator, crumbling old hallways, tiny rooms which haven't been updated in years with small uncomfortable beds and no frills. Took ages to get up and down in the elevator and just full of school groups - sort of felt like staying in a public swimming pool. Took half an hour to get our car at the end.

When I arrived, the doorman wasn't very friendly, or helpful. Check-in wasn't terrible, but also wasn't great. I got a room and immediately when I walked to the room the floor smelled like cigarette smoke. The room was standard small for NYC, but the carpet was dirty, the bathroom had mold and the bed had springs sticking out of it. The shower door didn't shut, and all the crevices in the bathroom had mold. The toilet broke at one point in the stay too. Really, the only good thing I have to say is that it was a good location. The bar or club or whatever is in the hotel draws all kinds of people to the hotel, I didn't appreciate the fact that the elevators weren't key controlled and there were a few people that would come up from the club and just wonder the floors.

We stayed in an interior room located on the fourth floor. The room was clean, but that was about the only positive thing I can say about it. The TV was not working properly with most channels having a green tint, the clock radio was flashing the incorrect time when we arrived and I had to fix it myself, there was no safe in the room, the sink made the most horrible screeching sound the entire time the hot water ran, the walls were paper thin and we could hear the man coughing who was staying in the room adjacent to us as well as the couple above us having sex, and when people walked by in the hallway you could hear their conversations and everything they were saying as if your door were wide open. I knew that this particular room did not have windows, but after two days, this started to feel very claustrophobic and made it hard to wake up in the morning due to the lack of any natural light at all. The courtyard was the main reason I booked this hotel and planned on spending a lot of time relaxing there, however, this was not possible. There were mosquitoes everywhere and we received at least five bites on various parts of our bodies. These mosquitoes were so aggressive that they even bit through clothing! It was too cool to swim, but no one maintained the pool, not even for aesthetic purposes; there were leaves and debris floating in it the entire four days we were there. The vending machines were the only place in the hotel for you to get water, and it was hit or miss whether they worked or not. We had to tell the front desk on two occasions that the machine had taken our money without returning a bottle and she laughed about it and said it was a testy machine (but refunded the money immediately). At $197 a night, we could have and should have done much better than this.

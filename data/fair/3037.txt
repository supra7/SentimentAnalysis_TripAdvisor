If you are looking for a place to relax and feel refreshed, this may not be the hotel of choice. My husband and I stayed at the hotel in October and did not anticipate the number of kids and people in general! It was very crowded and loud. They also placed us in a hotel room right next to the elevator, so not only could we hear everyone waiting for the elevator, but could also hear the elevator whenever it went by! Luckily they were able to switch us out of the room the very next day, which was appreciated. In general the rooms are very small and indifferent. Also, the beach is not the best for swimming as there is a drop off. We headed down to black rock in front of the Sheraton and took off to see other parts of the island, which was great! The hotel's location next to the shops was nice though! We loved Maui and really enjoyed our time there, but we would not stay at the Weston again.

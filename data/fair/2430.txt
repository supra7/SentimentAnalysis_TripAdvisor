The location is great, many other things were not. Topping the list is the loud banging pipes (steam?) that really prevented us from getting a good night's sleep, and isn't that the main goal in a hotel? It took days for them, and several requests, to get the feather pillows and comforters out of the room. We received down-free pillows the first night, but the feather ones weren't removed and the maids kept putting them back on the bed. We would have to go through them ever day to find the down-free ones. The room safe never worked. We complained the first day, it was not fixed and we heard nothing. Their comment that we could go to the front desk and use theirs would not have been convenient because there was almost always a line of 4-8 people, and the time it would have taken to drop off and pick up our items would have taken 20-30 each day. After paying for internet, having read the agreement, we found out that it is per device, not room. It is not stated anywhere that we could find, even after speaking to internet customer service . As we were here for business, several devices were needed, very deceptive! The only place to sit was one desk chair. There seemed to be room for a more comfortable chair, it would have been nice. Definitely not worth our time or money.

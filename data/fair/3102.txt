We booked this vacation(11/4 to 11/9) through their special introduction to Westin, of $749 for five nights, car and $100 resort credit. Closer to our departure date, they offered a $700 upgrade rate for oceanview with an additional $100 resort credit, which I accepted. We are Starwood gold members and were assigned a handicapped room (we are not handicapped) on a Starwood Preferred Floor (what makes it a Preferred Floor?), next to the ice machine and elevators. The room had the king bed, amoire, desk/chair, 2 nightstands and one lonely uninviting wooden chair in the corner. The rug was spotted in several areas, the wall paper was ripped by the lonely chair, the lanai furniture were dirt grey. Our $700 ocean view was beautiful, but just don't look down--the roof tops of Whaler Village. We heard every delivery truck with backup beeps and heard every bottle thrown in the recycle bins. I guess we were slumming because we were part of the $749 package. The bed was heavenly; there were not enough electrical outlets. I had to unplug lamps to recharge phones and cameras. One bedside lamp could not be shut off unless one got up to shut the hallway fixture--to shut both. Spa heavenly massage was wonderful, but don't expect the same sereneness at the overpriced nail salon. Based upon the condition of our room, please don't expect us to take our checkbooks for a Westin timeshare.

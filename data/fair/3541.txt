OK, so this in a pretty handy position for mid town and there is a very trendy bar and Cowshed products in the rooms, but that's about it. They've even got rid of the overpriced retro bar - Whiskey Blue (note: it is still there and overpriced, just now looking a bit more like the interior of Abercrombie and Fitch). The cheaper rooms are tiny - we really struggled to store our luggage. The noise from the bar (which is in the lobby) goes on 'till late, with loud music and despite asking several times, I never managed to get the "free" internet access that should have been included in my rate removed from my bill. Other little things grate, like how slow the lifts are. There are plenty of nearby hotels in and around the price range - pick one of them (for my money, the Marriott)

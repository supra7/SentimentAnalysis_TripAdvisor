The lobby and location are tremendous but the room (18101) was tired beyond belief to carry the Hilton badge. The room was small with a bathroom that was too small to turn around in and the wired internet is ridiculous since many business travelers are ditching their laptops for Ipads. The carpet was coming up in the doorway of my bathroom and the furniture looked like 1989 wanted it back...oh and the retro television (tube type) was another drawback. The slow service of the elevators almost caused me to be late since they were so slow. I've stayed in many historic hotels and really love the atmosphere but they shouldn't get a free pass with a room this tired.

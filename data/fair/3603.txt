My first experience with a W Hotel was in Montreal. Totally enjoyed every minutes of our stay. The next one was the W Hotel Time Square. Not impressed. Average hotel with overly designed features. And then we stayed at this W Hotel on Lexington. Not impressed at all. The rooms were small, way too small. The room was 9 feet wide and 10 deep. It was too small. We went to the bar the first night, the drinks we over priced and not made very well. Like I said, not all W Hotels are created equal. If you are looking for that special experience this not the hotel.

The grounds are awesome and the lobby is quite impressive. All of the employees are gracious and kind too! We booked a deluxe ocean view room and specified no smoking. That was critical as I'm allergic to smoke. Our room was a typical room, nothing deluxe about it. Our view was of the kids pool and all the noise that comes with a kids pool. Our room was non smoking but our neighbors balcony was not. They chain smoked next door and pretty much ruined our use of the balcony. Being a platinum member I was hoping for an "upgrade" to a room with a view that I paid for (the ocean) but no luck. I think for us, flying over 10 hours from the midwest to get here, then having the hotel give us a smoking kiddy pool view room for the "deluxe ocean view" price will prevent us from returning. Another issue was the pool area. People were hogging all the lounge chairs the staff does nothing about it. Sort of like being on a cheap cruise with limited seating. The parking is different since it is one of the very few things that aren't charged for but if the lot is full (as is usually the case) you have to valet for $20/night. If you beg the valet will remove the charge but it's a hassle. One thing to do for sure is the roof top star gazing, awesome views and great insight From Bob.

Me and my family were supposed to stay at the Maui Coast Hotel for 8 nights but we only stayed one. Being four adult women crammed together in a double bed and a sleeping couch is not my idea of a vacation! Even though the staff tried their best we chose to move after the first night. Coming all the way from Europe I expect more from a hotel in Maui. It was poorly situated between buildings with no sight of anything green (except of course for Haleakala in the background) and you had to cross a road to get to the beach. I know of other much nicer and better hotels in the same pricerange placed on the beach near Lahaina, where the view is a whole lot better!

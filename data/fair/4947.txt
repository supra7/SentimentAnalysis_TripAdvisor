I had read several reviews that said that this was a beautiful hotel with an unfriendly staff. They were very accurate. The woman that checked us in upon arrival was very polite and one of the bellmen was also very friendly. They seemed to be the exception to the rule. Upon checking out, we approached the front desk, the employee looked up, said "Last name?" I told her and she said, "You're all set." and walked away. So much for, "How was your stay, etc." I had low expectations because of what I had read but I was surprised by how much they really didn't care. We had a room with two double beds. Upon waking up after getting in late, I realized that the sheets had not been changed from the previous occupants. I left a note for the housekeeper in the morning and they had been changed when we returned. The hotel is very nicely decorated in a contemporary style. Kind of like a low end W hotel. However, the door to our room had such a big gap that the light from the hallway kept us up. Kind of odd. The noise level is very high in this hotel from both inside and outside. We had bid on Priceline and ended up in this hotel. While the location is prime and we had received an excellent price, I wouldn't stay here again. We visit Chicago often and there are many other better choices in the same area.

The good first: The room was adequate and quiet enough (even though I was on the freeway side). I was on one of the top floors. The bed was OK, not totally comfortable. The bad: I was there for a conference. When we left it took over one hour to ransom the car from the parking lot. I've read reviews complaining of this over a year earlier. Apparently nobody cares enough to do anything about it. It must have come as quite a shock to them that they were hosting a conference with 300+ attendees and that when it adjourned, many would want their cars. Some of us had planes to catch. Nobody on staff seemed to care. Over the time of the tripadvisor complaints, they've had the capability of fixing this. But they haven't. The food: Bad. One conference lunch was inedible. I had one ravioli and gave up. I also had bar food downstairs one night and it was awful. Service: at the restaurants it was as slow as at valet parking. We almost had to leave lunch in order not to miss a conference session. The room: Poorly laid out. When you open the shower door the towels are behind the door so you have to get completely out of the shower, close the door behind you and drip water on the floor just to get the towels. The towels are thin, and they only give you two bath towels. The air conditioning did work though and quietly for which I was grateful (it was during a recent heat wave.) The televisions were like a museum of the 1980s. Annoyances: They charge $10 per day for internet. That's like charging for the water you use. Worse actually, the water costs them. The internet does not cost them per your use. For attendees not staying at the hotel, it cost $70 per day. No excuse. Elevators were slow and usually crowded. The card key took repeated insertions to work. While this is not a one-star nightmare hotel, it is bad enough that you shouldn't stay here unless there isn't any choice.

We stayed there during the National Championship game a few weeks ago. Personally, I would never stay there again. First of all there is absolutely no security within the complex. You must walk thru the lobby and the desk person never asks to see your room key, which is actually just a key. This is an issue because the hotel is next door to Jackson Square. While definitely convenient there is a lot of foot traffic walking around. Also, the rooms do not have the electronic keys. This is a major issue especially if you had kids. I would never put my kids into that situation. The doors are hollow and anyone could break into the room at anytime. There aren't even safes in the rooms. In fact we did have someone break into our room and steal our tickets. When confronted the desk they were extremely rude and had total disregard for our situation. They even questioned whether we had tickets. A week or so went by and we discussed the situation with the GM; he questioned whether we had tickets as well. I told him I would provide him the receipt and he said I need a lawyer and hung up the phone. During the whole time, never once did the hotel even offer a small token of understanding, never offered to compensate us even a $1 for our troubles, nor said sorry. You definitely get what you pay for at Place D'Armes. Terrible service, terrible manners, poor leadership and awful consideration for security and the guests well being. If you decide to stay here during peak times like Jazzfest or Mardi Gras, I would put your expectations in the toilet now and assume something will get stolen. In the end pay the extra dollars to stay someplace where safety really matters.

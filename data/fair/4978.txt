My wife and I spent our annivesary weekend at the Whitehall; and boy was it a disappointment. Although the location is terrific, we had a Pinnacle room which is supposed to be their high end room. The room (other than the bedding0 was nothing special. The bathroom needed alot of work and generally, it looked like no one had dusted in the corners for years. The worst part was that we wanted to take a architectural boat trip and the concierge pushed us to take one that was not on the list we had gotten from several travel guides. We paid more at the hotel than we would have paid at the site (including the coupon we had). What a bummer. Never again.

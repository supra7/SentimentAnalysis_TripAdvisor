We stayed in room 502 which had mold and mildew infested shower, busted AC outlet, and service often forgot to look in the shower for dirty towels in need of replacement. Location is great and pricing was fair. On our way out we saw inside the room across ours that was also a deluxe but was almost two times bigger. We passed by Royal Sonesta on Burbon St. and that hotel looked much better while being similarly priced.

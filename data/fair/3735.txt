In preparing for my family's Orlando stay, I picked the Staybridge on the basis of many positive reviews. I am sad to say I now understand why some reviews were positive, while others less so. The benefits of this hotel for us were its location, which is handy to WDW, many restaurants, a pharmacy, and supermarket (walking distance for all but WDW). Other value-added services included the buffet breakfasts, manager receptions (3 times weekly) guest laundry (nominal fee), complimentary newspapers and shuttles to shops and WDW, tidy pool area and grounds, and willingness of staff to respond to issues brought to their attention. The drawbacks we experienced was a room that desperately needed more regular maintenance prior to guest check-in. For example, we were met with carpets that turned our feet/socks black within moments of walking on them, a toilet that would not flush/drain consistently (2 maintenance calls during our stay alone, problem still occuring on check-out), a moldy/mildewed shower head, curtain (a fresh one provided on request), toilet tank filled with mold, a moldy air exchange system, and rumpled bedding that appeared "enjoyed" by the previous guests. We appreciate that cleaning staff in most major hotels have 20 minutes or less to prepare a unit for new guests to arrive, but if you have health issues, such as sensitivities to molds, mildews, or dust mites, this is probably a hotel you want to avoid until the management works out a better maintenance schedule. Think I am being too fussy? Check out what the Centre for Disease Control has to say about exposure to molds and mildews. Offering us a portion of our stay costs back, while acknowledgement of a problem, did not fix the underlying issue, which is the need for better maintenance of the rooms, which I suspect is not unique to this particular property.

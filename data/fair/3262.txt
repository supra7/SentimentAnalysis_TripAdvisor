This is really a nice hotel but don't stay herenif you are from out of town. The valet service damaged my vehicle and painted over it! Worse, hotel management deferred to the valet management to address the issue. The hotel is nice and the location is good but in the event of a problem I would rather be at a better managed hotel.

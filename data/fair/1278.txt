Hotel has a modern feel, with a minimalist decor. Bed is comfortable enough. I was disappointed that there was no tub in the room, after travelling all day. The other disadvantage is that there is no room service. We walked across the street, to another hotel, which had a restaurant on the main floor. Lots of renovation is happening around the property. There was too much black carpeting around the property, which makes dirty very noticeable. We almost got lost on the way to finding it due to bad street signage and road construction, especially at night.

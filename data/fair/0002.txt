I just got back from a three-day stay at the Hotel Monaco Seattle. The bed was very comfortable; the suite was very spacious; the bathroom was very clean. The morning after the first night of my stay, I was sitting at the desk in my room and noticed a very foul odor. ( I had just showered, and all of my clothes were freshly laundered, so it wasn't me.) As I explored, I discovered that the smell was coming from the carpet and the upholstered chairs. One of the chairs had a dark stain on the seat. I don't have anything against pets or pet owners. But I do have a big complaint when a hotel doesn't clean up and disinfect the room adequately after a guest (canine or human) urinates and/or defecates on the carpet or furniture. This was my fifth or sixth stay at this hotel. It will be my last.

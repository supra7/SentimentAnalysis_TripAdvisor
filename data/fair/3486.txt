This hotel was very nice for the most part: clean, friendly service, convenient location, adequate lounge and restaurant. The rooms are on the small side, even for New York standards. We did have one major problem. A group of 20 people (head count provided by the front desk) held a party in a suite on our floor that raged on from 1:00 AM through 6:00 AM. The noise was tolerable when the party was contained to the suite, but when the crowd spilled out into the hallway, the noise was unbearable. The night was a comical cycle of calls to the front desk, security chasing the party back into the suite, only to have the halls filled again minutes after security left. Finally, at 6:00 AM, security escorted the unregistered guests from the hotel. I suppose I am a bit jealous that I was not having a good time with the crowd, but we planed to checkout at 8:00 AM to catch a train home. What was most disappointing was the hotel manager had very little sympathy for us the next morning when we lodged our complaints. She was more concerned over her inconvenience caused by the ransacked suite than the fact we got no sleep. I guess it was silly of me to expect a good night sleep in the hotel room I paid for.

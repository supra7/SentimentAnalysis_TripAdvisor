by name and when viewing their website, one would think this is a 4 or 5 star hotel. Only the price seemed to indicate a 4 or 5 star. However, like the other reviewers, my experience didn't meet my expectations. There is practically no lobby and there are no seats when waiting for your transportation. My room was adequate but noisy. Room service was good and the food was above average. However, the conference food and service was less than average.

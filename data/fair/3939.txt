I found Hotel Rex to be a little on the dingy side, nothing was really clean ... from our rugs... to the bathroom (love finding other people's hair in the shower. Love it.) to the public areas. It's the worst to feel unclean in your own hotel room. But they really tried to make up for it in a lot of ways. Free stuff -- like free WiFi & wine happy hour every day, one of these days they even had a kids string ensemble performing. And we got a great price for the area, since they worked with our friends who were getting married to book a package for them. The concierge was friendly but less than helpful, since he didn't explain we'd need close to a 45min lead time to get a cab to dinner. (How would we know this? We told him hours in advance and he mentioned nothing.) So, I'd stay there again at that price, but if I had to pay "retail" I'd look for somewhere else.

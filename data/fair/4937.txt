Generally, I am a big fan fo Four Seasons properties and while there are no serious issues, there is nothing that special either. Check-in is smooth, efficient and everything that one might expect of the Four Seasons. The desk staff are to be comended for their efficiency as well as their ability to tailor their discussion with guests (eg first time visitor versus business traveler). The lobby is rather unimpressive and could well be a part of a Sheraton or similar mid-line brand. Specifically, the furnishings are mixed and matched and appear to be part of a re-do in process. Floral arrangements are very impressive however. Rooms are fine and the bathrooms very lovely with L'Occitane products. One feature that I really liked in the rooms was the static guard spray. Very nice touch. The bar area is pleasant, and the service nice but really better for a quick business drink rather than anything social. Overall, I would recommend staying at The Peninsula if I wanted a spectacular over the top experieice, with great food spa and service (recently ranked #1 hotel in America by Conde Nast) or Park Hyatt if I wanted excellent service and a good bar.

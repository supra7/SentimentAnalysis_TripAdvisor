Parking is terribly expensive at $42 per night. The rooms were generally clean, but the windows had not been washed in a few years or more. The tub was clogged and taking a shower was like taking a bath. The entire room smelled like smoke, even though the hotel claims to be smoke free. The beds were made with very cheap, scratchy linens and the pillows were not of typical Marriott quality. The cleaning staff were very unfriendly and almost made a face of anger as we walked by and said good morning. We did not eat here because a simple bowl of oatmeal is $12. The location is perfect for walking to the sites. Our friends stayed at the Millenium nearby which was almost $200 cheaper per night. I would not recommend this hotel. It does not represent the standards of a good Marriott Hotel.

I have been staying here for about 10 years for Jazzfest. It is family owned and used to be like a home away from home. Now, the younger generation in the family is running it and it feels like they do not care about comfort of guests. Last year, I woke up during the night to find water pouring from the ceiling in the bathroom. For 2 days, I had to use the bathroom in the lobby before they fixed it. They had known about it prior because there was duct tape on the ceiling where the leak was! They didn't compensate me in any way. This year, when I arrived, the room smelled very musty! The duct tape is still on the ceiling! There is mold and water marks on the ceiling and walls (pictures attached). The shower does not work properly so that several inches of water accumulates in the tub. The toilet bowl handle has been broken for the past 4 years! If you don't push it carefully it falls off and you must open the tank and reassemble it. Meanwhile, at 9:15am, I was woken up by hammering and sawing outside our door. They were building a new room where the office had been. This happened several of the days, but in 4 years, they could not replace the toilet bowl handle in room 105! When I complained about them waking me up and about the condition of my room. Warren, the family member who now runs the hotel shrugged. I let him know I was disappointed and would not stay there again. After being a customer a few times a year, for 10 years he shrugged again and said "Alright".

We arrived on a Saturday. After familiarizing ourselves with the resort, we realized that there was not much to do. So, we upgraded our room to a unit with a private pool, jacuzzi, and outdoor shower. The room was very nice. Dinner was at the Italian restaurant. Portions are very small, but tasty. On day 2 we started to meet a few people as we laid around the pools, and walked on the beach. That night we wound up in a group of about 20 people and dined at the Japanese Restaurant. It was pretty good. That evening we heard that a few people at the resort were sick. In fact some friends we met from Texas were in their rooms extremely ill. That night we got to our room and my wife was very sick all night long. That pretty much sums up our vacation because we both spent the next 3 days sick . The room service was good and they tried so hard to make us comfortable. They sent up a dozen bottles of Gatorade and made us some chicken soup from scratch one night . We heard there were between 40 and 50 people sick in the hotel. I guess it was going on in several hotels. The Hotel was nice for a couple days getaway. Seven nights was definately too long there. We're not gourmet food people. If that is your thing you might like the food. Breakfast was the best meal of the day. There was a little entertainment on the beach the first night and after that nothing for a week. I guess several late nighters would go to Ricks Bar and dance. The best part of the trip was walking north on the beach to Maroma Beach which was absolutely beautiful. The white sands and the turquoise water were definately something to experience. There were areas around the hotel which had a strong septic tank odor. One of them was right outside our door.

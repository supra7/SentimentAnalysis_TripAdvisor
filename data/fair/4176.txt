The airline I work for put me up at this hotel for a couple of months, so I went a couple months with inadequate sleep. The people that work there are pretty nice usually. The shuttle service is amazing...now on to the not so good stuff. The AC does not work at all during the day time in the summer. I think it's just an old system and can't keep up. It works great at night though, even though you could just open a window. During the day it was hot and extremely stuffy. I had to call the front desk and ask for a fan, which they found one for me. It helped a little. This hotel is also extremely noisy. You might as well not have a door, you can hear everything that happens in the hallway. Also, you can hear all of your neighbors conversations among other things. If you just looking for a decent hotel near the airport at a reasonable price, I recommend the Holiday Inn Express down the road. I stayed there for a couple months also, much better!

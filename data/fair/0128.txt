I stayed at the Moore for one night (a Sunday). My room was on the fifth floor and all night long I heard trucks and buses thundering by. It was so loud, I didn't get any sleep. I even had earplugs, but the noise was so loud it couldn't be blocked out. I would not stay here again because it was so aggravating. Now, if you are a deep sleeper, you will be ok! Also, be aware that the hotel has no airconditioning. This wasn't a problem the night I was there, but during warm periods, it would be awful. A positive aspect is that it is very close to Pike Place market.

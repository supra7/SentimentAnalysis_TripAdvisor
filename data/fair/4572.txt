Bed was 30 years old This hotel was very nice. The pool and beach access was great. We stayed three nights. The biggest problem was the bed. It was really old. It took my fiance and me four days before our bodies recovered. I would have switched rooms and requested a better bed, but I didn't realize what the problem was until it was too late.Everything else was nice. If you want to stay here, ask for a room with a newer bed. I believe there are old and new sections of the hotel.My fiance chose this hotel very carefully - for the Hawaiian experience. He proposed to me on this trip and he wanted it to be special. I felt bad for him because this hotel experience put a damper on the trip. My back and neck were so bad that it interfered with my activities and I had to stay on Motrin. One other problem was that we called down for our car and 45 minutes later we discovered that no one went to get it. This set us back an hour and we had a lot planned for that day.

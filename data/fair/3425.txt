I was there for four days in late July 2011 and think it would be nice to keep the hotel guests' luggage for a short period. On the contrary, had to use a fee based system to keep it for two hours, while having lunch in the vicinity, after check-out. Another negative aspect was the refusal of a maid to help my wife to open the door of a toilet for public use at the hotel. Carlos - Brazil

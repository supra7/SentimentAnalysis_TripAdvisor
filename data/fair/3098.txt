Lynda and I have just come back from 7 nights in Waikiki, 7 nights in Maui and 4 nights in L.A. By far the most disappointing of our stays was at the Westin in Maui. Maui was lovely, and we did all the trips, overawed by the whales, fell in love with the dolphins and the pacific green turtles, but the Westin was a concrete souless block of rooms which seemed to underline all the excesses of America today. Far too expensive, the food in the "resturants" within the hotel was "plastic" and we much preferred the Hula Grill (next door) or most nights we ate in Lahaina, in the fish resturants (Opah, Mahi Muhi and Ona were my favourites). I did have one breakfast in Ono's (I think) and I sat next to a lady who proceeded to have 12 waffles in one sitting. I felt a bit queasy watching her, so perhaps the food was better than I gave it credit for. I upgraded ($700) to an Ocean VIew room, and it was quite nice to see the humpbacks breaking the surface out in the bay. The hire of the sunbeds at $25 and the cabanas at $60 was laughable, and we heard quite a few complaining about that. Nature gave us a beach and what better way to enjoy Maui than the lie on a towel on the sand, soaking up the rays. The Westin didn't even come near the Moana Surfrider in Waikiki, and much preferred the cosmopolitan mix of Waikiki than the predominantly American clientelle in Maui, and if I ever hear the word "awesome" again, I think I'll scream. Hawaii lovely, Waikiki interesting, Maui beautiful, Moana Surfrider classy but Westin eeuch, not for us, thank you!!

Stayed only one night, we moved to another hotel (Art'otel) for the rest of our stay, and very happy with our decision. The room was clean but quite small. The safety box did not work, no fridge in the room and extremely noisy during the morning. If we knew there was a construction site right outside our windows we would have requested another room, I wish the hotel would have advised us that there was going to be so noisy to either change hotel or even pay a bit more for another room. Unfortunately overall the experience was not a good one. I would say there were only 2 positives, the room was clean and walking distance (5min) to the U.

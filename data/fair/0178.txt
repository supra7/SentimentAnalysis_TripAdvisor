The rooms in this hotel are small, but clean. The staff was courteous, but not helpful. I have three complaints. My room was very noisy. I could hear the pipes rattling all night when people ran water or flushed the toilet. And I could hear the people in the next room dragging their hangers across the clothes rods in the closet. These noises made it really hard to sleep and I am not a light sleeper. I think a light sleeper wouldn't get a wink of sleep in this hotel. Although the front desk staff was very nice when I asked her to send a fax, she didn't actually send it. I didn't learn that she never sent the fax until I returned home--three days after I thought my fax had been sent. I asked the front desk to send up a bottle of hair conditioner. The person sent up a PARTIALLY USED bottle of the same conditioning shampoo I already had. That grossed me out.

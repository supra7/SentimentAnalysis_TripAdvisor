We used to be Westin "regulars" but this hotel has changed that. It needs to be totally refurbished. It's staff also needs to pay attention to its upkeep and cleanliness. We had room service one night. The dishes stayed in our room. we placed them in the hallway next to the door. They sat in the hallway for 2 days. (they may still be there). The lobby bathroom was disgustingly dirty on two occasions. It seems the staff is just not paying attention to things that Westin used to be known for. And upon arrival they would not honor our AAA rate because they said that we did not book it with that rate (we did). The desk person said that the room had to be booked with that rate or we would forfeit our reservation and would not have any room because they were "full." We paid the rack rate. The hotel made about $100 off of us, but lost our goodwill and future business (hope it was worth it for Westin). The positives: it is a great downtown location. Close to everything. Parking at the Westin self park is reasonable ($22/ with in out privileges). The concierge was awesome -- but very busy. Lobby area and bar with free wi-fi (helpful IT staff) albeit a bit noisy. I think that they sell out to the cruise ships and that is impacting the quality. Fitness room was tiny and outdated. breakfast at the cafe was very good but noisy, very crowded and expensive.

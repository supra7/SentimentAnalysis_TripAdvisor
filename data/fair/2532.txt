I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights in November 07. The main purpose of the trip was shopping so we did not need a lot in a hotel as would rarely be there. The hotel is beautiful and is being refurbished. It is centrally located with all the major shops near it. The Magnificant mile is right on the corner too which was great. To get to other major stores on the mag mile we took a taxi as it is a bit of a walk. The food was nice also in the hotel but a bit pricey. For breakfast we went to coffeee shops which are on each corner of the hotel which worked out much cheaper. There is a pub / restaurant beside the hotel called Millers. The food is amazing in this place and such good value. would definetely recommend this. Although the hotel was beautiful and i would stay there again due to its great location, we had a lot of problems when trying to check in. There was 3 of us and we had booked a triple room. When we checked in they were giving us a double bed and fold out bed, we had paid for a triple and had all the confirmation with us. They were not too happy about acknowledging this and changing the room until I would not let the issue go. We had to spend the first night in a double room with fold out bed and were moved the 2nd night to a fabulous triple room which was newly refurbished. So it worked to our advantage in the end. Each time i complained about the room, i was told different things by different people. To check in and get things sorted took a long time and they were very slow (but i think this is the American way from what I saw). Other than that the hotel was very nice and bustly with people and atmosphere. Would recommend again.

After hearing me rave about my stays at the W: Tuscany, my then-boyfriend booked us a room at the flagship W the weekend he proposed. The proposal was great. The room was not. It was TINY and had definite signs of wear (there was an actual hole in the wall of the bathroom where the doorknob had hit a few too many times, or maybe someone's fist? Who knows...) The room I had at the W: Tuscany was huge -- it had a sofa, a huge bed, and a great bathroom. I assumed they were all like this - they're not! Looking around our room, I could tell my husband was like "THIS is what you've been raving about?!?!" At almost $400 a night, we felt cheated. Here's how I see it: since this W is the first one they built in NY, it's the oldest and has the most problems. They made sure future Ws didn't have the same problems, hence the other Ws in NY are probably all really great. Besides the small room, the rest of the our stay was fine. The bath products are Bliss, which was really awesome. We had many drinks in their cool lobby bar and even though we were paying through the nose, the drinks were very strong and well made. To sum up, I still love W hotels, but I would make sure to stay at the Tuscany or the Court the next time. (I left off the W Times Square because I've never stayed there)

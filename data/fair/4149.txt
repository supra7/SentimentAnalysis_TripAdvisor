Great location. Paid an unbelievable $329 on Orbitz for the jacuzzi suite (only because it was the last room they had...or so we were told) and I had to join others from my office there on business. The rooms that I saw in addition to mine were excessively large and sparsely appointed. I had 12 ft. ceilngs and an altar like presentation of the jacuzzi, but only two chairs, a desk and bed were the extent of the furnishings. It was like having a raquteball court for a room, with a chair on one end and the TV on the other. Beyond the oddities, it was not clean, despite being pestered all day and night by the cleaning staff wanting to either refill my beverage caddy or just to see if I needed something (most of this should be done at once). I have one word to describe the bathroom, jacuzzi, shower, etc. - hair. Hair, funky smell, and I felt like I was staying in the guesthouse at Graceland.....in 1977. Needs updating. I love Kimpton hotels, but this is unlike any I stayed in before.

How lucky are you? I'm really conflicted on this review. On the one hand, given the market its a pretty good value but on the other hand I wish I had spent the extra $ 50.00 for something nicer. The location is terrific and the staff was very friendly. However, the 39th floor ocean view suite I was upgraded to (since the room with a king bed I thought I had guaranteed turned out to be just a request) was last updated in the 80s with dark brown appliances, coppertone tiles in the bath and kitchen, dark brown matching tub and sinks and what started out as oak cabinetry that had since been painted several times with thick coats of latex paint. Not the kind of thing you expect to see in an upscale ocean view suite. From what I understand, many of the rooms at this hotel are privately owned and Resort Quest only manages them. That makes me wonder if the rooms are all different and your experience will depend on the luck of the draw. Are you feeling lucky punk? Well are you?

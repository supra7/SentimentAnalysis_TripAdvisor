My husband and I stayed at the Park Plaza to take in a show and stay in Boston before leaving on a cruise the next day, so we were only there one night. I was a little nervous because my Aunt had told me that it wasn't what it was cracked up to be on their website. I was so relieved when I walked in and saw their gorgeous lobby. My husband and I travel approximatly 4 times a year and the Park Plaza is one of the most beautiful hotels I've ever stayed in. The only problem was when the bars let out. At about 3 AM a group of kids about 21 years old, were staying in adjacent rooms. They were SO loud, laughing, screaming etc. I listened to it for approx. 45 minutes before deciding they had no intentions of calling it a night. I called down to the front desk and they assured me someone would take care of it. No one asked them to quiet down. Finally at about 4:30 AM they did settle in for the night. So while the Park Plaza is beautiful, the walls are VERY thin and I'm not so sure that the staff really cares about the concerns of it's guests.

We got this hotel from Priceline for a girls Memorial day weekend and I thought since it was the "Westin" and it was a 4 star hotel, what could go wrong? We got to the hotel at 5pm and couldn't check in until 6 because they said our room wasn't ready so they asked if we wanted a map or a few drinks...duh! We took the drinks and the map. So they call me when the room is ready and we don't have a refrigerator or a microwave! We called the operator to ask for a refrigerator and they said they were all taken. If they hadn't made us wait until 6pm to check in, I wouldn't have had a problem with that, but since they were all taken and we had to check in at 6pm, I was very upset, but sitll didn't complain. The parking situation is horrendous! To valet it's $32 a day or you can self park for $24 a day. There are a few parking spots with meters, but good luck. Your best bet is to park your car in the lot behind the hotel (the street parallel to braodway) for $17 a day and take a taxi or walk where you need to go (It's $5 a day on the weekends and holidays). Needless to say we did that and never paid for valet or self park. After finding out the parking siutation, I complained to the manager, Jen, and she apologized and gave us breakfast tickets worth $45 a day for the two mornings we were going to be there. The food was WONDERFUL. I would pay for it if we didn't have the tickets. She also told me they would put us on the list for the next refrigerator and see what she could do about parking. After we got our free tickets, we never heard from her and never got a refrigerator. So this morning, I look at my account online, and they charged me $32 for valet when we never used it! I called and the receptionist said she'd take it off but it would take 10-12 business days! This hotel should not be a 4 star hotel. They have too many issues and when you're trying to get away and have a nice vacation, the hassle isn't worth it.

Stayed here because of the convenience of Virginia Mason Hospital next door. This is a very, very old place (I'm guessing built in the 1940s). While it was relatively clean and the bed was OK, the wall heater did not really work and we needed to get a space heater, the faucets in the bathroom wash basin either trickled water or blasted the water (clausing water to go on the floor and wall), there is noise in the alley in back of the hotel at night and in the early morning the dump trucks arrived, etc. It served our purpose of being convenient to the hospital for an early morning medical procedure, but if you're looking for a comfortable modern place for a vacation while in Seattle, look elsewhere. Rate was $116 per night - rather pricey for a hotel of this quality.

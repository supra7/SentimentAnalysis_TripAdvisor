Traveling to Phoenix on business and the Arizona Grand was one of the corporate choices. Now don't get me wrong. The place is clean, the people are friendly, and the rate is good. But the buildings are just set up strangely. The entrances to the rooms are a bit motel like - but the front doors to the rooms all face courtyards with pools or fountains - and the balconies at the other end all face out on parking lots and freeways (for the most part). It will literally drive you insane trying to navigate the resort as the footpaths tend to dead end at the various complexes, while the roads for cars seem to get you where you need to go quicker. The standard rooms are billed as suites, which they are - but only at the sacrifice of any room in the bathrooms (which are so small, the sinks are placed in the bedroom area). Beware of your room rate, there is a resort fee added on top (which is completely acceptable, but it doesn't include internet, which is an additional $15/day per device. So you can't use the same wifi access with your phone as the one you are using for your laptop.). I think this resort probably works best for families (as I'm sitting in my room listening to a monster session of Marco Polo in the pool). Parents probably like the resort feel, while the kids can probably spend all day at the attached mini-water park when it's open in-season). The mini-bar is stocked with beer, soda and Pringle's, but little else. Good for some, just not the right demographic for myself. On the bright side, the gym is awesome and the golf course looks nice.

Hotel: Maui Lu. Skip it, find another place to stay. Old and worn-out. Uncomfortable beds. Scratchy sheets and towels. They charged $30.00 a night for a third adult in the room, but only provided 2 sets of towels. When we asked for more, they gave us grief. (We finally got the towels.) The Continental Breakfast for the first morning was a joke --- a few grocery-store mini muffins and a little bit of sliced watermelon, juice and coffee. Everything ran out before we arrived (right on time!), and the food & drinks were never replenished. The grounds were nice, with lots of grassy areas, nicely trimmed hedges and lots of coconut and papaya trees. Easy walking distance to the beach; a good walking beach and the water wasnt great for swimming (churned up so the water is brown) but I did see some people having fun in the water.

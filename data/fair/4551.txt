Very disappointed I booked our reservation back when it was still part of the Mandarin chain and didn't believe that in few months time that that much could change. However, after arriving I felt right away that this was certainly no Mandarin hotel. When you pay as much as you do for these rooms, I'd expect the service to be at least up to Four Seasons standard, but it was far from it. Everyone was friendly and seemed to have good intentions, but any request we had was not carried out by the staff with any sense of urgency - we usually had to call 2-3x before someone would help us. We asked for help with travel plans, they directed us to the business center to take care of it ourselves. Though probably more relaxing than Waikiki, is it worth the extra couple hundred dollars a night when you're not going to get much better service or amenities?

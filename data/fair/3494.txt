I cringe when this place costs $350 a night, but when you realize what everything else costs in Manhattan this time of year, it's acceptable. I think of it as the "best of the rest" (of mid-tier hotels in Times Square). The rooms are clean and amenities are nice. Mine had windows that looked out onto nothing. The furniture and decor is supposed to feel modern, but it's really seems sort of cheap and dated. It certainly isn't a space you want to spend much time in (the room or the hotel). I've stayed here many times, yet the staff always asks me if this is my first time staying at the hotel. Everyone is efficient, but doesn't really convey any sense of the hotel itself. They seem to be content with doing their job.

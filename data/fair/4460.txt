Weekend trip Went to SF for the weekend, stayed 2 nights at Hotel Kabuki. It is a beautiful hotel. The bed was very nice. However I had called ahead of time and was told that our room would be the double double with a view and balcony in the tower part of the hotel just like I had reserved online. When we arrived we were told that we were changed to a family suite (an upgrade) but it was in the garden part of the hotel and on the first floor where we had a view of passing cars and no balcony or outside air. When I asked to change rooms the women at the front desk just stammered and stared at their monitors. The air conditioner didn't work so it was very hot in the room. Valet parking was a joke, $25.00 a night and I was told on the second night that I couldn't park there even though there were empty places. Found the staff to be not very friendly and never said thank you or looked us in the eye. I paid a lot of money for a room that I didn't want and was upset the whole time.

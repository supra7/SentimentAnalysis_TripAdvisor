You would think by it's name it would be a good hotel, let me list the inconviences.. -When we arrived, it was 6 adults and 4 children. We ordered 3 rooms and 1 of the 3 werent ready..and it was way after check-in..so we into the 2 rooms to wait and we rtealized they gave us the wrong rooms. We went to talk to the concierge and he said when you book and they don't have the room available the give you the standard room..BUT THEY DONT TELL YOU AND YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY THE SAME PRICE. Funny part is, he knew it was not what we booked and didnt say anything at the check-in. -When we returned from our night out the room still wasn't ready, so we practically paid for a room we didnt use. -DONT VALET YOUR CAR..I WAITED 1 HOUR FOR IT!!! And when the valet guy pulled up he was doing about 65mph in my truck. Oh and parking was $55, you would think for that price it would be 1 minute. -One room had a doorbell that was broke and went off beeping all night and they never fixed it..we told them and they said "oh well" -When we tried to explain our issues to Oksana the receptionist, she had a terrible attitude and was annoyed at us because he hotel sucked!

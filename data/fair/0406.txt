We had read some good things about this hotel, ie: their beds and sheets, plus the "quaintness". We only stayed one night, but when we arrived in our room, it was SO small. It had two beds, but there was barely enough room to walk around. We were there with our two children but since it was just the one night as we passed through on our way to California, we thought we could manage. However, when we tried to turn the air conditioning on, it did not work at all, in fact not a bit of air came out and the room was very hot and stuffy. We called down to the front and she said couldn't we just open the window? I told her that I had children with me and since these windows were low, ie only 2 feet off the ground, if I kept them open, one of my children was liable to topple out! She said then, that she would send someone up to look at it and within a few minutes, someone came up and he confirmed that, yes, it was completely broken. Since it was Sunday night, he said that there were no engineering people available to fix it, so they offered to put us in a different room. We were pleased to be upgraded then into a suite, which was much larger, with a separate bedroom. Our kids both got their own bed and my husband and I planned to sleep on the fold out bed in the livingroom. However, when we finally got to bed, this fold out bed had no sheets, pillows or blankets, so we snitched some off the kids beds, but the mattress was SO uncomfortable that we finally ended up putting the sofa and chair cusions on the floor and sleeping there! The whole bed platform was slanted and the mattress was only a couple of inches thick. Really bad. As well, there was a huge wet spot on the living room carpet that the previous guest had made and so we had to be sure to wear our shoes when in the room. All in all, the room, even with the upgrade was not worth it, I would never stay there again.

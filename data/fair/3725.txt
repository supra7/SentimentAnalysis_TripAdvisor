one of many nice hotels in that area, but at this hotel there are hidden charges that can greatly increase your tab. first there is the mandatory hotel service fee of about $9/day after tax, which forces you to pay for services you prob wont need, and they don't tell u about it until the end of check-in... second is the $10/day fee for use of the fitness ctr, you only pay this if you use the fitness center, but have u ever seen a hotel charge for use of the fitness center? they are all about nickel and diming their guests, they have disney-itis: do what it takes to maximize profits... also the hotel is monolithic and impersonal, the pool is not very inviting, the area surrounding the pool is awkward... it takes a long time to get in and out to the parking lot, the lobby is an uncomfortable patchwork of rooms or areas, and the main entrance is nice, but u only see it once: when u check in, because otherwise u enter thru a lonely side door... and oh by the way, u will be so sick of ducks by the time u leave, they really over-do their little duck theme... you'll see what i mean... finally the walls are thin, surprising given the size of the bldg, but it must have been built a while ago on the cheap... if u have neighbors, u will hear them... anyway, if u haven't finalized ur plans yet, i recommend u look elsewhere... there are many many very nice and less impersonal hotels at much better prices in the international drive area (on universal blvd)... i have stayed at hundreds of hotels and never experienced fleecing like this, really left me disgusted... as i asked the mgr: what's next? a fee to use the elevator?

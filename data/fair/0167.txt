I stayed at this hotel twice in September, 2009. The first time I was charged about $150/night. The second time $71/night. The $71 rate is about what this hotel is worth. The location is great if you're a business traveler, or even for most tourists. It's a little off the shopping drag, but centrally located if you're also going to visit the aquarium, Chinatown, Pioneer Square, and the other things there are to do in Seattle. But the hotel, itself isn't great. It's like it was a crappy hotel that someone really wanted to upgrade, but only just started before having to stop. Certain things don't go together. Flat screen TVs: good. Peeling paint: bad. Internet access: good. Carpet stains: bad. I would stay here again if I was a single business traveler trying to save a buck. Would I bring my wife here? Heck, no! Not that it's not safe. But much of the hotel is simply worn out. Housekeeping tries really hard to fight back against the grime and does an admirable job. But you can only hold back the tide of funk for so long. There's a great Seattle's Best attached to the lobby, and a Starbucks across the street. Free wifi at Seattle's Best and throughout the hotel. Starbucks wifi is free if you have AT&T DSL service or an iPhone. One note for anyone who has difficulty getting around -- avoid this hotel. You must navigate a set of stairs to get from any of the entrances to the elevators. Here's a helpful hint for those who stay, though -- it's easier to thump your suitcases down the stairs from the mezzanine level to the entrance than it is to drag them up the stairs from the lobby level to the entrance.

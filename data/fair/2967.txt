My wife and I came to the Ritz-Carlton for our honeymoon. Our greeting was less than perfect and it took us 45 minutes to get to our room. When we got to the room, we were greeted to a nice hotel room. Although the room was a little plain, it was fine. I was surprised they left us two chocolate covered strawberries on our honeymoon arrival. I would expect the Maui Ritz to have FRESH pineapple (at least a few chunks) every morning. I get fresh fruit at many other hotels I stay at for business. The real dark spot is the pool. The service was horrible and unacceptable. It is staffed by a bunch of inept white college students or mainland expatriots. No one EVER offered to set up our chaise chair. When I was at a Raddison in Aruba, you couldn't set foot near the pool before the guy comes to you finding the BEST chair in the house along with setting your towels on the chair. The Ritz never offered this service. Speaking of service, it was like pulling teeth to get a cocktail pool side. Finally, my wife and I began bringing our own hooch and ice and I was a better bartender anyway. (and yes I would share with you!) Looking for late night (after 9pm) apps or snacks? Not going to happen at this Ritz. Go to the store and be sure to have snacks in your room and enjoy the balcony with your sgnificant other and make your own happy hour! The grounds and campus was beautiful. Valet was fine too. Surrounding restaurants (not Ritz) were fantasic. Bottom line... if you know what good service is and you have either stayed at another Ritz or maybe even Mandarin Oriental or Raffles hotel, you will will be disappointed. Keep in mind, a disappointing stay at the Maui Ritz is better than a day in the office! Mahalo!

I stayed in Room 103 above the pub. The location was perfect for me, 100 metres from the Republica Metro station. But this isn't a hotel, it's like a half pub half hotel, so the staff seem to be from the pub. If you need anything you have to go to the pub and get their attention, in between them serving people at the bar. The room had no windows, well there was a 2x1 foot window above a locked door leading out to the roof I think. The room was clean enough, en-suite, TV with plenty of stations ( only found 2 English TV stations), safety deposit box and small chilled mini-bar. The air conditioning unit in my room didn't seem to work well. At night, there was a lot of noise from various machinery/air conditioning units/fans etc outside. ( which was behind the hotel on various flat roofs ) I had brought foam earplugs which solved that issue. Then there were about 4 mosquitoes in my room, and when I turned off the light to sleep they took turns biting me. I have 12 bite marks at the moment. I'd be worried about the same mosquitoes biting numerous guests and transmitting disease between them. There was the red blood splattered remains of 5 other mosquitoes on the ceiling were other guests had the same problem.

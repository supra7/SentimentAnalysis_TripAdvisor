Booked this place as a convenience for travelling from Kings Cross station. If you want basic room this is it, pillows on the bed about half an inch thick, a shower you need a degree to work, its like an old East Berlin lodging. I like a bit of comfort in my rooms and if I had known what the place was going to be like I woul not have booked it. Will be telling my friends not to stay here.

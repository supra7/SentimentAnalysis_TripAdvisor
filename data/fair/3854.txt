Way too expensive for what you get!! No restaurant, charge $20 for parking, didn't even clean the room our first day, the lady came to do turn down service, we told her it hadn't even been cleaned yet. She did a few things but didn't clean, no fresh pool towels and did not replenish the coffee. Normally not a big deal but when you are paying close to $400 a night it better be perfect!!

Price is reasonable for downtown SF. But you'll get what you pay for. Some European tour operators describe it as a "designer hotel". It is rather modern than design, and definately cold. As other reviewers mentioned, it is quite noisy, rooms are pretty dark during the day, plus you might get smell of restaurants kitchens depending on your room location (backyard). Heaters in the room and ventilator in the bathroom are extremely noisy too. Desk staff is acting like divas...clients should be treated like divas.... Still, if you're on a $90-100 budget and wanna stay in a clean Union Square hotel, you might consider it. The neighboorhood is not as bad as the "Metropolis" one - another "personality hotel", cheaper in every way.

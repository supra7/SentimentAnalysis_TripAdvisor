I attended a conference at this hotel and was offered a conference rate of $189 for a queen bed room. My colleagues did stay here and I saw one of their rooms. The room, like the rest of the hotel, was quite dated, musty, and dingy. Although this is a "historic hotel of America," it needs to be revamped and returned to its former glory. After reviewing TripAdvisor's recommendations and consulting a map, I chose to stay just one block away at the Back Bay Hotel (formerly Jury's). I have written a separate review on this experience, but to summarize: a top-notch experience, a beautiful hotel, and a promotional rate of $175. But at the Park Plaza, the service ranged from indifferent to hostile: an indifferent desk clerk when my colleagues' lost luggage was delivered, an indifferent concierge providing information about tourist trolleys, and a totally indifferent service staff at the in-hotel Irish pub (85 minutes to receive Fish and Chips!). On our last morning in Boston, I joined a colleague in the lobby restaurant for breakfast. When I asked to see a menu, I was told that breakfast was served from the buffet only. My colleague interjected that another waiter had let her order off the menu. The waiter sneered at me and said "We only let customers order off the menu if they insist." I insisted. My $18 omelette was adequate but did not arrive for 30 minutes. I guess the conference organizers chose this hotel because it does have sufficient conference space. But, overall, it is a faded hotel offering faded service at high prices, and I see no reason for anyone to stay here when the lovely Back Bay hotel is just one block away.

Subpar Hotel in Subpar City The best thing about this hotel is its location in central honolulu/Waikiki. However, why anyone would spend any time in Waikiki/Honolulu (Besides to see Pearl Harbor) is kind of beyond me considering all the island paradise that the Hawaiian Islands have to offer.The hotel itself is smelly, old  outdated, the sheets are paper thin from years of use, the rooms have a drab appeal and have housed thousands of smokers, the halls are dark and depressing. I'm not hard to please but I was somewhat disgusted when I had to sleep in the bed in my room. As for Waikiki, to get the same experience just go to a shopping mall or crowded beach. Though for some reason, its massively crowded and has its share of sleezy people.

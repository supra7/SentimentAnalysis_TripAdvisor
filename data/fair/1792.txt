This is an older hotel which must have been a remodeled former hotel of another brand, and borders a very suspect part of town (I had my tailgate stolen in broad daylight from the nearby Sheraton Brookhollow). The layout is very peculiar, with exterior (outside) entrances to many rooms. These exterior entrances allowed unobserved access to guest rooms, which is a very poor security risk in this area - a total stranger could walk directly up to my door. Additionally, the layout allows for several unlit potential hiding places for criminal activity. When I arrived to check in, I noticed several rather unsavory-looking characters loitering in the area. I always stay at Marriott, typically Residence Inn for the value and comfort. This is definitely the worst of at least 15 Residence Inns I'm familiar with. My room does not have basic silverware. I'm sure I could get some if I called the front desk, but I shouldn't have to. My neighbors are in an out of their room continually, and my whole room shudders as their door slams. The kitchen is tiny, with a two-burner electric range, instead of the typical four burners. If you need an extended stay hotel near the medical facilities, and take into account the security concerns, this place may serve you well. As for me, I'd rather try a Fort Worth Motel 6 before I stay here again.

The service at this hotel was so poor that we checked out early and checked into the Four Seasons next door and wished we had done it earlier. From check in to check out the service was unbelievable. The pool side staff were rude, the restaurant staff was short and abrupt, the front desk was a mess, and the managers that I spoke to regarding the poor service were unsympathetic and did not resolve our problems promptly and to our satisfaction. We are very seasoned travelers and have been to most continents staying at four and five star hotels and we came to the conclusion that this hotel should be rated a two to three star hotel at best. The location was beautiful and the physical property, although aging, was nice. The overall service including the valet, bell, and all front desk contact was very very sub par. For a hotel that was $300+/night, you can do a lot better. If you want true luxury, go next door to the Four Seasons or two doors down to the Fairmont. If you decide to stay here you too will be writing a disappointing review as I am. Good luck!

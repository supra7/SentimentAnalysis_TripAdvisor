We were booked to stay in the greystoke room, which didn't look that bad in the website photos. In reality it's a hideous animal theme gone overboard with stuffed animals on every surface looking at you. Maybe this would be good if you had kids, but certainly not for any kind of romance (unless you're into that). There is a giant stuffed leopard opposite the bed under a huge painting of a naked man with a big snake. To make this even worse,the room smelled horribly of disinfectant cleaner and some king of air freshener. It was unbearable. We decided we just couldn't stay there, and went to complain only to find out that someone had smoked in that room the night before and they were trying to cover the smell. They changed us to another room immediately. The next room was all pink and peach floral, basically your standard frou frou bed and breakfast room circa 1980, but with mirrors every wear, I mean every where, and spotlights on the bed. It didn't smell nearly as bad, just a hint of yucky air freshener. To top this all off, the flowers inside and outside are fake. Let me clarify, the flowers in the ground and around the courtyard are all plastic. I would never stay here again. In this case, "eclectic" is just another word for tacky.

The location was not bad, but not on the side of Times Square I'd have hoped for. The room was VERY small and even though I booked well in advance I was forced to take one King bed rather than two Queens. The elevator takes DECADES in the morning. I called to prepay out hotel with my bosses CC as this was partially a business trip and when I got there they had no payment on file. It took an hour to sort out and they seemed very put out by helping me. When it was time to leave I called to get help with bags and 45 mins later, no one came. Tried to do it myself but after 20 mins of waiting for the elevator, it still hadn't come. Called again, 30 mins later, still nothing. I had to walk down 20 flights of stairs and just tell them to go get my bags. They offer an ok breakfast, the cooked food tastes nasty (not real eggs) but its so packed and in such a small space, good luck. The lobby is tiny so if there are a few people there trying to do things you are cramped. Staff will let you stand around waiting for help. No one is very polite, all seem put out to be doing their job. In this economy they should be grateful to have jobs. There was blood on my duvet, just a tiny spot like someone has a tiny cut on their finger so I didn't flip out, but kinda gross. The vending machines for ice/etc. are on random floors so you get to wait 20 mins for the elevator to get ice. No room service. There is a GREAT italian place right across the street from the front entrance. We had a block rate making this cheap otherwise I'd never have stayed here. If you get a great deal go for it, otherwise don't waste your time with the rude staff. Oh and one staff member wears so much cheap perfume you can smell before you walk in the hotel that she is there. Made me ill all weekend. No blackout shades in bedroom so hotel guests across the street could see through our sheer curtains. Odd!

I was travelling on work to Phoenix for a 3 week assignment and was put up in this hotel by the travel coordinator. I must admit that the hotel location is brilliant, most amneties and facilities are walking distance from the hotel. Restaurants, Shopping malls, petrol bunks, convenience stores, everything is just a stones throw away. However, the hotel in itself is a bit of a dissapointment. As most home stays they have the basic facilities in place along with a cooking area. The staff however are extremely unfriendly and not at all co-operative. For eg, they clean the room only once a week, so I had asked them to advance the day of cleaning by 2 days for that particular week and they outrightly declined. The breakfast provided was extremely horrible and stale, you might as well not provide breakfast at all rather than provide such a miserable spread. The rooms were a bit crowded for the price and not the most convenient of stays that I have had.

The previous reviews state great location but fail to mention that the area around the hotel is under total road construction. You get to it through a bank parking lot with no signs or wait in traffic to get to it the other way. Took us longer to get to the hotel from downtown Napa than it did from SF to Napa. Had two rooms. One smelled heavily of bug spray that is still leaving us with head aches. Ants were everywhere. Check in was terrible, they could have cared less. Said the pool was heated but was cold. The hot tub water was too gross to get in, it looked like a foam bath. Room service was terrible, 40 minutes for coffee. No vending machines so you had to drive down the street for snacks. Room service food took forever and had to be sent back. One of the stranger rooms that I have be given, the walls were taller than the room was wide. I give the bathroom 5 stars since it was the only thing proportional sized. But the shower had mold on the grout. The Napa river views are pretty much where the homeless people hangout and fish. I stayed at the Westin Le Meridian Shanghai and the Westin in Vancouver this year and many others over the years. This is not their best in any way. Not many other choices in Napa except one or two better than this. I would recommend not to stay in Napa. The Westin is just down the street from Wal-Mart. Too many other nicer places to stay within 10 miles or so at lower cost. The. Valet was good, but not much else.

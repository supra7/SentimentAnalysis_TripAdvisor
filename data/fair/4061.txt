...as in thenardier from les miserables....i can just picture the wynn buisness meetings mantra: dont think of it as a "guest room , think of it as a small revenue generating engine: 1) since when have you been in a motel room where condoms were for sale? (ok they called it an intimacy kit) is this a truckstop? i could go on and on...500 dollars for shade at the pool...40 dollars for beef and broccoli(oh but it was the BEST beef and broccoli according to the suckerrs on here)200 dollars if you check out 1 minute past checkout....(what do the fishes and their fishwives say about this? "oh but its the best late checkout....) keep saying the words " 5 star resort" over and over and soon it will magically come true...whoever rated this place 5 stars was definitely either paid generously or drugged....yes the common areas are decorated nicely if garishly...yes its las vegas.. stop complaining...get in line...hand over your money.....make sure you smile at the robotic, unsmiling, inhospitable staff otherwise they might just charge you for frowning.....oh and if THEY make a mistake and charge something to your room "mistakenly" ( i think a trial balloon to see if you are paying attention), even if its for 5.95, you must sign a 2 page affidavit, swearing to the fact that you didnt charge it..when asked for a copy of what i signed ( mainly for further entertainment) i was told they do not give out copies of internal documents. But repeat the mantra: 5 star hotel over and over....who was it that said " the bigger the lie , the more people will believe it"? I think he works at the front desk...........

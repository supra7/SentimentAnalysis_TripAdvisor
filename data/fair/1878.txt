Pros: 1) Great location in downtown Dallas 2) Comfortable bed; great pillows Cons: 1) We had 3 people staying in our room. When I asked for an extra room key other than the one that was issued, the front desk clerk told me that they were all out of extra keys. 2) The elevators are incredibly slow. 3) The hotel room was tiny. 4) At the breakfast, there were breakfast potatoes and bacon but NO SCRAMBLED EGGS!!!!! 5) Dine-in room service took AN HOUR to come up. 6) Make sure you call ahead for your valet. Otherwise, you will wait a half hour for your car. 7) There is no pool at this hotel and the jacuzzi was out of order. 8) There was no HBO or premium movie channel. Bottom-line, this is a great hotel to stay if you plan on just sleeping here. But if the hotel-experience is important to you, then look somewhere else.

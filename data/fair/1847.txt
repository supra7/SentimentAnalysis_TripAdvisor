1 elevator -- 26 floors -- unacceptable. 20 minutes plus for our friends to get their car from valet. Did you hire a funeral director to decorate the room? Rarely does one see such a grouping of tan, brown and olive drab. Perhaps light switches where you could reach them would be a good idea. 14 years of college between us and we couldn't manage just the bedside lamp on. Is only one person allowed to read in bed? The toilet ran on. 1 bartender 40 or so guests. That is a bad formula. There are choices -- there is no reason to choose your property. Sorry.

Only plus-concierge was excellent! Two elevators to get to your room. Service and entertainment at terrace bar was awful. Breakfast room service was horrendous. In room coffee maker didn't work. Coffee in lobby was $2 for 8 oz and it was burnt. Front door to hotel needed assistance to open. Hotel store was highway robbery. Did I mention? Sign out front on mobile trailer.....Boycott Hyatt! This is by no means a 3 or 4 star hotel.

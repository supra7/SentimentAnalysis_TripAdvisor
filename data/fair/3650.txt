This W hotel is terribly disappointing. For sure, the lobby is nice but you dont' sleep in it, especially as I was here for business and did not intend to spend much time at the bar. The corridors are desesperately dark. So are the rooms (I have been unlucky enough to stay twice in the hotel). Views for any room below the 16th floor are terrible. Carpets were dirty, lighting depressing. Air conditionning was stupidely noisy. Finally, bathrooms have no bath. Location is good thouhg and service was ok.

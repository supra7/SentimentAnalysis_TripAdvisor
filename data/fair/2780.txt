We checked in were not greeted by anyone. Eventually a nice lady pointed us to the concierge tower. We went up and elevator with our own bags and waited behind a locked door before the concierge (who was great) greeted us. In our room the view was nice and room was ok. What was lacking was the service....we were paying $800 per night for the club level and were extremely let down by the service. We also thought the property and pool felt like being at Disneyland....not the place you want to go while on a relaxing Hawaii vacation. The place was so big we had to take 2 elevators to the beach and walk about 1/5 of a mile. We ended leaving after the first night and checking into the Fourseasons next door and had and amazing experience for the next 12 nights! The 2 hotels are not even comparable and the only thing in my mind they had in common was they shared the same beach. I am sure this hotel might be a good fit for some but I would advise you to do your research before staying.... KA

We purchased a Romantic Package and splurged on a room that is normally out of our price range. We were upgraded to a larger room but were disappointed with the sparse furnishings. The bathrooms are not much nicer than a Best Western. The room had a lot of noise filtering in from the hall which made us feel like we had no privacy. We worried the whole time that people could hear us. The restaurant was closed so we ordered dinner from the bar downstairs and the food was overcooked. When I let the Hotel know of our issues they responded saying that they will be renovating the rooms soon and they comped our dinner. We were really unimpressed with the Hotel and do not recommend it unless of course you do not think $350/night is a lot of money.

If you are after a cheap and cheerless place to stay in Cetral NYC this is great, however if you are picky about service and cleanliness, avoid! The hotel itself is located in a lovely green tree lined road in a cetral part of the city with good metro links. The room we stayed was pretty unappealing however. it was dark and dingy with itchy sheets and a grubby carpet. The shared shower and toilet was cramped not very clean. The breakfast was appaling! A very aggressive attendant slapped my hand with a pair of tongs when i attempted to help myself to the paltry buffet breakfast in an overcrowded stuffy basement!! We couldn't wait to get out, thankfully it was only a one night stay.

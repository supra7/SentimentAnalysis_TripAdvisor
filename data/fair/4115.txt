I must agree with the previous reviewer. We had a poor experience at this hotel. We booked a Royal Court Double Double room. When we arrived after a long drive we were told that our room wasn't ready, even though it was after the check-in time, and that we should come back in an hour. When we did return and were waiting in the lobby I had to ask whether the room was ready, it was obviously too much for a member of staff to come over and inform me. The room we booked was supposed to have views of either Nob Hill or Union Square - ours had neither. The room was very small and felt dated. When I complained to the front desk I was initially told that the hotel was full but the manager did manage to find a different room. This room was on a lower floor and had fewer amenities than the one we booked - although we were still charged the same price. It was a larger room but it still felt dated. The beds were incredible uncomfortable. My wife and I shared one bed and my children shared the other bed. Not one of us had a good night's sleep while we were there (three nights). When I raised this issue I was just told it was tough! The staff were in the main surly and unhelpful. I would not recommend this hotel.

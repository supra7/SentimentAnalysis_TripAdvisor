Check in a breeze. Got to room, our Deluxe Ocean View room was over the Whaler Village parking lot. Room not clean, first indication was the door was totally covered in a large number of greasy fingerprints. Inside no better. I am not a clean freak, but you would have to be in the dark not to see what was not clean. Talked to the front desk and with ALOT of discussion they finally decided to move us the NEXT day after a very noisy evening. But, we would have to come down four levels and our view then would be through palm trees. Of course no credit given to our bill. And the next morning another surprise. You must pay $$$$ to sit on the beach on a chair with an umbrella, and be the first ten to get one. We travel alot and this was a first to pay for beach chair/umbrella. We won't be returning to this hotel. Food poor, parking limited, watch you bill close. Also, one last comment on the parking. Watch out for "extra" Valet charges.

I stayed at the Trump for four days. The rooms were really nice and clean. A major issue for me was the pool. It closes at eight pm. This wouldn't be so bad but the hotel rents out the deck for parties so they start trying to run guests out of the pool deck at six. The party isn't untill nine. I understand that a set up is needed but I payed the resort fee too, and would really would like to lounge around and enjoy the pool without pissant pool boys telling me to get off the chairs so they can set up for a party.

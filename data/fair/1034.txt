We had 3 nights here: The good points: A short walk to the metro station and easy commute to the centre. Very secure parking with plenty of spaces. Free wi-fi in reception area and breakfast room. Helpful reception staff. Fair sized room. Air conditioning OK. Other points: Very basic accommodation reminded me of a Butlin's holiday camp block in the early 60's. Forget breakfast - it was instantly forgetable. Had dinner in the restaurant on the first night - didn't eat there again! Hotel clientelle appeared to be a mixture of tourists and longer term "residents".

Stayed for 4 nights in April after being transferred from the Wyndham Gardens Times Square South due to no water and a gas leak in the street. Arrived to find very gracious front desk staff but a filthy room. Called the desk at 11pm to have the floor vacuumed. Shower full of mold, dirty washcloth still in the shower, hair too. Daily service sorely lacking, always forgot something, tea or coffee, towels, garbage, even didn't wipe the sinks or mirrors. The concierge was great as were all front desk staff. The Italian place attached to the hotel was very nice, cool atmosphere, great dinner. The Thai place across the street was marvelous. Good location... But OMG they need to get housekeepers who actually do their job! I know what it is, I put myself through school as a housekeeper.

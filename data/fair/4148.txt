This is the downside to Hotwire. I paid $216 per night for customers to stay for 2 consecutive nights. It was a get away for he and his wife and a professional outing. I dropped them off at the hotel and could scarcely believe my eyes' The first floor and lobby was a plastic tunnel. Everything was lined in clear plastic lined scaffolding. You walked through tunnels of plastic. It is not a 4 star hotel like this. It has a great location and the rooms are nice but I have never been so embarrassed to set up a customer this way. I would not stay here for anything over $100 per night in this condition. I will never book with Hotwire again for my customers. I will continue to take the risk for my own travel, mainly for the hotels locations. Do not book this hotel at a premium ( $216 less than $360) unless they have completed the remodel. It will not positively impress, wife, partner, or customer in its current state

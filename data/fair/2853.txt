After an amazing stay at the Four seasons for 3 nights, my boyfriend and I decided to give the Grand Wailea a try for a night on Dec. 18th for a change of scenery...big mistake. I specifically asked that we not be given a room facing a parking lot or the construction across the street when I made the reservation however, that's exactly what they gave us and had the nerve to call this a mountain view...it was directly over the parking lot! When I complained they did nothing. We could also hear the construction going on across the street in the room. The grounds are huge and interesting to walk through but the carnival like atmosphere created by what seemed like a hundred kids running around didn't make for a great stay. This resort is best for families and is not recommended for childless couples looking for a quiet/ romantic vacation. PS. don't expect the same service as the FS..not even close!

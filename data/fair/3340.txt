We stayed at the Soniat House for 2 separate nights, a week apart. Our first night's stay was better than the second. The staff was friendly and very helpful, and the hotel's ambiance was exactly what we had hoped for. The room we were assigned was small but very nice, although the hot water ran out in the middle of the first shower. The mistake we made was choosing to have their breakfast. For 25.00, the 2 of us received 5 biscuits, jam, orange juice, and coffee. We are from South Louisiana, and love strong coffee. But there was not enough hot milk provided to make more than 2 cups of this thick coffee into cafe au lait. For our second stay, we were assigned a much less appealing room in the back of the hotel. It was large, but smelled musty and needed redecorating. The cost was over 300.00 after New Orleans taxes were applied. This room was at the top of their rate system for a single room, but clearly not worth the price. Needless to say, we did not have the breakfast. In summary, I would rate this hotel high on customer service and ambiance, but low in other areas. The experience of entering the doors off a residential street into the typical New Orleans courtyard was great, but even the "top quality" rooms vary in appeal. Skip the breakfast and walk to the French Market for a better experience.

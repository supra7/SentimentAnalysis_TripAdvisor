Great location, very nice public areas, but the attention to detail is really lacking. No shower cap in the bathroom, no hot water in shower or sink. We passed Housekeeping in the hall leaving for breakfast, when we came back 4 hours later the room hadn't been serviced. We paid for an upgrade to a suite which way way down a quiet hallway. The room was nice but kind of crowded with furniture. The property is very conveniently located to the French Quarter, easy walking distance to breakfasts and dinners. Ray at the concierge desk was helpful in pointing out places for dinner within easy walking distance.

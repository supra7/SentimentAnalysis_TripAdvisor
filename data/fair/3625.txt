I was extremely dissapointed by my recent stay. I was on business in NY for 6 nights and found very few redeeming qualities about the "W". The reception staff, while initially friendly during my check-in, was exceedingly rude when I came down with additional questions. In one instance, the woman at the desk, walked away from me when I was talking and this same woman picked up the phone and had a personal conversation another time I was waiting for assistance. I had to call down 3 times for a blow dryer, before one was received. I asked for help with my luggage on the way up, and they were "too busy". (I was one of two guests in the lobby). On my departure, I called for assistance, waited 30 minutes and ended up bringing it all down myself. The room (a "cozy" queen) was the smallest I've ever stayed in and it's shameful that they charge that price. The "living room" or lobby area bar is always packed with lots of "hip" people and not at all inviting to sit down for a drink. On Sunday at noon, we tried to get a Mimosa and had to talk to three people and finally a manager before someone would help us. The housekeeping staff is very pleasant and accomodating, the "car ambassadors" were helpful, and the concierge was pleasant- although moderately so, compared to other hotels. I am a frequent traveler and have stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels. I'm a Starwood Preferred Guest, but would never return to this hotel. Overall, the staff is a little too impressed with themselves, are generally unhelpful and rude, the rooms are ridiculously small and the atmosphere in the lobby is unwelcoming. Their "whatever/whenever" motto was certainly nowhere in evidence with the service I received (or lack thereof). There were 12 of us staying here, from my company, and all of us had the same experience and won't be booking here again on future trips. The Bliss products are great though, and the Spa was quite pleasant.

Will not be back.... there is not one benefit to staying at the Doubletree. They charge $21.00 per night for parking, there were dead bugs on the floor, so appearantly, they do not vaccum either. Housekeeping left the trash in my room upon cleaning it, there were trays of food left in the hallway from room service for two days and the coffee maker was broke. I was charged $2.00 for making a local phone call to the parking garage across the street. The only thing that is complimentary are warm stale horrible chocolate chip oatmeal cookies upon checking in. For the price of $129 a night, one would think something would be free, but nope. If you insist on staying here, park your car at the parking garage across the street, it's only $12.95 a day. This hotel is not for those who would rather spend thier money on sightseeing than on a room and parking.

I was sent to this hotel courtesy of another one which had overbooked. The staff were quite courteous, the lobby was gorgeous and it could not be closer to Gruman's Theatre and other Hollywood landmarks. Having said all that, the room was disgusting: the furniture was old, the bedroom was hot and musty (air conditioning did not reach there), and the maid had not even removed the soap used by the previous occupants. When we went to use the pool, we were given towels with dried blood on them. If you can put up with all that, you should be fine.

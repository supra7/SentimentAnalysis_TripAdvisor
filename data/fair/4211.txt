I have stayed in this hotel a number of times. When you first walk into the lobby it looks beautiful!! BUT..it kind of stops there. The staff, I find is not friendly, but not rude. Just kind of doing their job. The rooms are VERY dated!!! The beds are pretty hard. The sheets do not fit on the bed. And the BLANKET? Bring your own..LoL. The rooms are clean. The ocean view is awesome!! The bathrooms are ok. The rooms have coffee makers and microwaves..so thats a plus. The tea time and piano player are good if you like that kind of thing. Mainly seniors...my grandma would love that. The food there is gross and very over priced! I have tryed it more than once...so I know it wasn't just an off day. The sun porch is great! The pool area is dirty and small. To the point that I wont let my children go there. The main reason to stay at this hotel is the location...it is right by the start of the boardwalk, yet you have a private beach in front of you!! And the view from your room is amazing. I have seen dolphins playing early in the morning a few times. Location, location,location.

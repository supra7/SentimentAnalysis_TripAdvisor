First my wife and I booked this room through Expedia for Valentines Day and it will be the last time we use Expedia for future vacation plans. We requested a king bed but apparently our reservation could not be guaranteed and upon arrival found that the only availability were two doubles. The hotel arrangement overall is poorly executed and the elevator situation is awful. The hotel could use another 4-5 elevators. We waited on average of 3 minutes for an elevator and at one point had a 10 minute wait before deciding to take the stairs. And to use the elevator (even going down to the lobby from your room) you had to swipe your key card before pressing the button. I'm all about hotel security, but this is just overkill. At night when the hotel restaurant is in full force there is an unpleasant fish odor throughout the hotel lobby and ground level areas. As for the rooms, they are small even for Chicago standards. The bathrooms offer little in the way of privacy. I will admit having glass walls in the showers provides opportunities for "fun" times, but the sliding door (that never stays closed) and exterior shower curtain don't provide the proper privacy for actually USING the bathroom. To whomever designed the rooms, exposed concrete ceilings and pillars are not attractive especially when there are water/rust stains. Overall I don't recommend this hotel unless you are on a business trip alone and don't plan on staying in your room for very much time. The location is great, the hotel staff is extremely friendly, but the room quality is sub-par.

I had stayed here 7 years ago, and it was not good to go back. This hotel is a sad shadow of its former glory, living on a reputation its not keeping up. For the price go get a room at the Marriot/ Sheraton - anywhere that will be newer, just as great a location and cleaner/ newer/ quieter rooms. The plumbing is ancient - if a room above or near has a bath you can hear them turn off the taps, the rooms look tired and dowdy, and the hotel is more geared up for weddings - of which there were two the weekend we stayed than for travellers. Go and have a look at the ceiling in the lobby, have a cocktail in the Oak Room but don't stay here, its a waste of money, which is such a shame. There is so much better in Boston.

Room was small and heat didn't work right. Elevators came only after 20 minute waits. I needed a VCR and brought mine; they jury-rigged the TV so that mine wouldn't work, and then charged me an obscene $62 to rent theirs. Then they couldn't even bring it on time. Pool is only open to 9, and the staff got grouchy with me when I came down for a brief dip at 8:30. Sure, the lobby's pretty, but next time I'll stay at the Congress Plaza and walk up to look at the lobby.

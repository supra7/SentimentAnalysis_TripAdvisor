Stayed at the W Hotel on Lexington for two nights for a business trip that was mainly centered around mid-town. Can't fault the location as getting cabs or the subway opened up all of Manhatten but the hotel and rooms were basic. Much like other NYC hotels, the view from the 7th floor (which in London would afford you views of Hyde Park) was of an alley way and brick wall and the service was pretty poor as well. Travelling on business, I was not asking for much but it took them over 24 hours to replace my broken safe where I wanted to store my lap top / etc. which meant that I had to carry all my valuables around with me. The bar, Whisky Mist, is pretty poor. It was empty and the whisky is over priced. The Brandy Lounge in TriBeCa is much more welcoming. I definitely would not choose to stay here on leisure unless you know that you really are not planning to spend any time in the hotel.

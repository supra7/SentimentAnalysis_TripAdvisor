i was very excited for my first NYC boutique hotel experience at the Time. the location couldn't have been better, but that's about where the satisfaction ends. the hotel advertises ipod hook-ups for the stereo (a huge selling point for me as my girlfriend and i are heavy music listeners)-- they have one cable for the entire hotel. despite calling the desk to request it everyday, we never received it. the carpets were nasty dirty and stained. nasty. the hot water was inconsistent at best. staff were not at all helpful-- not rude, just very apathetic. wifi was $10 per day (!) for the money, i'd recommend staying in a chain hotel or another property...

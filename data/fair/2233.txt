Oh, where to start! The heat didn't work. This is very serious for spring in Boston, where the weather is changeable. The first night I couldn't get any heat at all. Once the heat came on, no one could turn it off! The room was so hot that the souvenier chocolates I bought melted. (I'm not kidding.) Not only did the hotel not offer me a break on the high price, the concierge was rude. I called one morning to see when the sight seeing trolley ran on Saturdays. Because of a change in plans, sight seeing was moved to Sunday. When I called the concierge the next day to confirm the times, he actually said, "Aren't you the one who called yesterday?" and he ended his answer with a snide, "Just like I told you yesterday." The best thing I can say about this hotel is that security was good and I felt safe. Also the location is convenient. If you are willing to pay these prices for such faint praise, be my guest. But not me. Never again.

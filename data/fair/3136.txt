We recently stayed for 3 nights at Regency Inn and Suites, at Memphis Airport during the new year weekend. While the hotel facilities (bed, cleanliness, good sound proofing, complimentary parking, microwave) are good, we had some discomfort as hotel guests. The room was not made after the first night with neither any explanation, nor apology. I had to call Housekeeping, twice, to get fresh towels. On the day we checked out, the phone rang at 8:30 AM - we did not ask for morning call. When we ignored this, there was a knock on the door a minute later from a female housekeeping staff. There was another knock on the door at 9:40 AM from another male housekeeping staff. The check-out time is noon. It just shows how poor this hotel is run, as there is no coordination among departments. Also, if you stay here, please double check your payment receipt before you leave to make sure that all charges are correct.

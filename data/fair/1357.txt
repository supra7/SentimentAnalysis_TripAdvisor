I usually stay at Hilton brand hotels when I travel which too often and this was one of the worst places. We checked into the hotel about 11:00 pm and granted there was no room service or open restaurant at the hotel at such hour but when I asked the front desk I was told that there arent any vending machines anywhere in the hotel! The room that we were given was very dirty (emply bottle of water near the bed and hair in the tub. When I called the front desk, the gentleman told me there aren't any other available rooms. Although I am a diamond member we were not provided with any water (as the policy states for H Honor members) and I had to call 3 times and wait for 30+ minutes for two bottles of water. We decided to check out and change rooms the next day. As we were checking out I discussed my concerns with the one of the front desk supervisors (at least that is what he claimed to be) and all he said to me was I am very sorry! Nothing more! Very disappointed in this hotel, the customer service, and overall appearance/cleansiness.

Got a great deal for 99/nt via Pricline. Glad I didn't pay full online price which was over 200/nt - certainly wouldn't be worth it. The room was a little run down - wall paper peeling, small bathroom, not very well sound-proofed and could hear people in other rooms and the hallway (we had two rooms on different floors - both the same types of issues). I have been to many lower end hotels that are nicer. The overall decor was dated - if this is a high-end brand for Marriott then they really need to up the game here. Expensive to park. Good points included location (main entrance on Common St but another entrance on Canal on the edge of the French Quarter). Not a noisy location at all but so convenient to the sites. In addition, the elevator was quick - never having to wait). The lobby was small but clean and the staff was friendly. The overall rating of 'poor' is based upon what the hotel tries to bill itself as, not on the price I paid.

I had to stay for 5 nights in this hotel on a business trip. The hotel has defined special rates with the company I work for. Otherwise I wouldn't have selected it. The room is ok and clean. Considering the fact that the hotel is located quite centrally in Manhattan the price is also ok. During my stay in January it was quite cold. In the first night the heating system didn't work at all. In the morning the room temperature was 13 Celsius. When I left the hotel at 07:30 in the morning I asked at the reception for fixing the heating mentioning the very low temperature in my room. When I returned to the hotel at noon the heating still didn't work. I had to ask a second time for fixing the heating. During the night you have to turn off the heating because of the noise of the fan. But despite I turned the heating off the fan went on from time to time for a short time. What was very unpleasant and it disturbed my sleep considerably. After the second night I again had to complain about the heating but they were not able to fix it.

Will Not Return We didnt know they had a new area and the old area and booked a room in the main old section of the hotel.The room was musty smelling, the air handler hardly took the moisture out of the air and it felt clamy inside the room.The bed was soft and the carpet seemed damp.For what we paid this was a disaster. I smelled stinky feet when in the room.We were very disenchanted to say the least. I complained at the desk but the hotel was full.Plus: They rope off a portion of the beach and have chairs and umbrellas. For a tip of $20 per day I was treated with respect by the guys running the stand.I would not stay here again.

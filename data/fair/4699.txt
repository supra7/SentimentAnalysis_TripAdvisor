Our family stayed 8 nights. The Sheraton truly has in my opinion, the nicest nook of beach on Ka'anapali. The water is clean and clear, and we didnt have to go diving to find tropical fish or sea turtles. It only took a mask to look right under wherever we happened to be swimming. The turtles generally swim all around Black Rock- even while locals and tourists alike dive off the cliff, but they certainly did not limit their swim to the reef. We saw them all around us, along with Butterfly fish, Pufferfish, and oodles of Unicorn fish. I got the hang of using a snorkel because I didnt want to lift my head and miss a thing. We had originally confirmed an upgraded room, but upon our arrival, they had no record of it. The following day after speaking to the manager our room was upgraded and we were moved a few nights later. Both rooms we occupied had a fridge that we could stock- which is always a good thing. The beds were comfortable, and the pillows nice. The bathrooms were not as clean as I would have liked them to be. For the price of the room we hadnt expected them to nickel and dime us so much. While one would expect to pay for valet parking daily, there is also a charge for daily self parking, a 20$ daily hotel fee over your daily rate, and regular ammenities are another 20$ They didnt greet us with a lei, and we didnt find the hotel lobby staff to be pleasant or helpful, although the waiters and cocktail waitresses and housekeeping were very friendly. The pool closed very early- but we found that most of Maui closes early. :) One great perk besides the good location, was that every thing you need from shopping to food was just a beach boardwalk walk away- literally. From board rentals to parasailing to banana boating. All within five minute walk. Some of the hotels right on the walk also had bars that stayed open a bit later that ours and hula.

The best thing about this hotel is the location - walk down the street and you are in the middle of Times Square - you can't fault that! The room was an ok size - a long time since it has been renovated though - we had to change rooms from a room at the front of the building - garbage trucks all night! But our room towards the back of the hotel was much better - the hotel has a very ancient lift - still works but feels very rickety - free breakfast included - basically donuts, toast, coffee and tea and juice - not much else - If you could pay the same rate and be in as good a location then I would look for somewhere else a bit more modern - but if it is all you can afford, and want to be in the middle of the manhattan action and do not have high expectations then this is the place for you - nothing wrong with it - just is very basic.

We visit Seattle annually and have always stayed at the Sorrento. It is a beautiful, old hotel that has always impressed us with its level of service. However, this last last trip was disappointing. First, they have changed their car service. It operates only until 5 p.m. on the weekends and the car was not the same as previous years. It was worn and old. We were also told by the valet that we needed to tip the driver because he only was paid by gratuities. Not only was this advice unnecessary but it was unprofessional. No car service meant taking taxi cabs to dinner and shopping because this hotel is not within an easy walk of the Market or many restaurants. We were also disappointed by the general lack of service. In our previous stays, we were warmly greeted and our bags taken to our room where the bell-hop would turn on classical music. Turn-down service was automatic and fresh ice delivered nightly to the room. None of this happened during this last trip. In fact, when we asked what hours the Market was opened we were met with a shrug. If we hadn't been treated so well in the past, perhaps this wouldn't have been so shocking. Maybe this was just a bad weekend but it seemed that the hotel has cut down on its staff and certainly are trimming corners on costs such as the car service. If you are a returning guest anticipating using the car service, just be prepared for the changes.

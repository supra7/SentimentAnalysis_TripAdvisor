Hotel is in a good location and close to train station, darling Harbour, china town, paddys market, etc. Although the staff were very rude and not friendly at all. They deactivated the card to the room which caused the lift not to work. We were stuck in the lift which made my daughter scared and shaking and we didn't even get an apology. They even tried to charge me extra when I was booking out of the hotel room.

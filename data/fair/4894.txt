This hotel nickel and dimes you for everything -- $15 to use the gym, $11 for wireless internet. I wouldn't mind the charges if I had known about them in advance or if they had just folded it in to my bill and I would have paid a little more... It's just irritating to arrive at the front desk and be told you have to fork over extra money for what should be basic hotel functions AND THE WORST PART IS THE WIRELESS DOESN;T WORK except in the lobby. In the room, it only works occasionally (just enough to frustrate you) so you have to use your computer downstairs in the noisy lobby. This is a serious minus for a business hotel--wireless is a non-negotiable for me. I won't be staying here again until I hear that they have upgraded this service.

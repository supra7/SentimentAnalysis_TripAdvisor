We stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon. The good things: the lobby is lovely. It was a rainy night and the lobby bar is cozy with a great fireplace and good drinks. The room service was also good, and staff is friendly and helpful. There are great Bliss products in the bathroom. With that said, it is SO not worth the $600/night for a room. We travel a lot and have stayed in hotels all over the world. This room was the WORST. They "upgraded" us to a room with a "view." The room itself was teeny tiny and completely run down. The Ikea looking furniture was stained and tattered. There were errant wires coming out of the wall. It was all-around a sad and pathetic feeling in the room, and I cannot imagine having to stay there for more than one night. If you're going to pay the money (even half what we paid!) please stay somewhere on the West Side or Downtown. There are too many great places in NYC to stay somewhere so run down.

Disappointment My mother, daughter and I stayed at the Casablanca every year for several years and were delighted with the accomodations and the service, which was always above and beyond. I tried to book the Casablanca this year as well for several days in August. I left a telephone message that was never returned. When I made a subsequent call for rates the response was rather curt, not at all like the prior experiences I had with hotel staff. Finally I discovered the reason for the change: Manager Joe Reyes had left the Casablanca, along with two other wonderful staffers, Aaron and Scott. With a little detective work I tracked Joe down. He is now managing The Shoreham Hotel on West 55th between 5th and 6th Aves. We made our reservation at The Shoreham instead. Getting Joe Reyes is certainly a coup for the company that owns the Shoreham -- Joe's unparalleled attention to detail and his wonderful way with hotel guests is what made the Casablanca such a wonderful place to stay in NYC. How unfortunate the company that owns the Casablanca let him get away!

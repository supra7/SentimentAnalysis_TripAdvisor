Over-rated, overpriced. We stayed in the Versaille building last weekend. Seriously flawed -- sure it was pretty and clean and had nice amenities... but the noise was wicked. I heard every footstep and drawer opening and door closing in the rooms around me! The stereo and TV couldn't cover the vibrations. An afternoon nap was out of the question. Even while showering I heard my neighbors' footsteps as if they were in my room. VERY disconcerting. I don't like paying this much for such poor quality. My complaints to the desk got me nothing -- not another room, not a white noise machine, no compensation.

My husband and I stayed this hotel about 17 years ago. It was The hotel you wanted to stay.But this time, it just did not meet our "The Westin standard". We stayed 5 nights this time. We like Westin hotels, and stayed NY, Atlanta, Tokyo, Whistler(Canada), Long Beach& SF (CA), and other places, so I think we know some good things about the Westin hotels. The hotel need major renovation. It shows ages inside of elevator, hallway, and bathroom. It even look "cheap" because grass cloth wallpaper was painted. If you stay at this hotel, DO NOT rent SUV. Parking spaces are so small and tight. You will have difficult time to find a spot, and if you are lucky enought, it is difficult to open the doors of SUV. In fact The concierges adviced us to ask the vallet desk to park the car if we cannot find a parking space. This is terrible, you have to drive around the parking area wishing you can find a space. Maid service was not sufficient. Our room was not cleaned after 3pm three times during our stay. Sometimes, glasses has lipstick marks on. I was not sure they just wash glasses at the sink in the room or change used ones. Used towel was left in the bathroom a couple of times.Our robes never hung up. "Do not disturb" tag was missing when we checked in, so we used in-room order tag with hand written "Do not disturb". The 3rd day, we finally got the tag. The front agents are ... some are friendly, some are not. The concierge are friendly and knowledgeable. Hope our experience was exceptionally rare, and evryone have a good time at this hotel.

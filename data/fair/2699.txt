When we checked in and went to our room, the first thing we noticed was a mound of garbage piled near the elevator. This was several garbage bags, obviously left by a housekeeper as they performed other duties. When we left a couple of hours later for dinner, the garbage was still there, although it was finally removed a couple of hours after that. The second issue we had was that the individual shampoo/conditioner bottles had already been opened and used; new ones were not provided until I asked the front desk for some. Other complaints include: the pool was colder than it should have been, there was a stain on the sheet for the pullout sofa, and the hotel was loud (this is a complaint of design though: atrium style hotels usually are louder.) Internet access is noted as free on embassysuites.com for this hotel, but there was a 9.95 charge. The front desk was very pleasant and accommodating, and the lady working the omelet station at breakfast was amazing (fast and efficient, but fun too. All in all though, I would not recommend this hotel. It does not live up to the Embassy name.

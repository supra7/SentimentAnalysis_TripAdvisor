I was in Chicago with two friends for a class. We knew we wanted to stay downtown so I booked this hotel through priceline's name your own price. While we were gone, our toilet overflowed and it was fixed by the staff but our carpet was still wet when we got back from class that evening. We also discovered that my ipod had been taken from the table in our room. The only people who had been in our room that day were the hotel staff so it had to be one of them who took it. We called the front desk multiple times to fix both problems and security was quick to start an investigation but the maintenance staff never cam to talk to us about our toilet or our wet carpet. The front desk and security said that maintenance was on their way to our room but they never came. Nothing was done until I went to the front desk and spoke to them sternly and even then they only gave us gift certificates for room service. It is a very nice hotel but the staff treated us badly.

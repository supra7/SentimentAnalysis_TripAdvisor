I have stayed in dozens of Super 8 hotels and this was one of the worst. My room was OK but the bathroom was beat up and the towels were very rough. The overall condition of the hotel was rather shabby with much deferred maintenance. The area surrounding the hotel had some rundown and abandoned buildings -- making it a bit creepy. The breakfast was a below the usual Super 8 norm. On the other hand...the bed was OK, the room was quiet (even though it faced the train tracks) and I slept well. This hotel was located a short drive from Beale Street. And the desk staff was helpful.

We stayed at The Time last weekend. When we did the booking, we were attracted by the fact that it is a Tihany design and its great location. However, after our stay we were a little bit disappointed. I will start with what we liked: This hotel is indeed quite nicely located. It is very close to time square, but since it is not in time square, it is relatively quiet. The service was also not too bad, especially the guys working the ground floor. (I am a bit annoyed by the guy who did the check out. He didn't seems very eager to serve the guest) However, they did give us a room earlier than other people because they saw that we have a baby with us. We appreciated that. The biggest problem with the hotel, however, is that the rooms looks old and dirty. The carpet looks dirty and way too much wear. The walls have many scuff marks that is almost unacceptable. In the shower, many places between the tiles are turing black and very unclean. Our toilet also stopped working on the second day. Please see the pictures I have posted for reference. We have booked 2 rooms, and both of them are quite small--in fact one of them is really tiny even though they charge us the same amount. Lastly, for the price we are paying, we are also surprise that there isn't any coffee maker in the room. As a conclusion, I agree with the complains other member is posting. The hotel really need to step up its maintenance--like repaint the wall as a starter. I sincerely hope the management will turn things around around.

Place D'Armes is certainly not the worst hotel...the location is fabulous, the staff is friendly and the courtyard is gorgeous. That's where the good things to say end. The website is VERY misleading as far as "balcony rooms" go. I saw another review in which the reviewer mentioned that she felt lied to because she had to walk out of her room and down the hall to the balcony. Same here. We got one of those same rooms. And then she mentioned that she got switched to a room that had a window that opened up to the balcony...all i can say is that's got to be better than having a room that is adjacent to a balcony that ANYONE in the freaking hotel could access (with a window to said balcony that is directly behind the headboard of the bed). The walls are paper thin. My husband and I were woken up at around 6 am by other vacationers in the next room who we discovered were actually talking at a reasonable volume. There is absolutely NO bathroom privacy. There are two slatted doors and approximately 10 feet separating the toilet from the bed. Not so awesome. The continental breakfast - coffee, oj, water, croissants and some danishes - was mediocre as best. The rooms were pretty shabby. There was a layer of dust on the walls from the ac/ceiling fan. Clearly the walls had not been cleaned in several months. The blanket (not bedspread) had lots of holes (cigarette burns?), the mattress was on beyond firm to "hard." I felt like the room could have easily been broken into - there is a physical key instead of a card and the deadbolt is only able to be engaged when one is in the room. Sunday our rate was $90. Place d'Armes _might_ be worth that...but Sunday our rate was $160 and I feel incredibly ripped off by that.

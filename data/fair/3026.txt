I stayed here with my family in an ocean view room in theueach tower. The room was great, and the location next to whalers village is amazing. Service was poor. The concierge were only interested in selling timeshare, to the point where we gave up asking for anything and foud better luck using google. The staff at the valet and the bar were often surly. My car got blocked in, which was irritation, with no apology from the staff. We waited 40 mins at the restaurant after being sat before we had our order taken; which I. Think reflected the disorganized nature of resortanagrnent more than anything else. Also, if you don't claim a lounger by the pool before 6am you don't stand a chance. Even though it doesn't open until 7am the pool staff doothing to prevent people from just throwing their stuff over loungers and walking away for the day. I complained to the manager - who seemed fairly disinterested in our feedback. I wouldn't stay here again, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's too crowded and the service is average at best.

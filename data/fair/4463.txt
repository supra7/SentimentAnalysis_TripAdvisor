Rip-off bar but good hotel The room was great, the service was very good but I was hugely disappointed with the bar. The hotel has directions to a bar in the lobby and the bar we were lead to was a stupid Karaoke Bar. We stayed for 2 drinks each and we were charged 50 euros for 4 drinks altogether- an absolute rip-off!!!!!! I blame the hotel for that, even though the bar can be accessed through the hotel into a small shopping complex. We were charged for listening to the japanese singers who were useless, just cause we wanted a few drinks without wanting to go down the street. This was the so-called hotel bar as such. It sort of ruined the goodness of the hotel.

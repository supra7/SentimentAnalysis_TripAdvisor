We stayed at the Hilton this past week for a camp meeting across the street at the convention center, when we first arrived Half of our rooms were not clean.Then when we finally got our rooms I had Hair(Pubic and regular) in our bed ( so they obviously didn't change the seats from the people before us.. It was also in our shower.Then there was trash on the balcony From the other people.One of the other rooms from our Group had BLOOD!!! On theIr Sheets!!!!! Gross right? The Maid Staff Was Extremely Rude and talked down to us all week... The staff at the front desk was also terrible..I personally WOULD NEVER STAY HERE EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!! ITS TERRIBLE

Let me preface this by saying that my husband and I are Starwood fans (Platinum members for nearly a decade). This Westin, however, should have been renovated at least 10 years ago, and wasn't -- the result is that it literally stinks throughout (in the lobby, in the hallways, in the rooms). The smell is a combination of cigarette smoke still left in the air circulation system from when not all the rooms were smoke-free, old carpeting, and simply a lot of people congregating in a place where there are no open windows anywhere, ever. I am sure an upgrade to the 1970's air circulation system could have helped. The other relic are the elevators -- they are so poorly coordinated that you inevitably get squeezed in like sardines with 20 other guests in a tiny (again, unventilated) space, going up 40+ floors. The lobby is generic, bland, and resembles an airport waiting area. The rooms/bathrooms should just be gutted and refurbished. I do not recommend this place.

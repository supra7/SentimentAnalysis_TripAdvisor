This hotel is located much too far from the centre of the city for tourist who want to spend their time visiting the main sites and to see a little bit of life in the evening. I.t is in a not too inviting area where yoy cannot stroll out and sit at a nice boulevard cafe , have a drink and watch the crowds passing by. After a tiring day in the city it is a bit much having to walk 10/15 minutes back to the hotel from the underground station.There is no air conditioning in the bedrooms and when we were there it was absolutely stifling. the hotel had decided to take the minibars out of use. For a 4* (so called) you would expect to have a few 'goodies' in the bathroom and indeed not all bathrooms had a bath just a shower (though to give it credit that the half bathroom with our room was new and very nice). the food was reasonable, no great shakes and thre was only one waiter serving quite a full dining room at breakfast. Overall the hotel was pretty bland and quite unatractive.

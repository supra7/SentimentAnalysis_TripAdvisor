I stayed at the Intercontinental with almost a thousand other guests for an in house conference. The staff and services provided by the hotel were top notch. Any request to the concierge, front desk, etc., was immediately responded to, and room service was punctual and very polite. The facilities were lovely, and appeared to be quite clean. However, after the first night, I noticed what I thought would be a few mosquito bites on my hands and arms. By the time of check out, I had 12 plus strange looking bites on my arms and back. I was either bitten by spiders or bedbugs while staying here. They are definitely not mosquito bites. Very disappointing and gross considering how nice everything else was. If I return to the Dallas area, I will pass on the Intercontinental.

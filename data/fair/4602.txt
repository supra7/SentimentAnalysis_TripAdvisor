Sound Proofing Required Generally the hotel was great : friendly and helpful staff; well appointed well serviced room though no gowns or slippers; great location for shops and public beach; superb buffet breakfast. However, there was one major problem. The ocean view rooms also overlook the loading bay of the Sheraton. These are in constant use and the noise is dreadful, especially vehicle reversing sirens which sounded throughout the night. Surely the priority of any hotel is to ensure that it's jet lagged patrons get a good nights sleep ? On the plus side, they efficiently arranged a trip to Hanauma Bay which was great - go there and snorkel with turtles ! I still think the hotel was good value for money.

the door to our room was very hard to open it kept getting jammed, the housekeeping went home before 7pm so i couldn't get any extra pillows, when we need more towels after swimming i called down to the front desk and they told ME to go down and get it, the "continential breakfast" was toast and cereal! this place was not worth $80

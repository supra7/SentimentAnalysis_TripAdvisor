This hotel is clean and rooms are comfortable, staff is fine. My complaint is that there is only one restaurant, and that is a super, super noisy sports bar. I was there for a convention and people who wanted to have serious business conversations or catch up with old friends could not find a place to sit and talk or have a quiet, decent dinner. A real disappointment. Great place to be if you want to shop till you drop as it is attached to two indoor malls, and come back to the hotel to watch football. Because believe me, you will have to HEAR football all through dinner whether you like it or not. Will never stay there again. And, they charge $13 day to plug in your laptop to the internet, and there is no wi fi unless you go to the business center! Unbelievable, in this day and age.

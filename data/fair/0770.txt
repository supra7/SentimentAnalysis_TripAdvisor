the resort was buetiful and a little to quiet .Im 32 and my husband is 40 we were on our honeymoon and were expecting a little more of a tropical vacation .We didnt realize that the dinners had such a high dress code . We brought shorts and tanktops we thought we were on vacation and left the dress clothes at home also, before you leave your room make sure your key works its not fun to have to walk all the way up to the main building late at night with a few to many drinks in ya.The wait staff was awesome they were allways right there to get whatever you might need .Unfortunetly we didnt have great experiences like most people .Our partial ocean view room was great but the ocean was no were to be seen.We really wished the hotel would have had somemore exciting activitties there wasnt a whole lot to do other than drink and pay allot of money to go on tours

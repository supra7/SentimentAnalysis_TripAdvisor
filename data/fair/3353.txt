Well, I am not sure if the scent of our loft was due to a deodorizing intended effect, but it smelled like a giant public bathroom. It nearly nauseated me. We stayed here in March 2011, and as I can see its appeal in its character,charm, location, and spaciousness, my priorities lie more in cleanliness, freshness, and comfort. We were upgraded to a loft, which was nice, I suppose. However, that then meant that we had to walk a narrow staircase downstairs to the restroom in the night. The living area downstairs, though, could be a perfect place to entertain guests, if that is what you want to do. And if you happened to be attending an event at the club next door, perfect location. I don't want to sound picky, but there were several hairs all over in the bathroom; the tub did not drain, yuk!, and well, that smell. We did sleep well, so maybe those lofts in the back by the pool are quieter. However, I have stayed at a much more pleasant hotel before called the Dauphine Orleans. It has the same charm, better really, and much much cleaner and presentable. There was not even room for us to park there at The Frenchmen because it was full, so their parking does not even accommodate their own guests. Strange. I DID like that they monitor who comes in and out of the hotel. Safe, I suppose. The breakfast left much much to be desired. It was very simple and really not even attended to. Cereal was spilling from the canister. Cereals, toast, and doughnuts, along with coffee, juice, and milk were offered. Very simple. No croissants or biscuits or fruit or something special or extra even slightly was offered. Oh, and the pool looked pretty, but too cool still to swim. So, I thought the hot tub could be an option, but it was not hot or even warm at all. Would I stay there again? Naaah.... but for those folks with different priorities may really enjoy it. It was roomy indeed.

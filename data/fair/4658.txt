You get what you pay for. This is a great place to stay if you don't expect too much. It is rundown but the bed was comfortable, room was cleaned every day and the staff were friendly and helpful. Coffee in AM at the desk. The grounds are great to walk around in and relax. Pool is great although not heated. Beware of the traffic crossing to the beach area. Small private beach coves with easy access to the beach parks if you want bigger. Free parking!!! Great Japanese restaurant next door!!!

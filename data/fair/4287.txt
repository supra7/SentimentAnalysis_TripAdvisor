The decor was very old; ripped carpet and very dirty, bent mini blinds...and the room was very small. When I asked about changing rooms I was told something about it being an art deco hotel and all the decor in all rooms was that way. I wasn't sure if they meant torn carpet everywhere but....Anyway, the location is good and the staff otherwise were friendly. Hotels are expensive in the city but I am sure we still could have done better than this one.

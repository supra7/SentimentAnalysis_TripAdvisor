One of the reasons we chose this resort was it states it has a heated pool. Infact it does have this facility but for the 10 days we were there it was icy cold. We knew after our long journey we would want to spend the first few days in the pool so our four year old could adjust to the different time zone. When we complained about the pool temperature they said they would adjust it and it would take a couple of days to heat up. All the other families huddled arround the hot tub as no one could endure the pool. One time I counted seventeen people in the hot tub.Two days later it was still freezing and they informed us they had it all turned off so they could change the filters and give it another couple of days and it should heat up. We were unable to switch hotel as everywhere was busy for Presidents day weekend and did not want to waste our time packing and searching for a more suitable hotel.We were given passes to use the pool in the Nickeleoden hotel down the road but they had no shower faciltiies so it was not ideal. My husband pursued them and the temperature improved a degree or two. Families actually ventured in to the pool for short periods but still complained of the cold. The pool never got to a comfortable warmth for the whole ten days. We had occasion to visit one of the Hiltons nearby and their pool was lovely. Location of resort is fantastic. Short drive to Disney, shops and restaurants. Three bedroom unit was very spacious. As reported in other reviews there are maintenace issues, bed just ok, sheets do not fit beds well but reception staff very friendly. Block 1 and 2 are next to the pool but as the numbers get higher the distance to the club house increases. I will never return to WorldQuest and can not recommend it. The first few days of our holiday was ruined.

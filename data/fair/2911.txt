My wife and I stayed at the Maui Prince twice a year for about five straight years, but gave up on the property. All the negative comments by other writers are the same problems we encountered, on an increasing basis, over the years with the Maui Prince. Indifferent Front Desk staff, shabby and dated decor, rooms in varying states of cleanliness and disrepair, beach furniture that is dirty and broken and a pool area that is desperately outdated compared to other properties. The list goes on and on. It's particularly bothersome as the Prince's rates are certainly not in line with it's facilities and amenities. From our perspective, it appears that Prince Hotels is not investing any capital in this property for improvements or remodeling. Why should they, the occupnacy remains high - this property is a "cash cow". It's very hard to understand how a large hospitality chain can be so indifferent about a property in such an gorgeous location at a world class tourist destination. My hope is that someone at Prince Hotels will read this and wake up. They have a gem of a property that desperately needs work! Until they do, we'll continue to stay elsewhere on our twice a year visits.

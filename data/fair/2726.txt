This is my 5th time in Vegas...1st time on Freemont Street. After looking at numerous reviews we decided to stay at the El Cortez. The staff was so unenthusiastic. Housekeeping was the worst I have ever seen...possibly understaffed. Food was ok. I will have to say we felt very safe...as far as the area. We would not go back

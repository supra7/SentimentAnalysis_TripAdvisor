This was our first trip to the Ocean City area. I selected the Holiday Inn since I generally think of them as a value oriented, middle-of-the-road type of hotel. Even though it clearly experiences a high volume of beach traffic (with the associated wear and tear), it generally met our expectations in all but one important area - sleep quality. It fell far short in this area. Every morning at around 6:30am the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom area began making a loud 'ticking' noise. It sounded like thermal expansion from the pipes running through the walls but whatever the cause, it was extremely annoying. There was no sleeping in when this noise fired up. My whole family could hear it and I seriously doubt it somehow decided to rear its noisy head for the first time during our stay. I reported it to the front desk upon checking out thinking they might give me some consideration but the report was greeted with a courteous but firm "we'll look into it". I hate paying full price for less than a full price product so I won't be returning. There are too many options in the area to get an unwanted wake-up call every morning while on vacation...

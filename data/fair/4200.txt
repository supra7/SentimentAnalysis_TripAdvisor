Where to begin? We were offered to pay $150 to upgrade to a king suite room, which were told would still be 50% of the regular price of that room. We took it, figuring why not it was my husband's bday and we were just staying over night and enjoying a chance to sleep in while our sitter watched our two little ones. The room was nicely furnished, quite big, but for a hotel that's not that old we were surprised at small wear and tear already like rubber stripping hanging off the balcony door, a loose towel rack hook by the shower, and plumbing pipes made a horribly loud noise for a solid 15 seconds every time you ran the faucet or flushed the toilet. Other complaints about the room were that half the closet doors were blocked by a nightstand and there were two flat screen tvs back to back - one to watch from bed and one to watch from the couch - which weren't working and required a few calls to maintenance. Service-wise the room was only set up for one person in terms of towels and robes, there were no toiletries at all in the tub/shower (just a bar of soap at the sink), a card addressed to another guest had been left in our room, and it took 20 minutes and 2 phone calls to have a bucket of ice delivered to chill some champagne we had brought with us (this was after we'd made the request at the front desk during check-in). I have heard great things about the new restaurant, Shang, but we didn't try it out since we already had dinner reservations elsewhere. I would not though recommend the overpriced room service coffee, which was weak and cost $20 when you added in the required tax/tips.

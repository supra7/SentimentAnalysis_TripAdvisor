No freebies here--even parking costs $$ We'll go back to Embassy Suites where the parking is free, the room has a mini-fridge and microwave, free bottled water, and a cooked-to-order breakfast is included.The Red Lion is a lovely hotel, but it is no bargain. AFTER checking in the desk clerk informed us we had to BUY a parking permit. Signs in the lobby and the room informed us that free toiletries were available. My companion ran out of shaving cream. The desk clerk told him they were out of shaving cream.The room was large and comfortable but the mini-fridge had been removed (we need it for medication). No microwave either! We had a cold breakfast the next morning. It wouldn't have been such a disappointment if breakfast came with the room. Bottled water was placed in the room with tags of $2 apiece. When checking out, the desk clerk demands to know if the bottled water was drunk so the room could be charged.The bathroom was tiny. Such a fancy hotel, and yet a grade-school size toilet is wedged between the bathtub and the wall. The builder should have made the room a teensy bit smaller and expanded the bathroom. Gregory's, the restaurant next door but affiliated with the hotel provided excellent food and excellent service at slightly high but not unreasonable prices. So the areas where Red Lion falls short are: no free parking, tiny bathrooms, no mini-fridge or microwave, really bad creamer with the coffee service, advertise free toiletries but not necessarily available. Red Lion's good points? The large room was clean and nicely decorated.

My experience at this hotel was that the room furnishings and location are nice, but the cleanliness is questionable, the desk service abysmal, and the one long distance phone call I had to make (inside the US, 70 mins long) due to my cell phone breaking cost me $200!! You would think I had called the Moon! Overall I would visit the bar on the roof-top for a drink (somewhat expensive, but great view), and stay somewhere else. There's a lot of swank hotels in the area that are worth paying a tad more for or the same as the Affinia is asking. Try not to break your cell phone either. Hope this helps!

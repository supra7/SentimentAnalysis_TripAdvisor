Prices are really exorbitant. And that's just for the room. A bottle of Evian water is $7. Toast on the room service menu is $6, orange juice is $7. That may be typical of this type of hotel, but it is still outrageous. If you happen to work for a company that has corporate agreement with them, prices are literally half the standard prices. If not, you are out of luck. My parents had the corporate rate, paying a whopping $200 less for a room that was twice the size of mine. I questioned at the desk why there was such a huge difference, they told me I was originally reserved for a smaller room and "If you're complaining about the size of the room, you should see the room you would've had". Great help. The staff are good a chit-chat, asking about where you're from and how the traffic was. But ask them to help you out otherwise, and get a snooty response. Really not worth the money. If you do stay, you can buy anything you need at CVS down the block and don't give the hotel any more money.

I have stayed in many Best Westerns and I have to say this was the worst. The building was unattractive, the staff seemed like they hated their job, except Becky who deserves to work in a nicer hotel. The magnificent mile website sited them as a location sponsoring Mot Chandon specials and upon arrival not one person had even heard of Mot. My partner called down to the front desk on our last night to request two wine glasses and was told that they had none. I knew this was not true since there is a restaurant attached and I do not take no as an answer in customer service. I then called down and requested them and the room service steward rudely stated that in order to honor my request he would have to charge three dollars per plastic wine glass to be brought to the room but could leave them at the front desk for no charge. I was not happy that the hotel needed to nickel and dime me for such trivial items. I will not ever stay at this hotel and will not recommend it to anyone staying in chicago. Worst Best Western ever.

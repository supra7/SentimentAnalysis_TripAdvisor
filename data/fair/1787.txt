Stayed there last weekend of 2011. A lot of small inconveniences that took its toll: 1. Cannot make reservations directly with the hotel. The hotel transferred my call first to a young woman who I could not understand. Next transfer was to Marriott business center and not reservations. I had to call the hotel three times to get transferred to reservations. 2. Reserved two double beds in each room. However, upon check in, told they only had a king bed in rooms left. 3. Lamp would not turn on in room. Noticed finally it was unplugged, Telephone would not work. Noticed it had been unplugged as well. 4. Room was very warm upon arrival. Maintenance woman did a good job figuring a/c was not working, and transferred me to another room. 5. Room TVs -- Set on analog and not digital - could not change, and only one remote for each room even though two TVs in each room. 6. No ice in ice machine. Went to bar, got ice, and five cokes. Charged $13.00 for cokes. 7. During check in, after being told there was no double bed rooms left, I was handed an "Elite" member card. When I used the wireless Internet, it stated that as an Elite Member there would be no charge $12.95 for each room. On check out I was told that I was not really an Elite Member so I had to pay the $26.00. 8. Check out was Noon. Front desk reluctantly extended to 1:30. Besides the maintenance lady, there does not seem to be a lot of deep thinking by those who run this property. Not much attention to detail. For $195.00 a room you should receive more.

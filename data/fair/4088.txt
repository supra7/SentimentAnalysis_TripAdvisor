Stayed at this hotel but was not as I hoped. Upon check in (6 girls) we were told that they only had king size beds. Cots were available but took three extra phone calls and arrived close to 1 a.m. Stayed on the side where you could see the pools and Las Vegas from the 21st floor. The noise from the night club (constant pounding) went until 4 am every morning. Several calls down to change rooms with no response. The hotel is a beautiful property but lack of interest in what customers are concerned about was very apparent. Upon check out voiced my concerns again but was told that the manager was too busy to see us. Have sent a e-mail to customer service on our return and have yet to hear from them. Very Disappointing!!

A perfect beginning A fantastic location providing excellent value for money. For 50 a night in central san francisco this hotel is certainly a find. The continental breakfast is a good start to the day including waffles, breakfast croisants, cereal, toast and huge muffins. The hotel is two minutes from union square and close to both Powell Mason  Hyde and California cable car lines. My only criticism is that the rooms are a little small and you can find yourself falling over your bags.

Continetal breakfast is atleast 15.00, Resteruants in hotel not as good or impressive as the swanky resteraunt we found on prince st. trattoria di monica, in north end. this little resteraunt was bigger than our room and was more impressive than the hotel resteraunt. there was no bathtub. I think I get it now four star means everything that could be a nice touch costs you extra and they don't have to work as hard as a three star to impress you and hey you get what you pay for and that's why there is no service with a smile. I would try a different hotel next time.

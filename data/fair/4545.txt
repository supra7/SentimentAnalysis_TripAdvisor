Bittersweet memories of a glorious past Our recent stay at the Kahala Hotel Resort has confirmed, without doubt, that the resort is sadly riding on its past performance and history as a world class resort. My family used to spend our Christmas holiday here when it was under the command of the Hilton corporation, and it was a glorious hotel that made everyone feel like royalty. Unfortunately, the resort fell into disrepair under the helm of the Mandarin Oriental group, and the current owners/managers cannot seem to put all the broken pieces back together.To its credit, the glorious beachfront location is without fault. The lush, tropical grounds, however, are in dire need of attention. Accomodations are dirty and beyond well-worn, bordering on shabby, without the chic. Carpets and upholstery are stained, and well past their service, and furniture is literally falling apart!The staff here seems to be indifferent to the needs of their guests, acting as though they are being held captive , plotting their long anticipated escape. Simple service requests go unfulfilled, or require multiple calls before any effort is put forth. The overall mood is more like a mausoleum than a tropical resort.Dining at the restaurants is anything but fine. The term hit-or-miss comes to mind, both in terms of quality and value.If price is any indicator of quality, then those who think they are booking a 5 star resort will be sadly disappointed upon checkin.The Kahala needs to be closed for extensive renovation. It has good bones, but it needs an investment team and quality management to help it along.Oh, one last thought...release the dolphins! They should be able to swim free in the ocean . People who want to see dolphins in Hawaii can see them while snorkeling, or visit Sea Life Park.

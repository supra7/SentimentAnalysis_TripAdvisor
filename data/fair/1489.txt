I guess this review isn't as bad as some - perhaps they are trying harder now or we just got luckier. The room was satisfactory as far as Motel 8s go. The neighborhood seems a bit scarry-looking, but I did not see anything to really be frightened about. Memphis's downtown area seemed a lot safer than my own city's downtown (St. Louis). The place was quiet enough for my family to get a good night's rest. My main complaint, other than the place just being kind of average, was the breakfast. We'd just done several days of traveling and had spent the night at other Super 8s, which actually cost slightly less, and the breakfast they offered was just pitiful in comparison. There was very little choice, I took a few bagels up to our room and my wife quickly noticed that the bottoms of them were moldy. I went back for donuts and they were not fresh either. Perhaps this is a minor detail, but when everyone else out there is delivering the goods, you should try to keep up, And guests remember their last impressions, too. All in all, I wouldn't go back.

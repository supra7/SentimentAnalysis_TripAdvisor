My wife and I went down to New Orleans the week after Christmas to get away from the family a bit. Though I wouldn't recommend this time of year unless you like the cold. We bundled up out side to brave weather. But the inside of the hotel was no better. It was freezing throughout the halls. There are many doors leading to other areas and patios on each floor, and for some reason, no matter what time of day I passed it, they were slightly ajar. I don't understand why as it was around 30 degrees at night. The staff was nice and helpful - I should know because we had to ask them for new batteries to our remote, for shampoo and conditioner that was not in our room, and for a hairdryer because where ours once was, there was now a marked tear in the wall - where someone had stolen or removed a wall mounted hairdryer. The bathroom had a plastic shower curtain that was ripped. Fingerprints from guests past were all over walls, doors, near light switches - does no one wipe down the walls? The art work was also ripped or dented along with the wall paper. Water stains also marked the ceilings and walls, shoeprints and luggage scrapes scarred the interior of our room. A fresh coat of paint or new art from a flea market would have helped. The bed was bowed - like sleeping in a hammock - that definitely added to the poor sleep we got. It was so cold in the rooms, that we were provided with electrical heaters. But there was no comfortable medium. At night the air was so hot and dry your mouth, tongue, lips and nostrils dried up and in the mornings we had sore throats. The bathroom sink is in the bedroom and it would clog with in seconds of brushing your teeth or washing your face. IF you could tolerate all that - there was a smell of sewer that appeared every so often, and sounds of the wall crumbling when people upstairs would move. It was definitely an old establishment with need of upkeep.

We stayed at the Westin for our Honeymoon during November, wish I had'nt. The resort itself is great, the renovated rooms are small, but very well done (I dont see how famalies fit into these tiny rooms), the pools are great (if you can find a spot), the beach is spectacular and the food is mediocre. Tips: 1) If you want a spot by the pool, be sure your out there by 8:00 A.M. because guests like to throw a towel on a chair and come back around noon. (The staff refuses to do anything about this) 2) If your traveling with more than 1 child, book a suite or get an extra room. 3) Dont fall for the time share presentation. They offer a 50% off stay at any Starwood hotel if you do the tour, what they fail to mention, until the end, is that 50% off cannot be used in Hawaii. 4) If you get sick, its YOUR fault. We met a couple on their honeymoon and they both got food poisoning from Ono. When they informed the staff, they were questioned for over an hour by security and then told, you didnt get food poisoning here, tough luck. The sad part is, the couple told us they werent looking for any compensation, jus wanted to warn the staff for the sake of others. 5) If your looking for a Romantic place, or even just a quiet one, dont go to the Westin. 6) Dont expect much from the staff. Although they are extremely friendly, they are understaffed for the amount of people on this resort. 7) Definately see Warren and Annabels magic show in Lahania. Probably one of the few good meals you will find in Maui and a great show. Just another note, you may take the route we did and think the complaints are from people who went during peak times. No. We asked a staff member about the over crowding and she told us its slow and they were about to get busy in 3 weeks.

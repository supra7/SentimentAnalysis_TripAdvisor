I stayed here for one night and checked for bed bugs when I first arrived and there seemed to be none. Later that night however, bugs were crawling on the phone and the next morning there were bugs on the bathroom counter and crawling on my bed! If it weren't for the bugs the room would have been fine for one night. The rooms are small but include a tv, fridge, toaster oven, and ironing board. The cheap price reflects the quality.

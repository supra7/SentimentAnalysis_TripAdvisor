Having stayed at this hotel 12 months ago we thought it was a sure thing to stay again for our recent trip to Dubai. Unfortunately the hotel has deteriorated somewhat during this time. The lobby area was spotless, however the room was grotty and seemed to need a good clean.. The shower was moldy & the skirtingboards covered in dust & hair! The toilet also ran all night & kept us awake. The staff seemed very distrusting, for example we were asked several times by the pool staff what room we were from, especially when we wanted to take the pool towel back to our room as our son was shivering. Upon check out even though I said we did not use the mini bar, we had to wait for at least 5 min while housekeeping checked, before we were allowed to leave with our pre booked limo service. The hotel did allow for an early check in which was greatly appreciated.

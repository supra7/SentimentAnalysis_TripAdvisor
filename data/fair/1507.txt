Was very disappointed this weekend with my stay at the Avenue. I booked through Priceline and chose a 4 star hotel. My winning bid was from the Avenue. Priceline has the Avenue as a 4 star along with the Sofitel, W and Westin's. No way - I would have rather stayed at the Courtyard. I realized that we were across the street from Northwestern Memorial Hospital, but we were on the 37th floor. Still from midnight til 5 am - there was an ambulance every hour that woke me up. Also the group of drunk girls that woke up the entire floor around 2am did not help. Another guest had to go out and yell at them. The wall a/c unit was so loud that when I came bac up to the room, my wife could not hear me knocking on the door. Also, when we could not watch a movie on pay per view, the front desk told us that the hotel got rid of it a few months ago. I am not sure I have ever stayed in a hotel that did not have pay per view. Lastly, there were no convenient plugs anywhere in the room. Had to plug one phone in the bathroom, but then could not shut the bathroom door based on where the plug was located. Other phone had to put on the floor under the table next to the chair. Would not recommend.

My wife and I stayed at the Palmer House on Sunday 14DEC2008 for one night after staying at another 4-star Hotel the previous nights. We were there for business. Upon arrival, the outdoor Bellman begin arguing with the cab drivers about moving their vehicles while i was unloading the cab with the cab driver. When he realized we were checking in, he begins to try to justify the argument. The Hotel and its Historic features are Great. The Hotel room was average. The toilet's drainage system was flushing every 30-45 seconds all night and the Bellman and Luggage delivery person stood around waiting for a tip after their service. I thought this was very rude (I always tip). This action was not practiced at the other 4-star Hotel attendants. I will not be staying here again. Finally, before checking out on Monday 15DEC2008, I was waiting in the sitting area on my floor and was manually turning the T.V. stations and noticed a porn station around channel 53'ish.....unbelievable. thanks.

So small I hit my head on the TV... The Cartwright has many good points -- but room size and reliable locks are two of their failings.Our room ($169. US) included queen bed, self parking, and continental breakfast. Not a bad price, and a great location. But I'd look for another hotel next time for 2 reasons. #1. The room size was so small both my husband and I hit our heads on the TV (mounted on the wall) when entering or leaving the washroom (especially at night). The TV has foam bumpers on it, so obviously this has been a problem that others have encountered. I am only 5'2 so I was a bit surprised to have to worry about banging into the TV!#2. The room we were in had a big problem with the lock. I was lying down for a rest before dinner, when my husband went out for a few hours. He locked the door from the outside. When I went to leave the room, I found I was locked in! The door needed to be unlocked from the outside -- the inside turning knob was a 'dummy' and did nothing... Fortunately there was no fire or I would have been in real trouble. I complained to the front desk and they offered us a choice: to move to another room or take a small discount. As we were leaving the next day (and were aware of the problem) we took the discount. But I wonder if this is a problem with more rooms there?! The dummy turning knob is probably common to all doors. My advice: Check the lock if you stay at the Cartwright.

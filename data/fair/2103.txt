Imagine a bathroom so small that you can't grab a towel behind the door without stepping into the bathtub! I kid you not that there was one inch of room between the toilet and the tub and two inches on the other side. I have never been in such a small bathroom. Paint peeling on the ceiling, dingyy decor and a horrible commercial product stench topped with a view of a brick wall--all for $409 a night!! When I brought these issues to the attention of the front desk manager, he was completely unresponsive to my displeasure. This is a place that I would never recommend to anyone.

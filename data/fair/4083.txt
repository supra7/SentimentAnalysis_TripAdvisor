Being invited for a stay on the 54th floor facing the strip, view was ok, but if you like looking at your sister hotel. The sound insulation could do some upgrades, we heard every flush from our surrounding neighbors washroom and also their conversations (day and night). I know Vegas is hurting but I feel with all the cut backs they have made (they do not change sheets even after calling down to request for them to be changed - hotel policy), I do not mind changing at the end but if we do need them changed and followed the hotel policy, I would hope they would follow. The in room minibar has a nice layer of dust on them as everything is automatically charged so no one touches them and even the chamber maids are careful not to knock them down. For what was paid, I feel the Big B (Bellagio) down the strip gives a better bang for the buck with much friendlier staff and service. Yes the little turn down chocolates make a big difference. :) - Skylofts were great but now going down in quality but the Sunday brunch at the Mansion are TO DIE FAR... and the only way I will be able to make it into the Mansion at MGM unless I get REAL lucky. The pool area is very small and all the lounge chairs get taken up very quickly even with the 30 minute squat policy, they are hard to come by on the Fri-Sun period, esp the Euro pool as 50%+ of available sun bathing area is dedicated to the $300+ cabanas (that no one uses but told to get off of) Unfortunately the 2 restaurants I wanted to try out were both closed for the week (Picasso and Alex), settled for Jol Robuchon and had a nice dinner with their summer promotion but then that is a separate review.

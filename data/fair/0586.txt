I had high hopes - being a former Seattle resident, I saw this hotel as a landmark hotel and was looking forward to staying here. The first night of my stay was dreadful. I was in a tiny room (which is understandable for an old hotel) with the most uncomfortable bed. To the hotel staff's credit, they moved me to a different room with a newer mattress. I was happy for the change, but the fact that the older mattress was still in circulation causes me to ask what the rest of the rooms are like. I definitely expected more from this hotel. I also found the lack of amenities very inconvenient. Right down to the inability to even break a large bill so I could use the vending machine. I was told that I would have to walk across the street to the convenience store to get some change. I will not choose this hotel again.

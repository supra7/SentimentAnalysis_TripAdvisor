No sleep and a vacation ruined. The staff did their best to accomodate us. The rooms are very small.That I could live with. There are no drawers in the room. That I couldlive with. The television had terrible reception on the main stations.That I could live with. The air conditioners are in the windows, so the noise from the streetis very loud in the room. The mattresses seem the cheapestfor an actual brand. Very, very hard and the pillows are small and alsohard.I had to keep the air conditioner on because the radiator was on and itwas almost 65 degrees outside. The staff did send up two blankets toput under the sheets. I went to Macy's and purchased some pillows. Try to have fun on a vacation in wonderful New York without sleep!I sent an email to the hotel about the problem and never received a response. So, here's my most honest review of the Casablanca Hotel,in my most favorite city in the world.

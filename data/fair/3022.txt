I booked this hotel via Expedia and have a Starwoods membership. Upon arrival I was told there were no double beds for my ocean view room citing my having booked via Expedia. Evidently although my reservations showed double beds, this is not honored. I asked to speak with the Manager and ended up having to move rooms 3 times. The first room was a disaster; could have sworn I was in a cheap hotel - the table has a visible layer of dust, TV was not positioned in front of the bed, view did have some ocean but you had to search for it beyond the large cement slabs that appeared to be an unused section of the hotel, and furniture/accessories in the room were chipped and worn. We were not the only ones unhappy. Day two there was a long line with only one customer rep. Never did the manager, or anyone else come out to check on status or assist. One individual got out of line thinking he was going to be able to address his check-out and when he tried to get back in line, there was heated dialogue and what looked to be a fight in the making. Oh yes -- then there was check-out; from all indications you could do it on-line but when it did not work, I was told by the front desk that this was known and I needed to check out direct with them (aha another wait in line). And even the kiosk/computer for boarding passes did not work. Again, from all indication it did and only after trying several times and asking the conceirge about it was I told, matter-of-factly, that Hawaiin Airlines did not allow the connection and it had not worked for a month. When I mentioned this at check-out, the front desk person indicated she had no awareness of this problem. Lastly, I was quite surprised to find only one small jacuzzi on the grounds and it was for adults only. Mmmmm, where is this on the write-up about this resort? While there were some nice things, the string of poor customer service was glaring. We won't return.

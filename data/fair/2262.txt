Stayed at the hotel on September 2nd for one night. Nice hotel, but very noisy. A lot of foot traffic, a wedding, and one of the reasons I chose the hotel - Scullers Jazz Club - was closed due to the wedding. The rooms are spacious with a separate area with pull out sofa and television, but the furniture and carpet are dated. There are areas of the hotel that need repainting and updating and just plain cleaning. The hotel location is very isolated - on a highway - but we had our car so this was not a problem. We had a very drunk bridesmaid on the elevator on our way back to our room, who screamed at us when we would not give her "jazz fingers". It was very embarssing for the boyfriend and a bit unsettling for us. It is not a hotel I would consider on my next trip - as the Radisson in Boston was cleaner, newer, more modern and with a more knowledgable concierge - all for the same price PLUS breakfast and parking. Good luck!

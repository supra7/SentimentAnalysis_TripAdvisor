Even for the lower rates we paid, we were dissatisfied with our room!!! Spend the extra 20 or so dollars and get a better place to say is my suggestion! the floor in the room was so unclean upon arrival, with lots of handfulls of black human hair everywhere! it was a dust ridden room leaving us sick after the first night stay. the property has potential, but has some problems. the pool had a condom in it ! the small parking lot held probably 8 cars max and was so hard to get in and out of. if u have a bigger suv forget it, park somewhere else cause u arent gonna fit through the alley to the parking garage. our floors never got swept or mopped after asking several times. Some of the rooms we saw were very clean and others like ours were filthy. we beleive some of the cleaning staff was very lazy and some were'nt. breakfast wasnt bad at all. the day clerk was so kind and helpful, she deserves to be at a much better property! the shower was full of mold and rust, we had to were sandels! the water was ice cold in the shower the first day! the night we checked in, the young man in the office said he had to go as soon as we walked up to the counter to check in. he left us in the office by ouselves waiting to get our keys, paperwork, etc. for 10 min., until another employee arrived to take over his shift! we were shocked at this. we couldnt beleive it! it was a fri. nite at 10:50 pm and no one there to tell us where to park, or nothing until someone else arrived! we go to new orleans all the time, and have always enjoyed our nice stays at different hotels, but never will we stay at this hotel again!

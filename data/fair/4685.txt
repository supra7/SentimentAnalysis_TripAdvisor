The Sheraton wasn't at all what I thought it would be, based on what I've come to expect from higher end Starwood properties. I don't recall reading anywhere that this was such a family focused property - most of these types of resort Starwood properties are a nice mix - but with its "lagoon" pool with fake lava rocks, and Gilligan Island-style straw "umbrellas," it was a big focus for children and ended up feeling like we were trapped in Disneyland for five days. PROS: we're snorkeling fans, and the location right at both Black Rock and Ka'anapali Beach (and the caliber of the snorkeling right from your room) was great; beds were comfortable and the rooms were very clean. CONS: mandatory $26/day "resort fee" which, as best I can tell, paid for their inadequate (system frequently disconnected) wired internet service; cheap pool chairs and amenities; "mai tai" bar was a sorry excuse for a Hawai'ian resort bar (or any bar, for that matter!); expensive beach umbrellas; no adult pool. Do your homework, and make sure it's what you're looking for -- especially at this price.

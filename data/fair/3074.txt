We were originally booked to stay at the Westin for 7 days, but after 2, we left to spend the rest of our vacation at another hotel. The Westin has not done a thing to upgrade the property in the 10 years since I've last visited. And to make matters worse, their staff are now the most unfriendly people I have ever encountered at a vacation resort. A few of the issues we had: No Lei greeting (no idea why, guess they just missed us), we were not made to feel "special" in any way - more like cattle!, the resort was SO crowded! You had to get out to the pool by 7am if you wanted a good seat.; the pool was freezing (70 degrees), the food and drinks were poor quality (Ono's) and VERY overpriced (even for Maui standards), You had to pay for any seating on the beach,and the beach sloped down quite a bit making it not so great for young kids. A bigger issue: the staff was so awful - the first room they put us in was water damaged...carpet pulled back and everything, we called the front desk and after being on hold for 10 minutes, they switched us to another room. This new room wasn't as nice as the first (well, it didn't have the water damage, but it also didn't have the nice partial ocean view). They would not upgrade us nor give us another room. They couldn't have cared less. When we left early, no one asked why. This is a resort that really doesn't care about quality, it's all about quantity. By the way, we spent the rest of our week at the Four Seasons and even with the price difference, the Four Seasons was worth every dime. I have never had a better experience then we had at the 4 seasons. Making that switch saved our vacation.

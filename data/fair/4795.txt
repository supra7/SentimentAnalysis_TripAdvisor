We booked 2 nights mainly based on reviews on TripAdvisor. Check in was quick, hotel seemed well run and taken care of. The problem was that the temperature in the room was quite warm and for some reason was not able to be adjusted. I called down to the front desk three times and was told three different stories: 1. They still had the heat on in the hotel because it was early spring and the ac couldn't be turned on, 2. They would call engineering and have them lower the temperature for our room, and finally, 3. There was nothing they could do & brought up a small desk fan. I've stayed in hotels all over the country and have never encountered this issue. The fact that it was never resolved made me swear off Langham hotels forever. I wrote to the management when we got home and never received a reply.

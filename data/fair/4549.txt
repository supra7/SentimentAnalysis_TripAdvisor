Pass this one up What ridiculously high room rates for a mediocre property that doesn't yet have its act together. I used to love the Kahala Hilton, and then Kahala Mandarin Oriental. New owners have a long way to go. There's more to running a new property than jacking up the rates and cutting back on service.

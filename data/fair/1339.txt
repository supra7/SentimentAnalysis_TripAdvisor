I try to stay at Hilton Garden Inn when I travel for business. Tripadvisor rated this hotel good. The location was poor with no place to go locally in what did not seem to be a safe neighborhood. The carpeting in my room was horrible. The worst I have ever seen at a Hilton Garden or any hotel I have stayed in over the past few years. Really surprised since I recommend Hilton Garden Inns overall. I will never stay here again uch better choices in the area at equal rates. Staff was nice perhaps just a bad room?

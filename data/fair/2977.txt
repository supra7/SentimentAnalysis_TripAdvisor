I cannot believe everyone is writing such great things about this property. I am not the pickiest person with hotels but I can be pretty discerning when it comes to nice up to date, clean rooms. I will say that the property was beautiful and well kept. The rooms are really what my major problem was for the trip. We were in town for a wedding and lucked up on some rooms at suite actually for $105 per night. The room was supposed to be $1050 per night. The first room I had was infested with ants on every piece of furniture. We were on the 3rd floor and there were ants. So we moved out to another suite with a different configuration and that alleviated the bug problem. I found the rooms to be very outdated. The loud floral patterns did not always match. We have 5 different colors of lamps in our room. The furniture was old and the Rattan looked as if it had seen better days. The carpet was old and quite worn as well. If this room was really $1050, I would have been offended. I would not have paid over $140 for this room and it was a huge suite. Say what you want, but this was no ritz to me. I have stayed in far better.

In my opinion it is the worst Marriott I've ever stayed. We stayed in the hotel for two nights over a weekend. The trip purpose was a nightlife, we stayed out until around 4 am hopping to sleep till at least 10 - 11 am. Each morning we were awaken at 7 or 8 am because someone in the neighboring room made some noises. I was able to hear entire conversation in the next room. When I complained to the front desk staff I was told they have full house. I see there are other reviews mentioned poor noise isolation in the hotel and I am pretty sure a hotel management aware of the situation. So, don't be greedy if you can't fix the issue don't sell the rooms with poor noise isolation or make customers aware of it. The staff in the hotel is very unfriendly. I also spoke with a front desk manager Mike, he has no customer service skills whatsoever. Rooms are poorly decorated and due for renovation long ago.

This property is in serious need of a face lift. The price for the tiny, dirty room is the same as many newer and cleaner rooms in the city. Do not be fooled into thinking that Marriott takes "care" of all of the properties the same. This hotel has bad food, slow elevatros and old carpet! YUCK. not a good introduction to Boston. Copley is a good "location" but Boston is not hard to get around. transportation is easy to get. Stay in another property- trust me. this is for real I just returned from this hotel last night.

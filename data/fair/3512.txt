The rooms were relatively nice, and a decent size for a king sized room. The elevators definitely need some fixing, they are small and it is a hassle just to get to the front desk (up to the second story, around the bar). Staff was not very helpful. The worst part of the hotel is the restuarant. Not only is it overpriced for an average breakfast buffet, but the service was horrible. They were slow and not very helpful (not worth leaving a tip). The atmosphere in the restaurant was just uncomfortable. Overall...nice rooms, but not much else nice about this hotel.

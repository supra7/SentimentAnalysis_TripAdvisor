My boyfriend and I stayed here for Labor Day weekend and it was okay. The place is old and it needs to be updated but the location is good... right on the beach and only about a 10 min walk to the boardwalk. With that said, we won't come back here. We only stayed at this hotel because it was a travel deal from Groupon for 3 nights ($150 total). The place might have potential if the rooms & building can be renovated. The elevators are a joke. You never know if it's going up or down and they are SLOW. I carried all my stuff down 9 floors to the parking lot after checking out because trying to get on an elevator was not possible. Other than the location, the saving grace of this place is the staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The worst part of this place is the restaurant. It is terrible!!! It took over 30 mins to get our food (burger & chicken sandwhich) and there were only 2 other guests there. Turns out all the 'to go' orders were getting filled as we just sat there waiting & wondering what was going on. Don't order the cole slaw... it's GROSS! Actually, it was all pretty gross. The rooms really need a face lift and the bathrooms need to be updated. This was the first time we have ever seen painted shower tiles. I'm sure it was cheaper to paint over them than replace them but really...??? If you get a cheap rate and don't care too much about aesthetics, then this might be worth a shot because of the location.

I was paying $400 per night at Westin, so I was expecting it to be like other Westins - great. It was nice. The standard rooms were more than just "standard," they were rooms that I would not pay more than $150 for it. Small, dirty, and awful bathroom. On the brighter side, the spa was EXCELLENT. Lots of pools, right on the beach. Though, I can get pools and beach for a lot less. Overall, I was disappointed.

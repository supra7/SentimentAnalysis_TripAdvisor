The Encore was supposed to be an 'Upgrade' over a room at the Wynn. While the room was very nicely decorated and clean, the towels were flimsy. Not what you would expect from a high end hotel. They do not have in-room coffee, fridge, DVD, or self-serve luggage cart. Smoke was not only in the casinos, but drifts into the restaurants, and into our 24th floor room ventilation system. Even 24 floors about the poolbar the music was loud until 3:00 or 4:00am.

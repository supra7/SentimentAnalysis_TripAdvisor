I checked in 2/25/11 and checked out 2/28/11. My forst night there, I looked around the room, it had a 27" old TV set, that was in a combo drawer and tv stand that was in bad need of painting, the handle used to open and close the drapes came of in my hand, and the alarm clock was digital, but did not light up. i went to take a shower and a used wash cloth was still in the shower! When I asked one of the cleaning ladies to correct it , you guessed it, she did not speak English !! And neither did her supervisor. Oh yea, if you like a nice shower you wont get one here. The water pressure was unpredictable, and it would go from hot to cold to hot. Avery Frustrating weekend. I would have check out and gone some where else but in a resort town, that is not easy, and I had business to take care of. Oh yea, if you eat at that steak house, be prepared to really pay allot for not much. Over all, I recommend going to Miami, or Alaska.

First of all, I don't know how this hotel can proudly display their Tripadvisor Excellent award at their reception. The hotel is terrible. We were on our honeymoon and they gave us a room with 2 single beds, joined together to form one queen size bed (each single bed has a roller at the bottom which moved). Rooms were too dark with insufficient lighting. Hotel staff were cold & standoffish. We had stayed at other hotels in various cities in Spain and this has got to be the worst reception. And don't let me start about the ghetto neighbourhood. We we warned by so many sellers around the area to be careful. Saw a couple of prostitutes around the hotel too. Not recommended for families and young girls. Infact, I wont recommend this hotel to anyone at all.

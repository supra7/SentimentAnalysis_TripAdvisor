Just opened, basic but clean Here for 3 nights for an exhibition. The Fair Hotel West opened 2 weeks ago and was already full. It is so new, that the taxi drivers did not know it was there and we had to direct all of them. At the economy end of the hotel market, in very expensive Frankfurt. Not to be confused with the Fair Hotel. Owned by the same group but located elsewhere. The reception closes at 21.00, so keys are left at the door in a dispenser. You have to use a pre-notified code to get your key from the dispenser. I did not need to use it, so I do not know if the system works or not. The hotel is more of a lodge than a hotel, as the facilities are limited. No restaurant, bar or lounge area, but you can buy a beer or two from reception.The rooms are small, but very clean with a TV (BBC World and CNN) and a welcome bottle of mineral water. Storage space was limited, but fine for a few nights. No room phone. Who uses them now anyhow. The bathroom was compact, but again very clean with a good shower. A good breakfast for a lodge, with a nice selection of cheeses, meats, etc and really nice coffee.The good points are that it is cheap, clean and witha good breakfast. The bad points are location. No restaurants in walking distsnce (well 15 min brisk walk if it's dry), hence it's a taxi ride everywhere and the costs build up over 3 nughts. The nearby town of Rodelheim (8 euro) is nice with plenty of bars and restaurants. In the other direction is Esleborn (12 euro). Again nice with plenty of places to eat and drink.Only other problem was the noise from the stairs. The hotel has no carpets on the concrete stairs, so you hear every step, particularly ladies shoes and also every conversation. I was on the ground floor and it did disturb my sleep. My colleague was on the third floor and he had no problems - he also had a huge bathroom.Overall, the place is ok and good value, but not for everyone. Virtually all the residents were from the exhibition centre, which is nearby (well a taxi ride away 15-20 euro)). Fine for a functional business venue, but for a romantic stay - forget it.

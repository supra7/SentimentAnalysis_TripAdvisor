Stayed at the Westin Maui as part of a business retreat, and had very mixed feelings. Pluses - really nice ocean view room on 7th floor, comfortable bed and a balcony overlooking gardens, definitely big enough and very nicely renovated. Small but adequate gym & spa looked nice. Housekeeping and front door staff were very helpful. Sunsets to die for Minuses - hotel is way, way too busy. Garden is like Disneyland - a huge playground with miles of different pools & concrete water slides . OK if you have highly energetic children who want to run & splash and yell all day, but not somwhere you can relax. There is one adults pool, but its small & crowded you have to be very sociable to be comfortable there. Restaurants are so busy both service & food suffer. But that said, if you have lots of children and want somewhere they can play, this may be your ideal vacation hotel

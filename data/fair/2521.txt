The lobby was very nice and the food was above-average, but the room was very small and the air conditioning did not work. The walls were very thin: I could hear every conversation taking place in the halls and adjoining rooms. The valet and bell service took approximately 30 minutes at check-in and check out. I tipped the bellman while I was waiting for my vehicle, which was a mistake because he left while I was still waiting. I would recommend the Swissotel, better prices, better service, and bigger air conditioned rooms.

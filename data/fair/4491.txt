Hotel was very pretty, service was fabulous. But the hotel is not well maintained, we may have just been unlucky but the first room we were in was so noisy we were moved to another which had a blocked toilet that flooded the room (and by the smell and wet floor this was not a new issue) then moved to a new room where the lights and tap didnt work. No rooms had curtains which is an issue for me as a light sleeper, no air con which contrary to popular belief IS needed in san francisco as it was warm and muggy. We were told to open the windows, its so noisy though that lead to no sleep either. Overall it was disappointing. I did send a complaint to the management but have had no reply. Hotel offers free wifi but it didnt work most of the time we were there. Oh and there is a $32 a night charge for valet parking and in a scarily busy part of SF we couldnt take the risk finding somewhere to leave the car so had to pay over $100 with taxes for 3 nights parking! Oh and the breakfast... it tries to be french cuisine but was poor choice to be honest

Mixed feelings about this place Having read the reviews I must be the only Irish person not to love this place!!During out stay last August the restaurant was under renovations - could live with this, no reduction in price of food despite having to eat it in tiny bar.Rooms were absolutely tiny and very noisy, bed not comfortable at all.Service excellent although we arrived at 10pm and room still not ready for us.Stayed for 2 nights before moving onto W Times Square which was more our scene - really modern. Had 2 great nights in the Bar in the Fitzpatrick but it was just like being out at home and we wanted something more New York style!Overall felt the place was over rated for what we paid.

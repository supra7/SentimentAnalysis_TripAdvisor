I can't believe the great ratings people are giving this hotel! Yes the staff are friendly but very young. We were asked at breakfast 'do you have a last name?' doesn't everyone? The rooms are ok but certainly not 4 star rated. We visited the Coronado on our way back to the Pacific Terrace & it is a true luxury hotel with rates about $100 less a night. We could have cried. The website really misleads guests - there is no spa as such, it is a door which is locked and you have to call a number. The pool is small and unheated with scruffy dated lounger cushions. The breakfast was lukewarm with no fresh toast or hot tea. The so called room service is from local restaurants not inhouse. We walked to see what they were like, they were jam packed with drunks, music thumping - 8pm. Then there were the vagrants, stinking on the benches we walked past along the beach which was badly lit - also people just staggering about, drugged up, smoking weed. We had our kids with us who were scared so did a quick walk round the block and came back without dinner. The hotel is in an area of small streets leading to the beach, some of the homes have furniture dumped in the gardens and it's generally a run down scruffy area with no fine dining. Fine for spring breakers, not families. Our dinner on our 2nd night was snacks from the CVS - great! Realistically the price per night should be $150. $20 for valet parking is also a joke - we got our own car out every time. It is more like an inn or motel that has been refurbished to look good with selective photography and wording. They should watch out for trading standards.

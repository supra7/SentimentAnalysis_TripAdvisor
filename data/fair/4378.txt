I'm writing this review based on three days in a single bedroom w/ Queen bed. My wife and I booked this over the internet, based on the reviews we read. We were extremely disappointed! We got there with two suitcases of luggage and had to haul it up a long flight of stairs to get to the lobby. This isn't fun by any means. The receptionist then told us we had to go another two floors to get to our room. And the best part - no elevator. So if you have luggage, this is going to be a pain in the.. well.. all over. The room itself was very dark (even with all the lights turned on) and was cramped. The bathroom is TINY! I will be including pictures with my review so you can see for yourself. The beds were hard - and I'm usually not picky about beds at all. But this was ridiculous. We would have slept on the floor but there wasn't enough space. The room was so cold, we had to ask for an extra heater. But when I plugged in the heater, the fuse blew, so all the lights went out! Later, when I asked for an iron and board, they sent me an ironing board with holes in it. The iron spewed dirty water on my trousers so I had to wear jeans instead. All this on the first day! Needless to say, we were extremely frustrated. As another reviewer mentioned, the wireless is terrible. I've got better wireless at home. It was slow and had weak signal quality everywhere. So if you want to check out the sights and sounds of NY, bring a brochure because you can't use the internet to look anything up. There are only two good things about this hotel - staff and location. The staff were friendly and quick to respond to our requests and issues. And believe me, we had a lot of issues with this hotel. The location is also great. Lots of places to see and good food all around. It's also right next to the subway, so makes commuting very simple. We paid around $150/night and would NEVER come here again. It's not woth $75/night let alone anything more. Please look elsewhere.

Very chic, contemporary hotel near Faneuil Hall. Nice room, nice restaurant, bed not equal to Starwood or W in comfort but adequate. Booked hotel through trip advisor advertised rate plus additional 10% click-on discount. Hotel looked into at my request but denied knowledge of additional discount deal, saying my rate of $179 was far lower than typical in any case. Didn't appreciate the insinuation I was being greedy as opposed to taking advantage of advertised deal. There was, in fact a lower rate of $169 through "Perfect Getaways" discount service but I went with Trip Advisor deal since I'd never heard of the other service. Also think it's greedy for upscale hotel to charge you for wi-fi these days when Holiday inns are giving it for free.

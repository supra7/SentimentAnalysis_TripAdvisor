What a difference a year makes. One year earlier nice orchid leis at the entry, now cheap made-in China tiny sea shell necklaces. Now you stand in check-in line for over an hour. Hotel Maintenance has suffered greatly. What a shame, this was once a decent property. Won't be back for a long time, if ever. At least the flamingos are still alive. Nearby Leilani's and the Hula Grill are still great food (and drinks). Be sure to catch Leilani's Early Bird dinners (upstairs). Onsite buffet breakfast still good, but waaayyy overpriced. Pool remains a touch on the cold side (colder than prior year?). Parasailing with UFO Parasailing on the beach near the front of the hotel, remains very reasonable, fun and safe.

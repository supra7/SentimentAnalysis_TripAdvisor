The quality of the room (ours was room 113) was poor relative to the price paid (well over $200/night). The hotel is old and quaint, the staff was friendly and helpful, and it is located in the center of the town which makes it easy to walk to restaurants and shops. However, while the Mount View has done some minor touches to make rooms more comfortable such as replacing the bedding and installing flat screen televisions, the hotel interior needs a major overhaul to bring it up to modern standards. Some of the major issues: 1) Many wooden floorboards under the carpet creak - this is especially bothersome for late night bathroom runs. 2) The rooms are VERY small and not luxuriously appointed. We had a hard time finding room for 2 suitcases. 3) The bathroom was dated (tub with old-style shower curtain) with a free standing sink, very small vanity and little room for toiletries...not suitable for most women. 4) Noisy window unit heat/air conditioners with no thermostats to control temperature.... 5) Old style deadbolt locks with big metal keys - don't automatically lock on exit, and are easy to copy. 6) Very limited parking and no valet. At times we could not find any parking on property or anywhere nearby. This property has so much potential if the owners would spend the money to upgrade it...

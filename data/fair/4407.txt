the hotel itself is so well located that it's easy to fall for it, but behind its doors there's not such a wonder. typical victorian stairs make it hard to get to the last floor,where my room was, with luggage. breakfast room is a tiny tiny room behind the reception, with not enough chair for all customers and no service at all, so it all ended up in a mess and a waste of money. better head off somewhere else for breakfast. when we entered the basin in our room was stuck and the following days cleaning service was not the good I expected it to be. Good if you want to be in central london, but onestly I will suggest to keep on searching for a good hotel.

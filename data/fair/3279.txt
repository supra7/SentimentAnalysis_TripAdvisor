This was my second experience at an Intercontinental hotel. I have stayed at the Intercontinental Buckhead in Atlanta. That hotel was amazing, and worth every penny. Naturally, I expected something on par with the Atlanta Intercontinental. Here are the glaring problems I encountered with the New Orleans version: 1. No restaurants nearby. I understand that Katrina was devastating to local business, but regardless, the restaurant selection in close proximity to the hotel is abysmal. The closest restaurant was quiznos- "grand opening" in a couple weeks. You get the idea. 2. Decor. The decor is in serious need of a facelift. It seems like it was en vogue at one point, maybe about 1983. 3. Hotel food. This is my biggest gripe. Unreal. Highlight #1- ordered a mediocre turkey sandwich to my room- $20. Highlight #2- attempted to buy brunch sunday morning- was told that I would HAVE to buy the $42 champagne breakfast in order to eat at the hotel restaurant. They were literally not serving anything else. I passed on the 42 dollar breakfast. Highlight #3- attempted to eat dinner at the restaurant. I arrived at 5:15, 15 minutes after they open for dinner. Stood there for 10 minutes, waiting for the hostess, nobody. wandered around the restaurant, saw nobody, heard cooks chatting in the kitchen. Left. One might ask why I insisted on ordering room service and then attempted to eat at the hotel restaurant. See complaint number one. 4. Prices. Soda + gardettos snack mix- $7. NY Times sunday edition- $6. The stunned look on my face- priceless. 5. Room service. Sucks. Showed up in the morning, too early EVERY time, told them to please come back later once I was gone. Never came back. In 3 days. 6. Local Complaints- I know Katrina was a big deal, but this city needs to right itself at some point on its own will and stop looking to the federal government for handouts. Businesses that ARE open are hideously overpricing their products, and the city is just plain dirty.

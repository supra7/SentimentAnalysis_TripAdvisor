I wish I could write a better review of this hotel but it was a disappointing experience. I had high hopes when the reservationist upgraded my room to a deluxe with a balcony and fireplace. The pros: Location is great. I had a great view of Quincy Market. The hotel is within walking distance to many places especially the North End. The staff was very nice. Great breakfast by room service which was included in the price of the room. The cons: The room was outdated. Bad lighting. The bathroom was OK but the bathrobes were old and hard to the touch. Very loud street noise. The heater/conditioner was next to the bed and kept my husband up all night. The canopy over the bed was broken. You have to call room service for ice. The fireplace is not electric or gas so you have to call the front desk to bring a fire log and light it and then plan on staying in the room while the fire is going ( 2 to 3 hours) or call the front desk when you leave so they can put out the fire log. It's a nice touch but too much to think about and plan during a one night stay. Parking is $40. We parked at a local garage, it was the same price but we got more hours for the same amount of money. (We stayed in Boston shopping long after check out. ) The biggest disappointment was that they ran out of hot water at 10am. My husband had to take a cold shower. When I called down to the front desk they said a pipe had burst in the basement. I told him the same thing happened the last time we stayed there a few years back ( and gave us the same story) and he accused me of calling him a liar. I told him that there was no way this could have happened AGAIN!!!! So if you stay here make sure you shower early!!!! There are many great hotels to choose from in Boston that offer great deals like breakfast and parking included in the price. Check around.

My friends and I reserved a "Living" suite to celebrate my 40th birthday. When we showed up to check in, however, we learned that they had given our suite away to another customer and were just going to give us a normal room. We complained, but the staff said there were no more large suites available. The staff were apologetic and put us in a much smaller, mini-suite, along with an extra room. The mini-suite had poor temperature control, however, and was very hot. Overall very upsetting. Otherwise very chic-looking hotel, clean, staff pretty friendly.

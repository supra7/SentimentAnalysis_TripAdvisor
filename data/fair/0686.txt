We paid $12 per person to have the shuttle take us to and pick us up at the pier from our cruise. We even scheduled a pick up time and everything, we called when the ship arrived, they didnt pick us up until 1 1/2 hours later!!!! I would just pay for a taxi. It seems like the manager is more interested in saving money instead of catering to his customers that paid for a service. We found out he waited till he had passengers to take to the pier till he would come and get us.

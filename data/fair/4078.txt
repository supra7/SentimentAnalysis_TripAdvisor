My wife and I stayed here six nights this past June (2009). The hotel is beautiful and the staff was courteous and proffessional. The check-in process was quick, but that could be due to our early arrival time (10:00 AM). The room was large, which was one of the reasons that we chose this hotel. The food was excellent in the restaurants and [lentiful in serving size. However... ...the air conditioning system is a terrible design. The unit is located in the living room with no other vents in the bedroom or bathroom. So it's 60 degrees in the living room and 85 degrees in the bathroom! The casino is a yawner, pool is packed (which is to be expected) and the clubs do not offer any advantage to gaining entry, even though you are a guest of the hotel....probably because at the this time they are the hottest clubs....although on a phone call before our trip, we were told that our room key would gain us entry...this policy is not adhered to.

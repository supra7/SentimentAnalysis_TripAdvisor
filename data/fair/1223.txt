Initially stayed at an Extended Stay around the corner from the Deluxe because they were out of rooms. That trip was from hell so I was able to stay at the Deluxe for free. The lobby is small and cozy. The exercise room is small as a walk in closet with 3 treadmills. Wi-fi is NOT FREE! I loved the location of our room because it was all the way at the end of hall. We were not between two rooms just one to our left. I was close to the exit and was able to view my car out of my window. I mention that as a plus because guest, I assume they were guest, were in and out constantly! They were leaving rocks to keep the door open. It made me a bit nervous but I guess no one from the street would walk into the hotel. Our room was clean. The bed slept okay, nothing fancy. The big chair had cigarette holes and wires sticking out that it almost tore my shirt. I never sat in the chair due to the holes but hubby found it comfortable. The let out couch was great for the kids. I hated the fridge because you had to stand away from it to open. It was very annoying and it never got cold. The freezer worked well. Bathing the kids was a choir because we had to use a rag to plug the drain. My hubby left his toothbrush and they have signs stating how they could provide you with one. I went to the front desk and they did not have any however fresh sheets and blankets were available. Shopping is close by so if you had to go to the grocery store or to Wal-mart, it is convenient. In conclusion, the bug traps were visible from behind the couch and corners of the bed. It was a free stay and again, I don't think I'd go back. Extended Stay and Extended Stay Deluxe is not for me and my family!

It was a busy time in Boston so hotel rooms we're scarce and we paid quite a lot for this one compared to the rest of our 3 week trip, but we don't mind that for good quality. The hotel communal areas are lovely and the staff helpful, but the room was so small, I'm 5 ft 11 and couldn't sit on the loo without my knees pressed up against the wall, nor get out of bed without kicking a desk chair. We go away a lot and have stayed in small rooms but nothing like this, the size of the room was not helped by the large furniture e.g. A big cabinet for the tv rather than having the tv on the wall, a huge desk which was useless as you couldn't sit at it - bad design. I'd like to give this hotel more points but really can't given the fundamental problems with the room. I'm sure other rooms are fine but based on our experience we wouldn't return, perhaps just pop in for a drink at the bar and stay elsewhere.

Our family stayed one night during our trip to LA last month. The hotel was located in a walking distance to the Hollywood walk of fame and less than a 15 minute drive to Griffith observatory and Getty center. The room was very clean and the staff in the front desk was very kind and accommodating. Free breakfast was OK though not impressive. Our room was located right below the fitness center, and we couldn't sleep after 6:00 a.m. becuase of the noise coming from the tradmill in the fitness center. I had to call the front desk twice to stop the noise. When we came back to the room after the breakfast, the tradmill noise resumed and we could not take a rest at the room. Considering that comfort and sleep quality are two main concerns when we choose the hotel is 'comfort,' this hotel was the worst choice in our trip to L.A.

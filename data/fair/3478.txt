I checked in for a 2 night stay and it started off well. The front desk informed me I was upgraded to a nicer room. As soon as I walked in and put my bags down, I shuddered to imagine what my original room must've looked like. There were empty bottles of cheap wine from the mini fridge around my room. After calling to complain, they assured me I wouldn't be charged for the bottles, but didn't send anyone up to clean my room. There were vomit stains on the sofa, the room smelled like stale cigarette smoke, and the lamps and light switches were either cracked or completely not functional. When it came time to check out, sure enough I was charged for the wine bottles and a slew of other items I never took. Although they promptly removed the charges, there will have to be a LOT of changes made before I consider The Time again.

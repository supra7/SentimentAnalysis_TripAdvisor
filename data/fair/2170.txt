I stayed at the Park Plaza for a conference. Based on the hotel's website, where it says that presidents and world leaders stay there, I expected it to be luxurious and highly service oriented. Instead, it was a worn old hotel with a low commitment to customer service. Here were some problems with my room. --occasional sewagey smell in bathroom --broken heater (heater would not turn on, then after it was "fixed" would not turn off) --old TV with remote that did not work --shower with water pressure that increased and decreased at random --shower that got hotter and colder at random --tiny bathroom with bad design - it was hard to wash my face without bumping my head on the shelf that stuck out above the sink --broken hair dryer --scratchy towels --hairs on bed when I arrived --filthy mirror --NO free WI-FI (they have free WI-FI even at the Holiday Inn) and the business center was not free either. It required a $10 payment to go online for 30 minutes. --very long wait times when I called to get some of these problems addressed In addition, the hotel could have been very charming if it had been properly restored or renovated. But instead there was 80-year-old tile in the bathrooms and it looked just a little dilapidated in general. I stayed a Doubletree in February which was cheaper and WAY nicer. The neighborhood was wonderful though.

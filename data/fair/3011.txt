We are currently staying at the Westin Maui Resort and Spa. We're loyal Starwood visitors and we've stayed in many of their best properties. To say we are disappointed in the Westin Maui would be an understatement. Our room is old and badly in need of a renovation. It's also very, very small. Despite having Gold status and being Starwood "VIPs" we were not given the customary upgrade, and instead received a tiny, shoddy room that literally overlooks a trash dumpster. We were told there were no upgrades available, but the hotel is not booked to capacity, so we find that hard to believe. Grace at the front desk was rude and unhelpful. However, many of the cleaning staff and bellhop staff are very helpful and accommodating. The hotel is in a great location, and the common areas (pool, lobby, etc) are pretty nice. Bottom line; next time you're on Maui stay at a nicer place, even if it costs more. The Ritz Carlton in Kapalua and the Four Seasons in Kihei are more expensive, but you get a lot more out of it.

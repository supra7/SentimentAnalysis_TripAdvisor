We booked through seattlebedandbreakfast.com and were very disappointed. For the price we paid, wireless internet should have been complimentary. Instead, it was $12 PER COMPUTER (not per room). As others have said, the rooms are small by US standards. The bathroom was particularly tiny and wasn't all that clean. We weren't a big fan of the grey decor, tiny elevators and overpriced extras in the room. This hotel seems to have been designed by someone trying really hard to be cool, but not quite getting it. The only thing that saved this from a one-star review was the good location. Oh, parking is $23/day too.

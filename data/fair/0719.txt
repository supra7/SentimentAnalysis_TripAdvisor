Oh, my gosh. This place is falling apart. The first room they gave me smelled so mouldy that I could not stay there, besides the fact that it overlooked the picnic table where the employees go to smoke. Dragged all my luggage back to the front desk and asked if they had another room that was maybe remodeled sometime in the last two decades. They upgraded me to a so-called "suite" which had also not been upgraded since probably the 80's. Fading yellow wallpaper, 4-5 patched holes in the ceilings where water had leaked in previous years, hole in the ceiling above the shower, shoddy furnishings -- this place really is an embarassment for the Radisson chain. The only redeeming feature was the bar/lounge where I had a decent chicken sandwich for a resonable price. Oh, and within walking distance of the airport which was kind of nice. But more than anything else this hotel needs serious refurbishment.

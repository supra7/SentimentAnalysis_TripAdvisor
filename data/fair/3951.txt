My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Rex for 5 nights in September 2005. I booked the hotel based largely on the positive TripAdvisor Reviews. I have to say that it mystifies me as to why the reviews of this hotel are so positive. Our room and the elevator were very small and the hallways had a strong musty odor. I never bothered to review the hotel at the time of our stay but we have since stayed at the Palace, the Hilton and the Salerno. All these hotels were superior to the Rex and were approximately the same price. I noted from the fire escape map that our room was the smallest on the floor but even with a larger room I would not return.

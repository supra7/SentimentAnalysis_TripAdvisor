Just stayed at the Trump hotel for a few days on business. I was unaware of the train issue until I woke up to the tremendous noise at 6AM the first night there. I was too busy to bother complaining. The view from the back of this hotel is really classic (lets just use he word seedy) If you like trains you can see the freight train roll out with 100 cars hitting the horns for several minutes in the wee hours. The second night I heard the first train at 3:45 AM. Ok let me discuss a few things. Resort Fee-Total Ripoff. I was told at the front desk it included internet. At checkout I was told it did not. I had nothing in writing telling me what it covered so there was nothing I could do. Cost me an extra $36.00 that I might not have used if I knew I had to pay. Free Vaket parking? I did not have a car but no hotel in vegas charges for parking. The gym was ok,with a number of problems with the touch screens on treadmills. My room had stained carpet and the hip tv in the bathroom not working. There was a tray of dirty dishes outside in the hall near my room for three days. That must be a record. I have a nice picture of that. Plenty of people housekeeping and other employees must have walked by it and did not bother picking it up. (probably the not my job stuff) Spoke to a few people on the way to the airport they had plenty of probems with bathtub problems etc. They train woke them up as well. Some employees friendly and others were pretty chilly. Due to the train noise this is just not worth the hassle. The walk to the strip is not great either. Its a little seedy and the only thing I can say is that it is not like walking a few bloacks to the vegas strip from most other areas. I would love to share a suite with trump for the night to see how he likes the place. I dont buy the nonsense about different management companies running rooms etc.

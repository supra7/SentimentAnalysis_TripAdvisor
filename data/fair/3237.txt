I am in the Roosevelt now and feel compelled to write about my experience. I pulled up to the valet and popped the trunk, the valet pulls my suitcase out of the trunk and pulls up the handle for me to roll it myself as he hands me a ticket. Gee, thanks. So now that I'm carrying my luggage, the only way in is up the stairs to the lobby. I am given a room key and I'm told that valet parking is $40/day. What a scam, why not just charge $50 or $75?. It would be good to know that I was going to be overcharged for parking before I booked the room. Or at least mask it by charging more for the room where the rate is known and then charge something reasonable for parking. In my room there is a 10oz bottle of water in the mini bar for $5. Fine, I drink it, but I need more water. I go looking for vending and there is none. I call room service and they bring me 4 warm bottles and I wonder will it be $10 per bottle?. I ask them for ice and they tell me there is an ice machine down the hall. The decor is nice but they forgot about the basic need and expectation of the guests. Dont scam them on parking, carry luggage up stairs...preferably to room, provide bottle water, and if asked for ice just go get it. So far, a terrible experience. I come to NOLA 4-5 times a year for the food. But I wont be returning to the Roosevelt. Save yourself the trouble and go to The Windsor Court or the W in the Quarter. You'll be glad you did.

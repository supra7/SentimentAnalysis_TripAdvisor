The hotel is a nice property with a friendly staff but for business travelers this hotel should be avoided. Business travelers who need reliable, high speed Internet access, similar to what you expect at major hotel chains will be strongly dissappointed. From my room, both the hardwire and wireless connections were extremely slow. When I complained that the service was slow, I was told that a conference at the hotel was using up most of the hotels bandwidth. I was told that the problem would go away the following day when the guests from this event leave. The same poor Internet service existed the following day. I even got up at 6:00 am in the morning to get access to important files and edit some websites, and the speed was unacceptable. Any business traveler who needs Internet access at normal speeds should avoid this property.

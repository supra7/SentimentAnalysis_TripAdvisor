We travel to Manhattan several times per year and have stayed in just about every hotel in the Times Square area. Having spent four nights at the W Hotel, we can safely say that we shall never return. SERVICE: No complaints but the army of "bouncers" dressed in black at the entrance seemed quite unnecessary. They made little to effort to do anything other than stand around and grunt. Front desk staff were awesome as were the room service ladies. DECOR: Ultra modern and chic but they really over-shot. The rooms were also similarly ultra-sleek, but appeared cluttered. Given the fact that the rooms are barely larger than the average bathroom, the whole pink lighting / glass doors / funky light fixtures just did not mesh well at all. ROOMS: These were the smallest rooms that I have ever stayed in, even by Manhattan standards. The bathroom was the size of a cupboard, with the toilet literally jammed in between the sink and shower. LOBBY: Always buzzing with people which was great. The fact that some hip-hop crowd was there made the place much less appealing, well unless the smell of marijuana is particularly appealing to you. Even more annoying was the need to take one elevator to get to the lobby and then a second elevator to get to your room. You need to budget almost 20 minutes just to get out of the damn hotel. OVERALL: Great location, nice decor all in all but really a tremendous waste of money given the alternatives right next door and around the corner. PLAN TO RETURN: Absolutely not.

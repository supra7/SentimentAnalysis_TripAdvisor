It was a most horrible experience that we had at this hotel. The room was small and dimly lighted. There were insufficient lights in the room and when we drew back to curtains, we realised the reason for the insufficient lights. The carpet was stained and looks dirty and the wallpaper was patchy! The bathroom is equally small and there is no space to place our toiletries in the shower cubicle. We had to keep opening the shower cubicle door to get our toiletries while showering. There was a day when the room was not made up when we came back to the room in the afternoon. We then requested for them to clean the room, when we came back in the evening we realised that the room was not cleaned! They had straighten the bedsheets and given us fresh towels but we can see that the sheets were crumpled. The breakfast at this hotel was also the worse we had in Italy. The eggs and bacon were cold, coffee was not fresh and the service at breakfast was non-existent. It was essentially a self service cafeteria. We end up having our breakfast at our own expense outside the hotel after experiencing it the first day. The last straw was on the day of our check out. Check out time was 12noon as usual and we were about to go down when the electricity was cut off in the room! Prior to that we can hear the chambermaid taking a call in the hall (the walls were that thin) confirming that we are still in the room etc. We had never experienced hotels cutting off the electricity once it's passed the check out time.

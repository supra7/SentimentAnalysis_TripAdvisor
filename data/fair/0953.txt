We absolutely loved Hawaii overall, and Maui in particular. However, The Ka'anapali Beach Hotel was the worst experience. No one was mean or rude, the staff were perfectly fine. However the hotel and the grounds were pretty "dumpy" (for lack of better words right now). It all looked and smelled musty and old. They really need to do some major updating on this location. Also, we went to the on-site restaurant the day we arrived. They had *only* a pre-fixed menu (for Valentines Day) AND they didn't tell us until 20 minutes after we had ordered that the non-red meat options were all sold out. Seriously!? I don't eat red meat; and they didn't have any vegetarian options or any chicken or seafood options. Only red meat left. And they waited a full 20 minutes after we had ordered to bother to tell me this. That was very disturbing. I had to ask for the manager and they came up with a meal option that was not on the menu....but it really took advocacy on my part to get them to offer that. The Beach location was great. The buildings, grounds were in poor shape. They need to do renovations. I would highly suggest doing more research and finding a different hotel.

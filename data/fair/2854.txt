We were very pleased to arrive at the Grand Wailea. The bellman and people at check-in were very nice. Our room was not ready, so we walked around and were amazed at the grounds size and beauty. Once our room became available we were also surprised and amazed at the amount of hair and ants on our bathroom floor. We started to clean up the bathroom, but since we were paying $300.00 a night we decided to call housekeeping to do it. Once housekeeping came up, they cleaned the floor with a couple of washcloths. Now I'm no expert, and possibly someone else had the vacuum, but it may of been nice to actually use the vacuum since the washcloth did not do the trick. We should also say they were kind enough to upgrade us when we arrived. However, if I had a choice I would just as soon have the room I paid for than the room with extra amenities.(i.e. see hair and ants above) Not to sound totally down on our Maui trip, on day 4 we really felt that we finally did get a clean room. However, I am not sure they are affilated with the Four Seasons. To be completely honest- nice resort, bad room.

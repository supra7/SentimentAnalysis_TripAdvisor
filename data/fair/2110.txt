This hotel is quite expensive ($400+ per night) and yet fails to deliver on the minimum you'd expect from luxury pricing. The hotel room was fine, spacious even, but the carpet seemed dirty, and my room faced inward, which meant plain viewing into other guest rooms (and vice versa). Oddly there were two bathrooms, but each one tiny, dated and hard to navigate (no surface areas for your things, little room to turn around). Basics were out of place - the room didn't have a do not disturb sign and the power outlets seemed ancient and risky when I plugged in my laptop. Also, at that price point, does charging $12-15/day for internet access really make sense? The biggest frustration came the evening before my departure when I went downstairs to print my boarding pass. They have a dedicated computer and printer for that, which was nice, but the printer was not working. I asked the front desk person for help, and she pointed me upstairs to the business center (as opposed to offering to do it herself). So I went upstairs to try again on printing my boarding pass, only to see that all of the printers in the business center were also out of service.

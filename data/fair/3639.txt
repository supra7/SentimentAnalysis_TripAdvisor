After a long flight from Belfast, Northern Ireland we were extremely tired so glad of the great location. However, we had booked to non smoking twin rooms. Firstly, the receptionist told us there were no twin rooms left, then she tried to give us two twin rooms 4 floors apart. Finally we got two on the same floor, but they were far way from each other and smoking rooms. The smell in the corridors was terrible. The rooms were no bigger than a postage stamp and the view was a breeze block wall, making the rooms very dark. However, on the plus side, being at the back we didnt hear any traffic and the location was excellent.. The lobby was stunning two, and the candle smelt lovely. Still not worth the money though.

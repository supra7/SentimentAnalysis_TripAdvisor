They have a lot of scripts for the staff that imply great customer service but must not have the infrastructure to deliver an even average experience. From missing items in my room (one day no trash can, next day no bath mat...) to claims of fresh oj that's not, the w just didn't deliver. These are all little things but every day i experienced several weird things that made it not worth the money.

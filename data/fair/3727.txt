I stayed here for five days while at a conference. Conference rate was $199 a night plus tax - very high, I thought. The hotel was very clean, nice lobby. Their claim to fame is that they march a few ducks in on a red carpet every morning and let them swim in the lobby fountain for the day - at the end of the day, they march all the ducks back out. There are usually more than a hundred people trying to watch and photograph this "event." Stay out of the lobby at 11 and 5!! The room was clean, comfortable, and we had plenty of towels, etc. I didn't find any staff that I spoke to who were very friendly - most of them had the attitude of "uppity". Excuse me -you're hotel employees, not British royalty! Outside there is a white sidewalk, white curb, and white road - very hard to differeniate the difference with sun glare. I fell, and was badly bruised for a month! Security took my statement for an incident report, offered to take me to a hospital, and provided me with ice and an ace bandage for my knee. Afterwards, they called once to see if I was OK. Bottom line - I don't think guest safety is a big factor. Food and beverages in the hotel were very high priced and nothing special. The background music was kind of old-fashioned. Overall, I could have had a room at several other hotels locally that were more down to earth, price wise and a lot more pleasant service-wise.

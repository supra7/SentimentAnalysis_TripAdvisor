I stayed here for two weeks in March - and especially given the extended stay I would have expected a much better room. My room was truly miniscule with barely enough room to walk around the bed and a bathroom that was ridiculously cramped (with the sink and toilet bowl effectively on top of each other). The view was also of a roof top with vents and the room was very dark with limited lighting. There was a sign in the room that offered extra Starwood points because the room was so small. I asked for a different room but was offered one of the same size with a bathroom that was maybe 6-12 inches larger and the only benefit being that it had a better view (of the street). The location is good for meetings in midtown, but I would try somewhere else the next time I'm in town. On the positive side, the bed was quite comfortable.

Ok, I love an old historic hotel...Diskoll ( sp) in Austin, the Grove Park Inn, but this hotel is just an "old" building. It was built in 1925 and I love that, BUT< BUT..it has not been updated...the carpet is gross, the elevator makes you feel like it's going to crash the cables squeak, but not in a good way. The Hotel bar and food closes at 10:00. We had no hot water the last day..I could go on..the main thing is I feel like this hotel is misrepresented..it is not "historic" it hasn't been taken care of..I wouldn't stay here again. I really can't understand how anyone would give this hotel rave reviews....

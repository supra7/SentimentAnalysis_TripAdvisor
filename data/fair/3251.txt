Will not recommend this hotel. The staff is not really helpful and the managers are downright rude, specially the night manager Mr. Johan Nguyen. The hotel is definitely in need of renovations. Very overpriced and there is an event scheduled in town, the management as well as the reservation coordinator Mrs Nicole Harisson indulge shamelessly into price gauging which is actually against the law. STAY AT OWN RISK as you cannot complain to anyone at corporate level. This hotel is part of the FRANCHISE program of the Intercontinental Hotel Group and is operated by the owner, and does NOT reflect the usual higher standard of most of Intercontinental Hotels. Would never recommend this hotel to families with children or/and senior citizen,as they can fall prey to an unscrupulous management. Not worth the money nor the trouble!

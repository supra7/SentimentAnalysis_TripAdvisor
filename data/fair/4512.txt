Gharana, Indian Restaurant is tired place to have food. We went to have food with family. food is good. service is slow. we didn't even finish the food and plates were taken off. seems staff was in hurry to go home. Good promotion, good food but service is a big question mark. Another thing about singers. taking long break when customers are there to enjoy. If song is not available no one offers second option. Well, need to think twice before visit them again.

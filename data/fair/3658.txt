I had stayed at W-The Court previously and loved it. So when my wife wanted us to return to New York but stay near Fifth Avenue, I -- without thinking -- booked a room at the W-New York. Without question, it's a **great** location. But Be Warned: The rooms are SMALL. As in, when we opened the door to our room, my wife said, "You have got to be kidding me." It was (much) smaller than my dorm room at USC. The Good: Service was good. Lobby was gorgeous. Bar had that cool W vibe. Spa was only OK. I asked for a male therapist, and I wasn't very impressed. Plus, the decor was rather bizarre -- hard to explain...felt like I had done some really hard drugs or something. Or like I had entered The Twilight Zone. Gotta say, though: Location was terrific!

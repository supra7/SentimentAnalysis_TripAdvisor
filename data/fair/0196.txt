Stayed here for four nights and realized it is a poor value and not up to Marriott/Renaissance standards. Poor location, Multi-lane freeway on the east side and high rise buildings on the west side that completely block the view to Puget Sound, and a long downhill-uphill walk to restaurants/shopping. Furniture in the room tired. Flat Screen TV but not high definition, always annoying. Small refrigerator did not work. Poor lighting in bathroom which is good if you don't want a close look at your face. Service very uneven,newspaper outside door on some days not on others, same with evening service to room. No material in room on TV and hotel amenities.Don't plan to eat here because it is difficult to figure out which restaurants are open at what times. If you are a Marriott rewards member, as I am, you will have a much better experience at the Downtown Residence Inn at Lake Union.

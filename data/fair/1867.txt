Ok at first glance to place dont look to bad. But when you get in and book your hotel you find rude service from some of the people behind the counter way over priced parking for them to take care of your car making you park several blocks away in an unsafe public parking lot where there is no one watching your personal belongings. Now lets talk about your room they give you two free cupons for drinks but that all depends on what they have they couldint even provide a person with a simple beer. Ok now you get up to your room you walk in and see a few different thing like a bottle of water that you would think would be free after paying for this place but oh NO it cost 3 dollars for something that you can walk three and a half blocks down to the 7Eleven and get for a dollar thirtynine. They tell you that they have free cookies and milk until 10 but nope they ovously dont know how to make an good amount becasue yeah there were none when we got here. All I have to say is that this place could use alot of people to quit coming to it for the simple reason they need to be made aware that they are here for US not them selfs.

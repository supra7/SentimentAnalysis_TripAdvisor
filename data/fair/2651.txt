The best thing about this hotel is the view. Check - in was a nightmare. 7 people working the desk and it still took 1/2 an hour. When we finally reached the check-in desk, our king sized room wasn't ready. (this was after 4 with check in allowed at 3:00PM) We were told we could have 2 queens or wait for the King. We took the queens - not an upgrade! The room was clean with a beautiful view. The furnishings are outdated, tiny table, no fridge, old tv. - nothing special. It was also noisy. We could hear the people next door unzipping their suitcases and muffled conversations. We went to Doc Bales restaurant in the hotel for breakfast. We weren't given any menues, just told where the buffet was. The buffet was substandard, runny eggs, greasy sausage and a cockroach skittering across the floor as my husband entered the buffet room. The common areas outside were littered with fast food containers, cigarette butts and papers. The 5th floor pool was filthy, mats of hair and feathers in a cloudy soup. The staff were very nice and tried to be accomodating, but they are overwhelmed. This property needs to hire more people and upgrade their facilities considerably before we would ever come back.

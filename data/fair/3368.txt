I stayed here for two nights in the beginning of October. Although the Inn seems quite nice on first encounter, it's just not clean enough. There was a lot of mold in my shower (thank goodness I had brought flip-flops) and the floor of the room was not carpeted. The junkies that seem to frequent it are a problem as well. There was a woman with many open sores on her legs who had them stuck in both the pool and hot tub as she and her partner (male) were inappropriately loud in the courtyard outside the downstairs rooms. The cleaning staff was incredibly loud in the courtyard very early as well. The location is fantastic and this place could be wonderful but they've got a long way to go before I'll stay there again.

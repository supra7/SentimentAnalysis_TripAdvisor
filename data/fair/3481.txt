I booked the Time Hotel because of the decent rate and great location, however, I found out quickly you get what you pay for. The rooms in this once hot boutique hotel are dingy and need work, and I questioned the cleanliness. The first room I was given did not have working air conditioning, so they finally allowed me to switch rooms, but the new room did not have a safe (which they eventually fixed) and again the air conditioning wasnt working and maintenance had no solutions. I slept with my window open for air flow, but it was incredibly loud, which is typical for the area. Nobody followed up on the issue until checkout, when I was given a small credit. My advice: you can do much better and enjoy a hotel that is a bit more updated and clean, and where there is service where you feel like they care about any problems.

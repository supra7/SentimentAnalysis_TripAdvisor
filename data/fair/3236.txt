I stayed at the Waldorf for one night on business. I checked in and was given a beautiful room, excellent bed, and a very nice bathroom. I have express check out so I got my bill the next morning and departed. Two weeks later I noticed extra charges on my credit card statement. I called the hotel and ask for the front desk supervisor. I was transferred into a answering system and never received a call back. Two days later I called again and explained my situation and asked to speak to book keeping. Again, answering system. Each time I left messages. Three days I caled and asked to speak to the GM. I had to explain to the girl exactly what I wanted and she sent me into an answering system. I called Hilton Customer Service and explaned what happened and what was done. The rep took my e mail and sent an e mail to the GM with my concerns. Two weeks later I recieved an e mail from the Hilton rep telling me that according to the hotel my situation had been taken care of... To this day nothing has been corrected and NO ONE from this hotel has returned my call. I highly recommend you stay at the Comfort Inn 1 block down the street.

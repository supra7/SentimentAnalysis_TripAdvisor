We stayed at the Villa Convento for a week in March 2007 and like many of the previous reviewers, found problems at this hotel. The staff is very friendly, the location is great, but quite frankly, the hotel was not very clean. The entry way is very run down and the carpets don't look like they have been cleaned in years. Plaster is falling off of the walls, the chairs in the entry are threadbare, and there are water stains on the ceiling and walls. Some of the problems can be attributed to Katrina, but many can not. The carpets were not vacumed the entire time we were there, with the same pieces of lint and small debris never removed. A close look at our room revealed dust that had turned into dirt on the top of shelves, picture frames and electrical cords. The bathroom walls had splatter spots that could have been easily washed off, along with simple things like washing light switches overlooked. Also, while the location of the hotel in the lower French Quarter is very quiet, we could clearly hear the conversations and TV from the room next to us. One day, when we returned from our activities, the room had not been cleaned and when I mentioned to the management that the maid had missed our room, was told that we wouldn't have maid service the next day either because the maid had gone to Houston! I think some of the staffing problems can be attributed to the shortage of labor because of Katrina, but, in general, I got the impression that the owners were just letting the place get rundown out of apathy or because they know people will continue to book there because of the location. The furniture on the balcony was rusted and broke when I was sitting on it, the plants shown in the pictures of the hotel are gone and the advertized continental breakfast is no more. I would warn anyone who makes a reservation here not to expect too much.

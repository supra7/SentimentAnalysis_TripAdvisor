So So After staying at the Orchard Hotel around the corner for three days, me and my wife moved here for a weekend stay.Let's say it was night and day between the two hotels.While the front desk staff was great and friendly and the lobby is splendid, the rooms are not. First, keys? Yes, keys on very old doors that we had little confidence in. Maybe we're just so used to keycards at hotels, but I think in this case, it also was the fact that the doors are ancient and don't seem sturdy.We had a very small room, much smaller than the Orchard, and we were tripping over ourselves. Also, in the room we stayed, there's no, let's call it, sound-free zone, so if you're staying with a loved one or friends and you don't mind hearing everything that happens in the bathroom, then you'll be OK. Otherwise, get ready to turn the TV up because that's how small the room was for us.While The Orchard has A/C, The Cartwright did not, so we opened the window and turned on the overhead fan. I need a cool room to sleep and I slept OK here.The location is a positive, right in the heart on Union Square area.The breakfast was not the greatest, but I'm biased toward protein-heavy morning food, not sweets and carbs, but, I guess that's the definition of continental.All in all, we paid about $400 for three weekend nights, which isn't too bad, but I guess we were expecting a little more for a SF hotel.

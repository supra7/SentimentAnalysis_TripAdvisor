We choose this hotels from a combination of location and price. The first impression was that it was an OK match between price and quality, without being impressed in any way. But the receptionist made this a very unpleasant experience when we checked out. The previous day my wife had just left her nightgown on the bed, and it was gone when we returned to the room at night. Next morning when checking out, we ask the receptionist if he could help us locate it. By telling us that it was impossible that it could dissapear from the room, he only called housekeeping to check if it was found, as we kept on insisting. It took him less that two seconds on the phone to verify that it wasn't. We tried to call the hotel a few days later to hear if it was been found, but felt we got the same attitude. Not a pleasant experience.

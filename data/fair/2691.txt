The hotel was very charming and campy, but overrun with sand mites--the front desk said they were native to Florida and there was nothing they could do. I've stayed oceanfront in Florida and never had to share a room with tiny bugs before!! The towels had stains on them and the room was not swept for the 4 days we were there. I read the reviews and they said "clean"---but no way!!! Maybe I'm just a snob-but I believe they charge enough to sweep and give CLEAN towels!

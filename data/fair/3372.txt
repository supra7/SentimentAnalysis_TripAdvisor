Very nice staff & very good Continental breakfast. Also, great location near French Market. Some good restaurants within walking distance. However, the room I stayed in was about the size of a walk in closet. The bathroom was extremely tiny with hardly any water pressure. Also, there was a large crack where the door to the outside of the room did not close properly. I was told that there were larger, much nicer rooms on the premises, but none were available at that time. I would suggest to anyone considering the Frenchmen for the first time to ask very specific questions about your accomodations. One night of that room was all I could take.

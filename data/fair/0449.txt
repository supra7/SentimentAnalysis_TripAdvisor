Average hotel, good beds. Room could have been cleaned better every day. I stayed 5 nights, tried to check out a day earlier but I was stuck since I'd booked through Hotwire and would be charged the night anyway. Parking in their garage $38 a day! Moved the car to the Westin garage (coincidence same name) for $18 a day. If you smoke you have to stand out in front and be bothered by scores of homeless begging money and cigarettes. Lobby had coffee set up but the coffee cart disappeared at 6 a.m. No place to eat during the day. Cafe and restaurant closed. Hours of operation of these were very limited. I finally moved for my last night down by the lake, Silver Cloud Inn. Better rooms, amenities and services than the Westin, and FREE parking in secure garage. I will never stay at the Westin in Seattle again and discourage any friends from doing so. Had to pay $6.00 to use their internet for 15 minutes. Free wi-fi if you have a laptop.

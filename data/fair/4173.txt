My stay was 6 nights and I regretting them all. The front desk was snippy, the room reeked of cigarette smoke, and the bed had a giant valley in is I kelt falling into. The mattress was either really old or super damaged. Quite uncomfortable. The noise outside was enough to keep anyone awake whether or not you could tolerate the mattress and the smell. The manager said he would reduce my daily rate once he was made aware of my observations, sent an email to his superiors and cc;'d me that he was doing so, then didn't actually do that. He reduced one night by a few dollars and claimed that one night was all he meant to offer. LAME. The $159 per night for 6 nights was way too much to spend in that place. Never again.

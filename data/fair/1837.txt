This hotel is in desperate need of a multi-million dollar renovation. The service is adequate and you actually feel sorry for the employees because the hotel itself is so awful. Just what I needed on a vacation - the feeling of guilt for employees bc the hotel I was staying at was original from the 80's. The fact that IHC allows this dump to water down its name is beyond reason. It is a multi story road side motel. Don't do it. Just don't do it. Note: Don't become an Ambassador. The club level no longer does breakfast buffets and evening appetizers. My guess is that this is a franchised hotel and the owner has allowed it to go to complete HELL. Again, DON'T DO IT.

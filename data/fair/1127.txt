Me and my family stayed at the Trump hotel for 5 days in celebration of my mom's 70th birthday, I personally didn't care for the beds, they were aweful, soft and mushy, my mother was miserable the entire time because the bed offered no support to the back. I loved the huge soaking tubs and the little kitchens. But the entire time we were there, we were nickled and dimed to death. First of all, you have no control over your car, there are no other alternatives....VALET Parking only! So eeeeeverytime you need your car, you have to sit and wait while they drive the car to you and of course this means a "Tip" every time your car is taken away or brought to you. This is not the only reason I will never stay at this hotel, but it definately is high on the list. Also, here's a pretty slick thing we noticed that they do, the bellman who unloads your luggage on the cart, is completely different from the one who takes your luggage to your room, so you end up tipping twice. Clever huh? In the past, we've always stayed at the Venetian, but the reason I stayed at the Trump this time is because I'm the proud pet parent of two yorkies and a daschund and this was the only "affordable" hotel that accepts dogs....of course there's the famous Four Seasons, but unless you have $400 per night....ummmm!

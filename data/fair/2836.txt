It has been a while since we were at the Grand Wailea, but the experience is one I should have shared earlier. We have stayed at the Grand Wailea several times as part of a business group, and until our last visit, have had good experiences. At a nearby jewelry store, my husband purchased a bracelet for me for our anniversary. It disappeared from our safe, and we got little help attempting to get it back. It was obviously an inside job. Enjoy the Grand Wailea, but be aware that you can not keep any valuables on the premises--even in the safe.

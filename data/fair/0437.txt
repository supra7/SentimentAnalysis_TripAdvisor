Lovely room and location but on check out was charged for mini-bar stuff. I queried this and they removed the charge. However I later found they had charged me for a non-existent meal and other charges. I have queried this by email 3 times and received no satisfactory response. That was 2 months ago! They also very meanly charge for internet access. Primitive!

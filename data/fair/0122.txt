Stayed at the Mayflower for a 2 day business meeting on June 5 and 6th. Advice to meeting planners: Think twice of having a meeting if over 70 participants will be at your function. The hotel was overwhelmed. Initially, the Plymouth Room, their largest conference room, which is under the lobby is attractive, but can only handle 8-9 tables of 8-10 people. Secondly, the mens room is up the stairs, across the lobby and down the stairs on the other side-- only the women's restaurant is adjacent to the meeting room. Finally, getting everyone's luggage out after the meeting was too much for 2 people. Chaos ensued for those running to catch a plane. As far rooms go, I was told I had an upgrade (Room 321). Apparently, I had a little more bathroom space. Unfortunately, the upgrade ended there, since I had a view of the hotel airconditioning unit, light well and having the hotel's mechanical power supply and hydraulic units kick on every few minutes did not allow a great night sleep. If you are given a room that looks into the lightwell, turn around and ask for a room that fronts the streets. You will be Sleepless in Seattle and highly disappointed if you dont. While most reviews, sound good for the most part, I want TripAdvisor members to be aware of some of the issues of this 80 year old hotel. Finally, make sure you allow for 15-20 minutes for valet. Your car could be blocks away. Oh, by the way, they charge $28.00 a day.

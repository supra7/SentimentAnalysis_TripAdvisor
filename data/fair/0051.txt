Were given a room which faced busy downtown 1st Ave. Cute Boutique hotel in most excellent location at Pike St. Market with friendly staff, awesome view deck, and comfortable bedding...unfortunately, the windows facing busy night time street have not been upgraded and provided absolutely no acoustic respite from loud ongoing traffic, drinking crowd, or street people yelling all through the night! This along with intermittent window air conditioning unit going on and off continuously resulted in getting absolutely NO SLEEP!!! at all all night long!!! At check out we were not the only ones complaining about this! For this kind of money, this should not be happening at this establishment! Otherwise, it would have been great! If you do go whatever you do, DO NOT! take a street side room!!!

This is an old hotel in a good location, but the rooms are very small and the hotel is very run down! We stayed on points for six nights recently and were very disappointed. You will hear noise from the bars across the street. If you make a reservation, please ask what year they last renovated? Breakfast was marginal. As an FYI, we didn't have a car since the North subway station was very close and convenient, but parking is $40/night.

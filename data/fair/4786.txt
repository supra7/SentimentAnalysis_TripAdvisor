The beds in this hotel were incredibly hard and uncomfortable. I asked to be switched rooms and the beds in the second room were no better. I ended up pulling the comforter off the second bed to try to create some cushion. I told this to the clerk at check-out, who informed me that they could have put a foam insert in to make it softer. I told him that this would have been nice to know when I complained to him the first time and asked for a different room. My memory of this hotel will be four days of back pain. Also, even by hotel standards, the towels were the consistency of 60-grit sandpaper. Excellent for stripping paint off wood, not so great on the skin. The hotel looks beautiful but does not have the comfort you would expect from a Marriott Courtyard.

I made a reservation via spg.com (platinum member) and stayed at this hotel last weekend. Long story short- the service was pretty slow. Although the staff were nice people (as all San Diegeans I think are)... they are pretty forgetful and not too quick on their feet. Evidence: 1) Called after making my reservation online to reserve a crib... was put on hold and nobody ever came back. I called back and reserved a crib via a 2nd call. 2) When I arrived at the hotel there was no crib in the room.. even AFTER calling back a second time to confirm (or really a third call overall after the debacle in my first point). UGG! So we had a crying 1 year old at 10pm waiting for a crib (which took 40 mins to come up after I called down to the front desk twice). 3) I asked for two rooms next to each other... but they were not connected. This is just somewhat annoying, not THAT big a deal, but when you mention on the phone that you have a family and would like two rooms together... it'd be nice to have the front desk put 2 + 2 together. 4) Finally... on Sunday I called down to see if I could get a late checkout... and again got put on hold and the person never returned!?!?! To their credit, they did call back 15 mins later to apologize (after I sat on the phone for 10 mins just waiting for them to give me a "yes" or a "no").

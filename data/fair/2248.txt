I love boutique hotels because of their details...decor, personal attention, unique bars/restaurants and have stayed in many, unfortunately the Copley Square Hotel has all the makings for a great hotel, but falls short in the actual delivery. From cleanliness (dust build up in the bathrooms), functionality (inability to print a personal document, even after they said they could) and security (a ridiculous, but dangerous fight which broke out after their club let out in the lobby, they need some managerial assistance. I do hope that they can get some, because the location, the decor and the idea behind the hotel are very good.

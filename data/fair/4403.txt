Tried to book this hotel with a debit card and was told very adamantly that they were unable to reserve a room for me with this type of card as they dont accept debit cards!!! - then to my astonishment they charged me (yes on the same card!) half the full price for not turning up! After reading other reviews, seems they can charge whenever they like for whatever they like even without your premission then refer you to some dodgy small print on their website!! Staff rude and accused me of lying when I tried to discuss the issue with them - stay away!

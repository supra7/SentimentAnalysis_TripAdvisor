Stayed over the Labor day weekend. I knew they didn't have air conditioning in the rooms but I thought they would of worked out a way to venelate the rooms better. They did supply the room with a plug-in fan but the rooms get very hot when the doors are all closed. They don't have a patio security screen door so you can't leave your patio door open and feel secure. The hallway was cooler than my room, maybe they should install venelation windows above the room entry doors (old school). I might stay here in the cooler months but doubt if I would stay here during the hot months again.

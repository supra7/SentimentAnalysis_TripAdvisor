This Hotel could be so good but is let down by its staff, when we arrived we were told there was no room as our credit card had been rejected but Hotel did not tell any one. When the card was used to pay it worked. We were offered a hotel in the Vatican area no good for us as we choose the hotel as it was near where our dayghter lived and she visited the hotel twice before we arrived to make sure they had the reservation. As we refused to leave staying at reception desk so no one else could be checked in, the Hotel suddenly found us a room by giving us a room for someone who had not yet arrived!!! We also got a small standard room not a deluxe as booked and not refund on the rate. We also experienced the non operational air conditioning and could not get it switched on and the breakfast is nice but not very extensive. The staff were not very friendly and the attitude they took when we arrived was disgusting they just didn't care that we had no where to stay. This could be a very nice hotel but our experience was very bad at check in!

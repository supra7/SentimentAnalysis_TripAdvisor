This hotel was in a great location but staff were very impersonal .While we were checking in the clerk kept answering the phone.The room was fairly spacious but the A/C was very noisy. We turned it off to discover we could hear other rooms aircon. All we wanted was a quiet room. I would not stay at this hotel again.

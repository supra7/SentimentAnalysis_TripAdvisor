We stayed at the Grand Wailea for a conference that was being held here. Fortunately, we received a discounted rate because of the conference. I read some of the reviews before we went and I agree with the majority of them. The resort really charges for every little thing. They charge $25.00 daily as a resort fee. However, if you want to use an umbrella on the beach or sit by a covered area by the the pool you have to rent the umbrella for $35.00/day or pay $50.00 to sit under a covered chair. I would think that should be included as part of the resort fee. We all found this to be incredilbly tacky. In most resorts umbrellas are available on a first come first serve basis. Most of our friends found ourselves sitting on the grassy lawn which had numerous flies but happened to have shade because none of us could stomach the exorbitant umbrella fees. In general, there seemed to be a charge for every little thing and prices were excessive. The service and the people who work here were cordial and friendly but that doesn't compensate for the the excessive prices and poor policies the hotel operates under.

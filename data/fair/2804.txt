My family stayed here for 4 nights and unfortunately this hotel is overpriced. Although the kids(ages 6,11, 13) loved the pool/slides/beach) it was crowded for a hotel that was not booked. We think the hotel was recruiting islanders to use the pool/beach for a daily rate and/or cruise ships. The hotel rooms were old and needed rennovation. When six out of the 8 handles on the bureau came off in both of the rooms...its time to get new furniture. Also, be prepared to spend a lot of money on food. On a positive note, the grounds/location are beautiful and the spa was excellent but I would look into the Fairmont, 4seasons or Ritz.

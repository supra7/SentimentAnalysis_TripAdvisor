The glitz and customer service is missing at the Ritz.. We stayed at this hotel 5 years ago and loved the service and facilities. However, we just finished a 4 night stay and were less than impressed This time the pool staff did not want to go out of their way to help or assist, tiles were missing in the hot tub and and the pool bar closed an hour early and no one knew why...When I asked for a beverage they said to go inside..... Next time we will sure try a new hotel.

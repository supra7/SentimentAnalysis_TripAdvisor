When we arrived we were rudely told that the lift was broken, so we had to drag our luggage up 4 sets of stairs. We were given a cramped room which stunk of cigarette smoke and damp. There was giant black damp stains on the walls and ceiling and splatters of tea along the walls. The bathroom also had damp. There was no lock on the door, and no holder for the shower to go into. We complained to the receptionist, who rolled her eyes and pretty much looked at us in disgust, plain rude really. We were given a bigger room with more space, which was a lot better. Although this time the bathroom was the size of a small cupboard, although it had a shower (of which water only came out about a third of the holes) was rarely warm and leaked all over the floor. By the time you finished water would flood the bathroom, and run undertheath the door into the room. The drawers in the room fell apart when we tried to put our stuff in them, but at least the TV worked. You were also only given 1 paper thin pillow each, which was quite uncomfortable. The continental breakfast was poor. We never went back after the first morning. All that was on offer was cardboard bread, weak diluting orange, cornflakes and jam. Go to one of the all day bakeries down the street instead (: The hotel was in a good location, in zone 2 of the underground, the nearest tube station (finsbury park) being a five minute walk away. You could also jump on and off the 29 bus right outside of the hotel, which took about 20 minutes to Leicester Square. I wouldn't reccomend walking alone late at night in this area though, it seems quite dodgy at times. The road outside the hotel was quite quiet, it is blocked off so not much traffic goes by. Overall, i suppose you get what you pay for, but my view could have been a lot more pleasant if it wasn't for the extremely rude receptionist and the terrible bathroom.

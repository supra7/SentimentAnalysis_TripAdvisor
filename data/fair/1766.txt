My husband and I stayed here for a romantic getaway. We were very disappointed in the size of the rooms. The whole hotel was very dark and quite. The bathrooms were nice but the tile was broken on the floor and it look like someone stuck it back on with toothpaste. the hardware in the large bathtube kept falling off. All in all we expected more and got less. Would not ever stay here again!!!!

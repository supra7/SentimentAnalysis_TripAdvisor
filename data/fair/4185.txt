First of all the hotel is not in a good location.The location has a lot of traffic.The second problem is the facilities the itself was clean but the bathroom was bad.The water is was very cold,i cannot take a bath.The third problem was the spa facilities nothing worked.The good was the view on the top floor restaraunt and the food.The staff of the hotel was ok.

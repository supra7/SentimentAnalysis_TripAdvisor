The Westin was the second resort that we chose to stay at while we spent the first week of our honeymoon on Maui. We stayed for 3 nights and I was actually bummed when we opened the door to our room and saw how small and plain it was. We had started our trip at the Napili Kai Resort further north, there the rooms were large, CLEAN and comfortable. The Westin's "ocean view" room was small and the bathroom was dirty with black hairs everywhere from the toilet to the tub, we actually wondered if they had even cleaned it. I thought the "heavenly" bed and shower was average. It's just unbelievable that we had to pay MORE than double of what we had paid at Napili Kai to stay at the Westin, it was sooooo not worth it. Pros... - adult pool -Ka'anapali Beach -proximity to Whaler's Village -breakfast buffet -Mojito's at the adult pool bar -valet guys and parking were convenient -boogie boarding in front of the Ka'anapali Ali' Cons... -couldn't find 2 lounge chairs together without walking around for at least 20 minutes. -It's impossible to relax around the pool. Go to the beach to get away from the packed pool atmosphere. -over-priced (I expect to pay more at a nice resort on Hawai'i, but this place is ridiculous) -out-of-control children running, screaming and acting-up everywhere! -numerous hidden costs, charges, taxes, fees, etc. This is not a place for a couple to relax and especially not a place for honeymooners. Do not stay here if you do not have children. Trust me- I am a 2nd grade teacher, I deal with kids daily and I could not stand the children that acted like crazies all over this resort.

We were rerouted to the Ritz Carlton from another hotel that had been overbooked for our conference. Upon arriving at the check in counter, the clerk was sullen & unwelcoming. He was clearly irritated when I asked whether a king sized bed was available rather than 2 doubles. He seemed even further irritated that I asked for 2 keys for the room after he had given me one. The staff we dealt with at check out was polite, however. The bellmen were very friendly and the room was clean but ordinary. It was not what I would have expected from a Ritz-Carlton.

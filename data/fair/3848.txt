At $169 a night, this hotel is VERY overpriced. It has a phenomenal location, and the street noise was not bad, but the property feels shabby. This hotel has none of the luxuries that a hotel in this price range should have. The front desk was not only messy, but the service was not professional. The elevators were dirty, and my room's carpet was old and very worn. The towels in the bathroom didn't match. The room's wet bar, fridge and microwave looked like something from a college dorm room. There also was no high-speed internet available in the rooms, which a hotel of this price range should offer. After one night, I checked out and moved to the Sheraton Suites up the hill.

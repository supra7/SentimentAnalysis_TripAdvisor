We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Kapaula from August 21-27. We have been married for 3 years & thought this would be a great anniversary getaway. We spend 1 week in the Princeville in Kauai before this...which I ADORED! Wonderful, Fantastic place....very luxurious, but enough about that. From the beginning of our check-in, we had issues/problems. Our room smelled awful -- like urine & mildew. I called to talk to the front desk, who said they would be right there---over 1 hour we were waiting. i called downstairs again & was told to come down & bring my bags, so we could get another room....how rude....this is a Ritz Carlton....what happened to the upscale standard. We got a new room which was better in smell, but the room looked fairly old & tatered & (just an FYI- I am not a spoled NY'er..... I am used to Hiltons, & Sheratons, but this was definitely a step below...very disappointing!) In the rooms, the the furniture was old , the lights did not work in the bedroom(we had to call the front desk to get maintenance), as stated in a review below same went for us " -- housecleaning rolled up our bedspread and set it to the side of the nightstand for our entire stay, presumably so they didn't have to actually make the bed" . The sinks were wet on occasion, when we went back to the room after it was cleaned. Carpets in the hallways were pretty dirty & there were scuff marks throughout the hallways. As a prior review mentioned- there were a few roaches in the hallway & we saw 2 in our room, but being from NY, it was not that shocking to me, although it was surprising to see this in a Ritz Carton. I will not be coming here, nor recommending it to anyone.

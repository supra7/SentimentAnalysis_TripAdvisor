Our reservation was for a king size bed. We were told upon arrival that it was a mistake by the booking company even though our confirmation clearly showed what was reserved. We were given a room about the same size as a walk in closet. We could not get the heat regulated and had to open a window. Trying to get an elevator in the morning was a fifteen to twenty minute wait. It is a very trendy looking hotel but the customer service was terrible. There are much better hotels for the money in New York.

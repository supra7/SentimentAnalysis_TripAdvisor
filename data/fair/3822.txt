What a joke. If you ever stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Chicago, Tokyo Midtown, Osaka locations you will be sorely disappointed. It seems that the head office has forgotten about this property. Time to turn it into a Marriot. 1. Arrival experience. Doorman in shorts and tennis shoes...and not clean white tennis shoes, but dirty old sneakers that he probably wears home at night. 2. Check in. 1 person in a street clothes, not a uniform. yes, 1 person. and a doorman and a technician. That's all of the staff that I saw. Strange. 3. Room. Bed was comfortable but all was horribly outdated and not in a good way. Final word. Ritz-Carlton, if you are reading, you should be ashamed and embarrassed to have this type of property sharing the RC name.

The Kahala Hotel and Resort I wasn't so impressed with this hotel. Many people thought that this hotel was really good...well, I learned the truth.1) When we checked in, we were supposed to have a dolphin lagoon view TWO DOUBLE BEDS. Well, when we went inside our room, there was only a single king size bed. I was really annoyed because this happened at the Fairmont Orchid, in Big Island, Hawaii as well.2) The noise insulation was very poor. On the day we were going to check out, I was awakened by people next door. They were really loud.3) The layout of the room was horrible and crowded! The TV was just sitting in the middle of nowhere, and the desk was right next to one of the living room chairs.4) The toilet flush was noisy and loud. My kids had to run from the toilet back inside the room because they were scared of it.5) When I looked outside the window, guess what? I couldn't see a dolphin lagoon anywhere!

As the saying goes, 'You get what you pay for'. This is one of the least expensive hotels on the beautiful Kaanapali beach. However, the accomodations (i.e. rooms) are the quality of a 'budget' hotel even though you are NOT paying budget prices. When we went to our 'first' room, we were in the unrenovated section. There was hair in the bathroom and when we were ready for bed found hair in the bed, mold and something hanging down from the pipes in the closet and the shower did not have a shower head on it. We called the front desk and asked to be moved. The asst manager on duty does not understand the concept of customer satisfaction. We viewed the 'second' room and it was not any better. After pressuring the asst manager, we were moved into a 'renovated' room. It's sad that quality was not a factor in the renovation. Also, the room walls are paper thin. It was hard to sleep. There were also not enough people working the check-in/out desk. We had to wait a considerable amount of time. While I think the amenitites and location are great, i.e. welcome breakfast, classes/shows offered, this is NOT a quality hotel. EVERYTHING needs to be updated. They are sitting on a gold mine and they don't care.

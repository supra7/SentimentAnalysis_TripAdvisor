Rooms are very worn. Expect about 100 years worth of paint, that in places is chipping, some poorly done repairs, lots of scuff marks on walls etc. The furniture was old, the chair wobbly, the desk had water damage. The door locks malfunctioned repeatedly and always required repeated tries. The TV in the room was old and the picture quality terrible (lots of 'snow''). The bathrooms was small, and cramped, with a severely damaged sink that had no plug. The shower was fine, and the towels excellent. The bed was fine. Internet was expensive.

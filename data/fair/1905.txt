Pros: Large room Super comfortable bed Microwave Mini-fridge Cons: Overflowing toilet Dingy, stained towel A/C stuck on so the room was too cold No coffee pot in the room No hair dryer No alarm clock No iron/ironing board No complimentary toiletries except soap (others available in a vending machine) Hot tub spa was green and disgusting but no "out of order" sign posted Strong wifi signal, but internet was slow and cut out several times There are really too many cons to list. I would never stay at this location again. I overheard a hotel guest complaining at the front desk about a laptop being stolen from their room. The front desk manager was watching security tapes to try to determine what happened. I made a mental note to take my laptop with me whenever I left the room! The worst situation I saw was housekeeping had children going into the rooms with them! I saw a boy about 8 years old and a girl around 4 years old. There is no way those children could be properly supervised if the housekeeper was doing her job. The kids could have been into the guest's luggage, personal items, etc. God forbid that one of those children would get into a guest's medication! It is completely inexcusable for children to be in the rooms with the housekeeper! This situation will be reported to Motel 6 Corporate. This property used to be a La Quinta. It has potential to be a really nice budget hotel. Sadly, it doesn't appear that it's on the right track. Don't be fooled by the "new location" label on the Motel 6 website regarding this property.

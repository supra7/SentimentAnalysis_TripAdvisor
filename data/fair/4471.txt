This place needs renovations!!! We stayed for a week because we had prebooked the stay. Our room had a cracked sink that did not drain well and a large rip in the carpet. The bathroom overall was ancient. The selection at Breakfast was excellent the 1st two days and dismal the last five. This Inn is much like staying in a great aunts guest room, a bit worn and out of date but clean and tidy. It is also quite inexpensive. The location is good for public transportation too. Renovations and basic repairs are needed but it does give bargain rates,

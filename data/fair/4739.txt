My husband and I recently stayed at the Westin Verasa while on a business trip. The accomodations were nice: bedroom, bath and suite area with a kitchenette and a balcony with a room of the outdoor lounge and pool area. The kitchenette was fully equipped w/dishes, glassware, etc. and included a sink, small refrigerator and microwave oven. As nice as the room was, the service was equally BAD. The front desk lines were very long which appeared to be a problem no matter what time of the morning, day or night it was. The front desk clerks were not warm, welcoming, or cheerful. We called down for hangers after checking in, left for 3 1/2 hours and returned to find they hadn't delivered them. Every day for the first 3 days they left ZERO bath towels when they cleaned our room. The 4th day we left early in the morning and returned @ 4:30 to find our room hadn't been cleaned yet. They didn't give us messages left for us. They didn't tell us there was a courtesy car/driver for use to destinations within 1 1/2 miles of the hotel; we found out from a driver that we hired to take us wine tasting and then when we requested the courtesy car to go to dinner, the valet called us a cab instead. One of the lights in our bathroom didn't work and wasn't fixed for 4 days despite us calling daily to complain. Its too bad the service is so bad because the location is good (5 minute walk to the downtown area where all the bars/restaurants/shopping are), accomodations are good, they have a wine tasting every evening from 5:00-7:00 in the lounge, and the outdoor lounge area is really nice. Despite those positives, I would never stay there again. There has to be equally nice accomodations where service is good in a place like Napa.

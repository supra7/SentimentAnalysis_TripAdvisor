Recently my family visited San Francisco for a summer last hurrah. We like to pick local hotels because they often seem more personal and friendly. The Hotel Diva is sort of a mix here and I should have read more reviews because if no one has complained about the endless garbage pickup on one side of the building then here we go! They come at around 1am then return at 4am and maybe even around 6am...I'm not sure if that's still the 4am crew. Even through earplugs I woke up! I know the building can't just pick up and move but if you want peace and quiet pick somewhere else to stay or ask if the other side is quieter. As far as the rooms and staff go. The pictures, I think, over-emphasize the size of the rooms. They really aren't as spacious as they appear online but the decor is fun. They are very clean and the beds are comfortable. The staff in the lobby are friendly but some are not as familiar with their own city as would be helpful. One of the concierge staff was somewhat pretentious and acted like asking about public transportation was idiotic. I would not stay here again or recommend it.

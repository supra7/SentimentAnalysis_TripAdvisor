Hi I stayed at this hotel in October 2010 for 3 days. Overall my stay was good (clean room and comfortable). The location of the hotel is really good and you can walk to all the main spots very easily. One problem was that check-in is very slow and i had to wait until about 5pm so that my room was ready. My main concern was that the day i left, my flight was only in the evening so i left my bags with the hotel. I had one laptop bag which i had forgotten that i left 200$ secured in one pocket. When i got to the airport in the evening and opened my laptop bag, i realized that somebody from the hotel had gone thru all the pockets of my bag and turned my bag into a real mess. The 200$ was missing... I've been to many hotels around the world and this is the first time this happens to me. For this reason i cannot recommend this hotel.

My husband & I have stayed at many ParkNFly hotels in the Seattle area. This is the first time we encountered miscommunication regarding when the number of days for parking actually begin. This hotel has "packages" 7-day & 10-day parking for a fee with 1-night stay. (Previous hotels actually had "free parking") We were leaving 10/14 @ 6AM for Puerto Vallarta, Mexico travelling thru SanFrancisco & returning on 10/21 @ 11:30pm. When we checked in on the 13th, we paid the upgrade fee for 7-days of parking, "MasterPark" employees parked the car. Unbeknownst to us, our 1st day began the 13th when we checked in because they parked the car that evening. We should have parked the car in the Hotel parking lot for that evening, then handed the keys over in the morning, 3:30am prior to taking the shuttle over. However, while waiting for the shuttle we spoke to another party staying at the hotel & evidently someone had left their luggage in the car overnight in the hotel parking lot & it was missing the next morning. So...do not leave your luggage in the parked car!!! Needless to say, our return flight was delayed; we arrived at 12:05am at Seatac & to the hotel approx. 12:40am. Technically we were in the 9th day, so they charged us $16.99!!!! for each day over the 7. In summary, beware of ParkNFly offers that are not actually initiated & run by the hotel, the hotel staff may not be trained adequately. Clarify the exact dates included for parking with the parking company or hotel & have it in writing & initialed by the staff. Never leave luggage in parked vehicle. I feel very strongly that I couldn't possibly be the first guest to have this happen, hopefully it won't happen to future guests.

This was certainly not a good deal but proce was not an issue for this trip. The staff were very rude- The service was bad, includiong the expensive restaraunt in the hotel- Wrong order and long wait for food and actually finding a waiter was a challenge. I liked the view from the room, the room itself was fine- but as you know the service can kill even the best of rooms. Too bad for this overpriced- and rude hotel. Try the Gaslamp( Hilton) accross the street- Better location for nightlife. Probably a nicer staff as well.

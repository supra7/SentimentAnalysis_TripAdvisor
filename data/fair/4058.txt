When I reserved the room I told the agent that I had two toddlers and asked if the hotel kid friendly. She not only told me they were kid friendly she told me I would have access to all pools in both hotels (wynn/Encore). We learned after we got there that Wynns pool was closed for the winter. Additionally only special tower people have access to the remaining pools at the wynnI wasnt really upset because I knew it was too cold to swim. But then getting a taxi we were left in the cold while a high roller and his group got into a Bentley and a Stretched Limo (Remember I said it was cold with a 2 and 3yr old in tow) and when I spoke to the bell boy/man he told me there were out of taxis and he sent a guy to the street to get us one. After 15 minutes a taxi arrived. And he lied. There were 4 taxis waiting in line at the next exit. Note this was our 3rd night and previously they always called a taxi up for us. Except for this last night Lastly we were told on our last night that encore does not allow strollers in their hotel, unless we were guests, and he wanted us to wait to get our stroller registered.. (which we didnt do!) Loved the room, hated the bate and switch show.

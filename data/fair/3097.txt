We just left the Westin Maui after 5 nights in an ocean view room. I must say, it was quite disappointing. I'll try to be organized in this review....i'll start by saying a travel often and used westin points to book this stay. Hotel Condition: From the outside, the hotel is quite dated. The lanais have old railings that don't seem that secure. In the inside, they have done a nice job with the lobby, common areas/restaurants, spa and pool area. although the guest rooms were re-done, ours was not in good condition. the valence was quite dirty, the wood furniture items were quite worn for their age (assuming they were not too old). the washroom was odd, as 1/2 of it was part of the hotel room (sink/vanity) and the other half was cramped and not clean. Service: Horrible. With the exception of the greeters/bellmen, there was no service. Concierge sent us a letter prior to our arrival, which we thought was a nice touch, however, our session with her quickly turned into a timeshare pitch. When she learned we were not interested, she had no interest in helping us with activities. Food: We can't really provide a great deal of info here, as we only dined at Tropica 1x for dinner. Portion size was small for the price and quality was not 5 star. Not sure if we just had a badly positioned table, but we were amazed by the amount of server confusion/chatter. Clearly not a well oiled machine Pool: This was the only plus. The 5 linked pools were a bit dirty, but quite fun! Overall: Not even clse to any other Westin i've stayed at. In no way is this a 5 star property. also, be ready for time share pitches around each corner by cleverly disguised "concierges". We did stroll down to the Sheraton a few times.....wish we stayed there!

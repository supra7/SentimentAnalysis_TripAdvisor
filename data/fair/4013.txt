Don't bother staying here - overrated, overpriced  Stayed at The Clift for 3nights in May06 and 3nights was long enough!When we arrived at our room we were v. disappointed. It was v minimalist to the extreme (2 tiny drawers for clothes), furniture looked cheap (sort of stuff get in ikea), room was v small and bathroom was ridiculously small.In addition, the room was incredibly noisy - road traffic noise  walls paper thin - could hear every word of conversation from people next door. Although bed was comfy, don't expect to have a good night's sleep here unless you're a very heavy sleeper! Overall, overrated and overpriced and we would definitely not stay at The Clift again.

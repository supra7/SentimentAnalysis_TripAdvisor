Well I found that upon returning back to my home my credit card was billed an additional 90 dollars for 3 rooms each! Took some time to clarify charges as well as requested 2 beds only offered us one and charged us additional when we requested again, Stated that they never receieved the request which I promptly showed them the copy they still charged, very aloof service, did store our bags for a day of walking however bags were mishandled and a gues phone ended up in our bag. I would choose another hotel next time, the rooms where very nice clean etc. no A/C in elevator and cramped.

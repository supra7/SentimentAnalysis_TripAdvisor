Small room, somewhat smudgy. Breakfast of poor qualtity, only with an upgrade of 12,50 euros it gets a bit better. Will come back at gunpoint only. One big plus, and the only one --> location is ok enough, next to the park, so running in the morning can be done (so do it, and don't go back to the hotel)

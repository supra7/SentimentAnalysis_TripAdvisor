My husband and I are particularly fond of funky/modern "boutique" hotels, however the size of our room left us a bit disappointed. The rooms were clean and decorated cool, but there was very little space. We weren't expecting a 900 square foot suite, but it was so small we could hardly find carpet to walk on! The bathroom was hands down the smallest either of us had ever seen in our lives. Although maybe there is advantage to being able to shower, sit on the toilet and wash your hands all at the same time. The sushi restaurant attached to the hotel was great, and the staff were all friendly enough. It was also a good location being close to shopping and Pike Place Market.

Stayed at the Beekman Hotel for 3 nights because of the rave reviews on this site. There is a however a fundamental problem about this hotel which does not get a mention. The heating and air con system in the rooms is not adjustable at all and your therefore can not turn off the heating and the air con if it exists, does not work when the heating system is on. I complained about this and was told that "the system is very old and is controlled centrally and depends upon the complaints of guest as to whether it is on or off" This is New York believe it or not!! I ended up placing copies of the New York telephone directory over the airvents to reduce the heat output, having concluded that the noise after opening the windows was unbearable. Apart from that, the hotel was acceptable but in need of a refurb, which I suppose is reflected in the discounted price on offer. The staff were friendly and helpful . The location is fine with lots of good restaurants nearby.

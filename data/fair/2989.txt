Aloha, We had to endure 2 days at the Whaler much to our dismay. When we arrived (yes, I know they are under construction) we were given a room in tower 2, 1264 to be exact. When we opened our door to the room it was very new smelling, new paint, carpets etc.. but the balcony was blocked closed from the outside, balcony was not quite finished. OK fine deal with it the room seemed nice.. until we turned on the water in the sink... brown... then we turned on a light, or attempted to turn on a light... no light bulbs in the lamps, OK deal with it... then as we were unpacking, the next thing we know we have a construction worker standing on our balcony. . UGH.. down to the lobby to pass on this information to the front desk. Was met by a nice young lady who apologized about our misfortunes. We were given the opportunity to check out late the day we were leaving as our flight was late at night, this at no addition cost. The water was just run to clear up the line, again due to construction and the bulbs were not addressed. The late check out was a good situation for us but when we went to check out the front office acted as though they had not heard anything about our agreement with the manager, (we were told 'notes' would be put in our account) so we again had to wait until a manager showed up and make things right. Terrible experience at the Whaler Pluses for the Whaler, good location on Kaanapali Beach, ample packing, yes the view of Black Rock, and the ocean view.

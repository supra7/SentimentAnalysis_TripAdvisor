I had higher hopes for the Beekman, based on other Trip Advisor reviews. This hotel hovers just above the acceptable level. It is true that the suites offer plenty of space for a family of four to spread out--there's a large living room with TV and a separate bedroom for parents (also with TV). The bathroom is off of the bedroom and is rather small. And while the bathroom was clean enough, it lacked the nicer fixtures and amenties that Sheratons, Westins and other chains have to offer. The sink filled with water quickly and we had to be careful not to cause a flood. The entire suite was in desperate need of a makeover. The fabrics are dated and dreary, the wallpaper peeling, and the carpet a bit thin and stained in places. It was warm in NYC during our visit and the AC in the bedroom did not work at all. A large portable AC unit sat in the bedroom, but the remote control did not cause it to turn on. We were able to open windows, but of course, the noise of the traffic on 1st Avenue made it difficult to sleep. The bed was far from the comfy "heavenly" sort that so many hotels offer these days. And the linens and the "vellux"-like blanket were far from luxurious. There was some sort of dried matter on the bedroom blanket--better not to think about what that might have been! The suite had a dated kitchenette with a sticky handle on the refrigerator door and a long dark hair sitting on the countertop--again, not exactly appealing. I stay at the Beekman based on my company's arrangement with the hotel, but I would not stay at the Beekman if I had a choice!

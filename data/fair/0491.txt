Very run down 2 bedroom suite which was in a seperate building behind the main hotel. Full kitchen with old and dirty range and completely unstocked with pots or pans or dishes or utensils, etc. Small bathroom had peeling paint and loose wallpaper. Holes in the wall where towel racks had been removed and not spackled or painted. Medicine cabinet was very rusty although mirrored front was fine. Paper thin walls and floors so neighbors sounds were a problem at times. Smoke detectors were missing their batteries so did not work. A towel was stuffed in the crack between the A/C and the outside wall. Furniture was old and saggy and not enough of it to accomodate 4 adults. The unit was very spacious however.

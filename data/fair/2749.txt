Had to extend our stay unexpectedly and went to the yellowpages to see places with a kitchen Only the Residence Inn Convention Centre had an ad (unfortunately for us); so, based on past experiences with the brand, I figure it cant be that bad Now, Residence Inn is not a 5 star resort -- i know that; but this RI is definitely showing its age OUTDATED We got a studio room with a queen bed. The kitchen cabinets & stove looked like it hasnt been updated since the 80s. Bathroom was the same (had a wood sliding door for the shower/bathtub area) LOUD - it's underneath the flightpath for LAS airport = frequent buzz/noise; we stayed at Mandalay Bay (beside the airport) and didnt hear planes taking off/landing - ventilation system; we had to shutoff the HVAC since it was just too loud - fridge (probably another sign of age...), quite noisy as well when it starts up every so often "Positives" The breakfast is standard Residence Inn; business centre has 2 computers with internet access There's a pool (didnt use; but was open even in early dec) & on-site laundry Monorail & convention centre is directly next door, so it's convenient in that sense; the roads around the hotel have center dividers, so you have to be travelling in a certain direction to enter the hotel (either southbound on Paradise, or westbound on Dessert Inn) Clean room & linen Staff friendly (didnt really have much interaction)

We spent one night at the San Carlos on business, attracted by the comparatively low rate and its location. The San Carlos is located on the corner of Central and Monroe, very convenient to the new light rail and within walking distance of all major downtown venues (the Herberger and Dodge Theaters, US Airways Center, Chase Field, the convention center). The room was small and and the bathroom tiny, but the furnishings, although outdated, were comfortable, and we had a nice streetscape view from our top-floor window. (The hotel is L-shaped, and rooms in the back apparently have poor views.) The main problem with our room was the noise: the doors are poorly insulated (there is a vent above, and a large gap below the door), and it seems as though the slightest bit of conversation in the hall is being held right next to your bed. Light streams through the gap at night as well. Staff were helpful and friendly but unprofessional. Parking is available down the street at a covered parking garage. Breakfast at the Silver Spoon Cafe located in the first floor corner of the building was good (bacon and eggs freshly prepared) but served essentially as a take-out meal. And a word about our "deal"--Compare rates; sometimes they are the same as the newer, more luxurious downtown hotels.

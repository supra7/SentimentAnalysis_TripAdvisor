I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the past two years and I am sad to say that it has gone downhill. Two years ago I thought that I had found a gem and was nervous to even tell friends as I wanted to keep the secret to myself. My last stay was a week ago and I booked a partial ocean view for two nights. I knew that the rooms are rarely ready before 4pm so did not bother checking in until my conference was over for the day. Upon check in I was shown where my room assignment was and asked if there were any other rooms (I knew this one was not optimal). The gentleman at the desk told me that they were entirely sold out - he assured me that I would like the room. Needless to say, the room was not acceptable. It was directly over the lobby of the hotel and essentially faced the street with a street light shining in to the room and cars parked behind it. When I called and said that this was not what I had expected - he asked in a snippy voice "can you see the ocean?" to which I replied " not really, there is a light glaring into the room". I told him that I would prefer to check out than stay in this room and then magically there was another room. Both days that I went to the pool there were no towels for the beach or for the pool (only a pile of used towels). In fact, I stood next to a soaking wet man in the lobby the second morning as there were no towels at the pool so he was going back to his room to dry off. The "breakfast buffett" is in a small room that feels rather dirty - you can get a tray and bring items to your room which I recommend. The rooms are still nice although do not feel quite as pristine and new as they did 1-1/2 years ago. I agree with the reviewer who stated that if you have a car, you are roped in to the $20 parking fee as there is sparse overnight parking around the hotel. I am not sure that I will stay here again - would probable consider renting a beachhouse if I needed to be by the ocean.

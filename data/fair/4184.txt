First I would like to point that the hotel's location is not opposite the tram station as mentioned in web site. It is 500 meters away and not easy to find because there are no street names and few people know it. The hotel is not 4 star, 3 would be much. The towels had holes, the windows don't close well enough, the view is awful, the curtains 20 years old ..., the staff speaking few english, wi-fi was out of order in rooms and you must have great patience to use the elevators as they stop whenever they like. Breakfast coffee was tasteless, juice not enough for all tourists ..., omelette watery and tables not clean Only price was ok but with the above luxourius facilities I wouldn't suggest it to anyone !!!!

Dont over stay your welcome! Stayed here for 3 nights which was excellent staff very friendly - excellent service. We then left and went to DC for 4 nights. Our return experience was totaly different. On the day we were checking out we had an evening flight back to the Uk and wanted to change our clothes and have a wash. The staff were not happy about this, they came in the bathroom to check what I was doing they were constantly watching us. We felt they wanted to make sure we did not have the wine and nibbles served in the evening, since we were no longer guests. There was an obvious atmosphere. This appears very petty for a hotel which prides itself on its level of service. When I left I said goodbye to the reception no reply - the gentleman did not look up from his computer at the front desk. They made us feel most unwelcome and would not recommend this hotel, the service is not genuine. Look for another botique hotel.

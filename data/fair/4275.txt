We thought this hotel looked OK from the outside and it had been refurbished in the lobby but everything else was dirty and tired, hated the bedrooms,they felt stale and the carpet looked ancient.Not cheap either there is only one redeeming feature the location is great and the staff were very pleasant. Free limited parking don't move or you'll lose your place. Try somewhere else.

We made a reservation at the Meddusa a month before our stay in Istanbul. When we arrived (armed with all our print outs of the confirmed booking), we were given a shake of the head as the hotel was full. It was difficult to understand what the problem was as the hotel person didn't speak very much English and I can't speak Turkish (I don't blame the hotel for my lack of Turkish!). We were eventually helped with our bags to another hotel nearby (Hotel Aquarium) and this place was very disappointing. I can't leave any feedback about Meddusa Hotel as a place to stay but as a place to make bookings with, our experience has been very poor. I would recommend that any 'confirmed' online bookings are checked and double checked before you arrive.

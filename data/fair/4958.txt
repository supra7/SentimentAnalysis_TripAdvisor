I booked this hotel through priceline and next time I will wait for a Sniqueaway or Jetsetter deal to pop up (they only offer deals to "true 4-star and 5-star hotels). We arrived at the hotel to great and speedy valet service, but a 30 minute wait to check-in. The hotel lobby is very small so it almost felt like we were waiting in line to ride a ride at an amusement park! When we got to our room (via elevator which I think has been there since 1920), it reeked of cigarette smoke and was generally musty. We called the front desk to change rooms- they were very friendly but made me go downstairs to the front desk to switch rooms. after another 15 minute wait, I got a key to our new room. When we opened the door, the same cigarette/musty smell greeted us. We didn't ask to switch rooms because we figured the whole hotel must smell like this. Needless to say, we did not spend a lot of time in our room. Overall, the hotel location is great, but there are numerous hotels close by and I would advise you to stay there instead.

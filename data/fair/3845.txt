Stayed in the Gaslamp Plaza for 2 nights in June 2007. Family of 4 including 2 teenage daughters. The specific type of suite we had booked in February with 2 bathrooms (because of 3 girls) was not available upon arrival because the people staying there before us "decided to stay longer." Never heard that excuse before, but that was the explanation. We had confirmed this same suite just 2 days prior to be sure it was available. They did offer other alternatives and we did finally decide to stay in a suite at a discounted rate, but only with one bathroom. They also offered a bottle of wine. The hotel is in a great location. Glad we stayed in town. The hotel is historic, so if you are looking for a modern hotel with amenities, this is not the place. It is dated, dark hallways and small rooms, but clean. The street noise level can be an issue with lots of bars around, but fortunately we were on one of the highest floors. The rooftop was a nice place to go sit or have breakfast, but the food was very basic (coffee, juice, 2 dry cereal choices and either donuts or muffins and bagels. No fruit or warm options but just enough. To give you some comparison, we did stay in an Embassy Suites and a Homewood Suites during this same trip in other parts of California. The Gaslamp does not match up to these hotels. I don't think my family would stay here again, but, if you are looking for very basic accomodations in a good location at a price less than the big chains, this might suit your needs. We would likely stay at the Embassy Suites, Hyatt or Omni next time. If you do visit San Diego and you like Italian food, you do have to visit Filippis. I had read all the great reviews, so we decided to try it. My family about left when we walked up and saw it, but once you walk thru the market area in the front, there is a nice, very casual restaurant with great pasta or pizza.

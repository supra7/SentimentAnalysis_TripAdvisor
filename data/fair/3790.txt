We recently stayed over the July 4th weekend. Photos of the hotel looked great until we arrived. Photos online are the exteriors of the villas, not the suites. We stayed in the "deluxe" suites as opposed to the "resort" suites. The only difference was that we were located next to the water park. The buildings looked dated and needed a thorough cleaning on the exteriors. There were bird droppings on most of the railings & walkway in front of our room. We did call the front desk and asked that they clean it, they did send people up. Good: Interior of rooms were large & roomy, looked remodeled. Camelback suites were located right next to fun waterpark. The spa was excellent & very tranquil. Lobby grill had great food, service was spotty. One morning they did forget to bring my daughter her breakfast since the rest of us had the buffet, but they deleted the charge off of our bill. The Rustlers Rooste had great atmosphere and food. Kids loved the slide in restaurant. Waterpark was the best part of hotel, they have entertainment in the afternoons and show family movies in the evenings in the wave pool. Bad: The toilet tank leaked and kept refilling every 8 minutes. The pullout bed mattress was more like springs in your back. We pulled the cushions off the sofa and had the kids sleep on that. Refrigerator in room could be a little larger or less stocked with hotel items to purchase. We brought our own water since it was record temps in Phoenix. You pay a resort fee but you have to pay for internet service also? Ended up going to the business center for internet access. Overall it was an okay stay but definitely will not be back, we will probablly try another "resort" with a waterpark.

This is a clean hotel and the beds are really confortable BUT my entire family didn't get a wink of sleep due to loud sounds (like loose tin flapping around on the roof) and paper thin walls. I don't think our neighbors were any louder than most but we could hear every word/action they made. Since we had to catch a 6am flight we were really counting on a good nights sleep. I'll try another hotel the next time we fly from Seattle.

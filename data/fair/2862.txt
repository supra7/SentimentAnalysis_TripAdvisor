I spent five nights at Maui Cost on recommendation from a local, in fact, someone who lives up the street in Kihei. I soon discovered why... this hotel is not at all worth the price tag, but it is frequented by townies and locals. Upon checking in, the staff was so rude, for some reason the girl, Mariflor, just didn't like the look of me, and put me on the ground floor next to the extremely busy and noisy housekeeping linen/laundry room. Luckily, the housekeeping staff instructed me who to speak to to get a new room assignment. The rude staff member giggled when I returned minutes later, had a good laugh when I asked for her manager, but another front desk person helped me and put me in a nicer room. I also spent time by the pool. The pool staff are incredibly lazy and rude, it's more a scene for locals who come there and drink all day and night. In fact, the hotel pool bar is like a "scene" for the locals. OK, that's fine, but as the ones paying to stay there, it certainly didn't seem like a welcome place for the guests. Moreover, I watched as a bartender and waiter - who I could describe in finite detail - made a guest a drink she did not order with junk she didn't order from the bar -- I was standing right there waiting for my drink -- and were dying laughing about it. The waiter walked up to the guest and asked her if she liked it, apparently she said yes, and boy, did they think this was hilarious! Har har, right? Nice people. Not worth the money, there are many hotels throughout this part of Maui, throw a dart, pick any other one and you'll have a more enjoyable stay.

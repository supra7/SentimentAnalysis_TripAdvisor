not worth it. I recently had my parents stay here and I spent an evening there with them. Sure, the place is incredibly well designed and quite pleasant to look at. However, their fitness area stinks and there is no spa.Our room bordered on shoebox size. for the price, do yourself a favor and stay at the W or even the Huntington, where you have a few extra luxuries. The bar is gorgeous and definitely worth a stop but drinks are in the $14 a drink range and service is less than superior. The restaurant is also lacking on many levels. I felt that we were ripped off and would not stay there again.This hotel is no longer an Ian Schrager property and having been to his new gramercy park hotel, it sure does show.

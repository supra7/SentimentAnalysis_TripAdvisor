I have been traveling to Maui for 20 years and I have stayed at many hotels in Wailea, but never the Maui Prince. So I decided that I would try the Maui Prince to see how it compared to the other hotels. It is not up to par with any of the other hotels in Wailea. The rooms are small, noisy, uncomfortable and out dated. The pool was also a huge disapointment, it is about a 1/4 of the size of all of the other hotels. Most of all the costmer service was extremely disapointing, I would almost say rude at some points. You are better off staying at one of the other hotels in Wailea.

Stayed on a Saturday night on the 9th floor, with views of the projects across the road. The main problem was that the nightclub is situated on the 7th floor, also it protrudes out from the building so that it is underneath the windows of the 8th floor rooms and higher. We might as well have sleeping in the nightclub as the soundproofing is so bad. When I called to request another room, I was told that they were booked up and there was nothing they could do except offer me some EAR PLUGS!!!!!!!! I thought she was joking, but then she proceeded to become rude and snotty on the phone basically telling me I should just suck it up! She did say she would ask the DJ to turn the bass down, but that never happened. Then at around 10 minutes after midnight, the phone rang with the front desk lady telling me she had good news, that the owners son would not be using his room tonight and we could move into it away from the noise... I think she was expecting me to be grateful, having just arrived in New York off a flight from Australia I certainly was not expecting a hotel room that I could not sleep in due to the noise from the nightclub, and having to deal with a snotty receptionist who forgot why she is working in a hotel. Oh and finally, to top it all off, at around 4am the fire alarm went off for about 15 minutes, a voice on the intercom said it was a glitch in the system. Fun times all round.

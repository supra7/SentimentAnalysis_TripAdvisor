As a person who has stayed at some every nice hotels, the service was average at best. In the Casio it took someone 15 minutes to come fix my machine after asking 3 people. The rooms are nice but small if you stay in the regular rooms. There was no turn down service which you would expect at a hotel of this class. The food choices were limited with breakfast expecting to pay over 60 for breakfast with just eggs and no alcohol. On a Saturday night the music from the club can be heard for till 2 am and we were on the 31st floor. In my opinion, over priced and not worth the money.

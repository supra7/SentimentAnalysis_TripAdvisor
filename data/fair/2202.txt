The hotel lobby is beautiful. The location is superb. The price was great. We Hotwired it and got a deal. It was recently remodled in 2005 and at first glance the room seemed great. We had read some of the reviews and thought that we had made a mistake. As we looked closer we saw that the carpet had stains in it, the bathroom floor had a permanent dirty look too it, the carpet was pealing up in one corner and when I tried to unplug the coffee pot to use the iron the entire socket came out of the wall. This is by no means a 4 star hotel. I will say the staff was nice and professional. We did not asked to be moved, so who's to say if all the rooms were as bad. I would just note that you get what you pay. If the finer things aren't what you're looking for, this is a cheap place to sleep that's close to all the sites.

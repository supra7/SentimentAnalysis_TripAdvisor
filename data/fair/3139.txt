Not as good as expected I just got back from a week-long vacation with my boyfriend at the Marseilles. After reading the reviews we figured we would be happy staying there. We aren't spoiled and never have high expectations but after this trip, we will NEVER stay there again. The hotel was going through some renovations - dirty! There were only two elevators which broke down one day and we had to use the stairs all afternoon - we were on the SIXTH floor! The pool is small and never enough chairs or umbrellas so you usually end up having to put your things on the side and jumping in the pool or risking burning in the sun! There were never any dry towels ready for us, we always had to request for them. The rooms were fairly nice and were always cleaned in a timely manner but that's about as good as it got.

I booked this hotel for two nights through reviews.. but I was not at all impressed with this hotel. Rooms are not really comfortable and have basic enmities. Bathroom was very okay not super great.. really old look. I booked a premium room though. The sofa was so uncomfortable to sit On and had to resort to the bed.. The lobby is lively and so is the coffee shop. Location wise this place is 15 mins drive to emirates mall. Also there is not much around this hotel and you have to take a taxi by all means. The only good part is a very friendly staff and a clean hotel. They have no affiliation with any airline for points as well..so you are empty handed with no rewards! Overall a very okay hotel nothing great.. just a sleep over hotel!

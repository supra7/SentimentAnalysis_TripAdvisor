After my labor day stay, I won't be deciding future hotel choices based on Tripadvisor ratings !!! This hotel was rated #16. I've stayed at #40, the Maison Dupuy, and for the life of me I can't figure out how the Dauphine carries such a lofty rating. Only two things, stand out about this hotel. The bed and the location. If that's all you want in a hotel, the Dauphine Orleans might suffice. Let's start with the lobby. It looks like a Best Western check-in desk, then you're off to the one working elevator with the cracked floor that sits outside the lobby area and in the garage with all the car fumes. The pool was actually OK, but forget sitting anywhere or laying out. There are about 4 deck chairs and 2 tables in an awfully cramped pool area. The bar/lounge smelled like a wet ash tray and looks like it hasn't been updated since the late 70s. One has to cross the damp ashtray bar/lounge to get to an equally horrible and dated breakfast buffet dining room. The dated and dank ambiance is surpassed only by what I would call the worst breakfast buffet I've experienced in years. There wasn't one hot item, if you exclude the coffee and waffle's you make yourself. The staff was decent. I feel bad they don't have a better environment in which to work. Bottom line, the public spaces of this hotel need a complete redo. There are far better choices in the French Quarter at more reasonable or equal prices.

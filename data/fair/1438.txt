I've been to New Orleans a million times, my hubby (1st time) and I've never been to a hotel that I was ready to leave before I got to my room. The girl that checked us in 6.22.12 that night, sat and talked to us. At first we didn't even know if someone was there. They were also very light staffed on valet. Got to the room and this was the SMALLEST room I've ever seen. Smaller than motels. It was however, VERY CLEAN (that's why we stayed). We had to go to the front desk again, and low and behold, I had to wait for the same girl to get off of a personal phone call to ask her a question. They need to coach this girl on customer service. The lady that checked us out in the morningn (6.24.12), however, was very professional. Even though the hotel was clean, I doubt if I ever stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone.

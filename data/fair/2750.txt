The carpets were dirty, bed was hard, coffee was good (No free continental breakfast), everyone was helpful but, lost half a day waiting on the manager, because he was saying we owed more money, we tried explaining to him that they already received the credit card payment.... but he kept insisting that we needed to pay more. I called my credit card company and it showed they received the full amount he was requesting. We even printed a bill online, but he still didnt acknowledge it. So i called the credit card services in front of him and he overheard me saying I wanted to dispute the charges.... Right there he called me over and said everything went through, and finally gave us a receipt. Which he wouldnt give us, when we paid at checking in. The manager probably thought he would get more money out of us since we are minorities.... So get your receipts and look over your credit card bills for overcharges.

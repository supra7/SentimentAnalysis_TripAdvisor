Although the location was very convenient (a 10-15 minute downhill walk to Pike Place Market), this hotel was dissapointing. We had just come off the I-5 after a HOT day of driving and there was no air conditioning, which was not mentioned on the website. There was a note on the window asking that we leave windows closed as there were renovations going on at the hospital 20 feet away from the hotel, also not mentioned on the website. We had to wait for the ancient elevator to go up one floor because the stairwells were closed due to renovations going on in the hotel...again, not mentioned on the website. The room we had was very old, dingy and smelled stale, and there were dried drips and spots on the bathroom walls. Construction went on until at least 7pm and started again at 6:30am. Both available parking garages were located down a very steep hill. These things should be taken into consideration for people staying there for medical reasons. The desk staff were very good at apologizing.

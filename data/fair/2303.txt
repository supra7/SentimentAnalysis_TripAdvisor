Stayed at the Hyatt with my husband on a short stopover in Boston. Booked the hotel through priceline (you would think the experience would have at least been decent value for money...) Paid $105 for the room, but then an additional $43 +tax for valet and $10 +tax for internet! For $160 you can stay at the Omni, a much nicer 4 star establishment in the same neighbourhood. The Hyatt is of a monstrous size, feels worn and hollow. The room was a little shabby with chipping paint in places and banged up furniture. Our heating was not working when we first arrived (a cold January night), the window was leaking whatever little heat was in the room. Someone came to fix it shortly after we called down. Once it was fixed he asked us not to touch the controls. The vent kept turning on and off all night, making a lot of noise. Our king bed was very high up and had a feather bed on top of the mattress, which made it too soft. I felt like I was floating all night. The pillows on the other hand were too hard. The location was ok, but too far to walk to Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market area, where parking is once again outrageously expensive. The last time I was in Boston I stayed at the Omni, closer to the market and North End where there are tons of great restaurants and shopping. The omni staff was fantastic and they brought up complimentary fresh juice/coffee/hot chocolate in the mornings. Will go back there next time. Never again to the Hyatt!

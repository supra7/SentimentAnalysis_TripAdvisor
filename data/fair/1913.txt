We stayed at Hotel Lawrence for three nights with our teenage son while we visited Dallas for the first time. We booked this hotel via Priceline (name your own price). We were disappointed immediately upon seeing the hotel,because it did not look as good asit did in the online photos. Once we entered we were even more disappointed. The inside of the hotel was not clean. We waited in line a long time to check in, behind only one other person. We had to pay $20 more per night to have a room with two beds, and paid $15 per day for valet parking. We didn't mind that our room was small, but it was not as clean as it could havebeen. The free breakfast was horrible. Although we paid for valet parking, I looked out our window one morning at 6:15 a.m. and saw our car parked on the street in front of the hotel. I looked out again at 7:00 a.m. and it was gone! We returned to our room one afternoon at 2:45 p.m. and the room had not been cleaned! And when they cleaned it they did not give us clean water glasses or remove obvious trash, like a soda can. Yes, we left them on the table,because there was no room in the one tiny trashcan in the bathroom! Waited two hours for a blanket and received it only after calling back to the desk. Theonly highlight of this hotel was the nice ride in the hotel van to the 6th Floor Museum, and the semi-prompt pickup for our return to thoe hotel. Overall, it was a very unpleasant lodging experience, and we would not stay there again even if the room was free!

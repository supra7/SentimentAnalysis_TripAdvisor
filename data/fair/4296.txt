We were very disappointed with our room at the Beekman Tower Hotel. When we checked in they told us they "upgraded " us to a room in the annex. The top of the refrigerator in the kitchenette had not been cleaned in a while which led me to take a closer look around. The hide-a- bed sofa was stained and torn, nothing I wanted to sit on. There was a baggie, and worse, a dirty q-tip behind the dresser. Mold in the bathtub which they have tried to cover up with caulking. We called the desk to complain and polite young man who came to check out our complaints said "We do apologize." We asked to change rooms but they were full up and had nothing else. They sent someone to clean up. Granted, we were staying there on points, but that shouldn't have mattered. On the positive side, the air conditioning worked.

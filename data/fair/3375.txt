friends from France were staying with us for 2 weeks apart from 2 days in Manhattan. They booked with hotels.com and prepaid well over $200 per night for a room for 4 [2 adults and 2 children] with breakfast. On arrival they were shown a room with 1 double bed. After protesting they were shown another with 2 beds. Breakfast was not initially available; they were told the hotel had run out. After insisting that breakfast was included, they were rudely told they would have to wait as someone was out purchasing more food. Finally, they were offered pastries. unfortunately they left with a poor impression of New York hospitality.

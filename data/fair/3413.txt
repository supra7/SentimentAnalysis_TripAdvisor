Just returned from a Christmas stay in New York City. We chose the Helmsley based upon positive reviews we'd read on the Internet. And the price was reasonable. However, you may want to pass this one by. Unless being centrally located is at the top of your list of priorities. Our room was on the 6th floor. The carpet was old and very stained. The furniture is old-fashioned and rickety. In fact, the legs were coming off both the bourdoir chair and the vanity. We moved the armchair since no maid had done so...and discovered a wealth of dirt. The bed sags in the middle and the shower runs in spurts of molten hot and cold. The room was quite cool and it was unpleasant to work with the radiant heater since it was so dirty. The main elevators were not working so we shared the freight elevator with staff. Depending on the time of day like morning and supper time, the wait could be very long. The "breakfast" was not appealing; better off going to Grand Central Market and grabbing fresh pastry instead...and a coffee at a Starbucks. On the plus side, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Any complaint was acted upon immediately. And the maid service was excellent. We could count on clean towels and clean bedding. Apparently, the main bank of elevators will be replaced by March which is good since the room prices nearly double in the spring. Would we stay here again? In spite of the room condition? Yes, because of the location. We could make our way anywhere in a very short period of time by subway, bus, taxi, or on foot. Anything one could want is within a reasonable walking distance from great restaurants to Rockefeller Plaza. Grand Central station is about 10 minutes away and Lexington Avenue is a wonderful adventure. Advice: Try to book a room on a higher floor. Or settle for a less desirable room in exchange for a highly desirable city locatiion.

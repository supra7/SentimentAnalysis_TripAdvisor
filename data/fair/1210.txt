The price was cheap so we did not expect luxeries for our stay there. It was centrally located and quiet at night. Shared bath facilities was clean. Saturday night was a battle to get near the loo though but otherwise it was ok. We stayed there for 3 nights. On arrival the room had clean sheets , coffee and tea sachets etc..However the room was NOT cleaned for 3 days. No clean Sheets..NO fresh Towels and NO extra coffee and tea bags. The bin overflowed with rubbish. The window was BROKEN and to open it we had to prop it up with a coke can or the trash bin! The TV was a waste of time because there was zero signal..Pathetic. The breakfast consisted of a hot dog and baked beans and an egg..not what I call english breakfast..but again for the price..the toast was good. Would I go again? No! no matter how cheap and convenient..clean sheets and clean towels is a MUST. I see they have now increased their price . I really hope that includes an upgrade in the service and sheets offered! Cheers

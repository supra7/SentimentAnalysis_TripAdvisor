My friend booked this hotel so that we wouldn't have to drive or take a taxi for a weekend in Seattle. I loved the look of the hotel. We got a deluxe room with a private bath. The only downfall of the hotel is its staff. My poor friend spent about 20 minutes drive around looking for parking while another friend tried to get the front desk clerk to tell her where we could park but he was too busy on a personal call to talk to her. We finally did find parking on our own. He seemed sort of blas about the entire thing. Well, besides the staff, I loved the hotel and we had a great weekend. It truly is a fun and eclectic place to stay.

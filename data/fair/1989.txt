If you read some of my other reviews, you will see I am not meticulous about hotels. When we are visiting a place, we are not using the room much anyway. However, this hotel was a real disappointment. Except for the price, very reasonable for Barcelona, and its proximity to Barcelona-Sants, the train station (as we were travelling through Spain via train) I have nothing good to say about it. The room looked depressing, dark in colours, with very little light, stained, and ruined wallpaper, various rust-stains in the bathroom, plus a strange humid smell when we got in. The breakfast was mediocre, compared with other 4* hotels we stayed in Spain. The selection seems to be the same everywhere (probably some Spanish standard), but somehow in this hotel it looked worse than in others. Speaking of 4*, I cant see how this hotel is rated that high. As for its location (quite close to a prison btw, another depressing sight when passing by coming from one of the two subway stations serving the hotel), you pretty much depend on the subway to get to the main attractions. Connections are good and the trains run late in the night, therefore the location it not much of a problem for seeing the wonderful city of Barcelona. Except for the hotel, everything was perfect there, so if you cannot afford better hotels, you can take the risk with this one. Other reviewers seem to get better rooms then us, so maybe you will get lucky as well.

I stayed here with a friend on Friday night, July 27. I arrived at 4:30pm, and was told that our room was not ready. After some prodding, I found out that the Hyatt rents rooms to airline personnel who need to sleep during the day before overnight flights. These personnel do not check out until 6:00pm, 7:00pm, or later. This means that those guests who book rooms for the evening have to wait til the rooms are emptied and cleaned. While I waited in the lobby, I noticed many other guests around me who were also waiting for their rooms. Some became quite irate and insisted on speaking with the manager. They were told they had to wait. It was ridiculous. At 6:30pm, our room was still not ready, and my friend and I had to leave for the evening. We told reception that we'd return around 10:30pm to check in, and to please not give away our room. When we returned at 10:30pm, we were told that there were no more rooms with two double beds available. They gave us a king and brought in a rollaway. They did drop the price of the room in half for the inconvenience, but word of advice to the Hyatt--if you are going to double-book rooms and make guests wait til late at night to check in, at least give them some courtesy by informing them when they BOOK the rooms, not when they arrive to check in. At least give guests the choice upon booking. And give guests an automatic discount if they opt for late check in.

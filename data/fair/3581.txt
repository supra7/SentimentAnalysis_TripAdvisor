I was so excited to be staying at the W Hotel for my visit to NYC this year but man oh man was I disappointed- let me count the ways: 1. Front desk staff, bellboys and doormen all seemed to be too cool and socially engaged to assist you. We felt no love, no warmth or even friendliness. Upon arrival, my husband and me had to drag our luggage by ourselves all the way up to our room without any staff offering their assistance to us. I'd lived in NYC for 10 years and had never met this kind of rudeness before. 2. The elevators are tiny and we often had trouble operating them: we had to insert our keys at least a couple of times for the beeping sound to appear before we were able to press any buttons. Seriously, W Hotel, with the rate you charged for your rooms I think you can afford an upgrade of your elevator operating system. 3. Bathroom mirrors are located too high, the sink was slow to drain; oh and the bathroom is ridiculously small. 4. The mini bar is outragiously expensive and is tricked with the latest technology so that if you remove or touch anything inside for more than 30 seconds, they'll charge you for it even if you do not plan to drink/consume it.5. We asked for a late check-out on our last day, and we were supposed to vacate before 4 pm. Way before the time arrived, the cleanig ladies and various staff had come and knocked our door to inquire "If everything's okay" and "If indeed we would be leaving by 4 pm." Way to make your guests feel welcome (not!), W Hotel. I can go on and on about what made our stay there unpleasant but I'll save my breath and end with this: Avoid staying here. The Bliss bath products and great mattress and sheets do NOT justify the price they charge for the room!

We stayed at this hotel for one night before an early morning flight. Included with the one night hotel stay was 7 days of parking for our car during our trip. So, taking the parking into consideration this is a good place to stay and a fair deal. However, I highly recommend that you get there at bedtime and leave first thing in the morning. The room was noisy, had a view of the roof and was worn and dated. There were large gaps in the door out into the hallway.

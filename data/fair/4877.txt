Why is this hotel open? It's still under construction. Lobby not open yet, main entrance closed. For some reason it was impossible to reach room service, had to go out to eat instead. The rooms are OK though, nice modern TV system which is important to me since I spend a lot of time in the hotel room. Internet WiFi connection was fast and 10 USD per 24 hours is a good price.

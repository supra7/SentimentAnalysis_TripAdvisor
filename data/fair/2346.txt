We stayed in the Fairmont in August of this year (have been before), and we were very disappointed with the level of service from some of the staff, especially Reception. I love this Hotel for its location and ambience and that is why I was delighted we were going back but from check-in to check-out myself and my husband found the staff to be rude. Our room was fine but could do with some refurbishment - we were on a special rate and I felt we paid the price for this throughout our whole stay. The only member of staff who we found to be helpful was a girl in guests services (sorry I cannot remember her name, she had red hair). I come from a Travel and Hotel background and it takes a lot for me to right this type of review but I really do feel management seriously need to take a look at front of house staff, there are a lot of them but this is diffenitely a case of quantity over quality. I will not return to this hotel and will certainly not recommend it.

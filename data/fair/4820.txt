My wife and I planned a few days in Boston, and had stayed at this hotel years ago. Things have changed. The hotel was OK, but it is in dire need of a renovation. The bath fixtures and tub are in need of replacement, as well as the carpets. The biggest disappointment was the restaurant, Seasons. It is advertised as a gourmet restaurant, however it was a typical hotel restaurant. Dinner was average and expensive, breakfast was awful. The hotel is in a great location, but it has really gone down hill . The only positive was that the staff was very nice. Maybe we expected too much, but we will choose another place upon our return to Boston.

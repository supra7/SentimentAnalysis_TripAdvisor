We stayed here for few weeks and we extended for another month. I was happy I was able to negotiate our stay with Liz, the Asst. General Manager. The service is really good from the friendliness of the front desk, the fast service from maintenance, the welcoming greeting of Martha at the breakfast room and the help I got from Aron when I needed some papers to scan. I applaud the housekeeping for being honest and for taking care of our room. I am not the type of person who needs room service everyday but when I needed it, housekeeping did a superb job in changing all my linens and my child always leave my computer, my i touch etc but it is always stays in the room when we get home. The laundry room never fails me, it is always available no matter how full the hotel is. They have 4 washers and 4 dryers for everyone. I've been to other hotels and they usually have 2 washers and 1 dryer working for 80+ rooms, that's crazy. I like the staff the most, they are so friendly and they remember me and my kids. We feel like we are home and we felt safe during our entire stay. I highly recommend the place to anyone. I would be probably coming back again once we are in San Diego.

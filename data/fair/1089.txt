The Donald would not have put up with the lax housekeeping, the broken internet and the non-functional amenities at this, his Vegas statement hotel. The first room I got reeked of cigar smoke-this in a fully non-smoking hotel. OK, called downstairs and got another room. Moved there and started to get to work. At least I thought I did. The WiFi cxn is not working. I'm a tech guy here for a tech convention (CES) so I think I know when the wifi is not working. Spent the better half of an hour trying to get it working until the CSR says, "Most of the new check-ins are having problems." Really? I call down to the Front Desk and of course all of the other rooms are gone, OK. Well, at least I can relax and take advantage of their luxuriously large jacuzzi tub. WRONG. The switch for the jacuzzi doesn't work. I call down to tell them to tell Maintenance to fix it before I get back from the convention the next day. It wasn't. Hey, I can understand that you're busy, but if you tell me you're going to do something, I expect you'll be getting it done. The Donald would expect it. You're fired!

A word of caution to travelers who book their vacation through Expedia. This hotel does not choose to honor all Expedia bookings. My friend and I recently booked two queen beds through Expedia, when we arrived at the hotel the booking was questioned even with the hotels confirmation number. We were told we would have to pay an extra $50 dollars a night, which we questioned. Then they said they would be able to put us up for two nights with the beds and we would have to move over to the Wynn for our last two nights. When we went to move they again asked for our reservation and confirmation after waiting for a very long time they photo copied our reservation and said that they would let us stay for the last couple days without charge ( I believe that the Wynn was full and they had no choice). Then we also discovered that beverages had been half drunk and left in our fridge from previous guests. They questioned this but did remove the charge. The whole experience of this beautiful hotel had been ruined for us. We found the experience to be stressful and we wasted much of our time trying to iron things out. There are many five star hotels on the strip my advise would be to skip this one.

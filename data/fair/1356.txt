We stayed here for two nights prior to a cruise. This hotel would have been ok had it not been for the fact that my family was followed and harrassed when we left our hotel and walked down the street. After that we made sure to take a cab everywhere we went.....even if it was close by. If you do venture out definitely do so during daylight and try not to look like a tourist or you may as well have a target painted on your back! I wish the concierge had warned us instead of pointing us toward the public transportation system. As far as our room goes, it was a bit dated- not what I expected from a Hilton. My family did enjoy the pool area. The water was a bit chilly but that did not deter from the fun. Food- the sandwiches were great. Stay away from the chicken caesar salad....not so good. The salad was not fresh. The breakfast buffet was pretty good. Would have been better if they offered either waffles or pancakes at the buffet instead of just eggs. Most of the employees were very kind and helpful. Because of the area and the fact that I felt unsafe when I exited the hotel, I would not stay here again.

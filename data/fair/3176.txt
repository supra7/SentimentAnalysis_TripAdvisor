We have stayed at this hotel several times over the years. The pools have been the only reason we have kept coming back, they are great. The rooms are long over due for a serious remodel. The beds are very hard, as are the pillows. It was two nights of fighting to sleep. The hotel decor is late 70's, ugly. There is a base board heater in the room, that is so noisy that you would almost just rather be cold then have it wake you up every time it turns on. We will not be back, unless they change things.

My husband and I were at the Ritz back in March 2010 for a conference. It is a beautiful property with amazing views, but please watch the staff. I had a pair of hot pink "She's Back" Lou Goutin shoes that I paid over $1000 stolen along with a designer purse. Our bellman was the only person that saw me and my husband pack them in the bottom of a ABC drugstore bag. He arrived at our room immediately after my husband called the front desk to request a bellman. I had everything ready to go except my shoes and purse that I had purchased a few weeks before our trip to wear out to dinner the night before. He over heard my husband say, "I would not put those $1000 shoes and designer purse in that bag." The bellman was standing right next to me, and I say his eyebrows raise, but I did not think anything about it. I did not pack them in the suitcase since I thought they would be safer flying next to me on the way home. We flew first class and my bag was never out of my sight, except for the holding area that the bellman carried our belongings to prior to us leaving for the airport. The security at the Ritz claimed that they did not see anything happen on the security cameras, but we found out that there were no security cameras in the area were our bags were being held. It was very odd that we got home with everything except my expensive shoes and designer bag, and it was stuffed in the bottom of the drug store bag with t-shirts and small trickets for our kids and grandson. Everything else got back home just fine. Interesting!!!!!!! Shocking experience.

Booked this at $105 per night (for suite) with Travelzoo offer. Stayed two nights. Great location. They are in the middle of doing a lot of renovation and the plans look good when it will be finished. Were on the 24th floor so above the major work so no noise heard. Suite was nicely decorated. Bathroom is Tiny and the light switches were in the hall which was a nuicance as had to remember to turn them on before going in. Bedroom is off the "lounge" but it is not a separate room so no door. Staff were pleasant and helpful, especially the doormen, always welcoming. This is now a 100% no smoking hotel.

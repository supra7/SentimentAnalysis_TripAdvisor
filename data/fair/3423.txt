The rooms were very large and spacious, also has a microwave and a mini fridge to reheat and to store things in the fridge which was very handy. The location of the hotel was only a few steps from the 96th St metro station which was very handy to get into Midtown and uptown. Only 10 blocks from Tom's Restaurant (Seinfeld fans). The rooms are a little dated and the decor can do with a revamp. the bed covers were very outdated and the room would change in look if these were more modern. The bathroom had been recently renovated which was good, however, we had issues with the hot water, we had to call the maintanence guy as we had the water running for 25 min and didn't have any hot water. when they came up, they said the water was ok and that it was warm enough. this wasn't acceptable and eventually the only way to fix the issue was to turn off the cold water completely from the pipes which meant that the toilet couldn't flush. The hotel doens't have any free wifi and if you wanted to purchase WiFi it was based on a 12 hour basis. the hotel elevator was so small, old and soo slow. we were on the 7th floor and it took forever for the elevator to turn up as each of the housekeepers had to keep using it with their trolleys to get to and from floors as there wasn't any service lift and as the lift was so small, the trolleys took all the room in the lift which took even longer to call the lift. When we checked out, weren't even asked how our stay was. the concierge pressed the button for the lift for us and expected a tip, when they didn't even offer to assist with our bags. the price of the room was excessively high for the room and service.

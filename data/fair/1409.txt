We stayed at the Confortel Barcelona for three nights while traveling around Europe on our honeymoon. We were excited to stay there as they were a four star hotel so we paid a little more than we were spending in other cities. Positives: The location is good. You are not downtown, but close to the beach, 10 minute walk from the mall and a transit ride (or longer walk) into the downtown. Negatives: The staff are just awful. When we checked in, there was a line of people waiting for help and the girl behind the desk just kept playing around with the phone and didn't even acknowledge anyone. When we finally checked in it was abrupt and not welcoming. We asked for a dinner suggestion and they directed us to the computers in the lobby. We called down asking them to make us a reservation at a restaurant we liked the sound of and they 'don't do that.' They don't look up when you approach the desk and are just overall rude. Not a nice feeling! I was really surprised to have this service in a four star hotel. We had had fantastic service from the other (B&B's and lower-starred hotels) places we had stayed. Room had a nice view, and free bottled water, but the shower was broken and one morning I didn't have hot water for the whole shower. We also saw some bugs, but it didn't bother us. Breakfast was fine, but overpriced (at 16 Euro per person). Pool area looked nice (we went up to see it but went to the beach instead). Overall, would not stay here again. I am sure there are better places to stay in the beautiful city of Barcelona.

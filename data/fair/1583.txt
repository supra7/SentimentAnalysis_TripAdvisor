Brand new and the first hotel to open in the area (with Ritz Carlton coming in in 2010), this latest luxury hotel is Hong Kong, is... well, trying to be cool. Located in the lower half of a 70-storey tower, rooms are designed well, with excellent bathrooms (cool sink, sliding doors, large tub, Bliss toiletries, rain shower), large HD LCDs (also nicely concealed behind a sliding mirror), and ok size rooms. Outdoor pool on the 76/F is not open yet, and the Bliss Spa below is in its final preparation. Actual lobby is still under construction. Views are ok. The "Million-dollar view" towards Central is completely blocked by the 101-storey skyscraper right in front of it. So the best harbour view is towards the west. The view towards the city on Kowloon side is more interesting. Everything in the room was an attempt to be "cool". Light controls just marked "Day", "Sleep", "Evening", iPod connectors, in-built surrounding sound system (that's awesome!). Although the room is equipped with blinds that block out all outside lights, these controls, be it the lights, emergency exit, telephone, all around the room actually light up the room much, which is a complete design failure. Didn't find staff to be especially helpful, as I was stuck outside the entrance because there was some hip party happening and they couldn't quite let me in... Everything is charged, and outrageously. Simple breakfast for 2 costs over $800. Can definitely find better value for money elsewhere.

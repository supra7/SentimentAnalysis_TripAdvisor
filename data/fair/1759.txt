My best friend and I reserved this hotel for our annual girl weekend. We decided to bring our mothers along. When we got to our room our mom's found little black bugs all over. The front desk changed their room but the temperature in their new room was freezing. We never could get the temperature right. They called the front desk for blankets and there were none. Then we found a fire ant in one of our beds. The trash can was not empty and was full of black hair. The gal who worked the front desk was nice but was limited in helping us. It was not her fault. As a result we are canceling the rest of our stay and moving to another hotel.

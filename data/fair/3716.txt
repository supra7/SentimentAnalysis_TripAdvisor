In a nutshell, I really just wouldn't bother. We had been looking forward to staying at the Peabody for a couple of nights at the end of a brilliant two week stay in Florida. It was throughly disappointing. We were there at the same time as hundreds of teenagers who were attending an event at the convention centre, which faces the hotel. Needless to say, we were kept awake by the inconsiderate shrieking, screaming and shouting of the other guests from their rooms and from the pool at midnight. It was more like staying in an expensive youth hostel. This may not have been the hotel's fault, but they weren't remotely bothered when I mentioned it in the morning. You also pay a 10 dollar service charge for water, local calls and an I Ride ticket, whether you want them or not. It's clean with a very impressive foyer and TVs in the bathroom. It is also handy for Pointe Orlando. However, we won't be staying there again, it was all just a bit below par.

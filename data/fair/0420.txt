Uninformed staff. Extreme wait time at check-in. We waited 2 hours for our room even though we weren't early for check-in. No one was available to help with bags. No wifi in room (even though the front staff told us it was free). Rip-off tactics in regards to the mini-fridge and it's sensors. If you move an item or try to store medication, you are instantly charged 7$ and a restocking fee. Computer access in the lobby is 7.95 for 15 minutes. The Westin needs to focus on customer service instead of trying to figure out ways to squeeze pennies out of their already premium room rates. The rooms were clean and modern but the service and overall experience soured everything.

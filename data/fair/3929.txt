I didn't want to be one of the reviewers to pan a hotel just because there were a few faults, so let me start with the good. Excellent location right on Geary in a perfectly safe neighbourhood. Free internet access was also available and the fitness centre whilst small was very much appreciated. Now, the not so good. If you have a room ending in 20,21 or 22 you will not sleep. These rooms overlook Geary and the hotel has done NOTHING to try and reduce noise. I am used to staying in city hotels, even in SF, but the street noise here was unbelievable. Please, if you are anything other than a very heavy sleeper get a room at the back. Next problem, housekeeping. Being woken up at 745am (when the do no disturb sign was clearly on the door) was not my idea of service, however it got even worse when the next day housekeeping left my door ajar all day. Not good enough - when I contacted the front desk they said they would record the matter and hung up on me. My final problem came when I tried to extend my stay. Whilst they were able to extend my stay one day the hotel was completely booked the next day. Fair enough - it was late notice. However it would have been nice if they had contacted another of the personality hotels and checked with them. all in all the hotel is ok but there are MANY better options in the city. Personally, for the mid range traveller, you should check out the Commodore on Sutter for a better all around hotel.

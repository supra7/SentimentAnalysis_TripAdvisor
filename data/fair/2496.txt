My husband and I were given a one night stay in a suite at The Palmer House Hilton as a gift. When we arrived the lobby was packed and I used my Hilton Honors membership to check in so as not to stand in the very long check in line. It was a frigid day in Chicago and the revolving doors never stopped moving which made the lobby area very cold. On the way to our room we passed rooms with trays discarded outside the doors - they were still there the following morning. Our suite was huge. The decor quite stiff and decorated in a 'Roman' type theme. The living room was very large with two sofas, a dining table for eight and a full wet bar, plus a full bathroom. The bedroom was quite big also with a king bed, lovely linens, down duvet and loads of down pillows. And another bathroom. My husband had work to finish but had a difficult time connecting to the internet. He ended up having to move furniture to connect to a phone jack, and talking to the tech department to sort it out. The internet connection in the bedroom was the only place were it would work. I watched TV in the living room and soon discovered how stiff and uncomfortable both sofa's were. While my husband tried to get his work finished I had a bath in the bedroom bathroom. It had no vent and soon was steamed up and smelling of mildew... We left the hotel for dinner at a nearby restaurant. Came back to have a drink in the lobby only to find it over-run by guests attending functions at the hotel. So, it was back to our suite where we slept fine. My husband got up early and went to the Starbucks around the corner to finish his work and brought back a coffee for me. We checked out and were glad to be on our way asap.

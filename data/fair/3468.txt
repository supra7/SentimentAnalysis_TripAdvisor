We decided to pay extra ($300-$350 per night) to stay in a really nice hotel during our two day vacation in NYC. Upon arriving at The Time we were very happy with the location and the service from the bellmen, the service desk, the bellhop--all very friendly and helpful. But upon entering our room we were very disappointed. The door was badly cracked and broken--as if someone had forced the door open while the night latch was secure. In the bathroom: the shower and ceiling had mildew (mold?), the caulking around the sink was peeling/dirty/slimy, and paint on the ceiling was peeling, Overall, the room was small and dingy with stains on the carpet and furniture with cracks and chips. So although the service was good we could not recommend this hotel to friends due to the discrepency between high cost and low room quality.

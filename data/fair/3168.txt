OK hotel, AWFUL neighborhood The hotel was OK (although it didn't have working air conditioning in the room), but the neighborhood was the worst. It's located in the heart of the tenderloin, and there were drug dealers outside of the property.The room and the entire hotel were clean. The staff was friendly and you can't beat the price -- especially if you take into consideration the free parking!! But I, personally, wouldn't go back. I'd rather pay a bit more and stay someplace else.

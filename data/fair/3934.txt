Not great for the single traveller I stayed at the Hotel Milano in April while travelling to the States on business. My main reason for choosing it was its proximity to the Moscone Center, which meant I only had to walk 5 minutes and so could come back to the hotel between meetings. Also it was a very reasonable price.I did not realise until I arrived that the hotel had no restaurant, no room service, not even any tea/coffee making facilities in-room. As a single traveller on business I found this to be more than a little inconvenient. Apparantly they violated their liquor license although I couldn't work out why this meant they couldn't even provide a kettle!Breakfast was easy as there are so many little places around that you can grab coffee and a pastry. Evening meals were more problematic as the staff were not knowledgeable about the area and were reluctant to recommend good places to eat.My room was a good size and the bathroom was nice. I had a window that overlooked an alley so there was little natural light. I felt that the decor should have been reconsidered as a result, really dark colours, heavy curtains and dark coloured lampshades meant that the whole place was constantly dark and dingy, even with all the lights on.The provision of wireless internet in room was really good. I think I paid about $40 for 5 days, plus an extra $25 to rent the wirless adapter as my laptop didn't have one. I don't know how this compares to other US hotels, but in the UK it is a lot more expensive.Overall I don't think I would choose to stay here again. When travelling on business I want a restaurant on-site and I certainly want room service and a kettle. But if you are looking for a reasonably-priced hotel, close to the shops, and don't mind eating out (even for breakfast) then it might be for you

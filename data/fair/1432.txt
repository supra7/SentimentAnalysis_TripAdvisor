A group of us stayed here for 4 nights. The location itself is quite good, easy to walk into the heart of Hollywood. Check in was quick and painless. The rooms were tastefully decorated and were spacious enough, although there was a strange damp smell on our floor that remained for the duration of our stay. Breakfast was satisfactory, hot and cold food to choose from. We did have a bad experience with our check out. After paying for 4 days parking at beginning of our stay, the front desk staff attempted to extract the full payment from us again, claiming they had no record of our payment. They questioned my wifes integrity with little subtleties. After we searched through our baggage for 20 minutes (becoming late for our flight), we eventually found the receipt and presented it to the front desk. They offered poor excuses and no apology. If you do stay here, keep your parking receipt.

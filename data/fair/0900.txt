My wife and I just recently stayed at this Hotel. I couldn't wait to find a place to post a review. I have to say right off the bat that the grounds are beautiful. They can't be beat when it comes to the scenery and the nice gardens and animals. But there comes the problem. It was so disgusting that they don't have any type of nets to catch the birds in the restaurant. The birds will sit on your table - disease! They will eat from your plate and hop around your feet. They land on the clean dishes and silverware and then the staff will serve you that same dish! I've seen it done! The water they served smelled like a bird took a crap in the glass. I'm telling you, don't eat at their restaurants. The Rooms need updating. For what they are charging you, you could get TONS more for your money at a TRUMP location. Their TV's are crappy, their sheets and bedding aren't what you are paying for. The place is very loud when you try to sleep! The room doors are very heavy and there is nothing that slows the closing of them. When they are shutting, they SLAM! You will hear the other guests doors slam! I promise you! Not to mention that the walls are paper thin! Talk quietly, or your next door neighbor will hear you. Especially if you are in the shower. The prices are way too expensive. That is a lesson I learned about staying at places such as the Hyatt. I will not do it again. $60 for a breakfast for 2. $40 for a Tuna sandwich. I could go on.....SAVE YOUR MONEY, go to a smaller scale hotel that is more updated, better, and that have affordable prices. STAY AT A CLEAN HOTEL!!

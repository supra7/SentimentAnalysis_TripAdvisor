We were sooo looking forward to this vacation that when we opened the room door we were stunned by the floor-to-wall window view of the space needle. But that was the high-point... As other reviewers have pointed out, the carpet was simply dirty and needs replacing ASAP. Next, the bathroom was stinky. It smelt like mold. Maybe the shower curtain needed to be replaced as well. Wi-Fi was chargeable - really in this day and age it should have been free. Pikes place is a good walk from the hotel and the monorail to the space needle is close by. Westin seems to nickel-and-dime you on all little amenities that you get for free at other places. We would definitely look elsewhere for our next trip to the great northwest.

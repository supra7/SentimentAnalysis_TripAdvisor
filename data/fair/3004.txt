After having to wait until 4:30pm for my room to be ready, I was already starting to dislike the way people are handled at this resort as its called. The room I purchased said, and I quote Ocean View. Panoramic View Of Pacific and neighbor Islands. What a downright , and outright lie. All I have is a panoramic view of the roof of the bar, and a glimpse of water.. at nearly $500 p/night this hotel rips people off. I rang and complained and all I was offered by management was worse rooms, and when I mentioned that the room description she said she would speak with her superior to have it altered so it better matched reality!.. doesnt help me much.. but hopefully the next person wont get robbed like I did. Great way to spend the first night of our honeymoon. Yes the pool and garden area are nice, but unfortunately outside of that all I have seen is rude staff and highly overpriced, out-dated rooms with very dishonest room descriptions. DO NOT STAY HERE this is barely a 3 star motel.

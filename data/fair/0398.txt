The Hotel is very nice on the outside and the lobby awsome but the staff just doesnt seem to work together and seemed to be lost in most cases. We got a suite and got my daughter a reg room and i would have paid our price for hers instead of our. the room just seemed out dated yet it was clean. The door to the TV cabnet was falling off and the bed didnt sit even the left side almost touched the floor. And we used the fax alot for our work but thats when it was working and when it was running half the time the faxes would never go threw, the the charge for faxed went from $8 for about 30 pages to $56 lol. the dinner was good for most part but we wanted to have a nice dinner our last night my meat was over half fat with about two bites of meat. Along with that I wonder now what is the sign for that you put on your door that says do not disturb cause it never stopped any of the staff from coming in at all and when they did they only knock once, better hope your dressed. and last but not least put your stuff up before the maids come in or they will throw it away- my laptop cover and my daughters contacts lens and case all in the trash. I could write a book but think I have said enough

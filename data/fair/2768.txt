My wife and I stayed at the Pioneer Inn for four nights at the end of June. Prior to our trip, we were encouraged by all the positive reviews read on this site. And upon my return I see yet more positive reviews. I'm not one to post a review like this, but I believe in this case people need to hear another side of this story. Let me start with the positive aspects of the hotel. 1) Price - if you don't want to break the bank, this place is certainly affordable. 2) Location - Lahaina is a fun town and you're right in the middle of it. Now for the negatives. 1) The rooms are small, outdated, and felt dirty. The furnishings and ambience of our room was straight from the late 70's / early 80's. 2) Our air conditioner constantly froze up, was increadible noisy, and basically made staying there miserable. You obviously need a functioning AC unit in Hawaii and we didn't have it. Each time it froze we were instructed to turn it off for a half-hour (is this really customer service?). It was so noisy you couldn't sleep. Be warned - all AC units here are window units and, at least in our case, it didn't work at all. 3) Location - as far as beach access, there isn't any. As mentioned above, great for going out and/or dining, but horrible for getting to the beach. 4) Service - or lack of it. You know about the AC unit mentioned above. They promised to move us to another room after multiple calls about the unit. The next day theys said they could no longer accomodate a move. Also just seemed to not care about you stay / experience in general. If I had it to do over again, I would have shelled out $50 - $75 more per night and stayed at any of the much nicer hotel options. I was very disappointed with this hotel.

Stayed at the Swissotel Chicago from June 11th-14th for a long weekend to catch a play and a Cubs game. Had a great time in Chicago, but felt the Swissotel left much to be desired. The Pros: great location, great views (we woke up and fell asleep to views of the ferris wheel at Navy Pier each day), comfortable bed. The Cons: If you drive, do not park at the Swissotel  it is $50.00/day. Park at the East Monroe garage at Millenium Park, it is a 5 minute walk and $23.00/day. The Swissotel also charges $9.95/day for internet access. Not wireless internet, wired internet. Seems if the motel in the burbs can offer free wi-fi the Swissotel can. The worst part was our room  it smelled terribly of smoke. I spoke with the front desk upon check-in to determine how long the hotel had been smoke free, the young lady who admitted she was new said she did not know and found the answer from a colleague. Turns out it had only been a year but it smelled as though it may have only been a week. The woman on the phone said she would send someone up to check it out and no one showed. We waited 2 hours while getting ready and ended up leaving without a follow up from the hotel. After some talking with my wife she reminded me the room was for sleeping and we would not be there for extended periods of time while awake. This is true, but it should not smell like a bar each time I return to the hotel. We were 2 rooms away from the elevators but could hear them clearly. The thermostat seemed broken - the fan would not stay on for periods longer than 10 minutes no matter how high or low you set the temperature. Other Cons: The HD TV is nice, HD channels would be too. The shower leaked everywhere in the bathroom, I needed my towel from the day before. The iron left black streaks on my white shirt  fortunately I always iron shirts inside out. The elevators are also very very slow.

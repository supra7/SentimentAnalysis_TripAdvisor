When we reserved our room, we asked for one on the top floor, saying that we really wanted something quiet and didn't want anyone above us. Well, that didn't work out. We were given one of those rooms that has a door to an adjoining room. Our "neighbors" came in from a night out on the town at about 2:30 a.m. and were talking loudly for about an hour. Plus, there's a bunch of construction going on outside on the street during the day. All in all, not a peaceful or relaxing place to stay.

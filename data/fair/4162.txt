Priceline "hooked me up" with this hotel. I should have been more careful. I can't complain about the location, it was pretty central to all of the fun in Seattle. The room, on the other hand, was pretty scary. At first it seemed normal enough-- clean sheets, clean towels, not pretty but no complaints. Then I got bedbug bites. After 3 nights I am covered in bedbug bites. I was too embarassed to complain about it and I had a feeling they'd make me take it up with Priceline anyways. The sheets were damn near toxic and I think they also gave me a rash. It smelled really weird and it had really nasty carpet. Anyways, if you want a cheap room close to the action and you don't care about your skin, this is your hotel.

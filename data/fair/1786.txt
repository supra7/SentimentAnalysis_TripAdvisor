We stayed at this hotel one night and it was one night too many. First, they simply did not have the king size suite we reserved. Already booked--too bad. Bait and switch? Staff did the best they could to give us a decent alternative. Sadly, though, the air conditioning in the smaller room did not work . The next room, also smaller, had a major leak in the ceiling of the bathroom. By then, we decided to just put down some towels and hope for the best so we could get on with our evening. We were told that the management would call us to see how to make things right. We never heard a word. On checking out the next day, we continued to request some kind of compensation so the desk operator deducted $20 from the bill. Don't stay here--there are too many other options. Following years of good leads from tripadvisor reviews, this is the second BIG miss in one month. How disappointing!

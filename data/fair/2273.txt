We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights while in Boston on a fun trip. The one and only benefit of this hotel is its location in Back Bay. It was about 2 blocks over from Newbury Street and directly across the street from the Prudential Center. Other than that, the staff was not friendly or very helpful. The concierge told us to go to this one club called District on a night that it was actually closed. A friend of ours drove down from Maine to hang out with us for the weekend, and parking at the hotel was $41/day. The refrigerator and ipod docking station were both broken, and we had to call the engineering guy a few times to finally resolve those issues. I wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel unless you get a really good deal.

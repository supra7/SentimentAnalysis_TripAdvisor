Darn, location ISN'T everything after all This hotel is convenient to Union Square and its attractions. It's quaint, a little down at the heels, but ultimately gives value in an expensive market. A nice continental breakfast is served on each floor - fresh pastries, orange juice, coffee, tea and fruit. There's always hot tea and coffee available in the lobby, and you can stop by the bar between 5:30 and 6:30 pm for a complimentary glass of wine. The restaurant, Fino, serves commendable Italian fare, and although it doesn't replace a trip to North Beach the staff was helpful, gracious and well versed in hospitality.What I didn't like: teensy-tiny room (the bathroom was literally in the closet and was no more than 10 sq. ft.); noise (if your room is in the front the street noise is loud all night. If you're on the back or the alley, the bar in the back releases a steady stream of loud, inebriated people until about 2:30 am, and then the garbage truck will wake you up at 4:30 am.) It was unusually warm during our stay, and there's no A/C. We opened the windows and turned on the ceiling fan, but that, of course, let in more noise.Older members of the hotel staff were professional and efficient. Younger staff were apathetic at best.Honestly, I think I'd try someplace else next trip to San Francisco.

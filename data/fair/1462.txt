The reason Hotel Smit is still being renovated is because no one is working on it. During the time I was there, nothing happened. Like someone else said, there is trash and stuff all around on the stairways and you have to carry your own bags up the very narrow and steep stairs (I was on the 5th floor). Cornelius was the only staff member at the desk who was nice. I would not stay there again.

I stayed in room 627. The bathroom was from the 1940's. There was no heat duct in the bathroom and the temperature was probably 60 degrees. The closet in the room was even colder. I called the management inthe morning and they sent a portable heater to the room. They said its an older building and they will be doing some remodeling. Sorry for the inconvenience was their position. When blow drying my hair, the circuit breaker blew out. 15 minutes later they reset it. Again, sorry for the inconvenience, however now I was running behind schedule. As an accomodation, they took the breakfast charge off the bill.

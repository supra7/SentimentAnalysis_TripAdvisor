First, let me say that I had a really horrendous experience with the room service food. Here are a couple of examples: One of the dishes I wanted to order: "Pasta with shrimp, garlic, white wine, herbs in an herb butter sauce" I wanted something slightly healthier, so I asked if they could lighten the butter in the sauce, and they said yes. So, what did they deliver, pasta noodles with cheese on top--there was no garlic, no evidence of white wine, and no evidence of herbs. Another dish I ordered, "Grilled Chicken breast, roasted tomatoes, olives, and basil on baguette" (note I'm using quotations as these are actual citations from the menu itself...just so you don't think i had some twisted interpretation). I ordered this as I thought it would reasonably healthy, so the first order came with a huge amount of cheese--I mean the sandwich looked like nachos in a sense that was covered with cheese, so I sent that back. I noted to room service that there was no mention of cheese on the sandwich and they apologized but said this is how they do it and customer like it . Ok, fair enough, but send me what's on the menu. So for the 2nd order, here's what arrived: a grilled chicken breast on a bun with sundried tomato paste (probably from a can), and evidently the basil and olives are in the paste. Is it just me or wouldnt one expect to see some fresh basil and some fresh roasted tomatoes on the chicken breast?? The Internet connection was a bit intermittent over the four days I was there. It probably worked 75% of the time, but given that I'm there for business, that's not acceptable, especially if I'm paying for service. Last, I asked several times to speak with the general manager and have him/her call me, and I never got a call... wouldn't recommend this hotel to a friend, and not even an enemy

This hotel is getting two dots vice one because of its very comfortable bed. This is the most I've every paid for a hotel room ($400) and was expecting a comfortable stay. Here's what I found: - the bathroom sink is so huge that it overhangs the toilet. I am not large, but had to sort of hang over the sink while using it. It was a first for me! - maintenance was very poor. One blind didn't work at all, permanently stuck in the down position; another had many deep tears two to three inches long on one side. It took two tries for the maintenance people to fix the broken blind. There were many, many two to three inch snags in the carpet both in the room and in the halls, with cut and patch jobs evident. - we thought we'd made arrangements for our bill to be split between my partner and myself (it took about 15 minutes for the check in clerk to do this) only to find as we were checking out that no arrangement had been made, and they had no way to split it. Wish I'd been told that when we checked in! - it was incredibly noisy. Lots and lots of street noise, including car alarms, truck horns at 3 in the AM, etc. I guess it's to be expected in NYC, but better soundproofing might have helped. - only one chair in the room, a deskchair; no other place to sit besides the bed (yet there was plenty of room for other seating) What took the cake was when I was standing outside reading the restaurant menu and felt something wet on my head. A individual was leaning out the window several floors above vomiting on me. Charming clientele! Truly a disappointing experience. A friend stayed at the W Tuscany in NYC during the same period and raved about how pleasant it was. Stay there; don't go here.

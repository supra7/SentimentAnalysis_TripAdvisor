I guess I will start with the parking lot that is too far to the front entrance. You pull up to check out and then go around back to the parking lot that is pretty far from the lobby. The front desk manager was patronizing and arrogant. They did not seem welcoming at all!! When I got to my room, it was not what was expected. I booked the JR. Suite and I am not sure why they called it a suite, because it did not have a balcony or a jacuzzi. I remember the website saying it had those ammentitie when I booked it. When I questioned it with the front desk manager, he said he would call back and never did. He seemed annoyed that I would even question the room. The room was fairly clean; however, I could see little stains on the rugs and dust in areas not used often. Behind end tables etc. The pool was not as nice as it looked on the website. It wasnt terrible however, the big palmetto bug crawling out of the pool led to my demise. I know this was not the hotels fault. The Front desk also did not tell you about the ammenities of the hotel. I was glad i only stayed one night. I have to say I was spoiled from the last hotel I stayed for 4 days. I did not feel welcome at this hotel, and I will not go back. The good thing about the hotel is the distance to Universal and the price.

This is a budget hotel, to be sure. It deserves credit for being clean and for a really nice complimentary continental breakfast, as well as great subway access. That said, unless you want to sleep on mattresses that are hard as rocks, use threadbare linens, and have a choice between listening to neighboring rooms' toilets flushing all night long or the rattle of a poor air conditioner, I'd look elsewhere.

I picked this hotel solely based upon trip advisor reviews and I'm sorry I did. I don't know what type of hotel the other reviewers are used to staying, but unless your thing is small rooms, hard beds, rough sheets, thin towels and loud a/c's then this hotel is not for you. Also we went out all day to come back to uncleaned room. The only good thing about this hotel is location, but Homewood Suites is next door and looks nicer and with bigger rooms I would recommend that hotel for the area instead.

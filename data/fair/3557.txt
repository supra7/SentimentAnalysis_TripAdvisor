So for $300 a night I'm staying in a tiny room with a view of the air conditioning unit? Please. My room was 45 degrees and it took an act of God to get the room in some kind of habitable condition. I'm not one of these touchy hotel guests, but this went beyone the pale. Sorry guys, next time I'm staying at another hotel.

Have stayed twice. Yes, the rooms, restaurants and lobby are well designed and appointed, staff are courteous, fitness center is sufficient, and location is superb, particularly if using T3. However, the hotel gets a rating of "terrible" for the most critically important aspect: noise. The very purpose of an airport hotel is sleep. Yet this is made difficult by the constant roar of aircraft taking off all night, even with earplugs. Having stayed in many airport hotels with similar proximity to the runway, the noise level was shocking, and a move to a different room provided almost no improvement. The transit hotels inside the terminals provide far, far better noise insulation. The people who put up this property are not stupid, so one wonders if a last-minute budget cut can explain such nonsense.

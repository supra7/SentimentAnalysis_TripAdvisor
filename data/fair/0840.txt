At $4.95 for a small bottle of water I am sure if there had been a mini bar I would have jammed it shut! The staff could not help you without making it look like it was a chore. The concierge gave out duff information constantly including the opening times of the emergancy medical centre, So when a straight brandy was ordered and one on the rocks was delivered it hardly surprised me that their solution was to take it away and scoop out the ice and bring it back. I still shudder at how it was scooped out. .... Oh and if you want fast, reliable Internet it's not to be found at this hotel!

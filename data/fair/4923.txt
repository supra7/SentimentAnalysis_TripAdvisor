I booked this hotel because it was recommended by my son's college. We were going to Chicago for a college orientation and the Best Western was blocks from the college. It was very convenient. The price was very reasonable and the reservation went smoothly. The room was small and a bit on the shabby side. It was difficult to adjust the air conditioning so the room was either very cold or too warm. The hotel only had 2 computers available for guests and they were usually taken. Once I had access to the computer, I found it to be very slow and the printer was not working. When I mentioned it to the desk clerk, she said, "Oh, just shut it off and turn it back on again and it will work. It always does that". I was trying to print my boarding pass and the printer was of such poor quality that the document was not legible. It is unlikely that I will stay at this hotel again.

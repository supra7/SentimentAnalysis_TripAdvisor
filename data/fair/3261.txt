The Intercontinental was disappointing. The service is attentive and the housekeeping is better than average, but the hotel itself is somewhat worn and shabby. The furniture in the room had seen much better days and was beaten and scarred like that which you would find in a second-rate hotel. The plumbing was very noisy and the room door closers were adjusted so that if someone walked out of their room and let the door go it would loudly slam shut. As a consequence, flushing toilets and early departing guests ensured that you were wide awake no later than 6 AM. My biggest complaint was the Internet broadband. They charge about $10 per day for the service in the room and it is hard cable only, not wireless. If a couple both have laptops, then they have to take turns using it. If one of you is traveling with an iPad, then you cannot use it at all. To add insult to injury, the bandwidth is only slightly faster than a dial-up connection. I ran a speed test on three different sites and the fastest download speed I got was 7/10th of 1 MegaBaud, or 700 KBaud. Compare that with typical speeds of 15 MB on most cable TV or FiOS home connections. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel for business travelers.

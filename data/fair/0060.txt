As a budget hotel I didn't expect much and it lived up to my expectations. It was two bedroom and they were clean but very old. Phone lines and cable lines coming from the vents because it still has the older style plastered walls. The location is great though and I was basically just sleeping there anyway. Single men is about the only group I would recommend this establishment to.

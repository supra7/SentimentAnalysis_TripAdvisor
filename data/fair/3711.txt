The Peabody is a comfortable property that clearly focuses on customer service. Its staff at the front desk, concierge, housekeeping, and particularly in the restaurants are extremely attentive, well trained, well informed, courteous, and helpful. The level of service is very close to what one would expect at a Ritz-Carlton or other similar, much more expensive hotel. The ancillary charges, including internet and gym access, are reasonable. UNFORTUNATELY, the hotel has inexplicably not applied the same level of quality to its parking service. The hotel has no self-parking facilities (it is currently beginning a massive expansion project, so the former parking lot is now a construction zone), and it has outsourced its valet parking service to an incompetent vendor. On three nights, I waited up to a half hour for my car. The valet parking phone line went unanswered on night, and on an other night I was unceremoniously told that they were "too busy" to take my car request at the moment. Then, when I was checking out, THEY LOST MY CAR KEYS! The parking manager offered to provide a taxi to take me to the airport and said he would return my rental car to the agency; as I was about to get into the taxi, one of the valets found my keys lying around somewhere. As if to rub salt into the wound, I discovered afterwards that they had overcharged me for parking -- the expected $120 (outrageously overpriced at $20 a night), plus an additional $60 for 3 of the same nights. If you drive, stay (or at least park) elsewhere. Then you might be able to enjoy your stay at this very nice hotel. Mine was ruined by all the aggravation with the car.

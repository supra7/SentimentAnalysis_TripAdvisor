Overall not very impressed with this hotel, room 701 is an accessible room which we were made aware of at the time of booking however it's either haunted or needs a maintenance overhaul! The door bell kept randomly going off at all hours and as the room is accessible this meant the bell was extra large with flashing lights! This woke us at least 4 times during the two night stay. In addition drainage was poor and a short shower would flood the entire bathroom and spill out onto the hall carpet which to avoid meant using the towels at the bathroom door as a barrier! Breakfast was very busy both mornings and not enough seating for guests. Finally beware of the dry cleaning service, I checked a shirt and trousers totalling $16.50 according to the slip in the room, when collecting the cost doubled to $33 and the slip I had completed wad not attached to my cleaning but a totally new one with very different prices! It took a while but I did get the receptionist to agree to amend the bill eventually! Overall poor hotel but good location.

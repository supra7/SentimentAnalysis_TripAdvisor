This particular Hyatt offers a buffet breakfast that is an ideal setting, but for the price the overall offerings were fairly mediocre, and the large dining room, which has a spectacular view, was marred by the obvious lack of basic maintenance (major chipped paint on the metal railing between the food area and the dining floor, clearly visible and obviously old 'dings' on the large wooden doors that open toward the ocean, and other signs of wear and tear that just don't jibe with the Hyatt Regency standards we've come to expect).

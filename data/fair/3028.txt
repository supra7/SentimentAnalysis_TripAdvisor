We checked in today after booking direct a couple of months ago. Very specifically told them on numerous occasions that we were coming for our 25th anniversary. Was told that there would be a welcoming gift (Wow, a free Westin grocery tote bag!). And guess what? A beautiful 2nd floor room overlooking the parking lot! Can't wait to see what the rest of the week reveals.

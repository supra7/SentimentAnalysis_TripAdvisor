Nice clean place. Best fitness facility I've come across in a long time. Huge comfy chair w/ footstool - all furniture and room in great condition. My issues were no fridge in room, Poor coffee pot, no breakfast passes to the restaurant, nothing special for long time priority club member, and expensive. I stayed for 3 nights, these little things add up. Plus, I had stayed at a Staybridge in Syracuse the week prior, so maybe my expectations were raised? Will miss the gym next time I stay in The Windy City, but not this hotel.

My wife and I stayed here in 99 and we were very impressed-then! I probably will not go back even though they are in a great location next to whalers village etc. We are starwood plus preferred but the best they could give us was a parking lot view with a lanai balcony that had left over beer cans on the table. There were several different bugs in the room and as I left the room on the second morning I found a HUGE cockroach scampering outside my door. Forget getting a pool chair unless you are up at 5:30 am. The cleanliness of the room was extremely bad with hair on top of the toilet seat cover and generally outdated dirty rooms. I will probably stay at the Hyatt and just pay instead of using my starwood points on this place.

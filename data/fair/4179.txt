We used Priceline to book this hotel and since our rate was about 40% off the regular rate I didn't feel the need to complain. However, this was the worst Red Lion I have stayed in. It was run down and dirty. The room reminded me of a budget motel. The Priceline star level was 3 star upscale and frankly I found it to be a 1 or at best a 2. Needless to say, we were dissapointed. complained to Priceline about the star rating but as I said, did not feel the need to say anything to the hotel. I just feel bad for those people who spend $120 plus dollars there.

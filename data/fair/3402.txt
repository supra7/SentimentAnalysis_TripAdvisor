This is my first review on "Trip Advisor", because I feel so strongly that other travelers should not stay at this hotel. While the location is wonderful, there are several other hotels in the surrounding area that are much better (we could have stayed at the Waldorf - one block north-for $80 more for the night). The room appeared on the surface to be relatively clean; however, when you really examined areas, you could see major dust. For instance, the bathroom door had so much dust on it, that I had to wipe it down twice. The bedspreads looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a very long time, and I just wondered about the bed linens. I am on the road approximately 80-90 nights per year, and only one other hotel has come closer to making me think that there were multiple live organisms in the room. While the staff was friendly, if you are concerned about BASIC cleanliness, do not stay here.

This trendy hotel is probably best in the lobby. Muted tones and great bar present a good first impression. But the rooms are a major disappontment. I had a suite over the Thanksgiving weekend and it was not worth the cost. The bathroom was so small, I had to leave my shaving kit outside, there was no place to put any of my personal items. The room had no place to put my clothes, a drawer was no where to be found. The view fromthe corner suite was outstanding until it was tainted by the sight of my clothes piled on the window sills so I didn't have to contstantly dig in my suitcase.

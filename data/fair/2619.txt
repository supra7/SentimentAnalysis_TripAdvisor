The hotel is beautiful, the restaurant is great but customer service is lacking to the point where it ruined my stay. The first night they left me 3 towels, I called and after 2 more calls and 25 minutes had passed a housekeeper came by with more towels. The second night they had left us with only 2 towels and it took an hour and 30 minutes plus 6 phone calls before someone came. The concierge got involved went and personally picked up the towels and gave them to valet attendant to bring to our room. We were part of a chess team and the school had provided them with the tax exemption but we were still charged for it. I spent 30 fruitless minutes with the checkout person trying to explain that but he was incapable of doing simple math, finally I gave up and left. Its a shame that this ruined our experience with the hotel as it is a very aesthethically pleasing hotel and the gym rivals the finest gyms that you can go to.

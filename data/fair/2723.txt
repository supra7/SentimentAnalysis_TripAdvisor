The location of the Hotel was perfect! Right on Fremont Street only a block or so from The Fremont Experience but we could not get away from the Cigarette smell! We were in a Non-Smoking Room but it didnt matter it smelled very strongly of Cigarettes! I can handle to smoke in the Casino but in a Non-Smoking Room, I just did not expect it to be so bad! Also, the AC was not working! Customer Service Desk did send someone out to look at it but did not help! Had it set at lowest temp but was probably 85+ in there all night! I suggest to anyone who stays here, non smokers especially, to ask for a room that is detatched from the Casio! Also I think they should keep a few Fans on hand for just in that case! Im not sure I would stay here again! Definately NOT for kids! We also booked a room with a King size bed but only got a Queen! Rooms definately smaller then they look in the pictures online!!!! No Fridge or Microwave or even a desk to sit with a computer!

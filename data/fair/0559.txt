I arrived at the hotel around 1 a.m. and I was surprised from the beginning. The pictures that the hotel has up on its website make it seem very spacious, but it is quite the opposite. The room I had was also much bigger online than in real person. Normally when I stay at a hotel I have received internet for free, but not here. Almost 20 dollars a day to rent their internet, when the restaraunt connected to it has free internet. I forgot to mention how small the restrooms were. I could litterally wash my hands and start the bath while sitting on the toilet. I would have to say there was one good thing, which was the bed. I was the most comfortable bed I have slept in in years, but it wasn't worth the price.

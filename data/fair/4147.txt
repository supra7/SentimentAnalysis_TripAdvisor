There is a cleaning fee if you smoke in your room.. the fee is $250.00, the hotel has mis-understood a recent law in Washington state banning smoking. The law does NOT apply to hotel room's and a $250.00 cleaning fee is rediculous. All hotel's should accomodate ALL guest type's and not be in the UN-hospitality business but the hospitality industry.

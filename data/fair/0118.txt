I just stayed there for 3 nights on a business trip. I will not be staying there again. The walls are not sound-proofed at all, so you can hear every little sound in neighboring rooms. I had an extremely noisy couple in the room next to me who kept me up until 4 am when I had to get up at 6 am for my work obligations. The bathroom floor and tub were moldy. My company paid for my stay in full ahead of time, about $400. I gave them my credit card up front for incidentals, and they put a $1600 hold on it and attempted to charge me for $800. Luckily, my credit card company alerted me to the unusual transaction. When I called the hotel to ask for the charges, they stated that they only did an $800 hold, which is still a lot for a stay already paid in full. It took a while to remove the $1600 hold. Luckily, my credit card company called me. Otherwise, I would have been mistakenly charged $800 of that $1600 hold.

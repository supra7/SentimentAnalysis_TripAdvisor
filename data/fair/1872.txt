Old, dirty, smelly hotel in downtown Dallas. Hotel needs to be torn down. I have had Motel 6 do a better job in hotel management. One day, a housekeeper barged into the room while I was changing, without knocking. She aploogized profusely as she left, but I felt I had to call the manager to let hem know just in case the story was not the same from her. He offered nothing short of another apology; not even a note to follow-up or a follow-up after he talked to housekeeping. Decent free breakfast every day. Although it is every day, happy hour is only an hour and beverage choices are minimal.

I am paying $$$ for a hotel room that does not have a Minibar or cable premium channels or On Demand. The price does not include internet and the speed reminds me of dial-up. The star rating is deceitful. I would give it 2 or 3 stars I would stay here again only if I were paying Holiday Inn Express prices Avoid it

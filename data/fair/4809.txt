I stayed here Oct 16-18, paid $400 a night for a "premium" room, and I could only wish I could get my money back. Friday morning at 4am the large loud truck arrived outside my room (I was on the 4th floor). It was setting up the tents, with all the clanking and banging of the metal poles that entails, for the Farmer's market that surrounds the hotel for the weekend. Then there's the unloading of all the fruits and veggies. Oh yay! That also happens on Saturday morning but not until 5am, so you can sleep in. The noise does not stop! I asked for 2 queen beds since I was rooming with a friend and got a king. The front desk said I could RENT a roll a way bed! I guess the $400 a night wasn't enough. The room itself was nice and the decor comfortable and modern. You couldn't turn the TV volume all the way down. I've had better TV at Holiday Inn. The bed was a little lumpy. The bathroom was also nice, but small. The towels were rough and small. Just a side note: I had a FedEx package delivered to the front desk. They insisted it was never delivered. After calling FedEx and getting the name of the person who signed for it, did they actually look for it.... and they finally found it. For such a small hotel, that should not have happened. The best part of the Hotel was the location. It's close to just about everything. The worst part of the Hotel was the location. The noise was unbearable. I stay in about 5 to 10 high end hotels a month and this is probably the worst experience concerning the noise I've ever had. I would not recommend this hotel.

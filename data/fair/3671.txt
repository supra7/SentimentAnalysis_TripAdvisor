We were so disappointed from the moment we arrived. It took us 20 minutes to register. They put us in a smoking cubicle (I can't call it a room. One inch smaller and we could have sued for cruel and unusual punishment) even though we would never have booked a smoking room. The bathroom barely fit one person and you had to achieve contortionist proportions to reach the toilet paper. No one ever answered the concierge or main desk phone any time we tried. The only bright spot is comfortalbe and visually interesting bar downstairs and the music CD which they have available to listen to in the room although CD has remained the same for over 1 1/2 years. Toiletries stink -- they make you buy them instead of offering them for free. All in all not anywhere worth the price.

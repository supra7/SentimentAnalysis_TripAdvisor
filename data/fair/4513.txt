I flew from Bangkok to Dubai and it is about 11 pm there but we didn't get the room. Because the room is not finished cleaning yet but they should prepare for us before we check-in. They said the guests that stayed in our room won't get out before the check-out time. We got a room when it was already half past midnight. Since we entered the room, the bathroom amenties weren't ready. They were no shampoos, shower gel and even towel for shower. We told the housekeeping so they refilled SOME for us. The next day when we came back from trip. The amenties are still not ready! The towels are still only one. But I like the hotel's breakfast very much.

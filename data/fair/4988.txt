I stayed here for 10 nights recently. The positives great location in the centre of Madrid. On the negative side. My legs are full of red marks from being awaken scratching the skin off my legs. The bedding is extremely old and needs cleaning/updating. I went to the supermarket and sprayed all the bedding but it didnt seem to help much. Also the security for me was not good. The keys as mentioned in other reviews are old fashioned and need to be left at the reception and you tell them the room number when you come back to the hotel. The problem is that they give you any key without checking your name or questioning you. This for me is a big defect as the give you whatever key you ask for without any problem.

Greatly disappointed in this small hotel. Compared with other small, boutique hotels in the city (specifically the Kimpton Brand Hotels), this hotel fell far short. The level of service was mediocre. The front desk was the biggest problem--highly unprofessional. Nobody offered luggage assistance, the concierge was never to be seen. We asked for directions and they were all wrong, twice. The first time, the front desk clerk didn't even know their street ends one block from the hotel (he seemed to pretend to be looking at a map). The second time we checked a map to confirm the written directions (we're not fools) and again found they were wrong. We gladly would have traded the cookies for a second bar of soap. It took so long to get a second bar of soap to the room, we just shared the one between the sink and the shower (also not thrilled that the sink/vanity is in the bed area and not the bathroom). All the trappings, little substance.

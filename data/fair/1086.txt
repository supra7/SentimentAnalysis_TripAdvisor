It looks impressive, but it is not from the inside. There is nothing to do there, close to the mall but not more than that. Service was bad as we didn't have the spare bed for the bay when arrived at 10pm didn't have electricity to use the hob and it took them a long time to fix it everything there is too expensive for NO reason Didn't like it - only liked the beds and bath - high quality!

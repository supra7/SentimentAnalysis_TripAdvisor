Having stayed at the W Montreal last year and loved it, we were excited to be staying at one of its counterparts in NYC. The lobby was large and typically funky (although there were no 'greeters' and no one offering free bottled water like they were when we checked into the W Montreal), but the room was a major disappointment. We'd booked a 'Spectacular' room on one of the upper floors, which was really stretching the definition of the word. A bed (not a big one by US standards), a small desk, chair, a TV and a bathroom - that was pretty much it, and the decor didn't even feel particularly modern as you'd expect from the W chain. And then there was the connecting door to the room next door, which meant that we could hear the TV/conversations/snoring from our (unknown) neighbours, which was especially annoying when the latest occupants (who were thankfully only staying for one night) arrived back at 4am on Saturday night and started shouting and partying with no concern for any other guests. The maid service was not great - we used both disposable and normal glasses for water on the first night/day and these were never replaced. The plus points: we ate breakfast one morning in the hotel's restaurant, Heartbeat, which was delicious - and the staff on the reception and concierge desks were unfailing helpful and friendly (although isn't a concierge meant to help you get theatre tickets? Ours just told us where to queue for the TKTS booth!). The hotel location was pretty good too - a short walk to Central Park in one direction and to the Rockefeller Plaza in the other. It was also useful to have an iron & ironing board in the room. Would definitely never stay at this hotel again and I'll be doing some serious research before spending my money with the W chain in the future. Hopefully this W is not representative of the overall brand and the W Montreal is more like the way their hotels are meant to be...

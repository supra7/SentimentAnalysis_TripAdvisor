Compared to other Hiltons (or hotels in general), the Palmer house has the tiniest rooms I have ever seen. After 2 room swaps because I keep thinking there must be bigger rooms, I gave up and just settled in. The lobby is beautiful but I'm not living in the lobby. The walls at the hotel are paper thin and you can easily hear outside conversations in the hallway. Housekeeping is poor as I found leftover food from previous guests on my foot after walking barefoot. If you have to stay here for the location, make sure you ask for a room that faces away from the train. Hotel was understaffed as well on a busy Chicago weekend so don't expect high quality services. Overall, the Palmer House did not meet the standards and quality of a Hilton hotel.

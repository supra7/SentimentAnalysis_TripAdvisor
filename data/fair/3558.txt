This hotel used to be so nice! Wow, this was a bad experience. I booked a room at the W on Valentine's Day. First, I was supposed to have a large room with a queen size bed - instead I have a tiny, dark room facing the wall of another building. There is a sticker on the wall saying "Is the room too small? Call this number for 500 starwood points." I didn't want starwood points, I wanted a large room! Anyway - next problem - the bathroom was FILTHY. The floor tiles were brown with dirt and the grout was moldy. The shower didn't drain properly, and as a result, there was a puddle of dirty water remaining from the previous guest on the shower floor. And, the glasses were dirty and looked like they had not been washed properly. GROSS!! Well, finally, after all that I decided to go downstairs for breakfast. What a disaster - the hostess was confused, not a single table was clean and ready for customers, and the food took almost an hour to arrive. In the meantime, nobody came to apologize or explain where our food was. It was just dropped in front of us like a sack of potatos.

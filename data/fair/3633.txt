For an upscale brand in the world's finest city, this hotel was absolutely not up to par. Starwood management has given up on this one and that mentality has spread to the staff. Bad news first: - Lack of doormen, bellhops upon arrival at 11P. - My non-smoking room smelled strongly of smoke. - Cramped rooms. Little natural light. Very tight lightwell. - Old furniture and fixtures. TV was from the 80's, furniture was damaged and scuffed, carpets dirty, and there was a random metal mounting bracket on the bathroom wall where it looked like a fixture had fallen off. - Room service very slow and inaccurate. Food was not good. Overcharged me. Good news: - Conveniently located to Midtown businesses. - Lobby is still nice

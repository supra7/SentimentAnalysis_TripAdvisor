I arrived at the hotel tired after a long flight. I just wanted to check-in quickly and rest. But there was a long line to check in. Then it turns out the room wasn't ready (1400hrs). So went out for a coupke of hours walk. The room was medium sized, furnished to an OK standard. Bed was very comfortable but bath room was small and dated. Breakfast was good but expensive. Best thing about the hotel is the location. + Location + Breakfast - rooms not great - Strange entrance via lift to lobby - expected more from a Hyatt

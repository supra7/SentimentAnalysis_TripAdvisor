I found this hotel through tripadvisor, so I was disappointed when so many little things went wrong...the hot tub was not working the first night we arrived, plus we had to get sheets for the pull out bed ourselves. The next morning found us frustrated when one woman made all the waffles she wanted, using up the waffle mix. Upon returning to out hotel room that night, no bath soap was left in the bathroom. The next day we found that our door had not been closing all the way...luckily nothing was taken. For the $159 a night I expected a lot more. Some of the employees were very nice, others just putting in their time, just doing their job...

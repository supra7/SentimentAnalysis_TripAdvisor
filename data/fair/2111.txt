I'm convinced I was in the wrong hotel as the reviews on here are OK in comparison to what we experienced - however they had my reservation at the front desk so I guess this is it. Very shabby and poor. Felt more like a cheap furnished bedsit in the outer areas of London than a hotel. Smells funny and is all around extremely disappointing. Certainly not worth the price. I asked for a room upgrade and was told I'd already had a complementary upgrade!! The room was a queen about you could only just walk around the bed, the TV prevented you from opening the door all the way and the bathroom was boarding school quality. To be fair on the front desk they very politely upgraded me again to a disabled access queen which meant it was at least a normal size (after mentioning that the hotel was 'historic'). It also didn't smell which was a huge improvement. At $250 a night it's a real rip off, I know it was a last minute booking but come on! My partner and I travel quite a bit and we have stayed in some very nice hotels in New York, Paris, South Africa and various other areas of Europe for less than that. To try and leverage it's 'historic' status as a reason for it smelling bad and been in fairly run down condition? Well that's really just bull.

I just came back from Sheraton Maui and was highly disappointed in the quality of the food, for two hamburgers and pina coladas paid $55.00 at the beach barbeque grill. The hamburger I saved to feed to the fish. I complained to the manager and he gave us a free breakfast buffet and that was not much better. The service at the restaurants is extremely slow and I we had to wait to get into our room over half an hour after 3:00 PM after they told us they would call us, I had to go to the front desk just to wait in line all over again . i have stayed at several of resorts on this beach and never experienced this service problem or quality of food on top of the food being very expensive. Our room was nice and big with balcony and flat screen tv. The resort fee was $18.00 per night and you got a paper and parking, that was a big high especially for people who were on a buget (I was not, but it still seemed high). The beach and the snorkeling were great right outside the hotel at Black Rock. It is a very clean beach and I would highly recommend the snorkeling to everybody. We seen eels, turtles and all kinds of tropical fish including puffers. I would definitely recommend if you stay there do not eat there go to Whalers Village or Lahaina and do not go to the Luau it s expensive and the food was cold and not very tasty, do Old Lahaina Luau. If you snorkel do not spend money on snorkeling boats just rent the snorkels from Boss Frogs which is much cheaper. Overall the experience at the Sheraton did not compare to the experience at the Westin and service was no comparison. I would definitely chose the Westin over the Sheraton anytime even though the rooms are quite small at the Westin our experience at the Westin and other hotels were pleasantly memorable, not at the Sheraton it was a bad hotel experience not enough workers on hand and overly priced food with low quality. I would definitely check around before I stay at the Sheraton.

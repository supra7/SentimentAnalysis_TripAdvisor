I can't believe that this is a four-star hotel--I've had better service from two-star places. This was our one night each year that my husband and I get away just the two of us, and we all we wanted was a place to rest and relax. We got there at 2 hoping to check in early, but we understood that we might have to wait until 4 p.m. for regular check-in. WRONG. They wouldn't check us in until 6 p.m., and even then it was because we told them that our cell phone was out of power so we could no longer wait for them to call us. They gave us a street room instead of the oceanview we paid for, the sheets smelled like sweat, only two people were working front desk during check-in with a sold-out hotel (the line went out the door). The pool was way too small for the number of guests and the size of the hotel. On top of it all, the staff was rude.

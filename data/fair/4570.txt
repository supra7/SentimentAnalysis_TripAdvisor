Stinky old tired hotel. Stayed just for 1 night, thank god. Got a rate at 220 dollars. The room was on the 1st floor, very noisy and near the parking entrance. The room was old and tired and musty/stinky. The paint was peeling off, and the carpet had seen better days. Let's not even talk about the stains on the carpet. The bathroom was old, could tell no renovation done in over 10 years. Felt like a holiday inn at times. At least the bed and bedding was good. The pool is small and crowded and so is the beach. Food service is good, the breakfast buffet is excellent but pricey. This hotel is a total ripoff (even for Hawaii) given the value for money you are getting Would not stay again.

This hotel is very well priced and the rooms are nice and clean. It makes a great impression with a nice and very clean lobby, and the rooms are small but really terrific. However, there is no A/C which means you have to leave the windows open, and it's LOUD. It's nearly as loud with the window shut. I started with a room that faced north towards the next building, a new blue 5 story. The people in that building were INCREDIBLY LOUD. It turns out it's a home for recovering drug addicts. They stay up late and play music and have loud arguments. After 5 nights of that I moved to a room that faced the inner courtyard. It was even noisier because now I was listening to the people and TVs from the 20 other rooms that faced the courtyard. On the bottom floor of the courtyard they rent to people with pets. One night an unattended dog barked all night. Almost no sleep for me. After staying here for weeks, I would say that it only gets quiet enough to sleep at about 1 AM. I had to get up at 6:30 for work, so this was not good. Most nights it was like trying to sleep at a fraternity party. Lots of young people staying up late, talking loudly, laughing and drinking. Personally, I love doing that from time-to-time myself. Just never at a hotel with others who don't want to listen to me. Also, the neighborhood is VERY BAD, and I've lived in Alphabet City in Manhattan. On 2nd and Bell (1 block from the hotel) there are drug dealers on ALL 4 CORNERS all night. There are also prostitutes and drug addicts. I spoke with a beat cop about it, and he was fully aware and strongly suggested I avoid that area at night. Said it was a huge problem and dangerous. He said they are trying to do something about it, but wouldn't elaborate. I'm not trying to bash this hotel. Like I said, it;'s clean and nice. Also the front desk is as helpful as they can be. There is just nothing anyone can do about the drug dealers, bad clientele, and lack of A/C.

I stayed at the Diva for one night in November 2004. It was my third stay there--I stayed there twice in 1998 and was shocked at how depressing the place is now. The change in the ensuing years was palpable: no more continental breakfast brought to your door in the morning, nothing in the "Diva Boudior" except coffee and tea and a sad little vending machine with junk food-y snacks...I was given a room on the seventh floor at the very back. The noice from Geary Street overnight was intolerable. (I was led to wonder who is driving these big rigs in Union Square in the middle of the night??) The bathroom was tiny, with no vanity but two closets??!!...and what has happened to the darling pack of toiletries that I was able to take as a souvenir in 1998? The cable selections on TV are pathetic--and internet access in the room costs $10? (The internet access in the lounges on several floors does not seem to work...) I stayed in SF during the hotel strike. Although I felt good that I did not cross the picket line in order to find accomodations, I would not hesitate to do so if it means a better value and a more uplifting ambience! I would never stay here again. It is not techy or modern, at least not in a fresh and upbeat way. And that $34 dollar parking? Get outta here!

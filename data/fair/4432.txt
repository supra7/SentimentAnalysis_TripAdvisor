It's very disappointing to go to a 4+ star hotel and receive less than the best treatment. When we got to this hotel, we were immediately asked for our car keys by the valet (the only parking offered by the hotel). We told the valet we would be right back after checking in to get our luggage. However, after checking in our car was nowhere to be seen. Later we went to the concierge desk to book tickets to the zoo. No one was there. The reception staff told us to wait and the concierge would be back shortly. After waiting 10 minutes, the reception asked us what we wanted and when told we wanted to book tickets they informed us the concierge would not be back for another 15 minutes. The room was comfortable but the bed was no better than the La Quinta or Comfort Inns we've also stayed at on this trip. and parking was an unreasonable $32 per day. I don't understand why. It it seems consistent that the more you pay for a room the more you are expected to pay for amenities and services like parking and internet.

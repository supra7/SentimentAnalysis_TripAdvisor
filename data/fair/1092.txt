The hotel itself was lovely, however, the freight train which rumbles through 3 times per night between 10 pm and 7 am was most annoying. It appears the hotel was not sound proofed adequately as the noise was so loud it was as if the train was coming through the hotel itself. In addition, the housekeeping service was very unresponsive and did not do a good job of cleaning. The room was disheveled looking each day after they had supposedly "cleaned" the room. Since I did not travel with my laptop this trip, I used the computer in their business center 3 times during my stay. The first time was the only time it worked properly. The remaining 2 occasions it would not send out any email messages even though it didn't have a problem charging my credit card for the use of the computer. Very annoying!! Would I stay there again? Not likely! There are far too many other beautiful hotels without the noise of trains running all night, etc.

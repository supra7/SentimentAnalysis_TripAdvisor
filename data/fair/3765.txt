I stayed at the Extended Stay Deluxe for three nights while attending a conference nearby. Check-in was very easy. The hotel used to be a Sierra Suites and is appealing from the outside with well kept landscaping. The lobby and interior hallways were well kept and the elevator functioned properly. There was a pool but I did not swim. There is a small exercise area with at least a treadmill but I am not sure what other equipment as I only went in to get a bottle of water (the excercise area is also the vending area). The room included a full kitchen with stove, refrigerator, microwave, glasses, silverware, pots, pans, plates, cups and a coffee maker. There is a small desk with a cork board above it, a small couch with coffee table, a tv on a swivel so that you can watch tv from anywhere in the room. The bathroom was ok, not great, not horrible. When I entered the first day there was a heavy smell of air freshener. When I returned the second day the air freshener smell had gone away and there was a heavy pet urine smell. I called down to have them send up some air freshener and they sent someone up right away. I later noticed that the couch was covered in pet hair. Staff was very attentive and went out of their way to ask how my stay was but somebody needs to be able to walk into a room and be able to smell that things are not right before the guest notices a problem. There is a 50's style dinner directly across the street called the "5 & Diner". I had breakfast there two days. The food was good but the service was below average. I also ate at a Mexican restaurant about two blocks away called "AJO Al's". Great atmosphere but the food was suprisingly bland. I paid about $80.00 a night for the ESD and booked it directly over their website. I choose this hotel because the company that was providing the conference recommended it. If I were to return to Phoenix I would probably not stay here again.

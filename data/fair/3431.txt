Though we had reserved a nonsmoking room, and the hotel claimed it was, it smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke. Since I am allergic to smoke, I was very bothered by this. Due to the fact we had a late check in, they had no other rooms to offer us. Of course, the room was loud, due to its proximity to the street, so bring ear plugs!!! The room was large, with a decent size bathroom. Other than the odor, it appeared clean. The lobby is right off the subway entrance to the 96th street station. This makes it convenient, but there is usually a panhandler there in the evenings. The hotel doesn't have much in the way of amenities, but if you are looking for a place to lay your head and are a smoker, this is a decent place to stay. The decor has a motel 6 kind of tackiness to it, but not outdated.

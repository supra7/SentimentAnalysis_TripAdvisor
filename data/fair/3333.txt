The check in was easy and the location was great. When we arrived to the room, we were slightly disappointed. The room was extremely dim, as we had an interior room with no windows. Due to the absent windows, there was no air exchange and the room had an odd odor. Our room also had a cockroach problem. We immediately called the front desk to ask them to take care of our situation, and it took over an hour and 3 phone calls to get anything resolved. The walls are extremely thin - everything, and I mean everything, can be heard between rooms. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you have a fixed budget and won't be spending much time in the room.

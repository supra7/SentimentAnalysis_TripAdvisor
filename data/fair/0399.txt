The Sorrento was on a "best list" over four years ago based on the certificate in the lobby. I can understand why it hasn't been on any lists since and it only has its owners to blame. Broken windows (or ones that don't shut), leaking AC units (if you have one), worn and mismatched furniture. The list goes on. We were in two different suites and most everything needs to be repaired or updated. It looks like a historic luxury hotel in the lobby and exterior but sadly it's crying on the inside for some TLC. The staff was awesome though but I wouldn't stay here again.

Came in for the Zero Coke 400. The staff were pleasant and helpful, especially the restaurant personnel. However, the front desk was slow, the lobby area is in need of a good cleaning including glass doors with 2-day old fingerprints, corners laden with spider webs and crumbs left under tables and chairs. The carpet in the hallway is in need of a thorough cleaning. We had two rooms and neither were what we ordered. The beddings looked clean and crisp but the carpet was dirty, something a good vacuum might have remedied. The walls were cracked, paint peeling, dead spiders attached to the ceiling and the walls in the bathroom were dirty. Used wash cloths were found in the shower and hair was found on the floor. There are hidden fees to which you should be aware regarding the room safe. If you do not ask the front desk to remove the "convenience" fee you will be charged a daily rate. I will never stay at this property again

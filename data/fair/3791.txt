Aside from the water park (and perhaps the golf course - I don't play), the standard of this hotel was of a highway exit Marriott. In other words, it is way overpriced. Room furnishings are getting long in the tooth. I was there with a group of a few hundred for professional conference. A good number of us got charged for min-bar items that we never used. All charges were immediately removed, which makes me suspect this may be standard practice at the hotel (perhaps the guest won't notice?).

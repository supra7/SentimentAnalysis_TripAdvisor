Room #137 (overlooking the parking lot) The hotel came recommended by a co-worker who stayed there "...years ago" (?) (so did the Beatles!) Ah okay....."but you simply MUST stay there if in Seattle!" (they used to provide fishing poles in each room!) Ummm..okay. (which begs the question "...I wonder how many bites #137 got???) It's old, it's dressed up nicely (sorta like your rich aunt Edna) Reservations made from the front desk for the "Six Seven" in-house restaurant didn't materialize (even though it was made from an adjacent room) Our room had a gas fireplace (which unbeknownst to us was the primarily heating source for the room). Off and on throughout the night the sounds of our MD-88 preparing for takeoff blasted in the corner. Generous amounts of hallway, roadway and seaway noise are all included throughout the evening. The Pacific NW black bear country theme was cozy. The bed was very comfortable, with a great selection of pillows. Great cable TV selection and wireless availability. Don't eat the in-room munchies however lazy you get....you can't afford them! A most unusual (spacious and attractive) stone master bath. Fieldstone lined shower and wall-to-wall open stone flooring! Cold, cold (freezing cold if you're over fifty and can't make it through the night without using "the necessary"!.... BEWARE wear your socks!) If you have large amounts of disposable income, stay waterfront (however beware that it's still noisy on the Bay) The most outstanding feature is the Sunday Brunch at the in-house dining room "Six Seven" (as in Pier 67). So what if you can't sleep at night, the food is great ! btw- the soap was pretty good!

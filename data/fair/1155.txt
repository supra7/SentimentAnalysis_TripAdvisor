This was our first visit to Key West, which was very beautiful place. We made lots of great memories with our children. Ate great food, great tours. Would recommend Fury excursions only. Room placement that was requested, when room reservation was placed 3mo in advanced, was not fullfilled. Our room was overlooked and not cleaned 1 day of our stay. Our second night stay our AC stopped working at 4AM, called front office. Voicemail said office closed, and offered no emergency contact or any other numbers to call for help. Food at pool area, not impressed for the cost! Front desk girl, was rude to Elderly guest that was in line in front of me. And he was just asking for directions to his room?

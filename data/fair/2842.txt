Upon entering the Grand Wailea we immediately were impressed with the waterfalls on the drive way. Everything was beautiful. But then we get our room. Its an 8 minute walk from the lobby to the room. The room was run down, chippped paint on the moldings, mold in the shower, carpet was dirty and smelled a bit...it just seemed like any other hotel room. We were in the terrance rooms which face the mountain and if you stood out on the balcony, you could see a good part of the ocean. But damn! This place nickle and dimes! $2.60 for a banana! If I had to do it all over, I would choose a hotel known for nice ROOMS. This place definitely lacked 5 star room quality.

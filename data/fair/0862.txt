The subject line says it all. I've stayed at numerous hotels for business (and personal) reasons and I've never experienced the incredibly excessive addt'l charges like the ones at Hilton Bayfront in San Diego. Here's just the charges I had: Self-parking in a detached parking garage - $21/day, extremely poor, spotty, constantly dropping internet - $13/day, fitness center - $15/use (HHonors is free...how benevolent), beer in the bar - $10/glass, standard movies to rent on the tv - minimum $12/movie, and the most ridiculous of all, plain ol', nothing special breakfast buffet - $25/person. I know the business center charges for all kinds of stuff too, but I didn't use it..I went to Kinko's. If you are made of money, then you'll love this place. The rooms do have a good view and the bathroom was spacious; otherwise there wasn't anything special about this hotel. There is a Starbuck's attached on the outside. There was not a frig in my room - go figure - they would Charge for it anyway. After we found out the money-grubbing, corporate bstrds even charged for the gym, my friends and I started kidding each other about excessive charges..."Oh, you flushed the toilet, $5"..."Oh, you used the phone, $3.75"...."Elevator use charge, free to go up, but down is $3500". While it is a brand new hotel and as nice as any other well-known chain hotel, you should look for a place that doesn't have excessive charges. A good pillow and a pretty view can be found at many places in San Diego - make this one a last resort!!!

Beware room 2008 and vicinity around the fitness center. We arrived late and all seemed to go as planned. Waited around 10 minutes for the shuttle at the airport (probably just missed the previous one). Check-in was painless enough and our room was clean/tidy/modern. At 4:00 am the room's alarm clock went off blaring. With our late arrival didn't think to check it. Then at 5:52 am, before the fitness center was even supposed to be open, some heavy adult male decides to run a half-marathon on the treadmill. Not only was it loud (walls are thin and even thinner when you SHARE A WALL WITH THE FITNESS CENTER) but the vibrations shook the bed and table. Ridiculous that this room is even offered as somewhere as any but a heavily discounted last resort. The clerk in the morning was clearly aware of the problem with this room but offered no further compensation (I can't get the sleep back anyway!) Would have been nice if the reception at night would have also received the memo. Will be following up for sure. Besides the inability for fatigued travellers to get a decent nights' sleep this would have been a nice stay to finish out our 19 day trip. Instead it was the low point of the trip by far. Not impressed and so cannot recommend.

I do not understand what other reviewers on TripAdvisor experienced at The Lenox unless they were mesmerized by a martini at the hotel bar. I paid over $300 for a "Deluxe" room and was given an aged room with furnishings and decor at least 10 years old. While the room was a decent size, there was no mini bar, just an empty old miniscule refrigerator with a dusty ice bucket sitting on top. The wooden desk had nicks and gouges and the vinyl wall paper was in disrepair. A fake, cheap Colonial chandelier didn't compliment the dime store lamps on either side of the bed. I constantly had to squint to read anything. The bathroom had plenty of thick towels, but it was small, dingy, and it dire need of an upgrade and renovation. It would have been rather appropos in 1978. While the location of the Lenox in Back Bay is excellent, there is a plethora of better hotels in this area. The Lobby is small and crowded at all times and both bars are loud and crowded constantly. We came back to the hotel afetr a fine meal at Number 9 Park and wanted a quick nightcap, but were denied entrance to both bars because they were too crowded. Shameful! It is almost criminal with what this hotel charges to what it delivers. I advise you to look elsewhere for a decent hotel experience in Boston

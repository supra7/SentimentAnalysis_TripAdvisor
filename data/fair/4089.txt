We just returned from a weekend at Encore. I have stayed at every five star hotel in Las Vegas and I was very eager to try Encore. Even from before I got there, things went wrong. My girlfriend called the hotel as it was my bday and she wanted to buy a bottle of nice champagne, chcolate covered strawberries, balloons and a birthday cake. They told her they can't create this type of surprise as they have 2000 rooms and it's too hard to do this. I have done and received surprises from/to her at many five star properties and have never received this type of response. I was pissed from the start. When we got to the room, I have to be honest it didn't wow me like a standard room at the Palazzo or the Four Seasons. I stayed in a salon suite at the Wynn before and that was truly amazing and the service was great. The following things were problems in the room the second we got in: The surprise that they wouldnt do The make-up mirror did not illuminate as it is supposed to The shower cap box was empty There was a large stain on the marble counter top from someone's left over drink I asked to be move to a larger room type for our inconveniences. I was not afraid to ask for this as we truly deserved it. Their response was oh we are sold out sorry. Overall, Encore needs to get it together and recreate the promised five star experience. The location is really too far from EVERYTHING. I would stay at the Wynn 1000x over Encore.

Closet sized rooms...good location We stayed here in Sept 2003. The photos are not entirely correct. I thought by viewing the pictures we would be getting a nice comfy victorian room. However, we were given a room the size of my closet, with a horrible view of the next door building's roof top. It was noisy and we couldn't get our room door open. The bathroom was ity bity too. It's an okay place to stay for one night, but if you are planning on making this your vacation hotel for more than that, you might want to look elsewhere. On the plus side, there is a trolly line one block away and it's literally 3 blocks from all the shops in Union Square. Just beware of the small, closet rooms! Oh, and parking is $30 and it's on the next block over. Better unload your stuff before hand, or you will be holding on to your roller suitcase for dear life on the hills!

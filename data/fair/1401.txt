Our room was small. There was 4 of us that stayed here in rooms and my room was the worst. We had the most people in our room ( 4) and our room was the smallest. It was smelly, not enough room to spread our luggage, but it was fairly clean. The accomodations were just Ok...spent very little time there. But the worst thing was the smell outside the hotel...it was sickening. My daughter could not stand to breathe. It was horrible. Will never stay here again.

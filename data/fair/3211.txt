We booked through Orbitz a King or Two Double Room. When we arrived, despite assurances there would be a King room, there was not. As that was not a guarantee, we accepted the room, until we saw it. It was a two star at best. The beds were 30 years old with yellow linens (using the term broadly). There was a nonexistent balcony which overlooked the parking garage. The bathroom was clean but tiny. We were with another couple and all agreed within 5 minutes that we could not stay. We immediately checked out and proceeded to another hotel which was much much much better. I know there must be better rooms in that hotel but you had better reserve the best.

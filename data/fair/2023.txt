We payed $400.00 a night for what they called the deluxe suite. It consisted of two full beds and a bath room. The beds were extremely soft and our backs were in pain every morning. The coffee maker did not work and if it had it would only make one cup. The satelite TV would lock up several times as you were watching a program. The refrigerator/cooler was only a place to store your drinks and you add ice to keep it cold. You could rent movies from the tv which stated movies from 3.95 and up. My wife and I never found one less then 13.99. Had a air in the food from the hotel restaurant. Definitely a place I would not reccommend to anyone.

Hip Hype This was a special birthday trip for my husband and I wanted it to be special, so spent more $$ than I normally would on the hotel. My heart sank when we were shown our Superior King room, which was so cramped. I called the front desk immediately with no answer, so I had to go down there. The clerk said the Superior is bigger than the standard, but they were booked so she couldn't move us until the next day. I settled for it because I didn't want to appear unhappy and spoil it for my husband.The decor was beautiful, silks and soft colors. However, there was no room to put anything, no drawers at bedside, just these weird plastic day-glo orange cubes. No comfortable chairs, either. The bathroom was super tiny - no room to move, no counter space and if you used the sink, everything in the bathroom got splashed. It was just all physically uncomfortable.The Redwood Room (bar) was gorgeous, with very tasty drinks and appetizers. On weekends, only bottle service is served, but hotel guests get priority reservations and can order without bottle service. I won't stay there again, but might pop into the Redwood Room (if they'll let me) for a drink.

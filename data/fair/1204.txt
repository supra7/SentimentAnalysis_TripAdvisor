Having been to HK several times already, we made it a point to stay in the area of Tsim Sha Tsui, Central and Wanchai. This time, due to time restraints, the only available hotel that we were able to book is in the Kwun Tong district. Yes, the Newton Place Hotel is just over a year old...nice facilities for a 3-star hotel but the location is not convenient for tourists. I would not recommend this hotel for those travelling with kids and for those who intend to visit HK for shopping. The hotel is in an industrialized are and is quite far from "civilization". We had to walk 15 minutes from the hotel to the nearest MTR station in Millenium City. If you will go out on a day of sight seeing and shopping, you will definitely feel drained if you are to take the MTR and walk all the way to the hotel. Taxi is good but you will have to bear slight traffic and longer travel time plus it's more expensive. The hotel offers a free coach service to Harbour City but then you have to wait for it to be available since they dont have specific schedule for the free ride. Note that we don't mind walking, in fact, we find it a good form of exercise but the daily to and fro walk from the hotel will really put a strain on any active traveller. Should i go back to HK, i will take my time and plan carefully so I could get booking in the area of Tsim Sha Tsui, Mongkok, Jordan or even hotels on the other side of HK Island would be preferable and convenient.

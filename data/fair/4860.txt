The nickeling and diming happens in units of Five and Ten dollars! First they charge a premium rate and then include practically nothing! The rooms are basically average and small and nothing special. Over-all, this is an experience in tastelessness. The Fairmont name may be a legacy from the mining culture of San Francisco, but there was more to that world than just digging for every dime you could get. How sad.

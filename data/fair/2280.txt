I had what the hotel calls a corner deluxe superior room with a small balcony from which if you craned your neck you could see the harbor. The room itself wasn't bad (had a small sofa) although the bathroom was barely bigger than a phone booth. The staff at the hotel was excellent. At this property Diamonds are offered breakfast in the "Diamond Lounge." The "Diamond Lounge" is a room that is only open for breakfast. It doesn't have any of the normal things you would expect in an executive lounge such as comfortable chairs for relaxing or reading material. The continental breakfast offered is not as good as what you get at your average Hampton Inn. If you want to eat in the restaurant your coupon allows you to have the full buffet for $15.50 plus tax and tip rather than the usual price of $21. I was told the hotel previously offered the full buffet to Diamonds but Hilton corporate told the hotel they were being too generous to their Diamond guests. Although I attempted to chat with the hotel's general manager about their policy toward their Diamond guests, I was unable to get any response.

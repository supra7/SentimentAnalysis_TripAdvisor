Double room there was only one drawer by the bed. Towels had holes in them & were not always replaced with clean ones Could not open the cupboard to hang your clothes up as the doors hit the side of the bed only 4 hangers. Also could not use the safe. Used cups & glasses were not replaced with clean ones.. Bathroom fittings were loose & falling off the wall, shower taps did not work, showers had very slippery surface Did not have rubber mats for their guests. Breakfast buffet very poor with not inviting & healthy choices As for the room service menu they only seemed to have pasta dishes.

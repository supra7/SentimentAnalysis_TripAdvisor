This hotel is a bit shabby and bit out of place for a business traveler. It's quite far off from the road and the nearest MRT (metro) station is a long walk downhill (and back uphill is a very difficult walk if you are in a business attire). The rooms were VERY VERY small and the bathroom were like aircraft lavatories. The setup was little shabby for that price. Not recommended for business traveler. Leisure travelers can try it out.

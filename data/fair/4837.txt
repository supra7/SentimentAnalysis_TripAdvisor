I am writting this from the hotel lobby, having flown in from NZ this morning, we were meant to be checking in at 5.45am but the flight was delayed and didnt arrive untill 6.40am, we had booked early check in as we have the children with us and knew they would be very tired, it is now 9.10am and still no room, my boys are at there wits end, we are all over tired and just want to sleep................. and to be honest looking around the lobby we dont look like the only ones waiting for rooms, This is very very poor service when traveling with children, can not recomend. very sad as we were really looking forward to our Dubai stopover, and we really needed a good rest after leaving the Christchurch earthquakes behind, we are here another 2 days but to be honest this has allready put a dampener on things.

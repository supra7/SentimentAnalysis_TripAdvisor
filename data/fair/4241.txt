My girlfriend decided to suprise me with a 2 night stay down ocean city maryland for my birthday. She got a 1st floor ocean front view right on the beach at this location. Once i first walked in and saw the view i thought it was going to be amazing. The view was outstanding but the room threw it off a little bit. There was blood on the curtains. Im not talking about a lil spot of blood but what looked to be a mass murder on the curtain. There were what looked to be around 15 small .22 caliver bullet holes in the fridge as well. I didnt think about mentioning it to front desk until after we left. I would never stay in a Holiday Inn again after experiencing that.

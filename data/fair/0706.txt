this is a nice hotel...had comfortable beds but the housekeeping is slacking. We were on our last leg of our vacation coming from Vancouver BC. The room they gave us had dried pee all over the toilet seat and dripped all the way on the floor. I complained and they sent housekeeping while we went around Seattle. When we came back it is still dirty, seemed like they just cleaned the floor. Anyway we were so disgusted thinking what kind of things the previous guest did to that room and housekeeping could not thoroughly clean. Finally requested to be put in a new room and that one seemed to be a lot cleaner. Check in was fast, guest service was great except for a certain male receptionist during check out who was smug and unapologetic when I mentioned the problem we had. Would not stay there again.

My wife and I, frequent Las Vegas visitors but new to the Encore, got caught in the front desk "upgrade scam." We were told that for $50 dollars extra we would be upgraded to the "Tower Suites" We were promised a suite with floor to ceiling windows, private entrance, separate pool (this pool is located all the way in the Wynn a long walk in wet bathing suits) Sounded like a great deal so we did it. When we left our room we decided to see what the room we were scheduled to get looked like. You guessed it, the room was exactly the same. It was a suite, with floor to ceiling windows. In other words, they got us. I can't believe Steve Wynn condones this. He seems like such a great guy who really changed the face of Vegas with the opening of the Mirage. We were so pissed at being taken we checked out the next morning and went to another hotel where they know how to treat customers. Front desk manager was overwhelmed with irate customers when we went down to complain. The place is gorgeous but they have a lot to learn about taking advantage of customers.

A very business specifc hotel located some 5 miles from Madrid town with nothing in the local area. If you like tall modern designed buildings then this may appeal, but I think it was over priced and sacrificed cutting edge design for practicality. For example the lighting system has different mood settings but on entering in the room no lights turn on and the controls are hidden away. The bath didn't get any hot water so nobody uses it and the pipes were rusty so the water was brown. Breakfast was excellent though, but not worth 140 a night.

I wanted to like this hotel because of the excellent location and the friendly front desk staff. However, the puported "luxury executive suite" which we booked was probably one of the more depressing hotel rooms that I have stayed in. As protrayed on their website, the room is decorated in brown tones, which is not necessarily bad but in our case was actually dark, drab, shabby, and appeared to be decorated with a mindset towards hiding dirt rather than being appealing. The furnishings in both the living area and bathoom are very cheaply made. It was a very depressing room to come "home" to or spend extended time in. BTW also, the internet service is very slow.

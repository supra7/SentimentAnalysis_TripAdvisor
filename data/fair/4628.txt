Okay for the price, but with problems This hotel was okay in all, although the room that I was in had some kind of parasites that bit me in 15 times. There were also bugs in the bathroom and bed. You can see the bugs crawl around in the bathroom all around the place. This hotel could have been a little better with being clean.

we didn't, we were charged 85.00 for each of the two nights which we had booked previously on the internet. The first room we were given had a screen outside the window, blocking out any view, so we asked to move. The next room we were given we were told would be noisy, but there was nothing else available. We paid an extra 10 to check in early and then had to carry our cases up the third flight of stairs as the lift was broken. The room was small and austere, stripped of all but the essentials, the mattress was thin, pillows thin and compressed. It was certainly not value for money. By 10.00pm we had had enough and walked down to the Novatel where we got a great deal with breakfast included for the two nights. Would I book again - even at 19.00 I think I would hesitate. Must just mention the staff, the receptionist who dealt with our departure was very helpful and understanding and was very aware of the shortcomings.

In general hotel was nice and clean, rooms are big and well apointed. The biggest problem is a customer service. It took us 3 hours to check in (after the advertised check in time). As it was mentioned in previous reviews, they promise to call you shortly as soon as the room is ready, which never happens. Only after going through several layers of management, listening to the explanation like " should you folks opt for the smocking room instead you would be accomodated right away" (our foult we don't smoke) we've got our room eventually. Then it took another hour and a half and several telephone calls to get the luggage from the bell desk. Overall - nice start. The following day we didn't get room service at all. The instruction was to push service button on a side of the entrance door. We did so 3 times during the day - nothing happened. When I call houskeepers around 7pm they told me that it was all my foult since I should call them to inform when we are leaving the room. Most people don't have this problems even in 1 star roadside motel. The best dining in Encore/ Wynn is buffet. Decent price for decent food. We tried 3 so called "fine dining" restaurants - it was a joke. Don't waist your money there - you'll get buffet left overs, supposangly prepared by famous shefs, unprofessional, basic service and pay for this dearly.

I see that others who have stayed recently had the same issues that we did - overcrowded areas, rude staff, overpriced food and beverages and small, outdated rooms. For our 5 year anniversary, my husband and I went to Maui, where we got married 5 years ago, and then came back for our one year anniversary. The hotel seems to have stagnated over the past few years with no updates or upgrades and the experience was NOTHING that I have experienced from other Starwood Properties. I got a package deal from Starwood for $795 for 5 nights, which is a great deal for anywhere on the island. But, we would have paid more to stay in a calm, romantic environment. Or at least one with a staff that was not rude. Our 6 year old neice was part of our group and when she went to get a lei (they were out hanging to be easily placed on arriving guests - but not us) one of the people in the lobby (bell boy? valet? who knows..) yelled at her. It was totally embarrasing. The woman that checked us in was so unpleasant and placed us in a double room "as I requested". At no time did I request this, and when I told her we were there on our anniversary, she said "good for you - but you requested 2 beds". Really? that is how we are treated as Starwood gold members? At least someone came to put the beds together that night. But the headboards were not moved, so there was this huge gap and the pillows fell between the wall and the bed within 5 minutes. I could go on, but the other reviews seem to cover everything. I will say that our last night in Maui we ended up staying an extra night, so we checked into the Hyatt. From the moment we got there and proceeded to the front desk, we looked at each other with that look - we instantly knew we should have been here the entire stay. The room was georgous, the staff delightful and attentive, and check out was even a breeze. Next time, it's the Hyatt. Sorry Starwood - you lost a customer here.

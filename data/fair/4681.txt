We suspect we both got mold sickness from the AC unit in our room. We asked the maid and the front desk manager to check the AC in our room, but no one ever did! My husband has been very ill for several weeks now. He has been to the ER twice lately for severe shortness of breath. The hotel manager denied this has been a problem, but our research showed that airborne mold sickness has been a real problem both in Oahu and Maui. We both were so sick, we were barely able to get back home!

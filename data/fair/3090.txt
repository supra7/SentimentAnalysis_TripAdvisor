This property is very beautiful...but not up to Westin standards. I asked for extra towels and had to call twice and waited an hour and a half for them to arrive. The last night of my stay was spent listening to the ceiling leaking in the bathroom and the noisy college kids having a party two floors above me. By the time I checked out, my entire bathroom was dripping with water. You should be aware that the property is very busy and crowded...not a place for quiet relaxation.

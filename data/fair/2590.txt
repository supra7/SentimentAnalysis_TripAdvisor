I recently stayed in the Dallas Sheraton for three nights. I was told nice things about the hotel and was really looking forward to my stay. My stay was completely disappointing. My room was in the South Tower (2206) was the room left so much to be desired. The furnishings were a throwback to the early 1980s and have obviously been in the room since then. The bed linens were decent as was the mattress, however the dust ruffle was various stains all around that greatly resembled feces. It made me wonder how clean the sheets really were. The bathroom was a complete disaster. It was obviously remodeled, but, it was not done intelligently. The countertop was over done and extended into the shower which prevented the shower curtain from closing properly. It was generally uncomfortable to shower in there due to the poor design combined with the horrible shower head and the lack of hot water. The room service food was lackluster and was more expensive than most comparable hotels. The service time was decent, however the order taker was rude and did not seem to listen. The bed pillows are old, uncomfortable and one of them smelled horrible. Time for new pillows! The front desk staff was nice, however, they did not even attempt to correct my dissatisfaction. I could feel them rolling thier eyes when I walked away after bringing up the lack of hot water and the miserable shower. The only compliment I can deliver is the valet staff. They were polite, respectful and very attentive. Talking with the valet staff would have to be the highlight of the stay there. (although at $29.00 a night, I would recommend self parking). All in all, I think a room at a motel likely would have been more convenient and comfortable. I think that the staff should have been much more attentive to my concerns. As a frequent traveler, I was utterly disappointed.

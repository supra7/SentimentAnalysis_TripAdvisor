If we had known that the extension was going on, we would have NOT stayed here! During the first night, we was placed in a small room, which could not acomadate 5 of us. We were moved asap, to another room, which seemed ok. At 7am the next day, we was awoken by the drilling, which lasted till 1pm. It was also hosting a convention, so the hotel was full of noise. I would come back AFTER the work has been completed!

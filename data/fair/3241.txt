My husband and I stayed here on 10/02/2009, we prepaid(Waldorf Astoria official site) ahead of time for " a deluxe Queen Room". There was a shower only in this room. Welcoming phone call from the hotel personnel asked us what we thought about the room. We complained the room with a shower only should not be categorized as a deluxe room. She said she would give us one free in room movie to make us happy !!! We watched some war movie and the next day, we were charged for the movie !!! We prepaid well in advance, but Waldorf official site reduced the rate 3 weeks before we arrived, AND ONCE MORE again 1 week prior to our check in. Hotel told us they would not give us any difference nor they can see what Waldorf Official site was offering !!!! ADVISE---Book this hotel through Orbitz, or 800 Hotels.com as they guarantee the lowest rate even if the price go down. This hotel just opened less than 3 months ago, and our in-room SAFE did not work but two very nice technicians came and fixed it after one hour. The best thing about this Hotel--A BIG SLEEK LOOKING PLASMA TV ! That was all. I could have stayed home for that !

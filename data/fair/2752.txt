The place is still OK but from our stay last year, you can tell it is being neglected. It wasn't as clean, someone had smoked in the non smoking room. It needed repairs and just is looking run down. On a positive side the help is very friendly and helpful and it is close to the strip. Didn't seem to be as many homeless people hanging around this year either. Still OK for a one night stay I guess and I would still recommend it, at least for now, but it does need some work.

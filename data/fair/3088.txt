This hotel did not live up to the Westin name. It is aging and noisy. Don't let them give you a "mountain view" room, they are really just parking lot view rooms. We asked to move and were told we would have to pay a stiff fee per night. The air conditioning did not work and took two phone calls to get it to blow cold air into the bathroom. The rest of the room never did get comfortably cool and we couldn't open the balcony door as the horns, sirens, and traffic from outside would keep us awake. The bathrooms are old with inadequate ventilation. We consistently had to ask for more towels, the quality of which was very inconsistent. The walls are thin and walking down the hall you can easily hear all the conversations in the rooms. The elevators are old and slow and there are not enough to serve all the rooms adequately. They now include the $20/day charge for guests to use the work out room, internet and pool, but spa classes are extra and the business center charges an high fee per minute for computer time if you choose not to bring your own on a beach vacation. The hotel goes out of its way to be family friendly, which is great if you have kids, and somewhat annoying if you are there are a romatic getaway. The lobby is open with real pink flamingos, fish and other birds. It's fun, but a little loud and busy. They have different local artisans set up each day. On the plus side, the beds are very comfortable, although we had to ask for more than the four small pillows on our king sized bed. The adult pool is a very nice touch - quiet with a bar and a hot tub. It has happy hour prices from 8-10 that are affordable. The location is great and the beach is steps away. The spa is very well done.

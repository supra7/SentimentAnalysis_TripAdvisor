My girlfriend and I were staying in NYC for my best friends wedding. First the good stuff. The hotel is in a good location if you are looking for a weekend in the Lower East Side. Loads of great bars (try the Double Crown) and great restaurants (Eight Mile Creek) Now for the not so great stuff. We checked in at 6.30pm after flying in from London only to be told the room wasn't ready despite calling a week before and asking that everything was okay. We were offered a free drink at the bar, but really all I wanted was a shower before we went out! We were then shown our room and whilst it was clean and tidy, it stank of cigarette smoke. After more complaining the hotel eventually agreed to move us to another room. Now for the critical stuff. We've stayed in NYC at loads of hotels previously and whilst this one was in a great place, it lacked any sense of charm. It's very cool, but very cold. The rooms were very small even by NYC standards and more could be had for the same money, (try Soho House or The Crosby) with exceptional service in comparison. At Thompson LES we called for room service on the Sunday only to be told that the menu was very limited as it was a Sunday. This would be fine in a rural hotel in Spain, but not in NYC! To end on a good note the bar on the 12th floor was good fun - loads of very cool people and the views uptown were great. Beyond that, not much to say really...there are of course loads of good bars in NY so don't let this tempt you.

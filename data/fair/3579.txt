Rooms are tiny, with very small windows and very expensive for what you get. The location is great, and the atmosphere is really loud, bar like if thats what you're after. In short, good for a nice spot to crash and shower, but not much else. If thats what you're after then you may as well get somewhere far cheaper. Asked for a large bottle of sparkling water and was told to go around the corner to a store. Given the concept of W hotels is to fulfill your wishes I didnt think the service was great at all! Won't be back to a W.

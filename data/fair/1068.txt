I really wanted to like this hotel and make it our 'favorite' as we travel to Vegas often. However, after three separate visits and issues with housekeeping each time, we have decided to try the Wynn in future. Here's a brief summary: 1st visit: Snot on the pillows. I could see dark marks through the pillowcases. When I pulled them off to investigate there were large mucous stains on both sides. Housekeeping could not fail to see them but figured I wouldn't and put the pillowcases on anyway. 2nd visit: Loved the idea of a kitchenette, just not a dirty one and what are two people going to do with one glass and one fork? 3rd visit: Contents of bedside table: Torn condom wrapper, 3 more unopened ones, empty gum package, used chapstick and used food wrapper. So as nice as the wonderful and friendly customer service is (valets, front desk), what good is that if you cannot enjoy a clean room? 3rd times a charm and we won't be back nor will we recommend the Trump Las Vegas.

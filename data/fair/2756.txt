-This hotel is very basic and definitely suits the budget. - Its about a good 10min walk off the strip to Bally's. -Rooms were small but well air conditioned. -Beds were not that comfortable, halls smelt very muggy and musty and not well lit. - No continental breakfast had a hot beverage dispenser but that was it. - Good free airport shuttle which is very helpful but BOOK night before. - Cabs will not pick you up there they are all on the strip but its about a 5$ cab ride from Bally to Super 8. -Front desk was rude and not that helpful except for the odd person..depends on the time of day. -Room keys never worked always had to get them re programed every time we got back. and were locked out from the pool. -Pool was refreshing after a long hot day but it was small and had a terrible location. -taps in shower were confusing and backwards. - 7-11 is close by and great to run and pick up a quick breakfast or coffee. Overall its great on a tight buget and when you are not spending a whole lot of time at the hotel. However Im not sure if we'd stay there again because I would rather stay on the strip and spend the money for the quality.

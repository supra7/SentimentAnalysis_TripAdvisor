We stayed here for 5 nights on our honeymoon. The in-room "free" internet access didn't work and took 4 hours for them to finally figure it out and fix it. Otherwise the pools are okay but not amazing and dispite it being the low season, they were crowded and hard to find a spot to lounge. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were what we expected. The grounds looked nice and the amenities of a large hotel are convenient but the charge well for those conveniences. Overall it was not even close to being worth the price. All our other hotels and B&Bs we stayed at during our 2 week stay were nicer in their own ways and definately worth their price. The Westin Maui is not worth the $300 a night price. Plus they charge you a mandatory resort fee.

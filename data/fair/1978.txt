We booked this hotel based on reviews and price (this also was a last minute vacation so we were trying to quickly find a good hotel in short amount of time). Location was good theoretically, in walking distance to Old Montreal, subway station and St Catherine Street. However, the immediate area seemed dingy. It wasnt far to walk to St Catherine Street but then you really have to walk a fair bit to get to the part of the street with all the shops and cafes/restaurants. Our room overlooked Rene-Levesque St and the view was of China town entrance and a dirty carpark (many random people hung out in that carpark at various times of the day and night. My partner was looking out the window one day and noticed a guy peeing on a parked car... lovely). We saw nicer areas towards the other end of town (which also were within good distance to Old Montreal and St Catherine street and public transport). Hotel seemed like it was nice but basic, good for those on a budget. Unfortunately, the major downside for me was that the rooms were so dark (dark paint, poor lighting). One light near the door good for getting in and out of the room only, one main light over the table (but the light barely extended to the bed) and one bedside table lamp. The light in the bathroom was much brighter than in the main room. Bedside lamp only provided enough light for that side of the bed. I understand that it gives the room atmosphere but it was so impractical and just plain annoying. The reception staff will get an extra lamp delivered to the room if asked (and it seemed like a common request from their reaction when I asked). Other than that, room was satisfactory, clean and comfortable enough, the bathroom was modern (but small and not enough room to store your toiletries on the washbasin without constantly knocking them off), also has a mini kitchenette.

We just returned from a weekend stay for my husband's birthday. Don't let the pictures fool you, it is definitely not a lodge, it is just a glorified motel. We chose NVL because it received the best reviews. The staff was very pleasant on the phone and in person until we were checking out and wanted them to be aware of some problems we had. Yes, the bathrooms are nice, but no tubs...just showers. And since you can't relax in your tub you would expect you would do that in the hot tub. No, the hot tub was out of order. When I mentioned to Elisabeth that we should have at least been told that the hot tub was not working and that is when she informed me they are not telling anyone because the part has been ordered for two weeks and should be getting it anytime. Point taken, but when you come someplace thinking you will get to use amenities you normally don't use at home, you should be made aware of it. We had problems with the internet all weekend long. They had to reset the router numerous times and send cords to our room to hook-up that didn't fit. The pictures of the rooms show couches and nice furniture, whereas the rooms actually have no couches and wicker chairs and a bakers room for a desk. Finally, when we were checking out you have the option to checkout using your television...that also, was not working. The breakfast was nice for a continental breakfast and the location was great. Would we stay here again, no! The room was decent, but for what we paid, we expected a whole lot more.

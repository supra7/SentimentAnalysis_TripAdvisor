There are two good things about this hotel: the location and the free parking. Otherwise, it is just not worth it to stay here to save a few bucks. The hallways smell. Our room was very small and dark. The mattresses were not very thick and the sheets kept coming off of them during the night. The place just seems very run-down. There was some peeling paint in the room and in the pool area. The place just seemed to give the impression that the owners don't really care about making it look nice for the guests. We really regretted staying here and wished we'd spent a little extra money to stay somewhere nicer.

I stayed at the Dunes Manor with my family. It was one of the worst experiences ever. The hotel staff was absolutely rude! There was no one to carry our bags and I then became the bell hop. The first room that we were checked into was absolutely dirty and I then asked for another room. Cleaner but not up to standard. I only stayed one night at this resort as that was plenty...then I checked out!

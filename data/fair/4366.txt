I stayed here several months ago and had a sub-par experience. My room was located directly behind the front office, so I was constantly woken up by the laughter and raucous chattering going on amongst the employees. I banged on the wall and even asked in person for them to keep the noise down, to no avail. In addition, the walls are very thin and noise travels easily within the halls and into the rooms. Regarding the cleanliness of the hotel, there were no bugs, but the sheets were badly stained. The toiletries in the bathroom had been used and were half empty, the tile floor was sticky, the shower curtain had mildew on it and there was hair in the bathtub. Speaking of the bathroom, plumbing was terrible - the water would either be scalding hot or freezing cold, with no middle temperature. I ended up kneeling outside the tub and using a cup with water from the faucet to wash my hair. Finally, the night before I left I called over to the front desk and asked for a wake-up call at 3 a.m. and if they could arrange for a cab to meet me outside since I would be leaving at 3:30 in the morning. They confirmed and said that both requests would be taken care of. Three-fifteen rolls around, and my friend wakes me up in a panic because we didn't get the wake-up call. We call over to the front desk to find out why we didn't get a call and to make sure the cab was coming, and find that they had no record of the wake-up call request and that they aren't able to have a cab pick us up at a specific time. Overall, it was a bad experience and I would recommend staying at a different hotel based on those points. I understand you get what you pay for - in terms of size and amenities, this was definitely a "get what you pay for hotel" - but those factors make it worth spending a few extra dollars to avoid the inconvenience.

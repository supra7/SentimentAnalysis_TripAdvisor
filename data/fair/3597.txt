Stayed here because it is near our NYC office. Survived one night of dark, dingy room, rattling air conditioner unit and carefully walking the path between bed/closet and bed/bathroom. Glad I am not overweight or would not be able to get through narrow doorway to bathroom and same narrow door way to closet. Poorly designed room has bedside table only on one side - the other side has part of the mini-bar food/snacks on a tray that says "careful - if you touch this we will start charging you" - not helpful, so did a MacGuyver and took trash can liner out and turned trash can upside down to make a bedside spot for water, alarm, etc. Bathroom is claustrophobic even by NY standards...no way two people could be in this bathroom at same time. Not all rooms come with a bathtub, so be sure to check before accepting room key. The concierge wasn't much help at the Whatever Desk. Asked for a recommendation for a good hamburger close by and the best he could do was the outrageouly priced Smith & Wollensky's chop house. After we had the chat "if it was your personal money and the hotel wasn't paying and the restaurant you picked isn't comp'ing you because you send them lots of customers, where would you eat?" - we got sent to a neighborhood pub, the Pig & Whistle on Second Avenue between 50 & 51st - nice atmosphere, very reasonable food and drink -would go back here One positive point -= the Bliss shampoo, cleanser and body lotion. Will stay elsewhere next time....so should you considering the price.

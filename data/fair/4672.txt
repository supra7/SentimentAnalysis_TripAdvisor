This was a beautiful hotel, but we were treated like cattle even though we are members of the hotel chain frequent guest program. We had no help when requested, the staff were surly, everything is additional charges, food and drink were way overpriced, waitstaff were ignoring us, kept coming up with 'out of stock' of all of the reasonable priced wines to the point of being ridiculous. I even had to ask TWICE to just get the candle lit on our table. There is an important concept in the service industry: Essential nonessentials, and this place has missed the boat on all counts. We stayed at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel the week before, and we felt welcome and as if they wanted us to come back to their property. Everyone had a genuine smil as if they loved their workplace. The KBH understands their customers are on holiday and want to be treated with respect and care. So for less money and a better holiday, we will return to the KBH, NOT the Sheraton Maui.

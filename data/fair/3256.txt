Instead of the $32/day valet charge, I had to discover myself that if I leave my car overnight at a meter on the block of the hotel after 6 pm and move it by 8 am the next day, there is no charge. At other times it is about $1.50 per hr. Also I wanted to use the computer to check a few things, but when I sat down, it stated $6.95 per 15 minutes of use. I thought this would be included in a supposed 4 star hotel's room rate. The room was OK, but since there is no door separating the bedroom from the sink and mirror in the bathroom, I woke up my wife when I shaved and washed. Maybe good for a businessman on an expense budget, but not for a vacation stay. Austere looking lobby and rooms, no elegance whatsoever. Dingy, dated hallways and thin walls so that one could hear people talking in a normal voice in the next room. Never again.

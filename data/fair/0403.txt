We want to love the Sorrento. It is in a charming historic building with a wonderful lobby bar and has a delightful feeling unlike other seattle hotels. and we had our first date and first night of our honeymoon there several years ago! So we keep on going back even though we have service problems againand again This time for our anniversary we booked with AmexPlatinum as what we thought would be a failsafe measure for good service. but when we asked to have our room cleaned (at both the front desk and housekeeping) because Amex gives 4 pm check out, we came back to a room that hadnt been touched. after complaining (politely i might add) we did get an apology letter in the mail but not even an offer of a free drink for our next visit . For the price in Seattle, stay at the Inn at the Market, for a little more the Fairmont or try your chances at the many new hotels that may not have the history but charge less and dont tempt you with charm but fail to deliver!

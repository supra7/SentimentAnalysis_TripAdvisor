We had a dinner celebration in Boston and booked a room at the Park Plaza. The internet special was $100 for a standard room. Very good price for Boston and I did not have high expectations for the standard room. The room size was ok and the bathroom very small. Unfortunately, the hallway to the room was littered with room service dishes around 4pm and dirty towels in the evening. We could hear every sound from the adjoining rooms as well as the plumbing. You get what you pay for and I am just glad we were not paying more than $100. Positives - the lobby was nicely decorated and the location is very good. BTW - the parking deck near the hotel was $28 for 4pm to 8am the next day.

This was my first time to NOLA. The hotel was recommended by a previous traveler. They were correct in stating the hotel is close (walking distance) to everything you can need - CVS, Casino, Shopping, Restaurants, Tour Guides etc. The 90% of the people working in the hotel were more than nice. But the bed was horrendous! It was too, too soft. It was a very old mattress with a down comforter placed on top. There was also an issue with the electrical outlets - I need to use it for my C-PAP machine and they finally gave me a extension cord to use for the evening. The following day they claimed it was fixed - it wasn't. Evenutally we had another room. By the way my roommate broke out in a terrible rash and need a presecription cream to allevate the rash. Oh yes - you need to pay for computer access and even though they offer you the ability to print out your plane pass it would time out after 6 minutes (the computer was extremely slow).

If you knew your shower didn't work would you still let people use it? my boyfriend and I took a one night trip and decided to stay here. There was one room open and we took it. With no warning, the shower flooded our whole room into the lobby ceiling and all into our room. 10 gallons of water out of our carpet later, at 1130 at night we finally got some sleep. The next day everyone was very nice, but they knew the drain didn't work. Next time, just don't offer the room.

We got our trip thru luxury link. The price was not to be beaten. We checked in , no problem. I had to call down 2x for them to bring our comp wine and truffles, dinner cert. for our 3 course dinner and our free breakfast coupons. We proceeded to dinner. Our 3 course dinner was great. The gnocchi was the best I have ever had. The btl of wine and the apps were great as well. Later that night was came back to the room to wake up drenched in sweat. I thought we had had too much to drink the night b4. When we bumped the air conditioned to 68, it would go down to that and bounce back up to a sweltering 78. We got up that a.m., came back later and went out. Next a.m., same thing. Woke up drenched and the darn thermostat was back up to 78 again. I called and told them to come up after 11am. Upon opening the air cond unit...I found the filter completely blocked with dust...GROSS!!!!!!! They fixed the problem and we had a better night of sleep. The parking is $48/nt. We found garages a few blks away for $26-$28. We parked there. I was looking at the beds and noticed that the head of the bed was higher tan the rest of the bed. Kinda in a "u" shape. odd. Maybe that is why my back hurt so bad. Dunno if I would stay there unless we had a deal.

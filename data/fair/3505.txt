We styed at the Time Hotel for 3 nights at the end of September. The location is wonderful, the rooms clean and the staff very pleasant. However, our "superior queen" room was absolutely tiny. Not "small"- TINY! The bed was not queen size,either; maybe just a bit larger than a standard double bed On the positive side, it was very quiet-probably because our room was located in an air shaft! The airconditioning worked great so we were satisfied. We would only stay there again if we got a really good deal on the rate. We paid $209 and, frankly, it was not worth it.

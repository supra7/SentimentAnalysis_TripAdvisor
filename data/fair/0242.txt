Stayed at the Quality Inn on John Street - Seattle Center. The hotel is what you are paying for which means the following to me. Good price for the other hotels in the area. Towels that are a bit scratchy & rough. Lower grade bed, but good clean sheets. Here are the positives: Great location to Space Needle (3 blocks), Excellent help from the front desk - thanks Chris, good location to rental car locations if needed, standard, but filing free breakfast bar, low cost for parking for other hotels in the area, fridge & microwave in the room, two good grocery stores within 1-2 blocks, overall good price for budget. Lows: Hotel carpet is worn, not a lot of sit down places to eat nearby, yes- the elevators are slow, but your on vacation, budget hotel as stated above.

We stayed for 5 nights at this hotel. We traveled with 2 adults, 1 child age 5. The beds were a bit too small to sleep in with a child, and the rooms are small too, but clean, as well is the bathroom.The staff is very friendly and helpfull, the location is prefect, safe neighborhood, close to the subway and groceries/restaurants, nice breakfast, good choice/price. Only 1 real complaint: the light in the hotelroom.They really have to put extra lamps in the rooms, brighter lamps and extra bedlight.

Made a reservation in January for March, to celebrate a friend's birthday. When we arrived to check in on Saturday afternoon we were told they were oversold and they were moving us to a nearby hotel. Well the hotel ended up being 5 miles away. We were traveling with two other couples for a birthday celebration. The other couples were able to stay at the Westin. I will say that they comped us the room for the night and then sent an email offering a free night stay at the Westin. I'm not sure yet if we will take them up on that.

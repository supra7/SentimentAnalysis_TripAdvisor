The room was clean but the breakfast was less than "poor." There was just one type of traditional cheese and dead sandwiches. I asked for egg which did not served until I Ielft the breakfastroom after half an hour later from my order. They accepts customers who are not hotel guests and serve them better and quicker than the hotel guests Location is good. It is in the middle of the city and just next to the Mall of Emirates. If you will stay in this hotel please do not take breakfast.

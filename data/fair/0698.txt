Spent one night on business. The room I was given was very large on first floor with two king size beds. Patio door into the pool area. Very nice Hilton beds. When I entered the non-smoking room it smelled like a cross between musty old clothes and cleaning supplies. I checked into the property about 10:00pm so I went to check the room service menu for dinner and zap, no menu in room book which looked like it had been used for a scratch pad. Had to call room service to find out choices. Although, the room did had left over things from the previous people, notes on pad, old check in folder, dirty coffee cup, candy bar in drawer. The bathroom was nice and clean but very skimpy on towels and no bathmat. Accident waiting to happen. I went to close the drapes and the pull wand was broken off and laying against wall. Not a lot of help there huh? I have stayed at this property a few other times with always the Hilton level of rooms. Not this time. Not sure if they are cutting back on staff or just careless room staff. My advise would be to find another hotel in area! Not worth the cost of room.

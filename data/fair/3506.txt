I stayed at the Time Hotel this weekend and found the property to be fair, but not great. The hotel seemed rather worn and I often saw large black garbage bags filled with trash from guest rooms sitting in the hallways. My room also was leaking in the bathroom via the light fixture due to a leak in the room above! When I contacted hotel management I was told "don't worry, we know" - what about the leak in my room?!? The staff were courteous, but did not seem to go out of their way, and the rooms were very, very small. I bumped into something just about every time I walked through the room. Bottom line, if you get a GREAT deal, you should consider the hotel. If not, keep shopping.

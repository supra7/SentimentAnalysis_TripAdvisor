I've stayed at the Millenium Bostonian twice in the past couple of years through Priceline which advertises it as a 4 star. Priceline nowadays is an outlet for distressed hotel rooms so it should be no surprise that this hotel is a bit shabby. Why they insist on not replacing the carpet years after it has decayed and started to smell is beyond me. Also, there is a fair amount of noise that enters the rooms from pipes, toilets, etc. Otherwise the location is great and the staff accomodating.

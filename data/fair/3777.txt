Yikes! We were charged a $40 per night "resort" fee in addition to fairly expensive lodging costs. The entire place is very very dirty, completely outdated and simply not kept up to par. Food trays were sitting outside of rooms for days, and the grounds are filthy. The "suites" are extremely old- very outdated TV, furniture and beds. Horrible mattresses and pillows. Definitely NOTHING luxurious about the place. The water areas are also dirty. Unless this places gets some major money infused into it and is managed properly, avoid it like the plague. The location is not great either. We will never ever stay here again and we certainly do not recommend it.

I definitely would NOT stay there again. Rooms are too small even for 2 people. Beds are advertised as queen, but they were not queen sized beds. No counter in the extremely small bathroom, so no place to put things you are using. Not enough room to put out the luggage holder without tripping over it or stubbing your toe.. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hallways not air conditioned. If I had brought my laptop, there wouldn't have been anyplace to put it on the desk that was crammed in the corner. It had the coffee pot, ice bucket & glasses on it and no where to move it to. If you like a quiet room, ask for a room away from the road. I couldn't believe that there wasn't any place to park. They advertise that they will let you leave your car there while on a cruise, but what about the other guests that are staying there while you're on your cruise? Lack of parking was a big deal to us. We had to PAY to park in a dark alley behind the hotel. If I had paid full price for the room, I would have been very, very angry.

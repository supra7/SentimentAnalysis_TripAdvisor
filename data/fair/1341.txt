This is the second time we stayed here. This trip our room, especially bathroom was DIRTY! I took a clean wet wash cloth and wiped step into shower and came away with black moldy dirt...ewwwww. If I hadn't needed a shower so badly after an international flight I wouldn't have taken one...I really considered not getting one. The blanket cover and bed skirt were dirty but the sheets were clean. Clearly the housekeeping supervisor is not monitoring what staff is or is not doing. Will never stay here again.

We stayed at the Sheraton for 1 week during our honeymoon. The hotel was of a good standard. I would recommend asking for a sea facing room as the view from our room was fantastic. The room was of a good standard and cleaned everyday. The hallways could do with a bit of a clean and disposing of the carpet as this is very stained and looks tatty. The breakfast is great and well worth the money. I would highly recommend booking a havanna on the beach as the beach gets very very busy at the hotel end due to the black rock and the excellent snorkelling. We were warned that Maui was very expensive so saved quite a lot of money to take with us. We were pleasantly surprised at the prices when we arrived. Lelani's restaurant in Whalers village is excellent value and well worth queing for a table. Also there is a bus from Whalers village which takes you into Lahaina which is a lovely town with great restaurants and shops. All in all the Sheraton is one of the best hotels and we would definately return.

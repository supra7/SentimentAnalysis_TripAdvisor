I am currently at the hotel. This is my third day here. The location is great but the rooms are small. The staff leaves a lot to be desired for. I have had bad experiences at every level. The front desk people are unfriendly and rude. They do not have a true "Concierge". In fact, the people that are at that location are the least helpful in the hotel. Since this is my first time to Seattle, I do not know what the other hotels are like but this one, I would never and i mean never stay at again. Parking is Valet parking only. I was definitely hoping for a much better experience. Too bad that I have three more nights here with a non-refundable reservation. The Runner, Georgia May 2011

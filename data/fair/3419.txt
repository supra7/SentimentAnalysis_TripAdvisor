We just came back from NYC last night and I have to say that this hotel was the worst one we've stayed at in about the 20-30 times we've been to NYC. The location was fine but the room was horribly hot and the heat made pinging noises all night long-we had to open the windows to be able to breath and it was very cold outside. When we used the shower the whole bathroom got wet, the toilet leaked, there was no good mirror to put on makeup, and the help there was practically useless-they couldn't even give me the name or number of the gym literally 30 feet up the road-they didn't have it and they never called back-and obviously there was no work out facility at the hotel. I would not return to this hotel-they have just updated the carpet but there is no way they can upgrade the rest of the room enough to even compare to other hotels we've stayed in before. They said that the beds were new but we had backaches from the beds.

We've been here 4 times before and were shocked at the condition of the hotel. The bathroom had sketchy stains, the furniture was broken and chipped, paint and wallpaper were peeling, The staff were polite but helpless. They offered three other rooms, but they were in worse condition?!? The pool was great, but again lacking basic maintenance. A $500/ night room should be clean and maintained. My advice - book one night, play in the pool 2 days and then go stay somewhere nice.

We had a disastrous trip to New Orleans all around and it was my husband's birthday. We arrived at the hotel. No Bell service. There were 6 valet parkers standing at the desk ignoring us. Okay. We had to carry cases up stairs, lucky we are both fit! When we go to the top of the stairs the Bellman was waiting there and casually waved us onwards towards the reception without speaking. Strange! A man (who I later realized was the manager because his photo was in the book in my room) asked if he could help as we were forced to wheel luggage through a caroling concert in the foyer. I snapped "why start now?" The room was a lovely size. The gym was new and so all of the machinery worked and had television entertainment on command. We ate at Domenicas and that was superb! However the overall experience was just too marred: We waited on hold with the concierge for over an hour (we got ready and had it on speaker phone). He asked us if he could recommend that we go to Antoine's restaurant and to have a particular waiter - the restaurant was empty and enormous and the waiter ignored us and the food was tepid. We booked a segway tour in the French Quarter and were told upon arrival that they had phoned our hotel to bring the time forward half an hour and had therefore resold our tickets. (Incidentally, they had only phoned half an hour prior!!!!!!) And it was my husband's birthday. Mortified. The valet parking blocked in our taxi as we were trying to leave. The people who were trying to get their cars looked like they were in Dante's seventh circle of hell. It is obviously big business for the hotel. The service was simply completely lacking in all regards. Perhaps if I had had a better experience with New Orleans itself, the hotel would have seemed better because the room was certainly the nicest part of our time there.

Our biggest frustration with this hotel was the comfort of the showers. All we wanted was a comfortable place to crash at the end of a fun day on Maui. Our first night was in room 161 a "superior" room, and the shower temp fluctuated between as cold as the ocean to hot enough to scald you, and the fluctuations were very frequent. We got moved to a different lower grade room where the fluctiuations were not as fequent or extreme, but still kind of annoying. That being said, we feel that the staff were curteous and polite, and while a litte run down the rooms were clean an comfortable (except for the shower).

Large complex with multiple buildings. Nice grounds and a lot of meeting space. I had a "villa". Room was average size but had a large bathroom. Very nice decor, bedding, etc. The events catering and bar staff was great. Has a resort fee which covers internet, gratuities, etc. Beware of sapce under your door leading to the outside. Mine had a small gap as did others in our group. A scorpian found it's way into my 2nd floor room. When I reported it to the front desk they didn't act like it was a big deal. Some inexpensive weather stripping under the doors would fix this. I stuffed a towel in front of the door. While a great hotel I'm not so sure I'd stay here again for having to deal with a scorpian getting into the room and a staff that wasn't too concerned about it - thus the "poor" rating.

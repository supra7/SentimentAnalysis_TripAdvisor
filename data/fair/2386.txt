made a reservation for an AAA and booked a "city view" room. Tried to check in at 2pm, the clerk said the city view rooms were not ready yet. Dropped off the bags and off I go. Return at 11pm, assigned room 1538. There are 22 floors in this hotel, so a city view is half way up the hotel? I saw a brick wall and roof and a very small part of another street. Too tired, I'll complain later. Have a morning detail, so out and about again. Return and order room service. Service was positive. Wake up at 4am to get a work out in. Fitness room and pool open at 5am. I go down to the front desk and the young lady, Tiffany, said the fitness room opens at 5am. "You can't ask security to open it?" "She will not open the fitness room." Poor customer service. This place sounds like the Omni up the street. I'd hope for better service as I'm a Hilton Honor's member with 8 stays this year. A cabbie walks in the lobby and ask, "Who needs a cab?" Tiffany says "no one." "Then why do you have the taxi light on outside?" "I can't turn it off, sorry." Lying through her teeth, when the cabbie leaves, the security lady turns off the taxi light. Turn off the light and too lazy to open the fitness room. The previous two stays here had no problems. I don't plan on staying here again, period.

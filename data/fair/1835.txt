Hotwired it for pretty cheap $59, so I can't really complain. Whenever I go to Hotwire and choose 4-star Galleria, I get either this, or the Westin Galleria. Both are supposedly 4-star. But if this is a 4-star hotel, then I am a monkey's uncle. There is just no comparison between the two hotels. Worth $59 a night, not a penny more!

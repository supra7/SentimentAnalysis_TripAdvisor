We got a great rate of 99.00 from the hotel's e-newsletter. Although the location was perfect for us to attend a play at the downtown theater, the hotel was less than 4 star. We stayed on the 23rd floor (rm 2321) where the ceiling was exposed we think for repairs on the heating and cooling system. There was a strong smell of paint also. Our room was a standard room, but it was really small. The bedding looked worn, the walls were stained, the furniture was dusty and the bathroom floor was not clean. There was hair on the blinds, the bathroom floor and in the bathtub. Our rooms thermostat we assume was broken because we were freezing the entire time. We asked for help with the thermostat and the front desk gave us instructions, but to no avail. The morning breakfast was sufficient, but being frozen and feeling like we were not clean left us feeling uncomfortable and dissatisfied.

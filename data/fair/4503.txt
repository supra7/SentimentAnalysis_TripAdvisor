Stayed there in June having last visited 5-6 years ago. In the meantime it has changed ownership and has gone downhill. Our room didn't appear to have been redecorated in years and the bathroom in particular was badly in need of attention. Whereas before I remember comfortable beds and lots of pillows this time I had a very uncomfortable night on a lumpy mattress with 2 nasty synthetic, thin pillows. No sign of the advertised turndown service. Breakfast ok. A shame really as the staff were helpful and it's in a great location for Union Square but I won't be going back.

All right - there is a wireless network somewhere in the hotel, but four of us with laptops could not get a reliable connection anywhere. Apparently, so many of the Sterling's customers have been using the Super8's network that they are now password protecting it. News for the management: Texas Stadium is HISTORY! You can't rely on drunk sports fans to fill the rooms. Leisure guests will expect reliable internet and business customers will demand it. Also, the rooms smelled musty. I may not have been in a remodeled section.

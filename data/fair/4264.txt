I came here hoping for a nice place to stay in to explore Los Angeles. What disappointed me when I first arrived was the $30 parking fee per day. Also, the valets didn't even smile. Also, they charge you for internet. When I went in the hotel, it looked nice but the lobby was sprayed with so much perfume. The perfume didn't even smell nice either. The perfume smelled bad that I almost threw up. The people at the counter had good customer service, but the valets didn't. I went to enter my room and it took a couple of tries to swipe the key until you can go in. That disappointed me a lot because it took a while to get into a room. When I looked in the bathroom, I expected maybe a toothbrush or toothpaste but they didn't even have it. All they had was a tiny bottle of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. Also, their towels stink. When I sleep at a hotel, I expected a peaceful sleep. But no. You could hear people outside talking while you sleep at 1 in the morning. and I couldn't have a good night sleep. I wanted to go the gym to exercise, but I was disappointed at how small it was. There was probably less than fifteen machines in the small fitness room. Also, they charge you 30 dollars for breakfast. Even a hotel with less stars than this one will have complimentary breakfast. How disappointing. To sum it up, this hotel is probably the worst hotel I have ever been to. Disappointing things: -30 dollar fee parking per day -No free internet -no free breakfast -no toothpaste or toothbrush -small fitness center -okay service -stinky lobby -Not so pretty view

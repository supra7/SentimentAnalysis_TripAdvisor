This is a very mixed review. Wowed by the hotel. Very funky and nice touches everywhere, see others photos, but, all very nice having this iPod dock but when it goes off at 4am and you can't shut the thing up it does p@ss you off a bit. I had to unplug it and leave outside the door :) Lots of shouting outside, I know busy city and we were prepared and took earplugs but just saying. Sat night had a lovely meal in their restaurant and kind waiter went and stuck 20eu on his mobile phone top up!!!! Fkn cheek! Next day police were staking out some no doubt pick pocket from inside hotel reception. All very bring you down to earth you are staying in a big city. Recommend the bar down the road for a cocktail and the food Market for brekky or lunch. Keep off Las Ramblas for good food, it's shocking. Mirablau for a night out was ace, got home 5.30am cos I couldn't stop dancing.

I am in and out of Chicago a lot and typically stay at one of the Hilton family hotels. I have been to the Palmer House Hilton on many occasions, but it had been a few years. Really the only nice thing about the hotel is the lobby. Take that away and you are staying in a low-rent hotel. Virtually everything about it is old and tired. The staff is less than enthused and they really reflect the hotel itself. Although generally clean there is no pride of workmanship when it comes to maintaining the hotel. Chicago is a city of endless hotel possibilities so why would one want to stay at the Palmer House? Last time for me.

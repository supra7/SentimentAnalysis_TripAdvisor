Staying two nights in Seattle - both booked for the 6th Ave. Inn. Friendly and helpful desk staff. The hotel was easy to find in a central location. The hotel is quite dated starting with the entrance and main check in desk. The halls are musty, and reminded me of visiting my grandmothers old apartment. The location is poor with a clear view of a strip club and adult shop across the parking lot from our room. The crowd roaming the streets were very undesireable. The room was in disrepair, with a hole in the bathroom door, old furniture, and a very dated bathroom. The rest of the room was adequate and the beds were good. Ticking and clicking air vents kept my family up for several hours. Security brought up ear plugs which helped some of us. We checked out and did not stay the second night. It is time to tear this hotel down and rebuild.

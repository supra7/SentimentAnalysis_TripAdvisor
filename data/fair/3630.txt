the W is a very trendy "hip" place to be but the room we had was no larger than a walk in closet......almost impossible to walk around the queen sized bed. the Hotel Lobby was extremely nice with couches TV's etc. The bathroom was minute...you could rest your chin on the sink as you used the toilet. the shower curtain was too short for the shower and water spewed out on the bathroom floor....not a square inch to put your toiletries......the room was way too small even for a single traveler and given the price you could easily do so much better.....never again...never

This hotel is beautiful and well-appointed. The room we stayed in (two double beds) was very large with a beautiful bathroom. What you need to be aware of is that there are 2 nightclubs in the building that, on good weather nights, open into the courtyard between the two buildings and blast the music until 4 or 5 in the morning. The music, and particularly the base, made our room vibrate and the noise was loud. This is a known problem to the hotel, who offered ear plugs when we complained. We did not think ear plugs were a good substitute for a quiet nights' sleep, especially considering this is a 5 star hotel.

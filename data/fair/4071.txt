We recently stayed at the Encore at the Wynn at the recommendation of our travel consultant. We had two bags of new purchases go missing from our room. When this was reported to the hotel, they stated that they have a policy which does not cover hotel guests property in their room during or after their stay. We have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world and this has to be the worst customer service we have ever experianced.

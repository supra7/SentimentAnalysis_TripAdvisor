I stayed here for 4 nights in November and had a suite. This rating is charitable - I hear the general standard of NYC hotels is grim. There was no bathtub in my suite - astonishing. The windows let a lot of street noise even though mine faced a side street. The heating system was difficult to adjust and I kept waking up at 4 am in the morning as the room was incredibly hot. Even after the maintenance guy repaired it (he had to replace something) I had to set it to cool the room in order to saty at a comfortable temperature. The decor of the suite is reminiscent of the 1970s - completely fails to be funky. Service is indifferent - some days I got my specified paper, some days not. The restaurant was closed on a Sunday night, and on one other night was fully occupied with a function. The location is excellent, but all these minuses mean that I plan to try a different hotel next time.

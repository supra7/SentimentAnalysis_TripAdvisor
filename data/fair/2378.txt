Here for 1week, usually stay at Hilton Garden Inn 2 blocks away. Check in was about a hour late & were to have corner suite, they gave us a standard room,went down to front desk and showed our copy of reservation for suite & price that was less, got corner room after another hour wait. All 3 elevators smell like urine entire stay, so did our rooms bathroom. Room was very spacious but decorated like something a cross out of the 60s and The Jettsons. Upon checkout was build higher rate than told ,will now have to go to front desk and shoe them reserved rate. Make sure you bring a copy of reservation If you don't want to get screwed. No more stays here, Hilton owns both, sure hope Garden Inn hasn't went down in care like this place.

We came to Seattle for a weekend and wanted a mid-range downtown hotel that offered a weekend package. They offered a package that was touted as including breakfast. The room amenities were listed as including the usual features: robes, toiletries, etc. We discovered at bed time that robes weren't in the closet. We called for them and discovered that one has to request them -- at no charge -- but hardly conducive to a relaxing evening when you're waiting 20 minutes for a bathrobe. The next morning, we discovered the same "lack" of a shower cap. I was told, again, it's free of charge, but one has to request it. The next morning we went to breakfast to discover that the complementary full breakfast was actually in a fast food cafe with counter service. Yes, we did receive the breakfast, but it was hardly the relaxed experience we anticipated in a full-service hotel dining room. On check out, we discovered an inexplicable charge on our bill (a room tax that represented about 40% of the bill). It was clear that the clerk didn't know how to calculate percentages, so she was befuddled. We spoke with the manager who couldn't answer the question about the 40% tax either, but he did reduce the cost of our room substantially to compensate us for the inconvenience. My guess: The Westin caters to tour groups. The cruise ships seem to use it as a staging location. So expect crowds of old-timers queuing up for their free breakfasts. The carpets look worn. The hotel looks a little old around the edges.

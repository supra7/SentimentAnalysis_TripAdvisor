The hotel website clearly states that the rooms are equipped with both air conditioning AND heat. This is untrue, but the hotel staff failed to mention this until we were four room changes into our stay. When it was finally established that the hotel had NO heating system, we tried to settle into our freezing room... only to find that there was no hot water. We changed rooms again. And again. Finally, we settled for the last room. This room had warm water for part of our stay and cold water for the rest. When we complained about the state of our room, the person at the front desk assured us that our first night would be comped. When we checked out, we were told that because we had booked through Hotwire, this would not be possible. So, we came to Florida to be warm, and while we can't blame the record cold temperatures on the hotel or the staff, we CAN blame them for a miserably cold room, a cold shower, and an unapologetic staff, armed with nothing but lies about how they would resolve our problems. I am so disappointed. I thought that Hilton stood for quality and service, but I have been proven wrong. As a frequent traveler, I am constantly booking rooms and talking to people about my experience. I will never recommend a Hilton again.

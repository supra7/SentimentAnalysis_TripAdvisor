Stayed for 2 nights with husband and children, and my parents stayed also in their own room. I made it clear in reservations that we were traveling together, but when I checked in they had us on 2 different floors and could not give us rooms closer together. The front desk lacked much customer service most of our stay. The room looked recently remodeled and was fairly comfortable. The view of the beach was over the top of a dirty restaurant roof. The pool was empty and under construction, though arrangements were made for guests to use the pool at the Best Western next door. We had our door open to the sound of the waves all night, and did not hear any noise (we were top floor on the end of the building) Though my parents who were 2 floors down and in a room more toward the center of the building (it's an L shape) had a sleepless night with partying guests until 3:30 am, and then when they finally quieted down (after a call to the front desk), the neighbors above them came home and stomped around above them until 5am. Our first morning we had to take cold showers because there was no hot water. I called the front desk, they said they would tell maintenance, but they did not seem sympathetic at all. The next morning was fine. Though this motel (called a Hotel) was clean and comfortable (in our King room) I would probably not stay here again. I like to actually sleep at night, and it seems from experience and other reviews that it is hit and miss at this motel. I am not willing to take the chance. I would rather drive to the beach if it means getting a good nights rest.

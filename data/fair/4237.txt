There are so many hotels along this stretch of coast line don't choose this one! Yes its near to the beach but they all are! Our teenage kids loved the games room and free internet but the hotel reception and room smelt funny! The staff were indifferent and even got shirty when we requested new tennis balls cos the ones the gave us were broken! Beds were made but only the top sheet was straightened, they couldn't be bothered to straighten the lower sheet.- never had that before! Also only one net curtain across half the window so had to keep curtain closed as room faced a path. Room wasn't cleaned till 3pm one day. Minor moans in the scheme of things but contributed to the couldn't care less attitude that permeated the place.

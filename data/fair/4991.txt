I stayed at this hotel on my second visit to Chicago. This hotel is a bit run down. You can tell that they have recently made some improvements and upgrades to this hotel, but it is still not very nice. It was not extremely dirty or unsafe, nothing was old or damaged, but it was not clean and comfortable and not somewhere I would stay again. The staff was not helpful at all from helping us with directions to a room key that did not work to assisting us with luggage upon arrival. Everyone who stayed at this hotel with me agrees we will not be coming back and we would rather stay at the original hotel we tried in Chicago. On a positive note, this hotel is conveniently located to most of the fantastic shopping and attractions Chicago has to offer.

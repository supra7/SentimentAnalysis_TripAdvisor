I was in Dallas on business and stayed at The Sterling Hotel. Some problems that I encountered were: no hot water in the shower area the last 2 days of my stay (i was there for only 3 days). There was hot water in the sink but not in the shower. When I reported the problem, a man came up and played around with things in the bathroom but the problem was never resolved. His solution was to run the hot water in the sink and maybe the hot water would eventually work in the shower. Result: no hot water in the sink OR shower. There wasn't one garbage can in the entire room including the bathroom. When someone finally brought the garbage can, it had no bag in it and the can was stained with all types of disgusting colors. It took 3 hours for someone to bring extra towels and washclothes. I had to call twice. Lastly, in the elevator, in order to get to your floor you have to continuously hold your floor number until you get to your floor or the elevator won't operate. It was a pretty scary experience. Please don't put yourself through that torture.

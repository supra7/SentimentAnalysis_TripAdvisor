Too much money for too little comfort My husband and I stayed here from May 25th to May 31st 2005. It is a lovely hotel in a perfect location with gracious staff, but our room was intolerably warm, even though the outside temp. was only in the 70s. Having the A/C on high 24/7 didn't help. Opening the only window and turning off the A/C didn't help either. Even the hallways, elevators and Rick's Cafe (where breakfast and afternoon wines and cheeses are served) were overheated. The linens didn't fit the mattress and the bathroom sink faucet produced only a thin spray of water (hot, cold, or warm). In the end we decided to put up with all of this because of the location and the inconvenience of moving, but we won't be staying there again. The Casablanca is far too pricey for what it offers.

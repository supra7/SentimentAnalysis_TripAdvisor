I stayed at the Helmsley Middletown a few weeks ago in early August. I know that hotels in NYC are overpriced and run down, but this is such a dump. I would NEVER ever have booked it myself or would ever stay there for pleasure. They don't have room service, just 4 places that deliver food. They have removed the yellow pages so you can't even find food available. There is a Mongolian convenience store with a buffet across the street that is pretty good. Their free breakfast in the morning was overcrowed with people trying to get to the croissants and muffins in the space of a closet. No in room coffee pot, but I requested one and got it. They didn't bring coffee or filters, but after 2 more calls to housekeeping I got those. Oh, no filters though. They said I should have brought my own..? They don't have in room movies you can order either. I think the location was good but otherwise, just a dismal depressing place.

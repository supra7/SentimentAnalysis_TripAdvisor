I stayed there for a conference in December. I'm sure it would be a different place when the oasis is open and as other people mention the $30 charge for resort facilities is outrageous when the main facility is closed. They do offer a shuttle to the mall but in reality yo could walk it it's so close. The hiking trail is uninteresting. The rooms are fine but not fantastic, spacious rather than comfortable with an undersized bath for some reason. You can get people to drive you to restaurants around the resort in a buggy but really it's not ideal unless you are prepared to walk as nothing is close to hand. As a summer resort for families I'm sure it's great, but for a hotel while on business I would avoid

My wife and I usually stay at The Sheraton Resort &Spa when we visit Maui. Usually the trip goes very smoothly and my wife and I enjoyed our stay at The Sheraton. However in December 2010 we stayed for 9 days and after the first night I had a sore throat and it just got worse from there. By the third day I just slept and woke up more tired than when I fell asleep. The Cleaning staff was asked to address cleaning of the A/C unit, I also asked the Front Desk to have their Maintenance check the A/C unit, But neither happened. I became so ill I just wanted to leave early and go home. WE HAD TO CANCEL ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES. Upon checkout I spoke briefly to the manager who tried to convince me it was lava dust, fog and so on. She was not even interested in looking into the room but did make alot of reasoning to convince herself that no problem existed. This will be my last experience at The Sheraton Resort an Spa on Maui. I have been to the emergency room twice since I have returned and now am now going the a pulmonary specialist. After coming home I looked up "Mold Sickness in Hawaii" on the internet and found out this is a common problem, especially now when all the rooms have a low occupancy problem and they turn off the A/C when not occupied leaving longer periods for mold to grow in the moist, warm environment. IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES OF ANY KIND-DO NOT STAY AT THE SHERATON RESORT & SPA ON MAUI. MY WIFE DOESN'T HAVE ALLERGIES AND SHE ALSO BECAME EXTREMELY ILL AT THE END OF OUR 9 DAY STAY.

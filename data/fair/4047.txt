Don't be fooled. Encore at Wynn does NOT offer a five star service. I stayed there for two nights with 3 girlfriends in June and we were thoroughly disappointed with the hotel: - no housekeeping service. We came back from a day out to find our damp towels unchanged, beds unmade etc. When we called Housekeeping they seemed surprised that we had expected someone to turn over the room during the day. It took 3 further calls to get clean towels, have the old towels taken away and arrange to have the room tidied and beds turned down. I'm not usually a fussy person with hotels, but when you've paid a five star price....? - no information in the room on anything at Wynn or in Vegas. No club/restaurant info, no details on how to get tickets or when the services closed. We went down to the concierge to buy club tickets before dinner but it was closed - this information would have been useful in the room! - no replacement of toiletries in the shower, dirty glasses were not removed or cleaned. - it was my friend's birthday and we asked what upgrades/extras we could get to make her weekend extra special. The front desk suggested 'a show' but nothing more - we weren't trying to get free stuff, we wanted suggestions!! They didn't even try to sell us an upgraded room or champagne. Useless. I have stayed in two star hotels who have treated their guests better. On the plus side, the casino is plush and the Club XS pool party was wicked fun, but next time I hit Vegas I will be staying somewhere with a real five star experience.

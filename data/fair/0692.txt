We were flying out early in the morning, so decided to drive down and stay at an airport hotel and park our car for 8 days. Quality Inn had the best deal price-wise. The good: The price. The staff were helpful, friendly, efficient and knowledgable. The driver to the airport was on-time and friendly (shuttle runs every half hour). A free breakfast is available from 4:30am on, and is not bad...coffee, orange juice, muffins, danish, and a waffle maker. Showers had good pressure and hot water. There was a fridge and safe in the room. Location is right by the airport. The bad: the hotel hallways are really dirty and run down. New carpeting and a serious cleaning job needed. Room was ok..bed was a bit soft, and the sheet were quite thin. There is no elevator. For one night it is livable, but I wouldn't go back if I had a choice. It served the purpose we needed, and our car was fine when we returned (in a lit parking area in front of the hotel. Good size stalls). Safe travels, E

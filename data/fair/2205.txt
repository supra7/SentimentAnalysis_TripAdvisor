This hotel has gone way downhill since my last stay a year ago. The three rooms that I looked at before choosing the best of a sad bunch all had a moldy smell. The carpets lloked old and stained. There was noise from other rooms. The bed that I slept on had a cheap, stained mattress. The valet took 40 minutes to get my car. The oncierge never called me back about a restaurant reservation. On the plus side, the location is great, and some of the old time employees still remembered my name. e-mail me for any questions.

Alright, I guess! I went to Miami on April 29-May 2, 2005. We had a standard room, with double beds! Okay let me start by sayin' it was 4 of us, and we were cramped up in this little room!!! It really is toooooo small for 4 people. The restrooms are old and really needs a upgrade!!! NOT TO MENTION THE TOILET OVERFLOWED! Don't be fooled!!! The hotel doen't look like the pic's on the internet!! Even though all the art deco hotels look old and like they all need some work! I would recommend staying on Collins Ave., or Ocean Drive because it's near everything! Overall the hotel was okay but we did have some problems...... and If it's got a cheap rate get it!

Although clean, tidy and well located, the El Bonita would not be my first choice in Saint Helena. The Art Deco dcor, while appealing, does little to compensate for the tiny rooms, lack of service and motel feel of the place. It is exceptionally well priced, however, so if you are short on funds, give it a try. After all, its likely youre in Napa Valley to explore the wine country, not to sit in your motel room.

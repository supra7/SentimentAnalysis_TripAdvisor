The room and bathroom are dirty. Terrible for to allergic people, because they don't clean the rooms. Nice location, close to metro station(about 5 min) and the park(2 min). My room had a small kitchen, but there weren't kitchen utensils to use!! The breakfast is satisfactory. The price and location are good, but if you can, choose other hotel.

Falling out of love... We were initially captivated when we found this hotel two years ago. Despite the small rooms, everything was impeccible and we were treated, as the staff liked to say, like family. This last visit made us feel like oustead relatives however. The refreshment bar was always empty, the staff did not go above and beyond as we were used to, and an early morning power washing outside blew out the side of our AC unit, soaking everything in sight. I reported this to the front desk, as well as in a follow up letter to the manager, and never got any sort of satisfactory response. The only thing I can surmise is that, as one of the bellman confessed, they are just so busy all the time, some of that personal touch has definately been lost. We go to NYC at least once a month and have not been back to the Casablanca. We have found bigger rooms and better service at cheaper prices.

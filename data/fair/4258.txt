The Downtown Marriott in Los Angeles was our final destination on a three stop stay in America, from reviews it looked like it was going to be one of the best but proved to be the worst. The location is not ideal and being in the financial district we found there were limited restaurants or food outlets open over the weekend, the majority of hotel guests appeared to be business travellers and as holiday makers we felt quite out of place as men and women in suits looked down there noses at us - it also meant drink prices at the bar were quite expensive! The room was fairly nice although dated and its probably no surprise with another Marriott opening at the other end of the street that this one has not seen any TLC for a while. The fitness suite was small, limited and not very looked after and the staff also were not very friendly - cashing travellers cheques was a chore most days!

The staff was friendly and the room was well cleaned. The room was smaller than it appeared on line. The remote for the air/conditioning was not in the room when the temperature reached 26 degrees Celsius, I decided to ask for it. The pull out couch was old and the bed could not be put back into the couch without assistance. Hot water was not always available. The furniture was old and shabby. I would not stay here again.

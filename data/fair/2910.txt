We just got back from a 8 day stay on Maui.The Island and sights were very nice. We stay at the Maui Prince, because we smoke we checked out the website the site read non-smoking rooms available upon request. So we book a oceanfront room, upon arrival we learned that all oceanfront was non-smoking.We tried to do the right thing, we ask for a smoking room we had to down grade to oceanview. The oceanfront room were up to date the, oceanview were not. The people were not helpful or friendly. We did no get the Aloha Feeling, we get the hit the road feeling.

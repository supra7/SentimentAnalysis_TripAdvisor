This apparent expensive and historic hotel in downtown boston was definietly not worth the price. We stayed in the hotel, because of a wedding at the hotel in mid-September. The rooms were quite small and freezing, we called the information desk regarding the cold temperature and they told us that the heat was completely turned off for the season. At the wedding (which was a beautiful room) I was moving my bag from under the table and when I put it on my chair and got read to move, i looked down and on my chair was the largest roach you've ever seen. The only good part of our stay was we got upgraded to the chancellors suite, which was nice because we were travelling with two young children. The rest of our party had traditional rooms, they were extremely small and they were all disappointed.

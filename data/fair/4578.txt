Very over-rated! We stayed in the historic part of the hotel in room 355. It was small and the air conditioning made so much noise it was hard to sleep. The over-all service was poor, the food over-priced and not so good, and the pool totally unimpressive. We had to fetch our own food and drink because there were no poolside servers. We were sitting on a hotel beachchair in the sand at 5:40 PM watching the sunset and a hotel employee told us we had to get up because the chairs had to be collected by 6 PM. We protested to no avail......Whatever.....My wife and I travel extensively and have never been quite so disappointed. There are plenty of better places to stay in Waikiki.

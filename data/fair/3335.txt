The public spaces in this boutique hotel are absolutly charming. The location is superb, in the quiet section of the French Quarter, and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The room we had (#22), however, left a lot to be desired: it was very dark, two large windows looked out into a very narrow alley which prevented much light from coming in; paint was blistering on the walls and ceiling; the stain on the floor was badly scratched; the bathroom was tiny and in need of updating and the noise from the hallway was very loud since there were gaps between the two doors to the room. At $396.50 (including taxes), we felt this was a very poor value and would look for a different place in the same area next time.

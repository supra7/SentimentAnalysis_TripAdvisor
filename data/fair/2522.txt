It has definite pros: the location is great, the lobby is beautiful, the staff was pleasant and professional. However, I have NEVER stayed in such a stripped-down room ANYWHERE. The bathroom is tiny, with a pedestal sink and no counter. Shampoo, conditioner and soap ONLY. No lotion. No shower cap. No coffee. No wet bar. No free internet. Paper-thin walls through which we could easily overhear our neighbors' conversations. The whole place is torn up right now - one entrance open, no fitness center to speak of, workers, tarps, and paint fumes galore. If you're thinking Hilton = four star luxury like I was, you are so wrong. DO NOT pay anything close to rack rate. If I hadn't gotten such a deal on the rate, I would have been furious.

We are frequent users of the HI and a member of their Priority Club, My family had been planning this vacation for months and we had been trying to narrow down our choices between the Hilton and the two HIs. Since we are familiar on how the HI operates it won over the Hilton. BIG MISTAKE! First , staff at front desk is rude and could care less about taking care of customers, Second, we have priority check in, HA! non existent here! third, the pool bar was selling alcohol descriminatorilly, I swear I could easily have bought my daughter a drink and nobody would have had noticed! fourth , the beds were hard and uncomfortable and so were the pillows. We have stayed at other HI as mentioned before but at this hotel ouch so beware! On one of the nights someone above our room was moving furniture all night long, I am a light sleeper , so I was drifting in and out of sleep, I mentioned it to someone at the front desk the next morning and to see if the would at least gives us a small break and what she said was that if it happens again tonight call us and we will go and tell them to stop!! no apology ! nothing... on the day of check out even thinking that we have given them more than a grand , my husband said thank you to they clerk that checked us out TWICE all she did was IGNORED HIM so he said it again , and once again she totally IGNORED HIM. So sad! HI so sad , next time we are thinking of going down the road to the Hilton. More money, but when you go to vacation You expect to be taken care of and we did not feel that way tthis place. The view is beautiful , But overall , We will not be coming back here . neither will recommend it to anyone.

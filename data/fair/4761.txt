I stayed at the hotel for two days. Booked at Hotwire and got a very good deal. Despite the delay at check in, the first impression of the hotel was amazing. The front desk could not find my reservation. Partly it was my fault. I booked only one day in advance and didn't print the confirmation page. The attendant was very helpful, but took too long to solve the problem. After overcoming the initial difficulty with the check in, the first impression with the room was great. Extremely spacious and very comfortable. The bed in particular is very good. The beach in front of the hotel is not so nice, but in a few minutes walk you get one a lot better. Just had a single meal at the hotel. Still, I approve the service. Quality and a reasonable value. The first day was great and the hotel seemed to be perfect. On the second day, however, I began to see the flaws. Something happened that today I find quite funny but messed up my hole day. I was stuck in the bathroom for 40 minutes. The old lock broke and crashed. It took a while for my girlfriend to call the customer service and even more for them to come get me out of the bathroom. In the end we still had to wait 30 minutes while they changed the lock on the door. The worst however was yet to come. Despite bedroom suite seem very clean. We were not alone in the room. I think cockroach and spider do not match a 4.5-star hotel. I could not believe it. So I had to take some pictures. I know I had very bad luck. It should not happen often, but that is the story.

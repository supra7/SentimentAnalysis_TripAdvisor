We've seen three rooms. Last one was great. I want to write that now that I see more photos of the hotel, it might be a good one. But we only saw the good room after we complained a lot about bein locked out in the basement. It might have been all a series of unfortunate accidents. But the thing is that we ended up in a room without a key, down in the basement (room 1), no much light from the outside and windows and door that would not keep the warmth in. After two nights we were moved to a room with carpeted floor, which was against health conditions for us (duly noted in our reservation). The fourth night we were in the good room (18, if interested, at the end of the entrance corridor). That is the big one. It has space, it hast sofa, coffee table,... Nice. We ended up having a good time. I guess it is a good place if you get a good room. Transportation connections are excellent and the neighborhood quiet and with many little shops and dining places.

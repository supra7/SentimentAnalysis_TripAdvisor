We have stayed here several times. The last over Christmas. Great value for the money and nice pool. Can't beat the free parking. Rooms are clean and we have only had one issue and that was with workers partying in the suite next to ours. It is nice to let the help have rooms over the Holidays but illegal activities were going on. Still all in all we will use it again.

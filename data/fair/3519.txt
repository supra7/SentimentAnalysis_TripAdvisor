While the location is very good and the place tried to be 'hip', the rooms are really below what one would expect for a W hotel. The room is very small, the bed is small, the shower is below average, the elevator got stuck and the acoustics are poor. The hotel staff attempt to make it up by offering Champagne upon check in but I would rather they spend the time upgrading the hotel. Avoid if possible.

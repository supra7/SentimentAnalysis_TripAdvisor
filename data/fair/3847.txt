We stayed 3 nights at the Gaslamp Plaza Suites. The price was reasonable & it was in a great location. Breakfast was included on the rooftop, consisting of cold cereals, juice, coffee & bagles or bread. The furniture was a bit worn, especially the sofa sleeper. Had a microwave, little bar & mini refrigerator. The downside was it was right in the middle of the nightlife section. At night it was crawling with people bar hopping & partying until after 2 AM & we stayed in the middle of the week. There was a bar with a loud band playing that vibrated the windows until the wee hours of the morning. So, if you're a very sound sleeper, I guess this place would work for you, otherwise find a quiter location. Kris H. Colorado

We have been staying at the Cow Hollow, Coventry, and Chelsea Motor Inns every time we visit San Francisco (2-3 times a year) for the past 20 years. For the last 15 years, we have been staying exclusively at the Cow Hollow. We like the neighborhood (lots of good restaurants) and appreciate the free parking and the reasonable price. Over the years, however, the service and room quality has declined. Until the last few years, the service was good and if, at check in, the hotel could not meet requests for floor and room type, they apologized and did the best they could to accommodate you. This is no longer the case. Our last 3 stays have involved very perfunctory even unpleasant experiences at check in. The front desk now has all the charm of an airport ticket counter, with the same adversarial, hurried feeling. When I asked if anyone had even read our request for the 3rd floor, I was told with a shrug "we are very popular now." When we checked out, I noticed many welcome bags on the back counter and got the impression that the hotel caters to groups and does not really care about individual travellers anymore. The rooms are reasonably sized but have gotten a little worn looking, with scuffed furniture, somewhat worn mattresses, and the occasional stains on the carpets. If you can get a room in the back on the 2nd or 3rd floor, the hotel is still a good deal, but if you end up on Steiner St. or worse yet on Lombard St. you'd better not mind lots of traffic noise. We may stay at the Cow Hollow again, but are also motivated to seek a new place in SF.

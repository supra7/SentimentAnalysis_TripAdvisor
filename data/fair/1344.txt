Horrible hotel would never stay there again. The staff was friendly and very helpful which was nice, was in a good location, but was dirty. When i say dirty i mean i dont think they change there sheets or wash the showers. My fiance and i stayed her overnight for one night and ended up sleeping on the couch and the chair in the living area part of the room (we were in a suite) And the only reason we were in a suite was because they gave us a new room after we found pubic hairs in our first rooms bed in the sheets!!!!!!!!!! Then at 5 a.m they switch our room for us because there was noone available to bring us new sheets and when i asked if i could come down and get them she said they had none.. HUH???!?! Suprise Suprise no clean sheets, well i wasnt so suprised they had no clean ones considering ours were dirty!! When we finally got to the new room we just wanted to hop in bed. So we did and what do we find a stain on the bed and more Hair!!!!!!!!!!!! it was evrywhere so we took the extra sheets in that room that they had for the extra bed and went to put them on and they also had hair on them!!!!! HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!!!! Every blanket sheet and bed in there had hair on it! Worst experience of my life, my neck still hurts from sleeping on the coach and i deffinetly would not reccomend and suggest if you do stay here to look over the entire bed before hoping into thinking your getting a good nights rest!!

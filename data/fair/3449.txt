I stayed in New York in 2006 for 6 nights, a beautiful experience if I would not consider the hotel. Loooking back now, I am aware that 120 USD/night (the paid price) is very low for Manhattan and for the convenient location of Larchmont (in Greenwich Village, nice, quiet, more European style) and that you will not get anything better for this money in NY. However I was very disappointed and felt that the advices on traveladvisor are a little bit overreacted when giving great marks to this hotel. I was a little bit worried about the shared bathroom, but this was not a problem, at it was quite clean. Problems were: - the smell in the hotel - the tiny rooms with no natural light (we had a huge block 1 meter or less from our window so we were barely able to see something outside or to catch the sunlight) - the old furniture in the rooms (I guess they were refurbished somewhere in the '60es) - the extraold A/C which made a lot of noise (made me feel somewhere in the dessert of Mexic, not in the stylish NY) - the horrible breakfast (1 muffin and 1 juice or 1 coffee- tried it once, never returned back in the basement for breakfast) Again, maybe you pay the location because otherwise I would not give half the amount for a hotel which in my opinion does not deserve even one star.

If you check in during the evening, you are greeted with thumping music from an area next to Reception and also by some not very interested staff. That sets the tone for your stay. I suppose that W hotels are an acquired taste: lighting such that your room and the corridors are always dark and shadowy; ghastly background music everywhere. They have business facilities but I would not class the general ambience of this hotel as attractive to business people. The location is fine. The rooms are OK (apart from the lighting). Service levels are below average (perhaps staff morale is low or leadership is lacking - who knows the background?). When I checked out, there was another guest complaining about staff not keeping their promises.

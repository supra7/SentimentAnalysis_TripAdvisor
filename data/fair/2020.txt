We waited over 2 hrs in the lobby for our room to be available when checkin time was at 4pm. Front desk help were snooty and couldn't have cared less. Finally got to our room around 6pm, but someone had smoked in it, so now we needed to change rooms again. They also had messed up our reservation dates. As a loyal Marriott rewards customer, this place was a HUGE disappointment. It is too big and impersonal. Room service dishes were left in hallways for 4 days until I called the front desk and complained. Only saving grace was the hotel's prime location. If given a choice, I would NOT stay here again.

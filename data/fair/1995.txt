The room was basically clean (with the exception of shower curtain and bathtub drain plug). It was very tiny (barely enough room for the two beds), but had a mini-fridge and microwave (but no alarm clock). My biggest complaint was the in-room A/C unit. You had to keep the door (to the non-existent balcony) open in order for it not to generate more heat than cold (it wasn't vented, so this was the only way to vent it). So, I heard street noise, all night, while trying to sleep there (including a early morning garbage truck and all-hours sirens). Did not get a good night's sleep here, and would not stay here again.

We were here for a meeting recently. The facility is very large and a little flashy, but our room was lovely and overlooked the ocean. Maid service was excellent and towels were changed twice a day. We did not see hoards of people milling about inside of the hotel - no lines at reception or crowds of people in the lobby or bar areas. There was an entire bank of concierge desks to help you. We never had to wait for an elevator. We called ahead for our car, so it arrived usually when we did. We did not see lines of people in the front of the hotel waiting for cars or taxis. They are very efficient in that respect. The hotel itself is quite peaceful inside. However, once you get outside to the pool and beach areas, all of that changes. It becomes another world. The beach is overcrowded, with people sitting practically on top of each other. You really must get out there by 8 or 9 am to insure that you secure chairs on the beach, and after the attendants set you up, the service ends. No one comes around to take a drink order. Also, unless you pay $94 a day for a cushioned lounge chair with a canopy, there is little shade at the pool. There are several places to have lunch outside, but the food is like airline food and you are served unceremoniously on paper plates. One presumably comes to Hawaii for the sun and beaches and not to stay inside, but I found it much more pleasant to sit on my room balcony and look out over the ocean instead of being herded below. The inside of the hotel is quiet like a spa, and the pool and beach areas are like Macy's at Christmas. Therefore, I cannot recommend this hotel.

This hotel looked good on paper. I wanted a hotel with a courtyard and a pool - real New Orleans flavor. This is not it! The room was tiny and the air conditioning could't even keep it comfortable. The room was musty. There is no lobby except 2 chairs in front of the desk. The pool was small and the courtyard so tiny you could fall in the pool trying to get around it. I don't see what the positive reviewers saw. Maybe they have nothing to compare it to. I say don't waste a great trip on this place.

I don't think I can adequately emphasize the weather situation at the Ritz in Kapalua. While the hotel itself is very nice, the weather is enough to ruin a trip there. We were there about 4 days for our honeymoon and it was windy and/or rainy every day. Even on sunny days, the wind woudl blow the book out of my hand. On morning, we woke up to clouds/rain and departed for our surfing lesson in Lahaina (15 min south). It was totally sunny in Lahaina when we arrived there! We wish we would have paid more attention to what the guide books say about the weather in Kapalua - we likely would have stayed elsewhere. While the Ritz had great rooms and nice facilities, they didn't really do anything to make us feel special (and they knew it was our honeymoon). We had just come from the Hyatt in Kauai, which sent us complementary champagne twice during our visit there. Something like that at the Ritz would have been nice.

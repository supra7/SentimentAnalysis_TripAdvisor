I read the bad reviews about the parking situation at the Peabody Orlando but I stupidly went ahead and booked a special rate anyway for a 4-day stay over Memorial Day weekend. I won't go into all of the details (unless you want to e-mail me), but the hotel managenet is certainly aware of the series of horrible events that occurred on the Saturday night of Memorial Day weekend. I asked for, and received, a full refund of all parking charges for the duration of my stay. One has to wonder if the Belz family (who owns the Peabody) cares about all of the complaints about parking? The fact that these issues have continued for months without being addressed is a matter of true concern. If you are invited to a dinner party at the Belz family home, I would not give your mink coat to the butler upon arrival. Because upon departure, you will undoubtedly be left out in the cold on the front portico while they try to find your wrap! If you must stay at the Peabody for a convention, I would advise a cab or shuttle from the airport. The parking situation and the constantly stalled traffic on International Drive should be avoided at all costs. For a vacation experience, a true 4-5 star experience would more likely be had by booking the Ritz or the Grand Bohemian.

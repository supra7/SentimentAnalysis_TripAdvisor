We went on a 10 day trip to Seattle and the surrounding area and stayed at the Hotel Andra 3 nights. The room was nice and even had a safe in the room for security while away. However, I would not stay at this hotel probably ever again. It is located down the street from a hospital and consequently ambulance sirens occur quite frequently. We were on the 9th floor and could easily hear every siren go by, all night long - every night. If you stay here, bring some earplugs as that's what we had to use to get a nice sleep. The parking lot across the street is used for Sat. night parties as well, for even more noise. Ice was out on our floor and reported, still no ice 6 hours later.

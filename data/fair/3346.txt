This hotel has an excellent location , great breakfast, nice rooms, and a wonderful next door restaurant, but have a very bad front desk attitude, we stay a weekend my husband reserved this for our aniversary, in all the weekend was very bad front desk service they don't be friendly or even they can not tell you anything about the area where to go , one clerk was talking just that the area was not safe, for us was safe enough, then at night saturday we request some towels and shampoo and the clerk said that she wasn't sure where to find them , then I came down just to relax and she was very rude she told me that they usually don't have guest at night in the lobby, so my husband and I where so upset with the service, then the next night was another clerk very funny she was talked to us very nice and told us that she was not affected to have guest down stairs that she really like have contact with the guest and try to help them and also she told us that the area is very safe just as a regular city but that she never have any kind of issue, we can say that this nice lady save our impression of the place, but the location is in a very nice area very safe, and also the street car run infront of the hotel, the housekeeping was very friendly my husband said that it cuold be because those clerks were very young for the position or maybe they really don't like their job !!!!!! very clean place!!!!!!

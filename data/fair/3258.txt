The Hotel was in a great location... Easy walk to Bourbon Street, Harrahs, and a Trolley stop. The concierge Joey was wonderful however that is about all the positives I can say about this hotel. The front desk staff was less than helpful and the room was a 2 star hotel for a 4 star price. Room was dingy and my view was of someone else's balcony. Overall, I would never stay here again.

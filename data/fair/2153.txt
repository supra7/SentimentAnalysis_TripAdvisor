I must say this among the worst hotel to stay. They charged me USD 320 per day without breakfast and were poor in all sence. Smallest room size as if you are staying in a store. I would rate this hotel as one hotel which is just charging for its location. Guys please do not stay here. Only good thing was breakfast which they charges USD 26 separately apart from this it is all [--]. Television remote not working... enter the room and you end up lying on the small 4*6 bed not even double bed, old building at a great location.

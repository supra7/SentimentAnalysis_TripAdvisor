Me, my two daughters and five grandkids stayed at this hotel June 26th thru 29th. This was our first time in Ocean City. We arrived a little early but our rooms were not ready. We knew that check-in wasn't until 3 p.m. but we just tried anyway! Our rooms were ready around 3:10 p.m. The check-in staff were friendly. We had two oceanfront suites--they were a little dated, but clean. The beds were extremely hard!! The rooms had no ironing board or iron. But instead had a small laundry room on the second floor, where you could iron. They didn't have any toiletries, but had wall mounted dispensers for hand soap and body/hair shampoo??? I didn't have any problems with the cleaning staff, but my daughters said they were very unfriendly to them when they asked for more towels for the kids. The hotel staff, in general was friendly but a little stand-offish. I have stayed at my share of motels and hotels, but for some reason I felt very uncomfortable in this one. My daughter and I went to the pool bar--the bartender was not friendly at all; we asked about drink specials--he acted as if we were bothering him! We ordered mojitos--which cost $5 and were terrible!!! We did eat at the restaurant at the hotel--The Skipjack; the food was very good and the staff there were so friendly and pleasant that we went back a couple of times! Ocean City had a lot to do on the boardwalk, so my grandkids had a great time. This hotel is on the boardwalk, but I don't think I will stay here again.

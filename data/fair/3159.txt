You can do SOOO much better... The Marseilles looks like a Deco gem from the outside...crinolated windows, an imposing porch. But this is the Fawlty Towers of South Beach! Inside, half of the rooms are remodeled, half aren't...and they all have issues...air-conditioning not working, elevators that stop halfway between floors. Hotel also tends to be louder than others in the area, and isn't that good a deal when you consider that the excellent, clean, cheap South Seas is next door....we stayed there right after the Marseilles, and preferred it by yards...

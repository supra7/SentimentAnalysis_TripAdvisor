Got the room on priceline for $70/night with taxes and fees. Considering the price, one shouldn't expect much. It's worth it though to pay a few extra bucks to stay somewhere closer to town. Had to drive at least 10 minutes before any restaurants/shops. Also rooms are totally delapitated and not insulated. Toilet kept refilling all night. Could hear birds chirping all night through the walls. Only half the buildings are used - other half are shut down. Staff was very nice and pleasant. If you want a dirt cheap room on Maui and you don't care about being close to anything and don't need a room with much more than a bed and a bathroom that feels like it's outdoors, then this is the place for you.

We were on the 3rd floor in what I suspect was the old staff quarters. Old furniture, old tv, old everything. One wall of our room was against the stairs and we were awakened the first morning around 7 am by the echoing sound of loud footsteps clomping up and down for about an hour. We assumed that they were delivering coffee to the rooms or guests checking out. Our neighbors must have been on their honeymoon and we heard all about it morning and night if you know what I mean! There is no mini bar, no bottle of water, not even a q-tip available. I couldn't tell if the room was clean or didn't feel clean because it was so old. The elevator was the size of a shoe box and was not always available as people would not close the gate and door after using. So, we made many trips up and down the stairs. I have heard that other rooms are very nice and charming. But for the $380.00 we spent, we would have been better off almost anywhere else. The dying cock roach on the floor the last morning we were there didn't exactly add to the old New Orleans charm that we had hoped to experience. I could never recommend this hotel to anyone and if you see a picture don't be deceived by it. Make sure you ask for that room in the photo you see if you want to stay in this hotel.

Displays dusty needs refreshing. Curtains in shreds, bathrooms need complete reno. Now I know why there use to be elevator operators, don't plan on going down to get coffee, you need a sherpa. The beds were comfortable, the fireplace necessary, the wall paper over powers the decor. All in would say I would make another choice if I were to re-visit.

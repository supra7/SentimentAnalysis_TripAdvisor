Starting off we were charged an EXTRA 25$ per night for parking (and that was discounted because we were staying in the hotel) For the price we paid... it should have been free. No drop off area.. you have to stop traffic on the street. The lobby was beautiful and love that it was connected to a coffee shop. The lady at the front desk was not welcoming or very nice. The rooms were WAY TOO small and old timey. The locks didn't work and doors/light switches were oddly placed. And I was woken up in the middle of the night by the cleaning crew. It was a good location I guess... We could have stayed somewhere bigger for the same price, and will next time.

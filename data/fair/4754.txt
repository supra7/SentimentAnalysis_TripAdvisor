All I can say is "dont do it", save your money and go somewhere else. Upon arrival, after requesting a King bed, non to be had unless I had an extra $89. per night, happy 26th anniversary dear in that bed way over there. To the maybe 5 gallon hot water tank (its in the trick cupboard under the fridge, that I must say was restocked maybe twice) couldnt even finish washing my hair with luke warm water. The workers were awesome with great tips on where to go (away from the resort for fun). Yawn, yawn. Too bad some of the whinny kids werent doing a little more yawning, cause they were a little annoying. Parents today, when kids are tired, order room service, in general people arent interested in listening to your whinning demanding kids at dinner. Maybe send them to grandmas so you too can relax. Or take a lesson from the locals, never heard any of their kids whining. This is my 4th trip to this area and maybe the other resorts did a better job at keeping the young ones in their own little area, but I dont recall being annoyed at almost every meal with crying kids. Which in turn effected the night life, everyone was in their rooms with their children. Hence no night life, I may be 50 but this place was a real drag. Other than the pool by the beach by day, there really wasnt anything to do but lay around. I too like to relax but I also like to have some fun. The available toys, oh right there were non. Sticking to the larger resorts from now on, at least they have things to do. One advantage to nothing to do, meant we left often, that was when I enjoyed myself . The beach was okay, just dont go in the water without water shoes, all the sand has washed away and its rocky first step in. Go to Playa if you want a real beach.

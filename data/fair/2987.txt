The exorbitant cost of extras was astounding, even by Ritz standards. First of all there is a daily "resort fee" which is not disclosed until check-in. We decided to eat all meals off-campus after our first morning, when a totally ordinary buffet breakfast for two totaled more than $50. A restaurant recommendation made by the concierge was clearly a kickback arrangement with nauseatingly disgusting food and equally obnoxious prices. After paying roughly $17 for two beers later in the week, I had reached my tolerance threshold. Added to the hotel's poor location in the heart of the "condoville" ticky-tacky region of North Maui and its lack of easy beach access, the experience failed to meet expectations.

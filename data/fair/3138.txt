Not Pleased Customer Service was bad.The bar in room did not work for the 5 day we were there.We told them it did not work each day and thery did nothing about it.We had to get ic to keep our water cold. Sometime the ice machine did not work.The bathroom was not clean, the tub and sink was not clean. Y ou had to take a shower,because there was no way to keepthe water in the tub. There was no stoper for the tub.The T.V. should be up dated.Also there should be mirowaves in the rooms. You should have contional breakfests.

Let me say this upfront: we got a room there for about a quarter of the normal price on Hotwire.com. For that price it was a perfect bargain. If you are going to pay the going rate for this hotel I would go else where. Your money will get you a clean room (a little bit small but hey it is Boston) and polite staff and that is it. Just about everything else costs extra. For a premium quality hotel I was surprised that they didn't offer free internet access, had a limited cable offering, and the prices for breakfast in your room were ridiculous ($23 for toast and juice? you're kidding me right?). You'd think for the rate of a premium hotel they might have have at least upgraded the soaps or something. If you want to stay in Boston and are looking to splurge on a stay look for another premium brand, the Langham wasn't any better than any of the higher end chains that cater to the business traveler (minus the amenities).

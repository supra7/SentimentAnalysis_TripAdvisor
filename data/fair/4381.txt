I was at this hotel as part of a tour and was a little concerned after having read some of the reviews. I was however pleasantly surprised the hotel room while a little small was clean warm and comfortable It was quite dark in the hallways and rooms there needs to be better lighting but I cant complain about the room. The staff and the bar was very nice and well appreciated after long days of looking around New York. On my last night though I had major problem I had booked a wake up call first thing in the morning and double checked it again when I arrived back at the hotel which the staff had confirmed. However I never received it and ended up missing my train to Niagara falls and losing out on my pre-paid accommodation. (all up this missed wake up call costed me about $600aus). I received no apology and no real reason as to why the wake up call had been missed. Considering I had received all of my other wake up calls on time I was thoroughly frustrated as to why I never got this one. The hotel would have been great except for that major mistake.

Although not informed at booking or during several calls to the hotel, our request for adjoining rooms lost us 50 sq. So instead of our usual Starwood upgrade, we were downgraded. No free rollaway or breakfast coupons compensated for the cramped space. Our final bill listed a $148 charge for touching sensored mini-bar items, which resulted in a ten-minute dispute at the reception desk. We needed 3 replacement keys, resulting in being locked out of a room with a baby inside (in a crib, thankfully). Dry cleaning took 3 calls and an extra day to get returned. The hotel took 2 hours for the rollaway and crib to arrivecrying baby waiting. The bathroom was better suited for contortionists. The check-in associate asked me to write a good review on TripAdvisor and use her name, which she wrote on my key card. The W on Lexington Ave. has a long way to go to match our usually satisfying Starwood hotel experience.

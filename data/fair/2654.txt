Everything looked like a Hilton when we pulled up to the hotel. The check-in was a nice and easy process. We all noticed when we first pulled up that the Valet check-in was running quite behind. They took about 20 minutes to get our luggage and our car, but since we were already driving for about 12 hours, it was not even a thought in our mind. Once we checked in, we were offered an upgrade for $40 a night for an oceanfront room, we accepted the offer and gladly checked in. Once in the room, we noticed the non-upgraded rooms that still had old tv's, no refrigerators, and not a Hilton type look in the room. I, along with the rest of my travelers, have stayed at multiple Hilton hotels each year and have always had better accommodations than what we were staying in. We honestly didn't have great expectations since it was on the beach, but with a Hilton name, we expected a lot better quality than what we received. We had no washcloths for 3 days in a row. When we called down each day, they asked if we had them to return....the housekeeping took them everyday but never put new ones back in place of the used. Each time we called down for washcloths or any other request, they took over an hour to respond. Along with the housekeeping, the shower had the same areas of mold after asking the housekeeping staff to try to remove it. They never removed in throughout our stay. The valet would tell you that the car would be ready in 10 minutes, but when we walked down over 20 minutes later, they hadn't even retrieved the car after we had called 20 minutes beforehand. If you want a hotel with a name, stay here, but don't expect anything over a Holiday Inn quality. There are a lot more hotels on the strip next to the Ocean Walk area that would offer better service than this hotel. We all hope that the Hilton bought this hotel for its location and not for its service. They have great lengths to grow before they can ever imagine calling themselves a Hilton hotel.

After looking for hotels in the SD area, we decided on Pacific Terrace, eventhough it was over priced, we wanted to enjoy the the beach instead of staying in downtown. The overall stay was "okay." The staff was very friendly, and the continental breakfast was alright, not great. What really bothered us, was the AC. My husband likes it very cool in our room, and the AC was not working properly, and it would get up to 82 degrees in the room. We called an had this worked on 3 times within 2 days. I would have appriceated if they offered to change the room, but they did not. The AC was still not working properly, upon our check out. We told the front desk upon check out what had happened during our stay, and she just smiled and said "sorry." Which leads me to beleive that this might be a common problem. I would expect staying at a pricey hotel, prolems like this would be handled better.

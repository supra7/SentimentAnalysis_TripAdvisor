we booked the room from one of these online services(ends up not being much cheaper than booking directly with the hotel after all the fees are tacked on), we didn't get the type bed we wanted or reserved when we finally checked in, and the clerk said there was no guarantee(even though it was pre-paid), plus the room had a heater that was so loud it vibrated the entire wall. So they gave us a different room the second night which was ok, and since we didn't pay for it in advance they wouldn't let us stay there our third night, as it was booked by someone else. doesn't make sense since we paid in advance for our first room, and basically got the schleppiest broken down room they had. So we went to the holiday Inn in the french quarter instead and it was much better. what a headache the Place d' Armes was! it is not a 5 star hotel by any means, you have to kiss [--] with the staff to get anything done, as they always know they will have business from unsuspecting tourists in the french 1/4.

Regardless of the fact that this is non-smoking hotel (or we had non-smoking room), the rooms smells like somebody smoked there for years. And, probably, not even cigarettes. It smells so that you even can not sleep first. Also, everything is a little bit broken in the room. Drawer, bath etc. You can use it, but it is broken a little. Very-very old hotel and everything there. Even people playing in the casino are old (!). And, from the window of our room we saw only parking )).

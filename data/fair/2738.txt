I stayed at the Fremont because I got into town very late and didn't want to spend a ton on a room I would only be in for a few hours. The experience was mixed at best. The staff was pleasant and check in was easy. Unfortunately, I was given a smoking room and I don't smoke. The room smelled horrible. The room was small with a tiny bathroom but this didn't bother me. Additionally, you get a lot of noise from the street below so if you are a light sleeper beware. Overall, I probably would not go back, room cleanliness or the lack there of is a deal breaker for me.

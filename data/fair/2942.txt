I just got back from the Ritz and the only word I can use to describe it would be disappointing. While the property is very nice, the rooms are only so so. Readers should not discount the wind. I cannot understate how much it howls on this side of the island if the tradewinds are up. We're not talking a light breeze, we're talking about winds that made it impossible to sit by the pool so if you are people that want to sit by the pool at your hotel you should not stay here. I found the restaurants to be pretty poor which isn't surprising for hotel restaurants but disappointing nonetheless. Kai was bland. The quality of the fish was only ok, and the menu was limited with no inventive rolls to speak of. The brunch at the Terrace restaurant was overall quite good, but there were little fruit flies over everything which shouldn't occur at a top line restaurant. Finally the service. This is what I was most disappointed with since this is what the Ritz is known for. No one went out of their way. We asked for good restaurant recommendations and their only suggestions were on property which is pretty frustrating. We got water the first day and then no water the rest of the time there, when we asked the front desk why they said the policy was to only provide it upon request. For what is supposed to be a top line service oriented hotel I thought this was pretty cheap and it infuriated me to no end because I've never had a similar response at any comparable high end property. Overall I would recommend that people stay someplace else either in Kaanapali or Wailea

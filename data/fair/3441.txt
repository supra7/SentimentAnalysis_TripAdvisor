Everything was fine until I had a question for the manager. The front desk attendant simply said, "I can't do anything, because I know it sounds ridiculous, but we have no manager and have not had one for the past three months." There was no one present who could handle a management situation. The attendant was rude and unreasonable about the request for simply finding a solution to my request. Just FYI.

My wife and I stayed here May 6-11. Within 12 hours after checking in, we were accosted by 3 different time share people which were hotel staff or dressed as hotel staff. What seemed to be nice and friendly staff were just attempting to lure you in to their presentation, wasting our valuable vacation time. Our rooms voicemail also started filling with lures and hooks to visit their hunter-gathers. By day 2, we basically stopped responding to staff (except for housekeeping, valet etc as they were the only normal people there) and stopped listening to voicemail. It was a very annoying way to start our 15 year anniverary vacation. We were also offered the "free upgraded room". Read the review on "Nice, but be wary of a free upgrade" as it is totally accurate. Luckily my friend informed me of the "up on the cliff" rooms before I went, so I cancelled and downgraded my room. Excellent call on my friends part. Room was good. The room safe kept breaking, but maintenance came out everyday to get my stuff out. View from the standard ocean front was spectacular. Beach: Awesome. In previous trips, we stayed at the nearby condos and other hotels and walked to Black Rock. Grounds: Great, but we've been to better.

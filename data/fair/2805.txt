The location and design of the hotel is great, but the staff and service that is offered is definitely lacking. Although the hotel is expensive to start with, it is loaded with hidden fees. I understand that it should be expected to pay a lot for a little in Hawaii, but some of the fees were ridiculous. They don't tell you this, but it is $20 dollars a day to valet your car and they do not offer any other parking. There is a daily resort fee for pool use and you are charged if you use the gym. Also the management of the hotel is rude and unhelpful. We were booked to have a late checkout because we were flying a red eye out. They acknowledged that we booked this when we checked in, but on our last day they notified us that we had to leave by 1:00. We met with the manager, Jane Valdez, and we were met with hostility. She spoke down to us and had quite an attitude. We felt as if we were swept aside once we had paid our bill. Overall, the beautiful Hawaiian setting that the Grand Wailea has can be found elsewhere and with better service, especially for the price you are paying.

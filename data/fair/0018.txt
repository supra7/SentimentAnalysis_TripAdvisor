We booked our room through Hotels.com and when we arrived the hotel could not locate the booking. They would not give us another room, even though they had availability and made us wait in the lobby for 45-min until they finally located the reservation. They then said they were going to move us to a smoking room and I showed them on my iphone that we had booked a non-smoking room. They said they would not guarantee room type through third parties and if we wanted a non-smoking room it would cost an additional $30 per night. We paid the "upgrade" after they advised they would not give us any other options. It was also clear that the staff had some battle going on as they were not nice with the people checking in or the people that came to the front desk for assistance. The room we received was nice, however we had other options available at the price they charged. Parking was also $27 per night. There are enough hotels in the area that you do not have to stay here. All in all, the trip to Spokane from Seattle was great.

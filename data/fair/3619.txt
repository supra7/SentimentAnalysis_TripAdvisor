We were here for a conference so we didn't have a choice where we stayed - If you do have a choice - choose another hotel. My husband put it best - it's Barbie sized! The rooms are TOO small. We shuffled around trying not to bump into each other! Our bathroom only had a shower - no tub and the beds are queen-sized and not very comfortable. It seems the more you pay for a property the less you get. No coffee in the room - 2 in the lobby will set you back $7.00. For the price, I'd rather be at the Omni - which was less actually.

I am always amazed when I read reviews that rave about a hotel/resort that I have stayed at and found to be a dump! I wonder how my taste and expectations could be so different from some of the reviewers on Tripadvisor. I was familiar with the resort from having dined at their restaurant many times, so I decided to stay there for a few nights. The reviews and the photos of the rooms looked quite nice. But, you really can't always trust or believe what you read. Our room had a wonderful view, no doubt. But the room itself was like a cheap motel room, every aspect of it was dingy. The bed is not uncomfortable but it is your standard cheap bed with no pillow top, The shower, towels, furniture, kitchen items we cheap and dingy, the same as you would find in an old motel. As others have stated, there is no air conditioning, which isn't such a big deal at night, but during the day, it does make a difference because the humidity can be high in Maui. There is no elevator, so you schlep your bags up and down stairs, the carpets are old, worn and dirty. There are more "rules" than I am comfortable with having when I am staying at a resort, you have to give a key to get a towel, you have to bring the towel back or be charged $20, and that's just the beginning of the rules. In this economy, you can find a nicer place to stay at similar or better rates. However, this is a resort that obviously can please people, but it definitely is not for me. It does not add up, I didn't find it comfortable or cheery to be in and if you go to the Hawaiian Islands, there are better choices.

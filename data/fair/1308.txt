We stayed here for one night to get an early morning eurostar the next day. It started well, the automatic check-in was very quick and the powerful air con in the room was a blessing as it was a very muggy day. However, when we came to use the sink, it was horribly, disgustingly blocked. Water just wouldn't drain out at all and debris from within the plug started flowing back into the sink! Really disgusting. Similarly horrible was the sight of the cup of tea we tried to make, more scum than tea and was undrinkable. The next morning, I went to the reception to get a hairdryer and nobody would come to the desk, despite me ringing the bell several times and could very clearly hear someone moving around in the nearby office. The breakfast fare was good but served in a dingy basement room. We have stayed in Travelodges on a number of occasions and each time, I get a little bit more fed-up of them. I have now vowed not to use them again as they do not represent good value for money in my opinion.

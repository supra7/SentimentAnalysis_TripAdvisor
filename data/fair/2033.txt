We were on holiday and we decided to go for a top-rated expensive hotel in Boston. We first tried the Lenox, which was delightful. The Boston Marriott couldn't have been more different. From the 20th floor you get a superb view of Boston, but your room is box-like with thin walls and noise can carry from the neighbouring room. The decor is smart and pleasant but the rooms have no character. Internet isn't free (which I think many holidaymakers find infuriating) and costs around 12 dollars unless you use the lounge area where it is free. There is no proper residents' lounge - it resembles an airport departure lounge and at around midnight an officious hotel employee shouted at my sons (aged 18 and 21) to leave the lounge because it was closing. There was in fact little sign of respect or consideration for the customer - we might as well have been at an airport. Lots of people on conferences were drinking and networking and maybe it's ideal if you're on a conference with an expense account. For a family on holiday it felt unpleasant and unwelcoming. Breakfasts were excellent and there was plenty of good food. Valet car parking at 40 dollars a day but I hear it's worse in some other US cities. If you have the choice, choose the Lenox.

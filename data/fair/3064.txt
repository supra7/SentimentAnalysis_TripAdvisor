Definitely love the location have stayed here 4 times over the years. However really it comes down to the room you get. The newer tower is the Ocean Tower and the rooms are significantly larger (I'd approximate by 30%) over the older tower. FYI: The older tower is the building with the main entrance. Ocean view rooms are better in the older tower fro noise purposes these have even numbered room numbers. Odd numbers face the parking lot and the NOISE of people coming and going and car alarms etc. I've lucked out with rooms and really have only continued to stay here because the staff has been gracious and willing to swap rooms etc. to help me minimize noise issues. Kudos Westin Maui Team! Anyway a few other tips..the resort fee (currently $25) is a deal given it includes internet access, self parking, the gym and two bottle of water each day. So at first i was a bit miffed at this fee but given what it includes think it's fair. The Ocean Tower can suck if you have a room facing away from the pool towards Whaler's village (odd numbered rooms) as you get the restaurant "smell" - think sizzling steak aroma. So long story short (OK too late for that) don't get an ODD numbered room at this resort.

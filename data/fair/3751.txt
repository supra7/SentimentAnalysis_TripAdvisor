I booked the hotel thinking it would be nice to stay in a place that advertises itself as a boutique hotel. Essentially the beds were not only extremely hard but very small. We had a room with 2 full beds with my husband, myself and my teenaged son. We normally sleep on a king bed so even queens are a bit small for us. The website says they have new serta sleeper beds - they may have been new but they were definitely the least expensive of the bunch! The next thing that was disappointing was that the in-hotel restaurant wasn't open on the weekend, even though it advertised that it was. Phoenix itself was not what I expected. It seemed like the city was closed for the weekend. We ended up driving 3 hours to Tombstone for the day because no one could tell us anything to do with our son for the day.

Hotel is excellently located to Magnificent Mile (5 mins walk), Navy Pier & Theatre district (15 mins walk). Rooms are good quality and clean, what you would expect from a four star business hotel. Gym is very well equipped (for a fee). Front Desk Staff were shockingly bad. Very unwelcoming and seemed like they did not want to be there. Concierge staff were snooty and were not very helpful. We were overcharged by $27 on a couple club sandwiches and drinks we ordered from room service. I would only stay at this hotel again if the room rate was really low.

We booked for three days. Yeah, like everyone else happy with the price we got. You thought Best Western that should be a nice place to stay. WRONG.!!!!. My first time in Chicago. And we get "greeted" has nothing to do with hotel. A very nice looking beggar hustled us out of money.Just to sit there and watch him give the same story to other people too.I'm thinking wow. The hotel does nothing about this. He did it to two other family's. We experienced about the same as some other reviews. No extra pillows,had to call for washcloths every night.The air conditions is awful.And the internet was sad. And the outlets are Old.Scary to plug your stuff into. NO we will never stay here again.We were happy to go to the Hyatt on the last night there in Chicago.I wish I would of read these reviews before booking. They need to read these reviews and fix their hotel.!!.

The staff was courteous and the location is excellent - right in the heart of the town of Calistoga. My husband and I were looking forward to a couple of relaxing days in a nice cottage. I especially wanted to be able to knit, read, and write thank you notes. The light in the cottage was terrible - impossible to knit and very hard to read. Although it was advertised as having a "breakfast" area, there was only one chair, and it was a low, living room type chair. There was no way to sit and eat at the tiny table. There was a private jacuzzi that was filled with leaves. I didn't feel like cleaning it so I never went in. We will not return to this place.

Looked to stay here after seeing several good reviews, and and pretty good prices on several websites, but could not find a site that didn't post hundreds of dollars in extra person fees. If you looked up a room for 4 people they would give you the price for the double and then in the summary show $300 in extra person fees making it well over the prices of any other hotel. $300 for extra people for 3 nights?! Bah! I would also look up 2 doubles for 2 people (sort of cheat the system) and they wouldn't even post rooms available for 2 beds unless it was 3 people or more and then charge you extra person fees on top of that. Expedia, Priceline, Momondo, Bing, all the same story. As 4 collage students looking to spend part of their spring break in Chicago, this is not the place for a good deal for an off season deal. Bummer.

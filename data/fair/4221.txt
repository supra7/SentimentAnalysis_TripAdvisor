Great location (on the beach), great room layout (mini kitchen and living area), great amenity layout (pool off the beach), but needs LOTS of work... Needs a ton of maintenance and a deep and thorough cleaning inside and outside -- including our room. Once the property is brought up to par, a checklist needs to be used by all Maintenance and Cleaning Staff (and Management needs to ensure that everything is checked off) every day to be sure that everything is clean, neat and tidy. BTW -- breakfast located onsite was the worst we have ever experienced. Needless to say, we did not eat there but one time. We were very disappointed in this property and will not stay there again.

We spent a week at the Sheraton. Yes, it is a nice hotel but a few things put a sour taste on the trip. The big one was that the Sheraton allows cruise ships to use the beach so you get this influx of people who spent a few hours on the beach and left it looking like a pig stye! right beside our beach chairs some people left about 20 cigarette butts in the sand as well as garbage. Really low class I thought! The other was that they charge you for absolutely EVERYTHING! Don't think that the coffee and paper is complimentary, it isn't. As well as the chairs at the beach or umbrellas, everything has a high rental cost to it. The food was good but EVERY meal came to $50.00 for 2 people at the hotel! No, it was ok to go once but with the better deals of the all inclusives in the Mayan Riviera, we would suggest to go to Mexico! Oh, and if you don't like Mexico because of the "timeshare" sellers, don't kid yourself....they do it at the Sheraton as well........

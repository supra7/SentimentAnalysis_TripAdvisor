In my last review I didn't recommend this hotel. But I got a good deal on Hotwire so I gave it a try again. My room this time was a bit higher up and seemed a bit less used. But I knew what was expecting me so no disappointment this time. However, a comment on how I was treated as a Hotwire customer: At arrival the receptionist girl noted somehow "ok you booked over Hotwire"... And we (me and my girlfriend) got a room with two separate beds (not that I really care about that, I just felt that this was done on purpose). I think that the girl at the reception tried to get somehow arrogant in the same sense as the hotel management in some replies here such as "we want to give people the opportunity to stay at our hotel which would not be able to afford it otherwise" (no exact quote but I read similar I believe). I could very well stay at your place but why should I pay more for that crap?

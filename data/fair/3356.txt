My husband and I stayed at the Frenchman the end of August. We were disappointed in the staff, they were cold and made us feel that we were bothering them. The rooms were small which was fine except we ended up sharing with the roaches for control over the bathroom. The only good thing about the room was the bed was comfortable. There breakfast consisted of donuts or bread for toasting some coffee and that was it, I received better in bed and breakfasts. The price was not worth it. I should have booked the Holiday Inn on Royal for less, at least I know what I would be getting. I have stayed in New Orleans over the years in may different places and this by far in the bottom of the list.

So we went up to Boston to see the Red Sox. We pull up at the valet, no valet parking we're told. The place was a zoo. There were hundreds of people in the lobbies both on the first and second floor. I had to walk from the other garage with my luggae, because as usual, they overbooked. The rooms have been chopped down by a third. I am so done with the Copley Marriot. I have stayed there over the years many times, but never again. Not for $329.00. Goodbye Copley marriot. Oh and the Sox lost.

I booked this hotel through Hotwire. I was looking for something near the Loop. This hotel was at least 2 miles south of the loop in a very rundown part of town. They do not offer any kind of shuttle even though they, at one time, listed a courtesy shuttle van on their website. The staff was of no help whatsoever in regards to restaurants in the area, etc. We were on the fourth floor and were able to hear music from the bar or party room throughout the night.

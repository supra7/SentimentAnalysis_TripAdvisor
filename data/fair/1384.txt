We stayed in room 2524 for four nights and were less than impressed. I get that the hotel isn't the Four Seasons, but there were some glaring details that were missing. The bad: 1)housekeeping was VERY stingy with coffee cups and drinking glasses. For a room with a "kitchenette" I would expect some kind of a supply of cups, paper even! Some of our glassware was dirty (sticky) 2) The flourescent light above the bed is horrendous and much too bright! 3) there is a bedside table on only one side of the king size bed 3) No bed stand lights 4) the light in the kitchenette is turned on by the switch around the corner in the hallway 4) even though the kitchenette has ample room to store plates etc, the plasticware and 2 plates were stored in the microwave.??? and there is no garbage can in the kitchenette! 5) there is very little room to store your clothes 6) only 5 clothes hangers (really) 7) we arrived at 4PM and were told our room wasn't ready (we waited about 15 min. until the front desk could contact housekeeping 8) Housekeeping is inconsiderate when cleaning the rooms, they were contstantly slamming the doors when going in and out of a room. 9) I got a dirty bath towel. Now for the good: 1)excellent location 2)good price 3)free bkfst (get there early) 4)free internet 5) great pool area

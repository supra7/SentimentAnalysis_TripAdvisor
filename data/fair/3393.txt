My husband and I stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown earlier this month. We arrived in NYC very early in the AM and they stored our luggage until our room was ready - shortly after 10:30 AM - hours before official check-in time! Throughout our 3 night stay we found staff to be very helpful and pleasant. This Comfort Inn is in a great location for attending the theater and not bad for exploring the city. And the price is certainly resonable for Manhattan. The room was clean, the bathroom was small but attractive, the shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water. The room was very small, however, and the mattress on our bed had seen better days - saggy in the middle. The bedspread was clean but very tired. The biggest problem was the noise from the hallway. Any time someone closed a door on the hall it reverberated in our room loudly enough to startle you out of a deep sleep. We turned on the AC fan to try and drown out the noise but it was not enough. The view from our window was of a brick wall about a foot away. This made the room dark and the lighting was not adequate enough to compensate for this. I would stay here again IF there was a room where the closing doors on the hall did not make me jump and the mattress was not sagging.

We recently stayed in a suite at this resort. First impression is that the hotel looks old and outdated. The exterior completely needs an overhaul. We checked in and the lobby was hot. I mentioned this to the desk clerk and he said it's always hot. Not good, in AZ the AC should be cold! The rooms were redone and looked nice. However, there were a few problems in the room. In a resort suite, there should be a full size mini fridge. There was only a "cooler" is what it was called by the clerk. Barely enough room to shove about 4 waters into because it was loaded with other items. The pillows were not even standard sized pillows, let alone oversized. They were mini pillows! I called down and asked for at least standard sized pillows, and housekeeping was less than helpful and almost irritated at my call. They said they only allow for two extra pillows per room. They did find two standard sized pillows and sent them up though. The TV's were small, around 15 inch or so. TV's nowadays should be large in a resort like this! The water park is fun for the kids, I will say that. However, the grounds were poorly maintained. There were weeds everywhere around the lazy river as well as trash all over. There was dirt caked on all the the entrances to the lazy river and walkways. It looked dirty and unkempt. There were large patches of gravel and dirt, where landscaping should have been. For a resort like this, it should be pristine. The lounge chairs were dirty and looked old as well. The food was good, but overpriced. Overall, the kids had fun, but if you're an adult used to nice resorts, this doesn't even compete. There is no feeling of luxury here, just a fun waterpark with a resort is trying to compete with nice resorts in AZ, but doesn't even come close. I would definitely consider staying elsewhere like the Westin Kierland or the Hilton Squaw Peak if you're looking for waterpark fun for the kids.

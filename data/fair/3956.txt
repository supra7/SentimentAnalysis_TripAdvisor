I won a priceline bid for two rooms at the Hotel Rex, bidding several months before our stay. I immediately called the hotel with my confirmation number, and they confirmed that we were booked for two rooms, each with one queen bed. Upon arrival at the room, the other couple in our party had no trouble checking in - getting a nice roome on the 7th floor with a queen bed. But when we tried to check in to the other room, they could find no record of our reservation - which, of course, should have been impossible given that I bid for both rooms at one time. When I tried to explain as much, the desk clerk actually told me to calm down. I have to figure that he's not long for this line of work when his first reaction to a screw-up by the hotel is to tell the customer to calm down. Once they managed to determine that we actually did have a reservation, they stuck us in tiny room on the second floor with one double bed. It was conveniently located just TWO steps from both the stairs and the elevator, so we could hear everyone coming and going. The single-pane glass in the windows also allowed us to hear everything that was going on in the street below, and the second floor location put is right at eye level with the street lights, so that it was nice and bright in our room all night long. Morals of the story - hope that you don't "win" this hotel through priceline - calling ahead to confirm your reservation doesn't actually mean that your reservation will exist when you get there. - If they do lose your reservation, you're not allowed to have any reaction to the situation. - don't book this hotel at all for more than one person if you are not fine with the idea of ending up with a double bed. - If you do end up in this hotel anyway, try to pursuede the desk clerk to put you on a high floor, as I'm sure this would help immensly with the noise and light from the street.

In many ways, this is a standard Westin hotel -- very comfortable bed, all the standard amenities, etc... It is, however, badly let down by two features. One is poor service. For example, if you drive up to the hotel following a GPS device's direction, you get to an entrance where there is no parking and no space to drop passengers off. When I rang the hotel to ask where I should park, they said "oh, yeah. We get this all the time from people who use a GPS system" before redirecting me to a different entrance. But the instructions were not on the website, and not in any of the emails that they sent to me welcoming me to the hotel. However, the bigger problem is the grasping nature of the hotel. I stay in probably a couple of hotels a week, many of them Westins, and have *NEVER* come across a charge for receving courier packages at a hotel before. To add insult to injury, when the package was delivered to the room, the bellboy refused to leave until he got a tip. This sullied an otherwise adequate hotel.

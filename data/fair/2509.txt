The Palmer House has a great location and a remarkable history. It is elegant, and especially so when decorated for the holidays. My stay got off to a bad start with a late arrival due to weather problems. At 2:30 in the morning, I was not eager to find problems, but when my smoke-free room on a smoke-free floor smelled badly of smoke, I was not happy. The person I talked to attributed it to smoke smell from another floor. I was too tired to argue. The next day, housekeeping put some sort of filter device in the room, and it helped a bit, but the room smelled for the 3-day stay. My room was in the rennovated section, but it was pretty basic. It was small with the usual comforts, except that there was not a coffee maker. Coffee requires a trip to the lovely but expensive restaurant or to Starbucks. The staff was cheerful and helpful, and my breakfasts in the hotel restaurant were good at the customary major city hotel prices. The Palmer House was fine, but next time I think I will look for soemthing else in Chicago.

If you want a million dollar view and a two bit room this is your place. Let me explain. We were handed our keys, do decent hotels still use keys? The outdoor stairs and walkway were dirty. The room smelled like an old shoe. Both my wife and I had little spiders waiting for us on the pillows of our twin beds. This initiated the bed bug check, found none.. The vaulted ceiling was the roof boards and it was obvious there had been a leak by the visible repair job. I have to say the view was fantastic once we moved the torn screen door out of the way. Hello 1980's the 19" diagonal TV still worked. Do I need to continue? A hotel is in the business of renting out clean and comfortable rooms. Mission not accomplished.

We did not enjoy our stay, nor were our issues resolved. Our toilet did not flush properly during the entire stay...it was disgusting. I actually had to use the bathroom in the hotel restaurant and go across the street to the mall to just use a restroom. The hotels response was that this happens because it is an old building and to call them when it happens. How embarrassing to call to have your toilet unplugged after every use! This was their best solution even after asking to change rooms to which I never even received a response to my request. Upon checkout, the manager said thank you for bringing it to his attention & engineering will fix it...that sure didn't make my stay any better, nor did it show me that the manager had any sort of empathy for our situation. The other issue was a yippy dog in the room next to us...how annoying...again, I complained but got no response. Hair in the bathroom too-ewww! I would not recommend this hotel, as I know you can get a better value & experience elsewhere.

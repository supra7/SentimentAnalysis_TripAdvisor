This hotel was an alternative since Tower 23 was booked for the Labor Day weekend. Needless to say, we should have just gone somewhere else. Foremost, there is absolutely NO way this hotel is a 4 star. No restaurant on site, small pool, underwhelming rooms with hideous decor, uncomfy beds and pillows that were a joke. The ceiling fan is wobby, dusty, cob webs, boy oh boy. And, we had the suite, which is just a bigger room with a pathetic ocean view. Not only was there a palm tree obstructing our view, but we were so sunk in, it was really a partial view. All this magnificence for $400 a night. And it smelled like weed. Trust me, if you're looking for a hotel and you're not expecting much, this might work for you. If you're looking for something trendy, hip, with views, great food, etc, this is not it.

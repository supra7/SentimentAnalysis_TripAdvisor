For a four star hotel, I was suprised at a few things. First I get to the Peabody to check in and was pulled out of line at check in because I was not with a convention as three others were. They took our credit cards and Id's and came back 30 minutes later and told two couples they were over booked and asked them if they wouldn't mind going to a lower class hotel across the street. They tell me that my room was booked with a King bed (I had four people). I booked a double. I had a copy of my reservation that was booked through travelocity. The bottom line, they didn't want to give the right rooms to us at the check in counter because we booked on a discount website. I spoke with the other parties and they gave them conflicting stories as well. They tried to separate all of us so we didn't compare stories about our check in experience. So, I had to sleep in a bed with four of us in it!!! They didn't offer me anything as a result of their mistake but offered the other party a discount on their club level room because they complained and said they weren't going across the street to the other hotel. Initially, they told this couple that there were no club level room and conveniently found one for them. The other party stormed out and asked for their money back. Then I actually had to pay to workout in the small gym that they have in house. This is a four star hotel, not getting it. Some of the machines are outdated and crammed together. It cost me $10.65 a day. I also went into the BeeLine cafe and ordered a sandwich with very stale bread. For the most part, the lobby is nice, most of the people are nice but the guy organizing the guests was a little manipulative tryinhg keep people happy. Drinks were expensive and food was overpriced for the quality. Latte's were over $4 our of a machine.

Over rated for such an expensive place. For the price of rooms you would expect immaculate grounds and pristine surroundings like a four seasons. But this place is average at best At one point while trying to relax Someone started pounding on the door . "Room Service.. Room service.." I had answer the door and let them know I didn't order room service. The person insisted I did and said aren't you Mr. X. No I'm not. "oh, they said" I was placed near the pool. At most high end places the pool is quiet , serene and relaxing NOT HERE. The pool is open 24 hours. Mistake. At 11pm the party started. Yelling, Wooping., Laughing. I could hear conversations as if people were in my room. The french lady talking to some guy about a wedding. People laughing so loud it woke me through my closed doors. Finally at 230 I had to call the front desk and ask them to shut down the party.It took a while but finally at 3 the noise dissipated. In the morning I asked to be transferred to another room. I was coldly told " You should have called earlier if it was noisy." They did transfer me to another room. The room reeked of air fresher. Even made me cough at times. Finally found fragrance sticks behind the TV and moved them to the closet. The toilet ran 24 hrs a day like water torture. Grounds were very unruly and Tired.. The Patio outside of the breakfast area was covered with leaves and tree droppings. They tout the breakfast experience. Breakfast was just ok 1 quiche. Over cooked sausage. Some cheese and muffins. Would not recommend the place and would not stay here again. No value here. I would have had a more restful trip at a Motel 6.

We stayed at this hotel for several days in October. The room was clean and spacious, and the location seemed perfect. It is across the street from North Station and a trolley tour spot. The problem is that the hotel is surrounded by bars, and the windows do not block any noise whatsoever! Friday night - bar fights right outside, screaming, cursing, garbage trucks, etc all night long. Saturday night - a repeat of Friday night with the added adventure of a man's bloodcurdling scream followed by sirens and firetrucks outside. Although the hotel slightly discounted our room because of the noise, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone on a weekend night.

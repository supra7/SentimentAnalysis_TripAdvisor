Having read Tripadvisor reviews, I thought I knew what to expect at the Surfer Beach (basic rooms, good location) - but still came away disappointed. Yes, hot drinks are available in reception, and staff were helpful(ish). Unfortunately, the previous reviewer is wrong in assuming that the whole hotel has been updated (despite what it says on the hotel's website. We had two rooms (over 2 nights) and both had shower cubicles made up almost entirely of cracked/chipped tiles. My mood wasn't helped by the fact the it was the worst accomodation we stayed in during an 11 day California trip (even worse than a 1-star motel in Pasadena) - despite costing 60% more than our hotels in SF and Monterey. PS. The broken swimming pool heater mentioned by another previous reviewer must have been a bit more serious, as they were in the process of tearing out the pool while we were there.

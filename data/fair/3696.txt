Anybody who would ever design a hotel with more than a thousand rooms should be legally barred from ever designing hotels. The distance between my room and our meeting room was about half a mile, through a maze of dismal looking hallways crowded with other meetings. Only Orlando and Vegas build these awful hotelzillas, outside the now defunct USSR. Hopefully, they'll follow suit. The food was just about the worst I ever had in a hotel, the steak chewy, the fish like a hockey puck.

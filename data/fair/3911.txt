My daughter and I booked a 2 night stay at the "DIVA" and when we got there the young lady who checked us in was very nice. The concierge guy was not pleasant at all especially when I tried to ask a question about a place that I had reservations for dinner that night. When we got to our room on the "Salon Floor" what a MAJOR disappointment!! Our room looked out onto a alley that was full of garbage cans and it REEKED like hell of garbage if we tried to open the windows and the other window looked out onto a brick building don't get me wrong you can't control a lot of things like that but good lord . The carpets were dirty in the hallway, the full length mirror in our room was leaning against the wall and not attached and we were told that there was free bottled water in the rooms on the "Salon Floor" but no there was not. When I called down to the front desk to let them know, they had done a shift change and the guys kept asking me what I want him to do about it and about 2 hours passed still no water or maintenance to be seen. I went down to the front desk and a housekeeper finally came out and handed me 2 bottles of water but not the kind that was advertised that was suppose to be in the room and the young man said all he had was a suite left on that floor and he was not going to give it to me and he did ask me if I would like at all, MAYBE I had the money for the room and he and the concierge guy made us feel like we were really nothing. The concierge finally showed me a room that was 3 floors down and it was exactly like the one that I paid more for. I have tried to call before but was placed on hold for a long period of time and then the phone just hung up. We came for my daughters spring break and we were stoked about coming but ended up feeling like we were not worth the time for some consideration of politeness and common decency. So we ended up leaving early the next morning and drove to Oakland to stay at a nicer hotel.

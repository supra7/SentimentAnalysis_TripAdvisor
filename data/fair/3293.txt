You would think that a JW Marriott would have the option of WIFI in the room, even at a cost? This one only has wired internet which we were told was very slow (we couldn't use it as we took ipads). We left the room at about 11:30 every morning and only once was the room made out of the 4 nights! The other times we had to complain at the front desk. Beds are probably 10 years old or more too. Location is great, though.

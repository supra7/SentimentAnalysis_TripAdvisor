So nice place, that's about it. We had a half of roll of toilet paper in our room and no replacement! Unbelievable! Two of the lights were out, and this is just not the expectation of this hotel. The worst part is that they charged us TWICE for a one night stay. They still have not got back to me about the charge. I have called them three times today with the answer "the accountant is in a meeting". With all of these problems I bet she will be in a meeting for a long time!

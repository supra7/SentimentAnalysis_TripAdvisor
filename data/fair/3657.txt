We just returned from four days at the W New York. I was very excited and really looking forward to my trip. When we arrived we were greeted by an extremely courtesy and friendly staff. We never had one bad encounter. EVERYONE was great!!! They were very helpful, courteous, pleasant, and professional our entire stay. The lobby was beautiful - very hip, cool. Needless to say, our excitement was diminished the moment we opened the door to our room. It wasn't much bigger than a walk-in closet. We had to turn sideways to pass each other in the room. Not exactly what we were expecting. It was very small, the floors and chairs were dirty. Our thoughts of rest and relaxation were dashed. We ate only once at the hotel restaurant. The breakfast was very good and I wish we would have eaten there more. The Bliss Spa was fabulous. I got the best pedicure I have ever had. I would definitely go back. The staff were very pleasant and willing to go the extra mile to make sure you were comfortable and pleased with their service. The best part about this hotel is the location. The location is terrific!!! All in all - the staff was GREAT! location was GREAT!!!! The rooms were not great! Probably would never stay here again, but accomodations are important to me.

But that's about all. I reserved the room (for 2 adults) and specified we wanted a balcony. Reserved well in advance. Got there at 3:00 p.m. and no balcony rooms available. And the hotel clerk didn't bother to mention it ... When I saw the cramped room with two double beds, a bathroom where the toilet took up most of the floor space, and one tiny window, I called the desk and then he said he reduce our rates to standard rates! The reduced rate was more than I would have paid if I had reserved a standard room to begin with. And I must have had the only really crappy bed in the hotel. Other reviews seem to love the bed... I hated it. My husband and I rolled together from side to side and top to bottom. It was like sleeping (or not) in a hole! And the internet didn't wrk so there was no "business area". Apparently if you can get in the part across the street from the main hotel you get a nice courtyard, etc., Not so in the main building w/o balcony!

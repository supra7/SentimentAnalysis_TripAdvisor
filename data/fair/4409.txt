Awful and would never go there again....but if you are: - The 4th floor is 89 steps high and there is no lift. The basement rooms are dark and dingey. The carpets in the rooms we saw/stayed in were disgusting. There is a 4% charge on all card transactions so pay cash if you can else it will could get pricey! Don't expect an english person on reception at any time of the day. Don't expect breakfast unless you want to get up stupidly early - there is a better bakery round the corner from the hotel where you can get a better breakfast. Best avoided unless you get an exceptional deal (as in less than 50 a night). Free Wifi though....

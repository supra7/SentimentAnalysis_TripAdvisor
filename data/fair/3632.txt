After a long haul from Australia I was looking forward to putting my feet up. Especially in their "much self acclaimed" spectacular room. Booked in for 3 nights. The porters were fantastic. Upon arrival and leaving the hotel. When I entered throught the doors however, I was greeted by a pathetic girl who lacked any enthusiasm, energy and didn't even smile. I found it surprising from a highly rated American hotel. Checking in at 6.30pm was tough due to the noise of the bar in the foyer area, nice if you can lip read the staff at the front desk. But it was made all the more difficult by this "girl". On entry to the "spectacular" room, it was less than W-hatever. Tiny for the price, tiny bathroom and cheap decor. I actually felt like calling front desk to check if I had the wrong room but there on their website displays clearly all rooms above the 11 floor is this standard. I would not recomment this hotel. Try other for better value and appreication.

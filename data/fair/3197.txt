I was quite disappointed with this hotel. I do not think I would stay there again. Pros: location cannot be beat, walking distance to everything, we even walked out to the Garden District and the WWII Museum very comfortable mattress breakfast was fine- good choice of cold cereals, yogurt, fruit, rolls/toast etc. go early however because it appears that when they run out they do not replace it. same with the coffee urns. We went at 9:30 for coffee and it was out, we tried again at 10:00... still out. friendly staff Cons: barely met my lowest standards of cleanliness- the floor had not been well vacuumed, the duvet cover had stains, glitter and hair all over it. the bathroom was reasonable but needed a deep cleaning. the inner duvet corner was hanging out and it was unutterably filthy. I took a photo but I won't shock you with it. It was clear it had not been cleaned in a very, very long time. very small, but that's understandable in a historic hotel and it was ok very noisy- despite my request for a quiet room (well, as quiet as possible given the locale) we were put next to the coffee area and people slammed the door and talked loudly outside our room starting very early in the morning. In general I found the hotel to be very overpriced given the above. We were there on a holiday weekend so perhaps it was not as good a value as it normally is. I won't be back however to find out.

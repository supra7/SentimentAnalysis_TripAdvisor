Very disappointing Having seen the Villa Fontaine website we had high hopes for this hotel. Alas we were very disappointed from the minute we walked through the door. We appreciate that hotels have a check-in time however through-out our trip to Japan most hotels tried to accomodate us if we arrived a couple of hours early. The Villa Fontaine said that we could only check in early if we paid an additional hourly rate. When we said that we wouldn't do this but asked if there was a place (toilets!) where we could change, the room miraculously became available and the excess fee waived. The room was small. Ours was on the second floor so could easily be seen into from the outside however the only way of having some privacy was to use a black-out blind so no natural daylight could come in at all. For a smart, modern boutique hotel it was also very disappointing to discover that there was no guest internet service available. This hotel really did seem to be a building with bedrooms and absolutely nothing else. Yes, it is in a vibrant area of Tokyo but taxi drivers struggled to find it so the location became more of a frustration than a plus point.

I travel on business and Vacation when I get the chance. I like the fact that I can review Hotels I stay at now I have found Tripadvisor. I love Hampton and Stay at them when I am on Business. This one has very bad Guest services and the breakfast was real nasty. I like the location and it has a free shuttle to the airport. BUT the lady at the front desk in the morning was weird and RUDE. I tried to get my bill for my stay for my company and it was like she was on the moon. More then 10 mins went by before she got to me as she was on her cell phone and talking to her self. The room the night before smelled like smoke and the room was not ready at 4pm. The hotel was not busy and I was told to just Waite in the lobby instead of giving me a cleaned room. Next time I will stay else where................

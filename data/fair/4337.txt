Deluxe suites not suitable for 3 I stayed in this hotel last weekend 23rd february as part of a group of 40. We were booked into the deluxe suites as we had to treble up. I was the unfortunate 3rd person that slept in the sitting area that had a pull dodwn couch b ed. I did not have a problem with this but was provided with o ne blanket only. The window was ajar all noght and could not be closed. I never slept one bit I was so cold. When I complained the following morning, blankets were provided for the following night and a caretaker was sent up to close the window. Only for this problem, there was a nice firendly atmosphere and breakfast was good.

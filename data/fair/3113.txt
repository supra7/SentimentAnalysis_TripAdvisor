The Westin on Maui has a gorgeous pool and lobby area. The hotel was way too crowded. I have stayed in the area at the Hyatt which is more spacious and seemed less crowded. We had a Mountain View room which was very small and the bathroom was as small as a broom closet. We booked a king size bed when making our reservation but ended up in a room with double beds as there were no king size beds available in the mountain tower and we were not willing to upgrade to the ocean tower for a king size bed at an additional $180 per night. Not worth the money.

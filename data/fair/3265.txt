I attended a conference at the Hotel Intercontinental. I arived on Sunday and Monday night noticed red marks all over my legs. I woke up itching several times during my stay. When I got back home a friendm who is a doctor told me they were either bed bugs or fleas, Other than that, the hotel had a great gym. I would never stay there again.

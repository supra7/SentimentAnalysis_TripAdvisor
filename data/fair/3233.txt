This hotel didn't live up to the usual standards of Waldorf Hotels. I requested an early check in, but wasn't able to check into my room until 3:30, 30 minutes after the standard check in time listed on our reservation and the hotels website. We had to rush to get ready for a wedding. As we waited in the lobby for our room to be cleaned we noticed many other couples with the same issue. It's a nice hotel, the rooms are clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated, but the hotel is not located in the heart of the french quarter, nor is the stated check-in time standard . I won't be returning.

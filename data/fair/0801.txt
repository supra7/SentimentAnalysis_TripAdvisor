I was very disappointed by this hotel and do not think it merits 5 stars There was no seperate bathroom indeed no bath, the loo was a glass cubicle with an ill fitting door and if one turned on the light during the night the whole room was illuminated. The shower cubicle also had an illfitting door and flooded every time, thus rendering the bath mat unusable and water pools all over the floor. The wash basins, without plugs, were so small with the tap above that using them was virtually impossible, especially for my husband shaving or rinsing ones teeth etc. Indeed frequently if the tap was turned on more than at 50% the water hit the bottom and spurted right out and over one. There was absolutely no space whatsoever for toiletries near the basins. One morning there was no water at all. Not even for the loo, this lasted for over an hour. The room was not made up until after 4.00pm, there was no turn down service or replacement of towels or soaking bathmat ready for the morning. The towels were thin and small and clearly rationed, there was no flannel, we were begrudgingly given 2 bathrobes - one in a tatty state when we requested them, they were not changed nor was the bedlinen. One bedside lamp was not working but loose off the wall. There was only one 'comfy' chair and very limited english based TV. (analogue only) The general hotel areas were very poor with no comfy lounge etc. service was difficcult to obtain. Receptions understanding of english was limited and I suspect some had limited spanish too. The only really good thing about this hotel was its location which was great!

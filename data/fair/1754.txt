Rooms were nice but housekeeping walked into my room, WITH A DO NOT DISTURB ON MY DOOR, twice...I asked to borrow a pair of scissors and was told that I would have to put up a 10-15 dollar deposit! My first night here I informed the desk that my remote turned the tv's on and worked the volume but would not change the channel so the next night I was then told that they had no batteries and I was pretty much SOL. My last day of staying at the hotel I received not one, not two, but four phone calls that they needed my credit card, EVEN THOUGH MY CARD WAS ON FILE, and then was made to return to my room and back to the desk so they could see my ID! I had already spent 2 nights at this hotel! I will NEVER stay at this hotel again! I'm sorry as an employee of the Choice Hotel chain I am happy that I work for one that takes pride!

We stayed at this hotel at the start of our honeymoon so we splashed out a lot more money than normal after seeing some good reviews but I can't understand why this hotel is rated so highly. It is completely over-priced and you have to pay for everything ($5 to drink the bottled water in your room, $20 a day to park in the garage). No-one helped us with our luggage when we arrived after a 20-hour trip, the room was nice but freezing cold and the air con was constantly on (the maid always turned it on while we were out so when we got back it took hours for the room to heat up and I had to get into bed to get warmer) and it was the same in the breakfast room where, even though the temperature outside was unseasonably low and no-one could sit out, the air con belted out freezing air you while you tried to eat a fairly limited-choice brekkie. Reception was fairly friendly and the hotel seems clean but, overall, I would never pay that much again for such a bog-standard hotel - for that price, it should have been super.

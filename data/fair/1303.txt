We walked in around 4pm to find 20 very loud, drunken football fans also trying to check-in and decided to get around this by using one of the two self service check-in machines which worked fine but, unfortunately you couldn't choose your room. The room the machine auto allocated us was on the 1st floor and frankly stank strongly of body odour. After a trip back to the now quietened reception we were thankfully moved to the 3rd floor facing away from the street. The most positive things mentionable for the room were it was of adequate size and clean. Apart from that, the bed was quite hard and the pillows were just dreadful - thin & hard. We asked for two more pillows and were told we couldn't have any until the next day due to a "laundry problem". The room had no phone which disturbed me thinking of safety - what if someone needed help in their room? I asked reception about this to be abruptly told to use my mobile phone. Hmmmm. Very poor space provided to hang your clothes and be prepared to take your valuables everywhere as there is no room safe. The bathroom got a tick for its cleanliness yet, like the pillows, the towels are cheap and thin. Tea and coffee facilities are of your typical cheap plastic 1 star hotel type and there is no fridge in case you are staying a while and need to keep some milk. Location is just about the only thing it has going for it. Euston station right next door and a two minute walk to one of the hop on-hop off bus tour stops. I strongly recommend not staying here - there are two Premiere Inns within 5 minutes of this place. For about 20 per night more you will get everything the Travelodge Euston is lacking.

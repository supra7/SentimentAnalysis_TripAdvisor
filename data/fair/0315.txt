1. I've been to Seattle numerous times; used to live there actually. 2. I'm not a highbrow traveler. 3. With that being said, since I did want to save a few bucks on my most recent trip to Seattle, I decided to check out the 6th Ave Inn. I've seen this place numerous times and it looked ok from the outside and was in an ok location (not the best, but not the worst). 4. My overall impression? * Yes, it is cheaper than the better hotels--> for example the Westin, which is one block away, BUT, if you just hate staying at the place, what's the point? * The rooms--> old. They're clean, but old... and small. * The overall hotel is, old. * The overall hotel and my "nonsmoking" room just smelled... a mixture of smoke and various bodily odors that apparently mixed into the establishment over the years. * The bed / mattress--> old and soft. * The bottomline--> Motel 6 is a better quality motel / rooms at a cheaper price. The problem is, there are no Motel 6s in the downtown area. It's one of the dilemmas, if you want to be in a decent location and want a nice room, you'll have to pay the extra 100.0-150.00 / night. Via this most recent trip, I realized that it's worth it to spend the extra money so that I can actually enjoy the trip... OR perhaps get one of the nice suite type rooms around Lake Union (but again--> you'll be away from the downtown area).

If you are used to paying $50 for a hotel stay when you travel then this will be the best hotel you ever stayed at. If you are used to staying at Marriott then keep looking. The room had no hair dryer, the shampoo bottle had been refilled so many times the label wore off and you didnt know what it was, there were two soap boxes, one didn't have any soap in it. The room was small and the bed was about 10 years old. The covers were old as well. They are very hard to find. They don't have an address. Travel down South Philadelphia St. Turn left onto Wicomico St. Make next left and immediately pull into parking lot on right. Don't think, don't look, just park. You'll notice their small sign that blends into the hotel once you park. Only expect to use the elevator for when you check in. They have to bring you up and down and it's a waste of time to grab someone. Our bathroom did not have a sink. The sink was in the bedroom. Literally, there was a sink with no counter in the bedroom. That's a new one for me. The TV was old and had no remote control. Expect to be woken up at all hours because the class of people that stays there. Imagine drunk bums yelling and screaming while they walk to their room. Great locaton on the boardwalk. Internet access is $4.99 an hour.

This is worse than a basic no frills hostel. I booked a room with a shared bathroom and got stuck in a room converted from a hallway that wasn't even marked on the fire escape. I could touch both walls with my hands and the rooms had a "moldy" smell every time I entered. The shower head was broken and sprayed all over when I was holding it, so the walls, ceiling and floor of the bathroom were soaked every time I was in there. The shower hook was broken the entire time I was there, so you had to hold it in your hands. To be fair, the pension was safe and was very close to La Ramble. But if you're looking, don't forget that the area is full of hostals, so look around for a better option.

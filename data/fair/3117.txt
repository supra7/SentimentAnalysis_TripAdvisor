I agree with the writer who said there were too many people here, although when I saw they have about 750 rooms, what did I expect? Next time I would book into a smaller hotel that would give more of the feeling of a tropical paradise, not an amusement park. Yes, the waterfall is noisy but not offensive. Restaurants here as elsewhere on Maui were about what you would expect on an island resort - expensive! I would go to Maui again but I would stay somewhere else.

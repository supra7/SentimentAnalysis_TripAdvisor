I have stayed with Westin hotels many times over the years and this was my first stay in San Diego with you. Let me begin by saying that your staff upgraded our room to Bay View with no charge which was deeply appreciated. However, we stayed in room 2119 and the condition of the room was very disappointing. There was a large crack in the center of the sill of our window and the hot water tap poured water from under the handle every time you turned on the water. (It soaked some of our travel items completely before we noticed the leak. The room showed much wear and took away from the romantic feel I had hoped for with my wife. We were also very disappointed that your valet charge was $32.00 PER NIGHT which we thought was more than excessive. Your staff was, as always, polite but the hotel was certainly not what I have come to expect from a Westin. Won't stay there again and hope that you will consider better upkeep of your rooms in San Diego if you want patrons to return. No offense intended but the warm place I hold Westin Hotels has diminished. Thanks for hearing me out.

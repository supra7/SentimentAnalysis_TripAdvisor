The lobby was loud and crowded and there were line-ups to check-in. The room was decorated nicely but extremely small with antiquated heating and a/c. We spent the night freezing as shutting off the a/c resulted in the room turning into an oven. We stayed here as our company Christmas party was being held in the hotel. Next year we will stay somewhere else, anywhere else.

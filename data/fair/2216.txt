I arrived at this historic gem of a hotel, and the lobby was beautiful, however, it was quite crowded. I arrived 10 mintues before check-in time, which may have been a bad idea. I waited in line for 26 minutes only for the man at the desk to tell me my room wouldn't be ready for an hour or so. According to the grumbles I heard as I made my way to the bar, this was happening to just about everyone floating in the lobby. People were waiting with unhappy faces all over the place, on the floor, on the stairs, outside in the front. I decided to wait in the bar. The bartender was a wonderful, cheery man with a great sense of humor. He even called over to the front desk to check if my room was ready without me even asking. An hour and a half and two beers later I was in my "suite". Don't let that word trick you. When they advertise 2 bathrooms, don't get excited. The bathrooms were the smallest I have seen in the country, and not all that clean (the toilets are actually like the ones in gas stations, the big handle you flush with your foot). I was practically showering with the toilet, and the shower curtain was "mildewy" and seemed to be attacking me as I showered. Cheap shampoo and coarse towels weren't the best either. The other bathroom was identical. The room itself had some old world charm, but nothing to write home about. The view was nil, and the carpet was pretty dirty, and the bedding had some stains. It was only a one night stay, and that was just about enough for me. One more thing, the bar attatched to the hotel "Whiskey Park", we were told by hotel staff we could enter without a cover, but the bouncers would not let us in without the $20 cover, and it was not worth it.

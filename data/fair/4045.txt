First and foremost, nothing for kids to do. Everything is adult oriented so you have to go someplace else. In addition, most of the restaurants and entertainment is on the Wynn side so a 10 minute walk with kids each way every time. Food is outrageously expensive. Service is very uneven and it is clear there are no clear hotel guidelines. In most hotels all employees have the same attitude, either good or bad. In this hotel you take a chance with every employee you deal with. Rooms are nice.

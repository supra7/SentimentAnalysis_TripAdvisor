The Boston Park Plaza has a beautiful shell, but the rooms are in desperate need of an update. The shower was straight from the 60s, with a temperature reader to boot. It took us 20 minutes to figure out how to use the old-fashion contraption, just to find brown water (which was apparently was fault of the city and not the hotel). I will say that the location is superb and the beds are super comfy.

First, I need to start by saying that this is the second time I have stayed here at the Westin Maui Resort and after expressing how much I loved the resort the last time was completely disappointed. My husband and I booked over a year ago to spend a week of our honeymoon in Maui at the Westin with a double upgrade from a partial ocean view. We were very disappointed to find that the staff placed us in a room over looking the parking lot and the backs of restaurants with a partial ocean view that they claimed was an "ocean view." After speaking with the front desk staff we found out this was one of the least desirable rooms in our building. We were very disappointed to hear this and after speaking with the front desk further decided to try and change rooms the next day. We were told they would move our luggage to a smaller ocean view room the next day by noon. The next day at three we got a call to come to the front desk and received news that the occupants in the room we were supposed to get had decided to stay another night. We were moved into a room slightly further away from the parking lot with more of a partial ocean view room than our first night. My husband and I just decided to accept our fate and stay in the second room. We just want everyone to hear our experience as we were deeply disappointed this happened on our honeymoon and hopes no one else gets a ocean view of the parking lot.

We booked this hotel based only on the reviews and the high ranking we found on TripAdvisor. But we were extremely dissapointed by the quality of this hotel. The good: the service and the friendliness of the staff, the central location The bad: dirty carpet, small beds, bad appliances, leaking and noisy AC, old tvs, bad coffee, not enough glasses/cups, only one chair on the balcony for a 6 person suite, not enough towels, not enough chairs in the room, no room to move around in the bedroom, extremely small swimming pool and jacuzzi, rooms facing the parking and garbage area of the neighboring building. Overall the price you pay is much bigger than the accomodation you receive.

My Wife and I spent 3 nights at this hotel in February. All three nights were free via Starwood points. We are Gold members. We arrived around 12:30 pm expecting a room immediately. They say 3 p.m. check in but most hotels accomodate you especially if you are a gold member. I complained several times until they somehow by magic found us a room in the old building two hours later. The room was the size of a large closet. we finally were told by a very nice mgr. that they would move us to the larger beach tower rooms the next day. At 12 pm the next day we were told the room still wasn't ready and it would not be ready untill 3pm. I complained to a mgr and somehow by magic the room was ready in five minutes. All in all most of the desk staff were indifferent and unaccomodating. The concierges were always trying to get you to take the time share tour. They also have a number of salespeople in different locations between the pool and beach hawking guests to take the time share presentation. This hotel has absolutely no class. Wailea is much nicer and much less commercial.

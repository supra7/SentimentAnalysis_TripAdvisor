I recently stayed there as part of the AARP National Event. Because it resembled the Park Plaza in NYC (which I have stayed at and found it to be exceptional), I booked my stay there. It really did not measure up to today's standards, however. I had booked a king room thru AARP with a convention rate of $180@night, at least 6 months prior, so I expected the room that I had booked. When I checked in, I was given the key with no other details. The hallway on the fifth floor had an odor to it and the doors looked old. When I went into my room, it was quite small with a double bed, not a king, and had no closet or even a bureau. As I was on my way out to meet a group of people for dinner, I stopped at the front desk quickly to inquire about this situation. I said that I booked this room quite a ways in advance and could not live out of a suticase for 4 days and that I wanted a better room than the one I was given. I was told to stop by the next morning as they were fully booked that night. Due to convention schedules, I was able to stop by the front desk in the early afternoon, at which time I was given a room on the 12th floor at a rate of $20 cheaper per night. This was a little bigger and better, at least it had a closet and a bureau. But the bathroom looked as if it was simply thrown together in a mishmash-old fixtures and shower that you could not even turn around in. But hey, I settled for a place to put my clothes. The breakfast buffet, in my opinion, was very pricey. It cost $19.95 for a hot dish-eggs, potatoes, meat. I did that once and ended up going to Au Bon Pain down the street on the other days. So if you want an old hotel full of character and quirks, this one's for you. If you want a more modern accomdation, go across the street to the Radisson. I know this hotel has character and quirks due to its age, but you should get the accomodations that your booked instead of what they choose to give you.

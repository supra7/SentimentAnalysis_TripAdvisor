Went there for a weekend getaway. Very disappointed at the low level of service: no room service during the day (after 5:30 only), stains on the sheets, loud A/C that was alternately freezing and hot & stuffy, bellman about ran me down as I was trying to get out of the elevator, furniture getting pretty worn, bad breakfast. Will not be back and cannot recommend it. 2 star hotel at a 4 star rate.

We arrived at the Trump Hotel Sunday night. Staff was terrible. The doorman didnt acknowledge me. No bellhop offered to help us with our bags. We had to hunt down the Valet driver. I gave my debit card for incidentals and they put a $600.00 hold on my account. They said $100.00 a day per person. The housekeeping light was stuck on even before our arrival. The front entry light bulb was out in our room. The scale in the bathroom was broken. There was a tampon wrapper on the bathroom floor and body hair on the bed comforter. We were missing our robes  and we were afraid the hotel would charge us for them. You are charged a daily resort fee, but according to the hotel services book in our room, it would cost us an additional $22.00 to use the pool. What a scam this place was. I gave a written list to the girl at the check out desk when we departed a day early. She didnt even apologize. A brighter note, the hotel maids were very concerned about the housekeeping light. They continued to ask us if we needed help or services. I did think that was nice. The hotel did have the following amenities Business center  for additional charge Fitness Center - for additional charge Swimming Pool - for additional charge

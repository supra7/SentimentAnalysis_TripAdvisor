I reviewed the Palmer House in Dec 2009. Sorry to report that my opinion has now been downgraded. There is no "service" in this hotel whatsoever. The front desk was condescending and did not care one bit about my promised upgrade. No bell staff. No concierge, just a vacant desk with some brochures scattered on it. Internet is now $20/day. My room was so forlorn, with furnishings right out of the 1970s or 1980s, worn carpet, DIRTY towel, hair in the tub, no amenities whatsoever, not even a coffee pot, and the same tired TV channel offerings. Workers were picketing over union affairs at all three entrances and banging trash can lids and hubcaps together - all night. Real nice touch there, Palmer House Hilton. And you did nothing about it. Last time I will stay here and I strongly suggest others stay elsewhere. Plenty of nice hotels in the vicinity. Palmer House is a tragedy these days, I'm afraid.

First of all, this hotel is unsuitable for anyone travelling to Barcelona for purely sight seeing. this is kind of business/conference hotel. It looks like built from IKEA flat pack - very boring deor - most walls are laminate of contrasting colours. our room looked like board room with a bed in middle (the bed itself was bot bad though). There was some fault with the TV ( loose contact i suppose) and had to push/pull the wires before we could watch TV. The room and toilet were clean. Did not hear any noise from outside, although there is some serious building work taking place right opposite. A breakfast at the hotel restaurent costs 15 euros and was worth maybe 6-7 euros(thats rip -off). Llacuna is the nearest metro station and its kind of 8 mins walk from hotel, it takes about 12 mins on the metro to La Rambles (with 1 change). So to sum up, I wouldn't say the hotel is very bad but its definetely not cosy and the location is not good, its out of way for tourists.

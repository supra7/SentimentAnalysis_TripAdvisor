Our room was beautiful and very well done,however lacking in basic amenities,no drawers to put clothes in and one chair.Our room was designed for the overnight single traveler who had to be in downtown Chicago,not for a couple attending a wedding and reception.The hotel knew we were a couple. A comment about a tip to get the best room,if it is required to play games go elsewhere.

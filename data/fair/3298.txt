First let me start by saying that we had a wonderful time in New Orleans. We were going to do that no matter what. When we called after arriving in the area near the hotel earlier than expected my wife called about early check-in and where we should park. We were told to drive around to the back of the hotel where we were greeted with no self-parking garage, but a $35 dollar a day valet parking option only. There was no early check-in but the staff was wonderful and took our things to a storage are while we went out for lunch. A few hours later we went to check into our room. Still no room available NEARLY 1 1/2 HOURS after our scheduled check-in time. The staff again was very nice and we were given a 25 dollar certificate to be used in the hotel restaurant. 30 minutes later we still had no room, so we sat in the lobby and waited for some sign that a room that I had paid good money for would become available. When we did get a room I tried to get online to download a map to be better oriented. WIRED INTERNET COSTS $14.95 PER DAY. Most economy hotels offer their guests at least free wired internet. Once again the STAFF IS GREAT at this hotel. However if management is not able to budget how much time is needed to clean and ready a room for this next guest then they should be in a new line of work. I was overall disappointed since I have had more professional experiences with hotels like La Quinta and Econolodge than this so-called "better" hotel.

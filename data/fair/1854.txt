Got here an thought the lobby and decor was warm and comfortable. Enjoyed the theme. The breakfast was good and the happy hour a nice touch. The staff was curtious but from high hopes my impression did nothing but go down hill. The elevators were slow or under repair all the time. When they stopped at the floor the lights didn't tell you which way they were going and people were asking up or down? Door key didn't work so went back to the lobby and they told me to pull the door shut and try again. That seemed to work.I was on the 11th floor and wanted Ice. Looked around and called the lobby to find the ice machine for the hotel was on the 3ed floor. With a slow elevator I am glad I took the ice bucket so it wouldn't melt. There was a strange noise that woke me up all night like the room above me flushed the toilet all night long. I left a wake up call the first night and they didn't call me. So the second night I called back to confirm the call and the lady said she circled it. No call and I overslept an hour. The exercise room was strange and poorly laid out which is ok as most hotels put the health club in corners but the equipment was old. No water and no towels. I would have liked to like the hotel but i won't be back.

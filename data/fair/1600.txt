Spent two nights in early July on a travel industry rate. Arrived late morning, as do most tourists from the States. We could have checked in early by paying an upcharge of around 25 Euros. We opted to change in the bathrooms and leave our bags with the concierge for the day. I usually have great luck with Accor hotels in Europe, but I won't be booking the Novotel Amsterdam again based solely upon their early check-in surcharge.

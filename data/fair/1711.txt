I stayed in a Grandeur Room. Booked the room from cleartrip. I visited this place in december 2009. First thing to observe is, the place is too far away from major attractions in singapore. Getting back to Riders Lodge at night is difficult. As far as I know there is no MRT service near this place. Buses to this place at night after 11 are not that frequent. I needed to checkout from hotel at 6 AM in the morning , it was raining that morning, it took me half hour to get the cab. There was no bath tub in the grandeur room. One irritating thing is that, there is a Dog training center near this place, a lot of disturbance occurs because of the dogs barking. The parking is chargeable, I think is S$ 3. The taxi will charge this amount, if you call it inside. I would recommend to ask the taxi to wait out and ask the hotel staff to help you to move the luggage. Staff is pretty polite, they helped with electrical adaptors, any transportation needs. The nearest bus stop is 5 minutes away walking. The direct buses are available to Little India, Orchard road, etc from the bus stop nearby. The breakfast was included in my hotel room charges. The breakfast is not that impressive. Fruits normally include banana. Cornflakes, cakes, tea, coffee are a part of daily menu. Two more items include one non vegetarian and one vegetarian item.

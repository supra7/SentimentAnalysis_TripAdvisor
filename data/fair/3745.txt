I was attending a conference and this was one of the hotels on our list. From the outside the hotel looks charming but then rooms left a lot to be desired. The rooms are small. I felt as if my roommate and I were on top of each other. The bathroom is very dated. The water pressure was poor and the water temperature was not reliable. The paint was peeling from the tub and the mirror was difficult to use if you are not a tall person. The worst part was the electrical socket was on top of the mirror. To use the blow dryer I had to close the lid of the toilet and stand on top while balancing myself as I plugged the in the dryer. I only wish I had taken a picture. If that is not bad enough the walls are paper thin. Our neighbors were not talking loud, they were talking in a normal tone, but with the paper thin walls it seemed as if my neighbors were sitting at the end of my bed. During the day its not so bad but at midnight it was terrible. I would not recommend this hotel if you are looking for a comfortable stay.

We stayed at the Maui Coast from February 5 - 16/05. The staff was really friendly and there were no bugs! The room was ok but is starting to look very tired. Although we were in a no smoking room there were cigarete burns in the carpet and coffee and side tables. The bathrooms are very plain and need to be upgraded. The Maui Coast needs to be refurbished or it is really going to be a dump in the next 10 yrs. Dont bother eating at the Hotels restaurant.. service is bad and food is worse. There are some really good places to eat but you will have to walk about 8 blocks to get a great breakfast. The best place is the Kihei Caffe. What I mostly found disappointing was the location. I had not been to Maui in 20 yrs so was very disappointed at the uncontolled building on every square inch of land available! The hotel is not in the best of areas and I found it upsetting to have to walk past the drunks and druggies on the way to the beach. The area is noisy, the traffic is brutal and we did not feel safe at all walking at night. There are very few street lamps and a lot of dark and creepy areas that if I was a woman alone would never venture out alone. The beaches and the ocean of course are lovely and its easy to forget what you are paying everynight for accomodations. I think the best bet in Maui is to find a private rental condo with the best features you can afford. My recommendation is to stay out of Kihea and if you can find a deal try Wailea. You will probably get a lot more bang for your buck. You will probably have to pay more however Kihei and Wailea are worlds apart in the kind of people that hang out in each area.The minute you leave Kihei and enter Wailea you know why you came to Maui! Maui's housing and development growth is out of control and it is so sad to see this beautiful place starting to become another Honolulu.

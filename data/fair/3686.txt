My wife and I had a 2 week vacation in USA and stayed at three locations: Las Vegas, Los Angeles and New York. The ironic thing was as the hotel rooms got smaller, the rates got higher. Not surprising given the general differing costs of living in those respective cities. However, trying to ignore how spoilt we were in Las Vegas, the so-called King bed was a Queen (actually, I suspect it was a twin, but I didn't have my measuring tape) and conveniently when I called them about it, they didn't have any rooms with a King bed available and lo and behold, on their computer systems we were meant to have a Queen anyway. Unfortuantely, I made the mistake of booking over the phone and not on the Internet where a receipt proving my booking would have been found in my Inbox. Other bad points: we had several suitcases for which there wasn't a bell boy in sight when we stepped out of the taxi. The carpet in the room was very worn in places, the bed just wasn't made to have 2 people sharing it, the maids didn't replace the Bliss toiletries my wife "misplaced" in her bags after the first night (I pay over $300 per night and they get cheap on simple pleasures such as that!). The good points: professional check-in staff, ultra-soft 100% cotton robes, lovely bar area (I suspect that this was the bait to make you assume the rest of the hotel is just as great). Overall, not impressed for the money I forked out. I would love to know where the other reviewers on this forum got such heavy discounts...

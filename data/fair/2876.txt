Just returned from 2 nights at this hotel, it was ok for the price of $167 a night, but we had "crawling bugs" in our room. Parking was free, but very difficult to find a spot if you returned in the evening. A/C was very noisy, it was quieter if you left the door open for the night. Check out Life's a Beach and Kahale's for some local flair.

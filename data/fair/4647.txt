My husband, 2 small children and I stayed at Maui Lu for Thanksgiving. We weren't expecting much based on the price. The hotel staff were always very friendly and helpful and the location is decent. We drove up and down the road for meals and appreciated the refrigerator in the room and use of the microwave in the lobby. Our room was the garden view. The worst part of the room was the carpet. It was old, dingy and dirty. I did not want my family to walk in the room without shoes on. The room had air conditioning, a nice sliding door in the back to open to a lanai and quiet, peaceful view. The pool was okay (too cold for us to enjoy at the time). Parking was good. If staying on Maui again I would choose a nicer hotel, but the accommodations are decent for the price. I did leave behind my prescription eyeglasses after we checked out and after calling housekeeping, they were mailed to my home in good condition.

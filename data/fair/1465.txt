My husband & I stayed this hotel from May 5th to 8th. The hotel was on the second floor of an office building that was located in the center of the city. They had free WiFi and nice breakfast and our room was spotless. We were going to give them "5" even it felt like a B&B till we checked out. We were heading to the port to catch our cruise that day. The reception guy with eye glasses booked a car service for us the night before. He told us that we had to check out by 11:00am but we could stay lounge area till 1:00pm for the car. After checking out, we went to walk, had lunch and back to the hotel at 12:30pm. We satdown by the reception for a while then I asked the reception guy for a bathroom. He replied "It is broken and no one repairs on Sundays unless we pay a million euro". He was loud, very cold and rejective. Then he turned his back to us. He knew that I would be in the car for one and half hours to the port. If their public bathroom were broken they had a lot of guest rooms and housekeepers were busy cleaning them at that moment. The room that we stayed was not even cleaned yet. Couldn't he accommodate a woman who need to use a bathroom? Wasn't there even one bathroom to offer the customer who had just paied $840 for a no star hotel in an office building? I had to run to the pizzeria that we had lunch and ask for their bathroom. When I run back to the hotel, our car was there and the guy was saying good by to us like nothing happened. I couldn't stop my tear in the car to the port. ...... My bitter memory of Rome.

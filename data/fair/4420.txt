To begin with, the hotel needs updating from the outside. It looks like it hasn't been touched since 1970. I was served by the front desk manager i believe and found him to be a bit stressed. It was pretty obvious he was new and didn't really know what he was doing. He couldn't even smile. I walked in the room and found it to be very nice but some hairs on the bed and the lamps very dusty. Oh and apparently the hotel is right by the airport? it's atleast a 10mins drive. Overall, very dissapointing and won't be going back.

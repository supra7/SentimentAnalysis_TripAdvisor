Dissapointing Yes the location of this hotel is good, opposite the Wardorf Astoria on Lexington but the praise stops there. The lobby is always busy, with people milling around and music playing, the hotel tries hard to be hip and trendy in line with the corporate image of the W hotels. My main complaint was the room. I know it's NY and most rooms are small but this was really tiny, basically a glorified box with not enough room to even swing a cat. It was so small the bathroom did not even have a proper door but rather a sliding frosted glass door which did not even close properly. If your loved one/partner is in the room they can hear everything since they will be sat on the bed about 3ft away, so dont stay here if on a romantic break! Also the room was dirty, there was loads of dust on the "mini bar" area (basically some stuff left on the side) which had obviously not been cleaned in weeks and also wasnt for the 3 days we were there. Also there were various stains in the bathroom around the floor and on the walls and some hairs that did not belong to us. Will not be staying here again, this is one to avoid

It was bad from the start. When I checked in (after 3 PM, not very nice), I was given the wrong room type. When I asked to be changed into a suite, the clerk, instead of checking my booking, said the suite was very expensive, implying I could not afford it. I had to go online (and pay for it) to clear the matter and get the correct room. A couple of days later, my girlfriend actually saw a mouse in our room and was terrified. To be fair, the hotel didn`t charge for that night, but we had to pack and change rooms again, and not for a very good reason. Furthermore, I could not say the staff is very effective. For any simple order (hangers or a bucket of ice) we had to call more than once and wait for quite some time. I would recommend to anyone looking for a hotel room in the Times Sq area to look somewhere else.

Room was small and lighting system was not enough, during dark ours was very difficult to work also because the room are not big enough to have a proper desk were to work. But the worst was concerning the heating system which is connected to the room card holder so every time I went out the room the heating system switched off and when I came back the room was just frozen Positive aspects are the cleanness of the room and the nice and big breakfast room

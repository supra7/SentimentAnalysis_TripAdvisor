not what we expected When we arrived we found our room to be verry stuffy and warm. There was not airconditioning and the windows only opened a few inches. When we talked to the desk clerk, she said that airconditioning was rarely needed in San Francisco. However, she added if this was a problem we certainly could look elsewhere. As she would have no trouble renting it. Since this motel is in the Castro, the clientle seemed to be mostly gay men. On the weekend we were there. They hung over the balconies and drank, smoked, socialized and cruised into the wee hours of the morning. On the plus side, the location was good, our room clean and promptly made up each day. However, I still had the feeling we were staying in a male resort. All that was missing was the hot tub and naughty movie channel. Our one and only visit.

Let me start with the good stuff. Hotel was clean and staff was friendly. I felt like the pictures were taken with the largest room that they have. I was in a cramped shoe box like room. NO A/C in this hotel. This is not normally an issue, but they should tell you. The outside noise was LOUD and hard to sleep. I swear the garbage man starts work at 2am and goes till 6 am, 2 nights in a row. NO COUNTER space in the bathroom. All you have is a sink, to say the bedroom is small, the bathroom is even smaller. All I can say is save your money and I wish someone had been honest before me! No restaurant on site. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!

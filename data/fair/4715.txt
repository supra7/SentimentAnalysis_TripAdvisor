We visited with our three children, ages 4,9 and 13. We thought we would be spending lots of time in the pool, but it was too cold even for the kids. Why would a nice resort skimp like this? The first time we stayed at the resort, I thought that it was just an anomaly. After the second visit and reading many reviews, I'm confident that the management knows about this problem but still chooses to keep it cold.

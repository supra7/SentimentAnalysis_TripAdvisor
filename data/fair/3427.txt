I would not recommend this hotel. My family booked three rooms separately to meet up in New York and asked for twin rooms. Despite booking and paying up front two months before and asking for the rooms to be near each other, our requests were ignored. When we asked at the desk on arrival, we were told dismissively that as we booked through Expedia our requests would not be met. We ended up in double rooms, with my grown son and daughter having to share a bed, and each room as far apart as possible on the 2nd, 5th and 9th floors. The double rooms are tiny with no room to swing a mouse let alone a cat! The desk staff clearly did not care and acted as if this was a normal situation. It probably was as each morning we heard people at the desk asking to switch rooms. On a trip to the USA which saw us staying in many excellent good value hotels, the Newton was by far the worst and least value for money. Do not book this Hotel through an agency as you will be given the least priority in allocation of rooms and will not get what you think you have booked.

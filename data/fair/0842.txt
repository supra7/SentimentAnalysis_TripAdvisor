My sisters and I spent the week-end at this lovely relatively new hotel. They upgraded us to a large room with a bayfront view. The hotel service was good and the Vela restaurant food was delish. I would have rated this higher had it not been for the Odysea bar. The female bartenders were mostly Eastern European foreigners and spoke their language to each other in front of customers. They were very rude to us girls although they were were very nice to the guys. They kept hitting on men the entire night (they needed green cards?) and ignored us. Everytime we needed a drink it took an act of congress for them to serve us. They didn't like it when some of the men talked to us. We kept getting dirty looks. This was the worst experience I've had in a hotel bar. Definitely will not be back!!

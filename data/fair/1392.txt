If money is a big issue and you're looking for a well-situated location for Rome, this is an ok choice. Rooms were clean but not nice. Beds weren't comfortable and the breakfast was bad. Now I know why it was substantally cheaper than everywhere else for a party of 4. If you're looking for somewhere nice on vacation, pass on this place.

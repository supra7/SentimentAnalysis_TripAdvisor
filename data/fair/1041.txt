We booked our room through expedia , when we arrived at 11a.m. we were told there were technical difficulties with the room. and wanted to switch us to their other hotel down the street When I refused to be relocated they started showing me available rooms, none looked like the pictures on the web site and none were acceptable . I agreed to look at the rooms in their Hotel Sonya and after viewing 4 rooms they finally showed me a comperable room to what I had booked online, dont know why they didn't want to give me the room I paid for in the first place. Other than the bait and switch the hotel was just fair. 2 star at best. Who needs the agrivation

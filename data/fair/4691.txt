Stayed for one week in this hotel. Pros - good location, close to ocean, nice snorkeling Cons: In the room: furniture is old, towels smell chlorine, poor drain system in the bathroom, closet doors which suppose to slide - just don't slide, bathroom is old and uncomfortable Outside: pool stinks with chlorine (not a best place for kids), $10 for beach chair per day per person, another $10 for umbrella, beach towels are very old. Basicaly, here you are paying for everything. Water in your room $5, breakfast - $60 for two, dinner will be more expensive. They have free internet, although slow Its not that we cannot afford to stay in places like this, but even 3* hotels in Turkey or Egypt have more ameneties and quality services than Sheraton.

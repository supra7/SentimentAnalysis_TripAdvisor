Stayed at the Omni for a weekend shopping trip and have been to a number of other hotels on the Magnificent Mile. Room was a suite with pull-out couch in parlor--extremely uncomfortable for my 16 yr old. Room was tiny/cramped and king bed uncomfortable. Bathroom was large but dated, with odd layout and not enough hooks/towel racks. Most interesting problem was that the room on the 19th floor "squeaked" all night due to the wind rocking the building structure! Although the movement of the building was not discernable, this squeaking noise made it impossible to sleep. Location was good, but this hotel is nothing special and the structural idiosyncracy makes it not worth the $300+ per night.

We booked our accommodation online direct through the hotel and it was 1 nights stay including a cocktail and breakfast and airport pickup. Firstly I have to say, we went to watch a NBA Phoenix Suns game and the location to that was great. We walked there and around town easily. Thats about it though... When we arrived in and called to let them know we were here and to find out where the bus would pick us up - no-one answered the phone. We didn't think it was far (which it wasn't) from the airport so caught a cab. Got there early and the room was ready which was great. The room was quaint but the novelty wore off when it took about 30min for the water in the shower to go from freezing to luke warm where it stayed and we also couldn't get the heat in the room working. It is an old building, was winter and after my cold shower I needed heat! We also didn't get any information or vouchers for the cocktail, breakfast or wifi so went to reception to ask. The receptionist told us he would send them up. They never arrived... The next morning we wandered through the restaurant & snoop at what the free breakfast was and decided not to chase our vouchers again, we just left and ate at the airport. Maybe if you are into the old style charm of the place stay or want something on the cheaper side in town this is for you but if you want any type of comfort - give it a miss.

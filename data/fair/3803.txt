This is the former Hilton and then Pointe South Mountain, etc. They have made some renovations but they are primarily surface. The rooms are still worn and although suites, dark and in need of upgrade. Interestingly, they are now part of Preferred Hotels which has many fine properties throughout the world. I will be surprised if Preferred allows them to stay part of their program for long. For the details: 1. Banquet food - lunch food average, very plentiful, service good; dinner food below average, service good, atmosphere poor 2. Access - very good - close to airport, easy in and out. Resort lobby and registration not convenient to the rooms - true hassle to have to travel there to get your morning bill when checking out. 3. Room service - food, below average; service poor; no ice brought with soft drinks - server said, "oh, I guess I could go to the ice machine for you." Room service is comparable to a cut-rate Holiday Inn, not the type of hotel this place wants to be. 4. Price and value - OK if you are with a group; overpriced as an individual - you can do much better elsewhere in the valley. Their group fare includes gratuity for housekeeping but NOT for the bell service -- and this resort is spread out all over so you end up calling for golf cart service many times because it is too far to walk Restaurants - only two - one is mediocre Mexican and the other over-priced steak and ribs All in all, I would not come here again unless I had to because of a meeting. There are so many many better choices in the area.

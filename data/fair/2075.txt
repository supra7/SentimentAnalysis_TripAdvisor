My husband and I stayed at the Longwharf for a long weekend. Great location. T stop literally right outside front door, Aquarium steps away, Harbor taxi also right outside front door, and Fanuiel Hall/Quincy Marketplace right across the street. The North End is a short walk away (2 - 3 blocks), which is Boston's Little Italy. Great restaurants there. Word of advice - most of those restaurants are booked solid for dinner on the weekends. Make reservations weeks in advance. Check the internet for Italian restaurants in the North End - they are all generally within one street of each other. Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with any of the restaurants there. We particularly liked Florentine Cafe for casual lunch. When we were there (mid-May 2007) there was some kind of function on the first floor. The first room we were given was on the first floor and overlooked the function (some of the hotel's rooms are set up in an atrium style overlooking the floors below.) We asked for a move to another room that would be quieter and were given a room on the 6th floor, which is not set up in an atrium style. Unfortunately, the noise from the hallway is very loud, and if the room is close to the elevator, people tend to forget how voices carry in the hallways. Overall, the hotel was OK but the noise was difficult to deal with. I travel quite a bit for work and find that I am sensitive to noise in the hallway, but this particular hotel seemed louder than most. Loud late at night and loud early in the morning. Large amount of children in the hotel, assume because of proximity to Aquarium. Bring a white noise machine or ear plugs. Bottom line is the hotel is kind of dated, but seemed clean and service was good. Can't beat location. Not great for romantic get-away due to noise and kid factor. Concierge floor might have been better but is $100 per night more expensive.

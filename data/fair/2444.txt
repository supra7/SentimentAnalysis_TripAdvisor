Stayed 2 nights for business because other choices with a shuttle bus to my conference were sold out. I was glad I requested a high floor, away from elevator because I would have been extremely upset to be in a room near the noisy train. Room was clean and bedding was nice, although as others have pointed out, the tiny bathroom was annoying. I didn't mind having an old tv but the lack of available coffee and the rip-off fee for wired internet was more than disappointing. Who wants to sit at a hotel room desk after a long day at work? never again.

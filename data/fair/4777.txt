Booked 3 nights in Boston through Virgin Holidays as part of a week's stay in USA. Got room 315 at the Lenox. It is small by American standards and the bathroom was tiny. There was mould all around the bath and everytime we used the shower, there was water on the floor afterwards, so we had to put towels on the floor. The view was of some sort of heating ventilation on a flat roof. we couldn't even tell what the weather was like so just kept the curtains closed all the time. When we asked if we could move to a room with a better view, we were told that we would have to pay a charge of $60. The guy on the desk was totally disinterested, although the person who took our bags to and from the room was very helpful. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room so you have to order room service if you want anything. The lobby was recently renovated, but how often do you use that apart from when you are waiting to leave? The only good thing for us was the central location.

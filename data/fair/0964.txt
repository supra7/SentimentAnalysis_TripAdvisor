We reserved a room with a king size bed w/ ocean view. On the night of arrival we were assigned a room in the Molokai building -a room with 2 double beds. We were told that king size rooms were based on "availability". The room had obviously not been used in awhile as it smelled very musty and mildewy. The ceiling fan was very dirty. The sliding, old wooden door in the bath area had sand all over the floor. The fixtures in the bath were very old. I have asthma and needless to say, things went from bad to worse. The next day my husband and I,(after a miserable night) did get moved into what we were told was our "original reserved room" which was in a different building, with a king size bed and a great view. Why didn't they do that in the first place? It's obvious that hotels overbook just as the airlines do. Beware the Molokai building if anybody stays there. The other buildings in the complex were very nice.

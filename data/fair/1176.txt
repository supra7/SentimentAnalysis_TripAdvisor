First of all, let me say I was supposed to stay at Sunset Fisherman's Resort at my friend's timeshare. However, that resort was being remodeled so my friend and I had no choice but to stay here. The service here was the WORST EVER. I've never been treated so rudely by hotel staff in my life. Our all inclusive plan did not transfer, so we had to pay extra for room service and our choice of restaurants. The bath tub in the room didn't work - there were cracks in the sliding glass doors and windows. The concierges weren't interested in helping you unless you wanted to purchase a timeshare. When you had a question at the front desk, they gave you five different answers. The restaurants were okay - the food and service were hit-or-miss. The beach was HORRIBLE so we went back to Playa del Carmen for swimming and laying out. There was nothing to do when it rained - the only indoor activities consisted of hanging out in the crappy sports bar or spending a fortune at the spa. The timeshare presentation was overly aggressive. I spent a week here and I'm pretty sure I will never come back to any all inclusive resort in Mexico. This resort damaged any positive attitude I might have had about visiting this area!!

This was a Priceline stay, and it was rated 3*, This property has seen better days, like 25 years ago. It was nice once, I'm sure. Now, it's very dated with parts of old features still around. It was very close to the SeaTac airport. They don't have their own shuttle, you use one of the parking lot buses. There are four, I believe; A,B,C, and D. That's confusing, only one works. My room was large, but it had an irregular shape. Things all worked, but the bathroom was outmoded. The employees were OK, no one stood out. For a 3* property it did not make it. This Red Lion is 2.5* at best.

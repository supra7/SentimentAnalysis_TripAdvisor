Chose this hotel because of great reviews on Tripadvisor. Location of hotel is excellent, just round the corner from Times Square. The quality of accommodation was below average and extremely overpriced for the sub-standard rooms and amenities offered. Was kept awake for 3 nights by a constant noise from the hot water tank which seemed to be shared by everyone on my floor and produced a loud gurgling noise whenever anyone in another room turned on their water supply. Also, it was advertised that there were tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms - my room had an antiquated coffee machine located in the bathroom!. Breakfast was awful and reminded me of a staff canteen with hotel staff watching my every move to check that I didn't take more than my fair share of the food. After trying this for one day, we opted to eat breakfast outside. I feel that this hotel has had over generous reviews on trip advisor and was distinctly average.

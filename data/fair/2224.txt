Came into town to see a Sox game. I thought this would be a nice place based on the name & the description on Expedia. Not at all. Old hotel the rooms aren't nearly as nice as the common areas. When reserving my room on line I had selected the rate w/ a king sized bed, at check in I was told they were overbooked for kings & doubles was stuck w/ 1 queen. The elevators are old & shaky. The room was very small & plain. No pictures, nice drapes or bed linens. The cable wasn't working so we couldn't watch tv. Bathroom was old & TINY. Old fixtures. Bed was very uncomfortable. A/C didn't work it just made a clicking noise it sounded like a train was in our room. Our room was located above the popular bar in the hotel Whiskey Park. At 2:30 in the morning the street below was full of loud people leaving the bar. Cars beeping, people laughing & screaming. The windows were so thin it seemed as though they were wide open...you could hear everything. The same applies for conversations in the hall outside your room. You could here all activity out there including the housekeeping staff & loud walkie talkies. I will never stay here again nor will I recommend it.

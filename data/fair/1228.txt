I stayed here one night while waiting for my flight since I was taking the train both to the hotel and to the airport the next day the fact that it was the furthiest hotel from the trainstation mattered to me the room was of good size and had a fridge but I had to unplug the lamp in order to turn it off the next morning I saw a couple of cock roaches and thats when I decided that I wouldnt be staying at extend stay again with other choices I will try something else next time

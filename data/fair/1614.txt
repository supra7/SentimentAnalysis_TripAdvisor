After flying for hours, dealing with airport security, baggage claims, and car rentals, all I wanted to do was get into a bed and sleep. When I got to my room, I pulled back the covers and there was a giant white stain on the blanket beneath the comforter. Bet you can't guess what that was. I called down for new bedding and it took them almost an hour to bring it. And by bringing it I mean dumping it on the floor outside the door, knocking, and walking away. Not even an apology. Terrible beds and furniture too. The bathroom was recently remodeled, but they didn't put in a new shower head. It was so incrusted from hard water that it sprayed in a dozen different directions. Absolutely terrible stay. Something more like what I'd expect from a $40 a night motel.

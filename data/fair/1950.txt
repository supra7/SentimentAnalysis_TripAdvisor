It might be nave, or a simplicity but the service it is just not what i expected from a 5 star Business hotel. For working reasons I had to wake very early this morning after a very long flight and working day the day before. I had some time in the afternoon so I decided to get a quick nap in lunchtime since the Hotel is really closed to my office. I ordered some food, and I signed the bill. After having lunch and while I was having my really needed nap, the waiter knock on my door, woke me up with the message that there was no credit on my account and that I had to pay in cash. I admit it, I was pissed off. I wanted a nap and I couldnt get it. Since I wouldnt be able to get it, I went to the lobby to clear the problem and to check what happened to the credit I gave the day before. I just wanted to get an apology and some explanation. Since I was returning to the hotel 2 days after, I said that I wanted to cancel the reservation, even without meaning it. I work in the industry and I was amazed that I went out of the lobby without an explanation, an apology and having cancelled my reservation. I couldnt believe how the hotel could lose a customer so easily. I felt so nothing that I preferred to look somewhere else.

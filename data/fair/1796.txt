Where do I start... We were traveling with a rather large group. Check in was SLOOOWWW. In our 1st room, it had no bathroom door. So we get moved to our 2nd room. Where our A/C isn't cooling the room down at all. So, we get our 3rd attemp to our room. Finally a door to the bathroom and the A/C worked, but the mattress to this hotel seems like something you would pick up at the flea market. SO UNCOMFORTABLE!! My family was tired of moving so I decide not to say anything. I also mention to the clerk that our hall way is extremely hot, doesn't seem like the A/C is working. She said she would have someone check on it. The hall way never got cooler. On our way to the pool I ask the front clerk for towels for my kids and the kids in our group. About 10 kids, he says he can only give me 3 towels total. He says, that once those get soaked to go and take them back to him so he can give us 3 more towels. WHAT???!! Never heard of such a thing!!! 2 other couples from our group had to change rooms becuase their beds were BROKEN! One of those couples with the broken bed were switched into a room where the toilet would not flush. We finally settle for the night, I get up in the morning and there on the wall is a huge ROACH the size of a ketchup packet!! Disguesting!! I get the kids up and tell the to start getting ready so we can check out and leave. My daughter pulls out their iron to iron, doesn't work and had GUNK all on the bottom of it. Then I realize that the clothing rod in the closet isn't even hung up! Also, don't be fooled by the amenities, the rooms do not have microwaves or mini fridges. Seems like this place doesn't get many guest. Our group felt like they were running around the last minute trying to make these room appear presentable. This is a trip our group takes once a year to the same location in Dallas. We will never return to this hotel. An aweful experiance.

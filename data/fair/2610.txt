I decided to visit this hotel for the Memorial Day weekend for some R & R. --The air was not working on my floor, and when the maintenance guy arrived on my 3rd night he said they just found out the air had been down for 2 days!! -- No free wifi; parking was $21/night; hard beds --The club lunge was on the other side of the hotel in a separate tower so in order to enjoy the member amenities I'd have to fight through the large crowds downstairs. --The hotel was taken over by a church conference group and the halls, lobby, skybridge, restaurant, front entrance, lounge areas were full of people all the time. Every staff member was overextended and check-in and checkout lines were ridiculous. Not a bell boy to help anyone who was not with the conference. Luggage all over and people standing around....MASS CHAOS for 3 days! It was not relaxing and even when I spoke with the concierge after getting my checked bags she said she felt sorry for me and acknowledge that I probably was not able to get much R&R.

Overpriced, and the surrounding area is a bit dicey, as we found out. I suggest you find something cheaper, cleaner and safer by looking a couple of blocks north. Also, the air filter in the rooms was filthy and they don't serve coffee or muffins (which I missed). Only highlight was the Custom House restaurant, but I would never stay at this hotel ever again.

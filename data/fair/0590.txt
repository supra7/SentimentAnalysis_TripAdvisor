My fourth stay but I won't come again. Hotel rooms have gone downhill and so has the manager's attitude. I had to do some serious arm twisting to get a bath tub after traveling for 24 hours door to door. Lobby is still well presented and rest of staff pretty good, especially Amber on reception who was most courteous and helpful. My luggage was delayed by 12 hours courtesy of AA and the hotel did not tell me it had arrived, it was in reception for 3 hours, although they did give me a toothbrush and toothpaste. On one day my room was not cleaned although it was done fairly swiftly when I complained. It just was not as good overall as it used to be, so I'll vote with my feet and select another hotel for my next trip.

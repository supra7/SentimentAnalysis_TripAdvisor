Clean My experience was just okay, the room was clean, roomy and quiet. and the location was convenient. However, the restaurant was never open. Coffee in the rooms would have been nice.When I checked in I had to wait until 3 to get my room. During my stay I heard at least three individuals arguing with the staff , they had reservations but no rooms were available. Staff told each that they were overbooked and wanted to send them across town to a Holiday Inn.

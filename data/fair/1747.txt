I based my decision on Hot Wire star rating. They gave this hotel a 2.5 star rating. It felt like a budget hotel, something I would expect from a one star. I was given a smoking room eventhough I requested non smoking. I needed two beds but only got one. The TV only picked up about seven stations and the rest would not come in clearly. Front desk stated that they were working on it. I was very disappointed with the room. Although clean, smoking smell was very strong. Staff did not seem to be to concerned about my problems. I observed three other travelers complaining, so I guess I was not alone. This is a basic no frills low budget motel with not much ammenities. If that is what you want, that is what you will get. I called Hot Wire to see what I could do. They assured me that the competitors gave the hotel the same rating or higher. I have lost confidence in the rating system and will be very hesistant to booked with them again. I would prefer to pay more and base on my own selection. I guess I just expected more from a 2.5 star hotel.

I have stayed at the Larchmont Hotel at least 10 times over the last 10 years. I have stayed there primarily for price and location. It is on a gorgeous street between 5th and 6th Avenue in the Village. The street is quiet and lined with Brownstone buildings and trees (think Sex in the City streets on the show!). It is close to subways as well and everything in the Greenwich Village. Unfortunately the hotel has kept the same decor and has not been remodeled, revitalized nor maintained well throughout the years. During this last stay, the room's furniture, rug and bed spreads were looking extremely worn and old and the rug stained in many areas. The mattress felt lumpy with a rather deep indentation where all the previous people slept on. The room also smelled rather stale and stuffy. The window blinds were bent and broken allowing light in. The TV had almost no reception at all and the WifI simply did not work period. The hot water heater made A LOT of noise all night long. The bathrooms were not up to the standards of before where they were incredibly spotless and cleaned constantly, now I found hair everywhere and also some mold. Luckily the toilets were very clean! Due to these recent experiences, I will not be returning here. With the competition of new "budget boutique hotels" opening everywhere in NYC, this hotel is not worth it anymore. The hotel need to be seriously overhauled

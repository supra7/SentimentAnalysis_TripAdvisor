My husband I went here for a special evening out on the town. Upon arrival we were told we had a beautiful corner room overlooking the park. The room was quite nice and it was in fact facing the park. However, in the morning I noticed some little worm type bugs crawling around the bathroom floor, many of them disappeared under the door onto the carpet outside of the door - this just grossed me out so we checked out early. We left our car with the valet the evening before and when we got our car in the morning, we found that our ipod had disappeared from the vehicle. Overall the staff was not very helpful and/or with the room situation. I honestly can say that I will not stay at this hotel in the city again. There are many we will choose first like The Liberty, InterContinental, etc. The Langham is in a great location to walk to the Faneuil Hall and the Waterfront. I also found the lobby furniture to be in pretty rough shape, it really could use a new look.

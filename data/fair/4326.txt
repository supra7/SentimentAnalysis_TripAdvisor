Pretty Ridiculous I had read all the great reviews on this hotel, so I decided to stay here this past weekend. I have literally stayed at every hotel in NY and this was pretty bad. We were supposed to have a superior room, but due to delayed flight we didnt check into the hotel until 1 am. They had sold our room and stuck us in a double room. the room was so small, you couldnt pass somebody at the foot of the bed. Smalest hotel I have ever been in. We had a fantastic view outside of city workers tearing down a building which started at 5 am each morning and didnt end till 9 at night everyday. I feel that the hotel should have given guest some warning as to the noise level outside, or have discounted the rooms that had that noise. Never had room service so I cant tell you how that was. One of the elevators was out of service so you waited a minimum of 10 minutes on your floor to get into an overly packed elevator. Room key on two occasions didnt work, and we had loud neighbors in the room next door. I dont recommend this hotel to anyone. especially if you are used to a more higher end hotel!

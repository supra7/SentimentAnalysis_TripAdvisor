Stay frequently in this neighborhood for work, and I sampled the W's "charms." So depressing. As a female business traveler, I prize hotels that are cosy and feel safe and clean. The W features a huge trendy bar in the lobby--like passing through a cocktail party to check in (seems to be the case in all the Ws I've visited) with loud techno music even in the elevators. The halls are dimly lit in an artsy way with tiny spotlights in lieu of real lights (what are they hiding?)--it didn't make me feel comfortable to pass through these dark halls and I practically ran with my luggage. My room was even darker and wasn't helped by the stingy three lamps with low wattage bulbs, the black-and-gray carpet, grey/silver walls and slippery maroon comforter. In fact, I travel with needlework to pass the time in the evenings, and couldn't see well enough to work on it! The room was clean but tiny (typical NY) and looked out onto a parking garage and roof, which didn't add much light in the daytime either. Bathroom was just ok with a stall shower--barely big enough for one person--and a giant water stain on the ceiling. Thoroughly grim and I won't be back if I can help it. It's a pity, because the location is great and there are tons of wonderful little eateries nearby and it's just a few blocks from wonderful shopping including the Bloomingdale's flagship store. The W needs to grow up.

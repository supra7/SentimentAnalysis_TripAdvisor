This hotel is awful- We had to stay here because the Essex where the rest of our staff was staying was sold out by the time we booked our rooms. The room doors feel like prison doors and the hotel overall was dirty and a little scary. One morning the power went off for almost hour and the staff acted like they couldve cared less at the inconvenience this caused us trying to get ready and out the door for a work convention we were attending. Over all we were incredibly dissatisfied and will not be staying here again.

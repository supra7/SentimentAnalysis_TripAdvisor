Stayed at this hotel for a convention and it was just "ok." The lobby was nice, but the rooms were really outdated. The bathroom was narrow and the fixtures were from the 70's. The shower pressure and temperature changes when anyone else in the hotel flushed a toilet in a nearby room. The air conditioning in the room was not keeping pace....they have installed one of those motion sensors to shut the thing down when nobody is there....clearly a good idea. Problem is at night, when you are not moving (asleep), it shuts off, so I woke up each night uncomfortable. The bed was great, so was the bedding and pillows. Ordered room service and it took forever (1.5 hours) and was over priced and mediocre at best My advice...lots of other choices in Dallas.

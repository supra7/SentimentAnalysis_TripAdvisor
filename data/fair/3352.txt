Please know what you're getting into when you book this hotel. It is small, privately held, and on a very busy street for nightlife. I knew that when I booked. My problem is NOT that my room was right on the street and not really even that there was no sound proofing between the street and my room. I could even see light pushing through the cracks in the door during the day. Sure, the transom has no window treatment and so you get a streetlight unfiltered, keeping the room brighter than the brightest day all night. My problem is with the way parking is administered. They have a VERY SMALL lot and have a first come first served policy. I knew all that. I checked in and was charged $45 for 3 days of parking. No problem. However, the last night, the lot was full, and I was denied parking. The front desk "attendant" told me that someone had parked there illegally. So, I asked her why not have them towed. She replied that the lot was too small to get a tow truck into it (a good hint for anyone who wants to park for free). She sent me to a lot a couple of blocks away. So, I asked her if she was going to refund my parking. No, she wasn't able to do that. Only a manager can do that. At checkout, a new person at the desk. Parking is on my bill. I ask for it to be refunded. Again. Sorry, only managers can do that, and no, she won't get a manager to call me. I can try calling later. So I did. No manager. No message. Next day, another call. No manager. No message. You get the idea. Now, I am calling American Express.

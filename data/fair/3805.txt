Where to begin? I was in Phoenix with clients on business and this hotel was recommended because of the price. First of all, the hotel is so large that you really can't walk around it all if dressed for work. So, they send golf carts to tote you around. A pain in the neck. Secondly, it's a family place with millions of kids running around. Thirdly, while I was there they had the national Cheerleadling competition there so at 7 in the morning there were kids practicing outside of my room which obviously woke me up. The rooms themselves are all suites and have been refurbished recently. But the lighting was awful and the rooms very small. Also the sink was in my bedroom which seemed really odd. I worked at night and when I got back to my room I wanted to get some ice. But, the ice machine near my room was by a swimming pool which was locked up so I couldn't get any. When I called the front desk, they told me I could get ice somewhere else, but it was a long walk and the grounds were very dark. Creepy, actually. As if all of this weren't enough, upon checking out I was charged a $30 per day faciliy fee. I was there on business, I didn't use any of there facilities at all. So, maybe if you and your family are traveling for pleasure, consider this hotel. But, if you're going to Phoenix on business, you're better off at a Holiday Inn.

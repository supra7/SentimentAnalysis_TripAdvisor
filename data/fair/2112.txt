My husband and I were only in town for one night. I decided to cancel our reservation at the Nine Zero and book here to save a little money. Huge mistake. I get the hotel is old, I expected that and it is charming in that way. What I didn't expect was 10 year old televisions and no free internet. The location is good and for business I could see the draw (except for the no internet). I think for the price you can find better at a place nearby. The check in and check out process was quick and painless. The beds were decent but the bathrooms showed their age and the floors are very slippery when wet, even with a towel down. Beware of the concierge, they seemed to be pushy when it came to getting a cab or taking the hotel truck, although either will set you back about $30 to Logan.

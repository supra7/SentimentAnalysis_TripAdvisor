I hate surprises. Especially when they are sneaky charges. We checked in to the Maui Coast on a rate of $161 only to find tucked into the welcome package a note indicating a "mandatory" $15 per night resort fee to cover a long list including pool towels, parking, etc, etc. All these are things I would expect from a mid-range hotel. In my opinion, it is just a way to increase the rate without advertising it. We checked out next day, on principle. By the way, no WiFi in the rooms, slow sink and a noisy AC unit completed the picture. On the positive side it was a nice, clean spacious room, great grounds, lovely lobby friendly check-in. I'd not recommend it simply because of the duplicitous charge.

This hotel is visually stunning but after a long day of touring Maui, a lengthy tortuous walk to your room is not exactly very rewarding. During our stay, the nearest elevators went out of service and the door keys ran out of batteries. This kept us out of our room for 2 hours in midday! These small things DO cause a lot of inconveniences especially when you plan a grand vacation at a steep price. It remains a bragging piece for your Maui vacation to have stayed at the Grand Wailea, but be ready for some disappointments.

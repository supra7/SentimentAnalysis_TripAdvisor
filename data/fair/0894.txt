I would not recommend this hotel. We stayed here on our honeymoon for a week and found ourselves standing in line for checking in, queueing every morning to be seated for breakfast, dismissive staff, tagged every morning for use of the pool, hundreds of people, mediocre rooms and what I will remember forever is the bird droppings everywhere! The breakfast room and all the dining rooms are open air so everywhere you sit there are bird droppings! Watch the backs of the chairs!. It puts you off your food. There are literally hundreds of people here and you're treated like a number. There are copious amounts of food here for breakfast and lunch and dinner portions are huge but although it looks good there is little or no flavour due to poor quality ingredients -fruit and veg with no flavour. Meals are expensive too. Also there is a daily charge for parking and gym whether you use them or not. There is no luxury and its not a romantic place, I was very happy to be leaving after a week, in fact I couldn't wait.

We arrived at The Roosevelt, Confirmation in hand, at 6 PM only to find that there was not a room ready for us. We were asked to wait, along with our luggage, in the lobby for "fifteen minutes or so". We noticed at that time that the lobby somewhat resembled an airport that had been shut down due to inclement weather. People were all over the lobby with their luggage awaiting a room. After 20 minutes we returned to the counter to check and were told that it would be "about another 20 minutes or so" before our room was ready. When we asked what would have happened had we arrived at the 3:00 check-in time and we were told that we "most likely would have had a room". So what does this mean? Even though we gave them a credit card to "confirm", thus the term "confirm" our room they seemed to have given it to someone else. We finally settled for a Queen Room even though we had reserved a King. On the second day of our stay, Maid service arrived promptly at 4 PM! (The hotel did compensate us by slipping a letter of apology under the door of our room?) As it turned out, several people attending the same Reception we were, had the same problems with rooms not being ready. Then the evening after the Reception one couple went, Confirmation in hand, to check in and were told they did not have a room and no rooms were available. They were from out of town and had to drive the 70 miles back to their home that night. The only reason for all of these problems can be overbooking. We were looking forward to our stay at a Historic New Orleans hotel with a great reputation but were very let down. We will not be staying there again.

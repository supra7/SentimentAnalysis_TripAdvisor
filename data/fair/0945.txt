WE had a less than relaxing stay at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort? and Spa. The hotel gave us anything but a resort like stay. I think my friends who recommended the hotel really stayed somewhere else. I will just list the good and bad of our stay. Good: Nice looking pool and grounds, good balcony size, rooms are new, good ocean view, good food. Problems: HORRIBLE service, we could not call the lobby once because the phone was busy. On the ninth call she explained everyone took their break and that she was the only one at the desk. The service continues to the pool service to cleaning crews(a dirty window in the room blocking view, and when I asked someone to clean it in the hall she siad not tell she finishes all the other rooms in the hall. She didn't come for 3 hours. Ugly building, it doesn't fit in with hawaii, and it looks like an old office building in china town from the 80's. This hotel tries to make up for its 80's look with the pool. The pool is fun tell one of the hundreds of kids I was swimming by starting giggling for no reason. When I asked her what was wrong she said she was going to the bathroom. Gross!! This freaked me out since there were kids everywhere all giggling. Also the rooms are Asian themed and fit in with the hotel, but not Hawaii. The Hyatt also had a unswimmible beach (coral everywhere that cut you) and we had to walk 10 minutes each day to the north end. The hotel tries to percieve itself as a nice Hawaiian hotel put fails in every cateragory. Should of booked the Westin, Sheraton or Grand Wailea

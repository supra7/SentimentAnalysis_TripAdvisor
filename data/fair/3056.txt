Westins--Love them. this Westin--HATE it. The reviews that say that the hotel needs help, are all correct. I know I know, I should not have visited there during the week of Christmas, but we decided at the last minute to pop over to Maui for the holiday weekend. Here is a list of things to hate at this hotel: Front dest staff are down right rude. I am the type who approach the desk always with a smile and usually have wonderful staff to assist you, or answer a quick question. Here I was glared at and told to step aside! They only care about selling time shares here. Yep--there are other comments on this, and it is true. I was approached three times in the first 24 hours and almost scheduled without consent to a tour of the property and a presentation. If you are a GOLD member--EXPECT NOTHING from this hotel. No room upgrade, no late check out, no newspaper, No bottles of water,no seperate check in desk to speed things along when they are 15 people deep at check in and they only have 1 person working the desk, while the other one hides from time to time in the back. But you can expect a room with a view of the garbage cans(that has not been cleaned), or low level room overlooking the rooftop for the front of the hotel--and a view of all the garbage that is on that low level roof. was actually told while I was at the front desk--"we are a resort hotel and therefore we do not have to provide any of the upgrades or amenities of the SPG program" "we are a destination hotel and have a certain group of people who come back every year for the holidays and that is who we give our best service to" Did I mention they allow dogs? sure thing--had a giant poodle sit next to me on a lounge chair and later walk over and drink from the pool. and yes-I kid you not, hike its leg on the nearest rock next to the pool. (I was horrified) STAY AWAY from this hotel. there are several other hotels on this beach with better staff, newer facilities, and you wont be treated like cattle.

I am currently staying at the Peabody for a convention. This is without a doubt a well-maintained, upscale property in a location convenient to the Orange County Convention Centre. The staff is friendly and service is prompt. The rooms have nice beds, linen, etc but are nothing exceptional. The outstanding feature - or omission - in the room is the lack of a coffee maker. Can't remember the last time I stayed at a hotel without a coffee maker in the room. Thankfully, there is 24 hour room service but there is no excuse for no coffee maker in the room. My other gripe with the hotel is about the health club. When I travel for a convention, I like to get my workout in early to beat the crowds. At the Peabody Orlando, you cannot get into the health club with your room key and the club does not open till 6 AM. It costs $10/day (or $25/week) which is not surprising for a hotel in this class. However, the hotel should allow guests to access the health club 24 hours with a room key like every other hotel I have stayed at does.

Ok, it is bad. The room is shabby, the shower made a horrible noise whenever the water was running. Sounded like a jackhammer. Valet parking was terrible. Did not want to leave our car there. Tons of construction in the neighborhood which starts at 6:30 am. Staff was rude and impatient. The location isn't even that good, a little to far north for me. A long walk back up hill from Pike Place Market to the hotel. And the price was too high for the quality of hotel and service. Live and learn.Booked our hotel before reading reviews on Trip Advisor.

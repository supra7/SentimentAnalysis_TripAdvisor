lots of little glitches that just take away from the vacation, to being put in a room with two double beds versus the king bed booked, to having a welcome card in someone else's name in our room, to having the fruit and cheese for said person taken from the room, the dirty tub and seat cushion, to only being able to get one drink to take away at the bar - guess your spouse needs to be glued to you, to the 'try for a free gift at starwood' to only find out someone had already removed the card so we were SOL Guess we aren't coming back

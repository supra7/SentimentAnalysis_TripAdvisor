I was afraid I was going to get bed bugs. Great location, but room smelled as soon as I walked in. Bathroom smelled like urine. Sheets were wrinkled like the bed had not been changed. Old crummy shower no light bulb in lamp. Very over priced for what you got. Hallways filthy. Only thing good is location.

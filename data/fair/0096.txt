I'm usually a pretty postive reviewer but sorry can't do it on this one. My buddy's bed had hair it in, lots of hair, shower did not work at all... and there were men's shaving rements all over the bathroom. Basically it I think it must have used to have been a building full of bachelor suites made in the 70's.. they slapped a bit paint on it and tried to pass it off as a hotel. I was going to complain but when I got to the front desk in the morning there was a huge line of people all complaining. The courtyard is very quaint and the location is good but you can definitely stay at a nicer hotel in Seattle for around the same price.

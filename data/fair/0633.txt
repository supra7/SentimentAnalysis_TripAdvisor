The hotel is showing signs of wear on carpets and furniture. The beds weren't very comfortable. There is an $8/day charge for self-parking yet this is clearly a suburban hotel with lots of open space around it. Typically parking is included in the price in such locations. Wifi is available for an extra charge - not free. Billed as an airport hotel yet it is about a 10 minute drive from the airport. There is an extra charge of $15/day per adult over 1 in the room (to cover the allegedly "free" breakfast). The breakfast is a little lower quality than what I've seen at other Embassy Suites (no English Muffins available, fruit is cut melon and apples/oranges - no bananas or berries available; cereal selection is limited). Microwave/mini-fridge in room. Computers (2) in the business center sketchy - one not connected to the printer. Clearly this property is being milked for all possible profit at the expense of the customer experience. Would recommend only to those who realize that they will be receiving an abbreviated Embassy Suites experience. Sights to visit in Seattle (one day): Museum of flight (4 miles away from hotel); Harbor cruise (10 minutes from museum); Pike Place Market (walk from harbor cruise); Space needle (open at night too). The Elliott's Oyster House restaurant (next to harbor cruise dock) has an amazing selection of oysters on the half shell - highly recommended if you want oysters.

After living in Chicago for years, but never staying in the beautiful Palmer House, I finally got my wish with a work convention there. I stayed 2 nights in a miserable, tired, tiny room that looked out over a concrete roof and an adjacent office building. This room had just enough room for a small full bed, an armoire, and a little desk. The overhead light flicked for several minutes before turning on completely (just like in the movies), the shower was only luke warm (with cheap toiletries), and the halls were dated and dingy. Even the dry cleaning service returned clothes that smelled like smoke! Overall, I was very disappointed in the way the Hilton has not maintained this beautiful hotel.

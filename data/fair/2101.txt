Beware- the walls are paper thin as other reviewers had reported. Breakfast buffet at Pairings was overpriced for mediocre food. Rooms need to be updated. Bathrooms are postage stamp size- door must be closed to sit on the commode. Staff was pleasant but cannot recommend this hotel. The beds & pillows were comfortable. Very little door staff/bellman- use the revolving door as the main doors are very heavy! Looks like most of the reviews are pretty unfavorable- find another place to stay! The pictures on the hotel website certainly make the hotel appear better than it is! Perhaps the Tower rooms are nice- never got to see them!

I really enjoyed this hotel. Nice room, no Las Vegas casino BS - convenient desk, parking, nice breakfast. But unfortunately I discovered that the maids washed my water glasses in the sink. I cannot stand this. It is disgusting to think that the same person who is cleaning your toilet and bathtub is washing your dishes in the sink - without dishwashing liquid or hot water. It is just gross. So I will not return here. Management was non-responsive to this issue.

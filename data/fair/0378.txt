We live in Seattle and each year we book a hotel room downtown for the tree and BON star lighting. This year through an auction site we ended up at the Edgewater for around $120/with tax. Upon arrival we were told we needed to shell out another $30.00 to get a waterside room. We obliged thinking we got a good price through the auction site and were in the holiday spirit. Once in the room it had an overwhelming smell of smoke upon arrival even though the check in person told us twice the hotel was non smoking. Our water view was nice but too close to a dock where a large boat was being worked on even late at night! The decor of the hallway and the room were very dated and did not have a "Seattle" feel. This hotel is not worth more than $120/night, I feel very sorry for others that have paid $250/night for this place especially for a room that is not waterside. I would not recommend this to anyone as there are so many other better alternatives in Seattle.

In the depth of Chinatown and its smells. Rooms are spacious but expect stained carpet and barren walls. Four women travelling together with no secondary mirror in room. Adequate bathroom with comfy beds. Bed linen appeared clean. Noticed no sprinkler system in room. OK if you spend absolutely no time in the room other than sleeping.

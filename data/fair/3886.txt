This hotel is an older, refurbished building, with several off shoots to the main building. We had the misfortune of staying in an annex located in an alley surrounded by bars. It is a VERY busy and extremely noisey location. The room was older but large, slept 5 comfortably, but the beds were very hard and the carpet was filthy. The room had a nice size stocked kitchen with a bar and a large dining room table. There is no air conditioning, which I am very glad it was only in the high 60's cause it got pretty stuffy in the late afternoon, and you would not dare leave the sliding glass door open at night, as we were in an alley with all types of actvitiy, homeless people sleeping in the bushes, people smoking pot and lots of intoxicated individuals. The last night we had several people banging on our door at 3:30 in the am. The average age in this particular block was around 19 years old. It felt more like spring break in Rocky Point Mexico. On a positive note....the beach was just a very short block away, and you could see the waves from the balcany.

This hotel has really gone downhill. While checking in, we received a parking ticket that we didn't discover until the next morning...$48 if paid within 7 days, and $76 after that. If you don't discover it before you drive away from the hotel, you have to email, fax or mail the ticket back to them or pay up. Not exactly convenient for someone leaving on vacation!) This is even if you pay the $10 per night parking fee. The elevators are LOUD and keep you awake all night long. (Our room was 4 doors down and it was still a problem, so this isn't just the case for the rooms adjacent to the elevator) Although the staff offer a smile, you get the feeling that they are disinterested and some are simply downright condescending and rude. The food is decent...IF the restaurant happens to be open when you are there! This used to be a pleasant place to stay when traveling in and out of Sea Tac airport, but it seems poorly managed and completely lacks customer service.

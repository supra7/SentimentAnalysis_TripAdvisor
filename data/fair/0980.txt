We stayed at the hotel (actually forced) as a result of a cancelled flight. Here's the good and the bad. Good: Very helpful staff, beautiful grounds, prime spot on the beach, and plenty of Hawaiian activities (lei making, hula lessons, etc.) Bad: Very, very outdated rooms. Pretty shabby and everything was dingy and felt dirty. May not have actually been dirty, just felt dirty since everything was old. And you can hear everything from your neighbors. Walking from above, showers running, toilets flushing, etc. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again...rooms need major renovations. However, I would recommend the Mahana! It was beautiful.

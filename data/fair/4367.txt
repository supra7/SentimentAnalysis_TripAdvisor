Ill start by saying that this is not my first time in New York city, so I knew that I was not booking nor paying for a grandiose hotel, I was booking somewhere to sleep. In some cases this hotel surpassed my expectations, in others, it was a complete fail. First, the room and bathroom were quite clean and troublesome free. There was a television problem but I did not mind. The neighborhood is fantastic and it was very easy to travel around. The problems I had mainly took place the night that I checked- in: the bellman did not even offer to help my daughter and wife with their luggage. They literally stood at the front desk chatting up a storm and stared at my family and I. This would not be so problematic if the hotel had an elevator, but it did not. I even asked if I could have help with the luggage and the young man made a disgruntled sigh before disappearing into the back office where he had visibly kicked his feet up and played with his phone. The other was stumbling around the bar flirting like he was a prepubescent child. This is true, and I really wish I was making this up. Later that night I came back to the hotel and my door was not working, after changing my keys FOUR times, the clerk told me that I had to wait until the night manager arrived until I could go into my room; he was due to arrive at 11pm, at that moment it was 9:30. He arrived early and simply changed the batteries to my door,this took him two minutes and I wondered why on earth couldn't one of the the 5 men or women working downstairs could not do that it was not like they were busy! Hell, I would have changed the battery myself if I would have know that was the problem. All in all, my stay would not have been so bad if the hotel management hired a more capable staff.

While it's a trendy hotel, it is lacking in a number of areas. The first room we were in was large, but the step up to the bathroom measured 10". And, the ceiling was that much lower than normal, so my 6'4" body felt "squished". We checked in late, after seeing a play, and the room was quite warm. So I turned on the window shaker, (yes, that's all they have), and while it worked well for cooling, there is only one fan speed - loud and high. Trying to get some sleep was difficult, and when I turned it off about 3am and opened the window, the traffic noise, buses and police sirens were worse. They "fixed" the fan, as there were some additional noises, but then told us that's the only speed. We moved to another room that would be quieter, but it was only nominally so, and much smaller. The front desk didn't seem truly committed to resolving the issue. Then at checkout, we learned that they had charged us $30 a park our car, which we never moved, while we could have parked ourselves in the same garage for $12 a day. The tv was intentionally set to refuse our iPod plugin, as we wanted to watch a show my wife had built showing our previous 28 anniversaries. They were much more interested in selling us adult movies - I guess to go along with the unpriced optional equipment in the room, a vibrator. But they did offer 7 versions of Spiritual books, like the Bible, Koran and such. How touching.

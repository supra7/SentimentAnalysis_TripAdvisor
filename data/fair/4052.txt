We show up at about 5:30 pm and told the reserved room is not ready. Maybe about an hour. I'm tired, it's well after check in time. I raise a stink. After the normal script of "I apologize" and my conveying my disatisfaction, they find a room available!! Starbucks Coffee? Not in this Hotel. All they have is Wynn Coffee (about $4.00 for normal coffee 14-16 oz). The signage that leads you around the hotel, is sometimes right, and sometimes not. We found ourselves going around in circles, following the signs. Take a compass!! Expecting the usuall express checkout on the TV, we check our bill. There are charges that are not ours. we call the front desk and are told we have to fill out a form at the front desk. The charges were made at 1:00 on our check in day. We didn't even check in till 5:30. We didn't even have a room yet (to charge to the room). Back to the script again (I apologize sir). Maam, it's common sense that the charges are not ours, can't you just fix it without us. I'm sorry sir, but you'll have to come and wait in line and fill out the form. Yes, there are lines to check in and out. I see signs of too many cutbacks. Room is very nice, show was very good. For around $200 a night, this hotel is not worth the money. The bugs not worked out yet. Even calling the front desk is cordial at best! For this money, I'd take Ceaser's or the Venetion. Not ready from prime time. Oh yeah, the black jack games at the bar do not comp drinks, Period! Doesn't matter how much you play. gym? yes, but if you want to shower, that's extra! not kidding. funky mattress?? Your sorta of at the end of the strip.

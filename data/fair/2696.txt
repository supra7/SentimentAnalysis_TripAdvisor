Very average I found the Melasti had a great location but the hotel is very old and in desperate need of an over haul. I found the staff at reception were not very helpful and the room service was very slow and normally cold by the time it reached the room.The egg station was the best thing about breakfast but anything else was very average.The pool is not covered by any shade and the pool bar is in direct sun all day, which also means the water in the pool gets very warm through out the day.Would not stay there again

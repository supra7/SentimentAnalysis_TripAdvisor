This little roadside motel is convenient if you are travelling through Napa Valley and have absolutely nowhere else to stay. But beware, not all the rooms are cozy & sweet as they may display on their website. The road noise is incessant, the staff is amateurish, and the amenities are basic. This would all be tolerable if these factors were reflective of average room rates, but at over $200.00 single beds during summer travel season you should expect better. Save your money for a good case of wine, the El Bonita is not worth it !

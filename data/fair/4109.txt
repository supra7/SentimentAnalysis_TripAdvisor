Cute hotel but staff weren't very helpful. This is a pretty little hotel in a great area but I was disappointed with the staff. I had to carry my large and heavy suitcase up 2 narrow flights of stairs without any help or offer of help. In fact, the person on the front desk just watched me struggle with it! Personally I think this hotel is overrated. I wouldn't return here.

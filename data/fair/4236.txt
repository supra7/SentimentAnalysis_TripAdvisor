The hotel lobby is very nice and there's even a sign that says "Enjoy our new look!" as you walk in. Beautiful grand piano, new furniture, and fresh new wallpaper. The niceness stops there. Turn the corner and there are stains on the carpets and old paint. The entire hotel (except for the nice, new lobby, of course) looks like it had its last makeover in 1988. As you walk down the hall, you can actually see that the hallway/building is leaning to one side. The carpet inside the room was always damp, and there's this general damp/musty smell throughout the entire building. I normally enjoy returning to my hotel room after a long day out, but I dreaded coming back to this room because of the smell. We had trouble getting the internet to work in our room, but they were good about fixing the problem right away. The pools were a decent size and there were several, which was good. The tile/sharp pebbles on the pool deck could be replaced, though. There's a swim-up pool bar, (somewhat) nice game room, tennis/shuffleboard courts, and an area with several hammocks for relaxing on. It was in a excellent location for the beach and the Coastal Hwy. strip. There was plenty of parking on-site. The room was large, but sort of cramped: the kitchen area (with its 1970s-era counters/appliances) is right in your face as you walk in, along with a small dining set that you hope doesn't become a fire hazard should you need to escape. The bathroom was tiny and constantly damp, but functional. I'd stay again if nothing else or a worse hotel was the only one available, but the Holiday Inn at 17th Street is a much nicer place (we looked to transfer there after a few days, but they were booked).

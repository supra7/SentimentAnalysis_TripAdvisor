I stayed at the Maui Prince for one night in August (2004). I was fairly disappointed in this hotel. While the staff is helpful and the beach is nice, I did not like the rooms or the pool. The rooms desperately needed a makeover. The walls were marked up. The furniture was old and dirty. The bedspread was falling apart. The pool was not nearly as cool as other places on the island. I was so upset that our travel agent booked us there on our honeymoon. It was not close to the paradise I expected, and not worth what I paid for the trip. I paid an extra $500 and moved to the Hyatt and it was well worth it. While I'm sure this hotel is fine for some people, if you are picky about where you stay, don't stay here.

Booked hotel based on location. Very centrally located and close to tube and bus routes. Staff was friendly, but was adamant about a 4% charge for using credit card. No mention about this on website. Also room was insanely small. No desk, no phone, no towel bars, no hangers for clothing and half of light bulbs were removed = poor lighting. TV worked, but no remote( asked for one and was supplied with one two days later). Breakfast room was very small, and made for some uncomfortable eating moments, but overall not too bad. On the whole I would say the hotel was absolutely misrepresented on the website. The rooms do not even come close to what is described or shown. For the price one would expect more. This is more comparable to youth hostel than hotel.

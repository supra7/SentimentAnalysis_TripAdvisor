My husband and I were really looking forward to this trip. He has been working long hours and a restful week at a Ritz beach resort seemed like the perfect vacation. Most summmers we spend our vacation out of the country and do lots of sightseeing. The location is beautiful. The golf course, pool and beach are lovely as well. Unfortunately, the pool and beach are not very welcoming. The wind blows relentlessly at the pool. So much so that they do not have umbrellas. The strong wind can blow your drink or book away and the sun is hard to escape. If you have stayed at other Ritz beach resorts you will miss the pool and beach services also. At the pool, an unhappy staff member may bring you a drink. At the beach, no drinks or towels will be brought to you. Chairs and umbrellas are not allowed on the Ritz beach. Chairs but no umbrellas are allowed on the grassy area above the beach. There is a bay close by where you can rent chairs and an umbrella. We stayed on the club level. The food options were quite nice. Worth the extra price. The staff was very nice. The strange thing was how dirty the hallways were. The carpets on the club level looked like there had been some kind of flooding. It made you feel like they sure were not worried about your impression. Based on some other comments about this, it has been this way quite awhile. Mowing the greens at 5:30 am was cruel also. Overall, I would say this is not acceptable for a 5 star Ritz. It felt like a large nice Marriot or Hyatt. That would have been ok for $200.00 a night but for over $700.00 no excuse. K and D

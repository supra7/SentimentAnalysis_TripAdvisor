My 3 sisters and I drove to Seattle from MN to see the Vikings vs. Seahawks in preseason (good luck at the Super Bowl.) Before we arrived my mom paid for our room. So after I got home and got my charge card bill I was shocked - Kings Inn charged me $205.76 for being a no show! They also overcharged my mom $40 from the agreed upon rate. It wouldn't have been a big deal if they would have fixed the error and apologized - Wrong!!! They did no such thing, in fact they said these things happen and blamed us. I have spent many hours trying to remedy this with no luck. Yes, the place was old, but charming and we LOVED the location. But customer service NO WAY!

Hi travelers! Stayed in this hotel before about three years ago...loved it! this time we stayed in a partial ocean room , and the hotel suppossedly gave us an upgrade to the BEach Tower....Beware! the room was dingy and looked dirty, and due to being renovated there is construction in the tower, which can be noisy early in the morning....we asked to be moved and of course there were no open rooms...Stay in the tower that is right above the entrance...

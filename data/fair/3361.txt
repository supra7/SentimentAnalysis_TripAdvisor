This is a bed and breakfast hotel, with a pool. The location is very nice, just SW of the French Market, just outside the French Quarter (less than 1/4 block outside). The room was a little small, but okay. The room and bathroom were somewhat dirty, but the linens were clean. The bed was excellent. Most of the rooms are centered around a small pool. We stayed for five nights, and people partied in the pool until three o'clock every night except one, so not a lot of sleep to be had. Complaints to the front desk clerk produced no help there, so don't stay here if you would like to have a good nights sleep. The front desk clerks (24 hr clerk) were very good and helpful.

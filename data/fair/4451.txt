I booked 6 nights at the Westin as a combo business/pleasure trip. At a convention rate of $249 per night PLUS $32 PER day for the car, and an additional $40 for the internet it was NOT a bargain. When I first checked in I signed up for the weekly internet rate of $40 - I still have trouble with the fact I can get free Wi-Fi at Mcdonalds or Starbucks but at a hotel where I am paying more than $1500 for my stay I don't have free wifi. To make it unberable, it was the slowest internet I've ever experienced since dial up! I tried calling the 800 number which handles their internet and got nowhere. I tried the front desk and as I was explaining the problem and the fact I had already called Tech Service they rudely stopped listening and transferred by call back to overseas tech service. I had to call the front desk TWICE and loudly say "Don't transfer me" just to get them to listen. Very frustrating! Adding to the fact the buttons on the phone for front desk and concerige did not work -- I could not dial out even to call the tech service...I had to use my cell phone. It was a miserable experience. I was there on business for 6 days but could never connect my office effectively unless I took my laptop to the convention center and used the free wifi. The hotel's own front desk staff told me "we've been having problems." Still I had to pay for it. I travel for business often and recreational travel but based on this experience I would NOT reccomend the Westin. This is the first bad review I have given on Trip Advisor...

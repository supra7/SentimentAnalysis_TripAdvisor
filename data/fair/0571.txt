We were in the Queen of Art room and was very dissapointed in the very soft and saggy mattress. The room was also poorly insulated so we had to turn on the heating unit. Unfortunately, the unit was so loud that we had to turn up the volume on the tv. Felt like we were going deaf! The next day, we asked if we could get a better mattressand the front desk upgraded us to the Artist King room. A big difference in the size of the bathroom and more comfortable mattress (although the air/heat unit was as loud). Overall, the hotel was very clean, contemporary with a very nice group of employees. Bonus - really good restaurant next door. Red Fin http://www.redfinsushi.com/

For a discounted rate the place was fine. The only negatives were the noise issues...Very thin walls...Can hear everything going on in adjoining rooms & in the hall...Housekeeping very noisy early in the AM...Loud persistant conversations in Spanish heard all morning...The old box AC/Heater unit on the wall was very loud and worked poorly...The $5 daily parking fee for the always tight self park lot is a joke...They never charged before... Most "motels" in this style/category offer free self parking for a paid guest!

If you are used to staying in nice hotels, you will be disappointed by the Ritz. It's not nearly as nice as other Ritz properties around the world and the food is pretty mediocre.. They apparently renovated the propertyrecently, but the decor looks cheap. Also, if you visit Maui during the winter months, this is definitely not the place to stay. Because it is close to the mountains, there is a lot of wind and rain and it has been consistently about 10 degrees cooler than the closest city, lahaina (a 15 minute drive).

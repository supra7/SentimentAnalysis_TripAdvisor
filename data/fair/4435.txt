I have stayed at many Westin and Starwood Properties. I must say I was very disappointed in this Westin. First of all, after driving all day, I parked apparently on the wrong side of the Hotel. I went into the hotel but could not get any information from anyone where I should park. I had made my reservations 7 mos. ahead of time. Second-Expensive rooms and on top of it extra charge for internet.....extra charge for parking your car......30 or 40 dollars a day. Third- Food is terrible! I had room service and it was unedible. So I tried the bar area and the food was also so bad that I took one bite and couldn't eat it. The bartender said he agreed and brought me something else. Fourth- The bathtub faucet dripped all the time, I tried to turn it off but could not fix it. The bathroom was out of date and completely difficult to get in and out of the tub and shower! The Westin in Pasadena could teach this Westin how to treat their customers and also how to cook food that is edible. I have stayed at the Westin in Pasadena at least 10 times. The rooms are much nicer with free internet, bellhops are much more informed and professional.. Parking not as expensive. San Diego needs to redo everything about this hotel. Extremely disappointed in this Westin.

I stayed at the W on Lexington on business. Having stayed at a number of Hotels in New York, I would try to avoid returning to the W in the future. It's probably a fine hotel, but suffered from too many of my pet hates. The room was a reasonable size, but poorly laid out. Hard to imagine it was actually "designed". In-room snack tray, kept atop a large TV balancing on top of the mini-bar was quite a precarious combination. The furnishings in the room were clearly quality when they were installed, but torn bedding, frayed blinds, scratched and damaged desk, broken bed.. needs some TLC! As other travellers have reported, the aircon in my room could have done with a service. I was never hot, but the cooling was only just barely adiquate and had a terrible smell. The bathroom is small. Complementary toiletaries were not pleasant. It was impossible to have a shower without soaking the floor and no room for a wash bag etc. I didn't find the staff partiuclarly helpful or friendly and even the elevator music irritated me!

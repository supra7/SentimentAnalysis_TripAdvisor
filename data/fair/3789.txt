We stayed at the hotel one night. We bought the deal on LivingSocial.com...and I think everyone else in town did also. We did go on a weekend (Saturday) and the waterpark was VERY crowded. There was no organization at the lazy river. You had to fight to get a tube, and some of these people (mostly adults) held 5-6 tubes together and would continuously go round and round. You would think with people waiting, you would only be able to go around once, then give the next person a turn. I didn't understand that. We wound up going to one of the swimming pools that were less crowded and enjoyed ourselves there. Check you beds! I believe my daughter got bit my bed bugs. She woke up with two areas of small red welts, three to four of them right in a row, under her armpit. The positives...the french toast at the lobby grill was the best I ever had.

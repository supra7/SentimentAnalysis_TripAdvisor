overpriced (i paid $320.00 a night), worn out carpet and mattress, uncomfortable, absurdly priced parking ($51.00 per day), no free internet ($15.64 a day), no free exercise room, bare minimum accessories in room, and a toilet that would be more at home in a high-volume truck stop than in an alleged luxury hotel. after eight nights at the fairmont, i can honestly say i gave it a shot--and it consistently disappointed. i will not be returning--there are dozens of better options--and there is no way this place should garner 4-stars.

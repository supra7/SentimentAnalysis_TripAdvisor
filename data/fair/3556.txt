I've traveled extensively to NYC for several years- always staying at a Starwoods property. My client insisted on staying at this W. What a mess-- we were both highly disappointed, disgusted in the lack of service in the lobby and bar area, and they charges were embarssingly expensive. Two months later I am still getting miscellaneous charges-- now from the shipping department even though I brought my own label and tipped generously. Never will I stay at a W again. W = WORTHLESS

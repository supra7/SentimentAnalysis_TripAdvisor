My Mom, sister and I stayed here with our three kids. Upon arrival, only one of our rooms was available. We waited three hours, to find the second room had to have had a toilet overflow...STINKY! We refused to stay in that room so they upgraded us to a suite and a smaller room. Our smaller room's lock was not working, so we kept having to have them come in and let us in. (it happened a lot with the kids going from room to room). The staff did their best, but the hotel is a bit shabby...Our shower controls were installed improperly, so it took a little while to find the hot water. (we had to point the control to COLD). Dumb stuff, but it did grate on our nerves a bit. We loved the bellmen and valets, they couldn't have been more helpful. Wireless internet would have been nice. You had to pay for TV internet, we didn't use it. Our rooms were above the bar downstairs, it was pretty loud last night until about 10:30-11. The funny thing is, I had a bad experience here in '91, and wrote my first nastygram to a hotel. (the comped me another visit) Since that time I have written one other complain letter (to VW), so I'm not really a whiner... If they do some renovations, I'd give them another shot, but for now, they're off the list. I think the staff was great given what they had to work with.

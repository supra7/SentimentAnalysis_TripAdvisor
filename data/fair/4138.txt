this is an okay hotel, but a bit overrated on tripadvisor. * the room was okay, but the fireplace was not working, and even though we asked them to fix it, it never got fixed during our stay. there is no bath tub, just a shower. * the breakfast is alright, better than the breakfast at a holiday inn, but not as good as a bed & breakfast. * the elevator was terrible; it was old, and if someone forgot to close the door (it didn't shut automatically), nobody could use the elevator. several times, we had to use the stairs to get to our room on the top floor. we switched to a different hotel (commodore) after two days.

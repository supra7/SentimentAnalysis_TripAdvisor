I have never been one to write review but this recent trip has pushed enough buttons that here I go. We are well travelled both on business and pleasure and have been to some amazing places and while the hotel buildings and grounds are nice the service, lack of follow through and quality of food and drink are second rate. And when questioned you get a lot of blank stares and let me check with my manager. Rooms-all of the rooms are basically the same size jr suite but the views are questionable, don't know where they get off calling this ocean view, you must be on the 3rd or 4th floor or there just isn't a view. Walls and windows are thin and you hear everything in the adjoining rooms and there is no hot water, at best Luke warm which makes the two bath tubs that come with your room unappealing- much less usable and even if is really hot outside and you want a cool plunge the water is brown once you get over two inches in the bottom Food-all the food seems to come out of the same kitchen almost like a massive Vegas buffet, no matter which of the 7 options and much of it is just repurposed with a different sauce Hot water-

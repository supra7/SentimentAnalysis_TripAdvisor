We stayed at the adjacent Westin Ocean Villas which were great - no complaints. We were there for my sister's wedding. Had all of our appts at the spa for mani/pedi/hair for bridal party. First thing said to the bride upon arrival at the spa was "what happened to Sunday? I'm coming in on my day off for you! What happened to the make-up appointments on Sunday?" We had cancelled the make-up a month earlier (their cancellation policy is 1 day.) She then wouldn't say a word to the bride as she did her trial hair up-do. The style was not quite what the bride had envisioned but the stylist refused to change it unless we paid for an entire second up-do fee! What is the point of a trial bridal hair do if you can't modify it at least once?? We were appalled at the rude service and we will never be back.

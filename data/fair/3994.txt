Party Hotel Yes, Comfort No!!! My husband and I stayed at the Clift for a weekend. The bed was a rock and the walls are paper thin. Rooms are old and carpet looked like it needed a good cleaning. Or better yet, replaced. We got a complimentary upgrade upon check-in because we were celebrating our anniversary but if that was an upgrade I would hate to see their regular rooms. At night the lobby bar turns into a very loud night club. It's so crowded that you can't get into the hotel without showing your hotel ID card at the door. You can't even find a place to sit and have drink if you're coming back from a day of sightseeing. Is this a hotel or a nightclub?? If you are in your early 20's and you rather have a loud crowded club feeling than quality  comfort than this is your hotel. I can think of one good thing........the hotel is in a great location. But so are a lot of other hotels. Once was enough for us.

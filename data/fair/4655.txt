The Aston Maui Lu is an older resort that has not been maintained over the years. I was looking forward to playing tennis, but I was disappointed to see that the net was drooping half way down and there was no fence enclosing the tennis courts. The pool starts at 4 feet deep so it's not suitable for younger children. There is complimentary coffee and tea served in the lobby every morning. On the coffee table, there is only one microwave and toaster for all the guests to share. The toaster handle was broken. It fell off at one point and we had to reattach it to continue to use it. Despite all the negatives, there are a lot of positive features about the resort. The staff were very friendly and helpful to us. It is a very peaceful and quiet place to stay. We just needed to walk across Kihei road to get to the beach. Within a 5-10 minute drive, we could go to Foodland, Star Market, restaurants and shopping malls.

I was booked in to this hotel as part of a package. I stayed three nights. Everything was a little below my standards. The tub was worn - not dirty, but the enamel was stained. The mattress was soft and bendy - no springs sticking through but not much better. My name was incorrect in the system and I was told they couldn't correct it. I was unable to get my messages and had to have the switchboard put me through to get them. My last night I wanted a drink at 10:40 but the bar was closed already. I made one local call and the charge was outrageous ($2.25). I will avoid this property in the future.

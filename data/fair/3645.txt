So much was wrong with our stay, I hardly know where to start. The main problems were; - my bedding was dirty, I had to report it twice before anybody did anything about it - when you check in, no member of staff bothers to tell you anything about the hotel, you're merely handed a key (where's the gym? The spa? The restaurant? How do we operate the damn lift?!) and there's no information in the rooms to help either - the room was like a sauna so we had to use the unfeasibly loud air-con (loud enough to keep both of us awake), not what one expects in New York City in January! - the plug didn't fit the bath and the water in the sink didn't drain properly - I raised these issues when we checked out of the hotel and the guy on reception acted as though he hears just such complaints all the time and merely berated me for not asking to change rooms (so they clearly KNOW some of their rooms are not up to scratch - I wonder how they allocate such substandard rooms?!) Apparently not all W Hotels are this bad. I'm not going to risk it, pick pretty much any hotel and it'll be cheaper and better.

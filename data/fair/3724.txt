This hotel has seen better days. While the lobby is lovely, and the ducks cute to watch, this hotel is past its prime. Rooms are small, overpriced and not updated. The bed spreads were thin, dirty, stained and ugly. I stripped them immediately upon entering our room. Cheap towels and a see through plastic shower curtain that soaked the floor, made the bathroom unacceptable. Only highlight, the bath gels smelled nice. Cracking and chipped paint in room, windows that were so wet with condensation you couldn't see anything outside and the carpet beneath the windows was soggy. Pool was not heated, game room was closed for renovation and the hotel was full of conventioners. Not family friendly at all. I would never stay here again.

Not up to reputation My stepsister and I just returned from a four day stay at the Royal Hawaiian. My brother lives in Honolulu and suggested that we stay at the Royal Hawaiian because of it's reputation. I must say we were very disappointed with our stay. First off they did not give us the package we had reserved in November of 2003 for this trip. Secondly, this 5 star hotel put sheets on the bed two nights in a row that had several wear holes! Can you imagine our surprise? The second and third nights we had a roach in the bed. Sadly, this was my stepsister's first trip to Hawaii, and my brother and I felt as if we'd lost face by recommending this hotel. My brother was horrified when we told him of the holes in the sheets. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone based on our experiences. We stayed in the Tower with ocean front room with a large lanai. We ate in the Surf Room the first night we were there and found the limited selection of pricey food to be only adequate, warm not hot, and the service left a lot to be desired. After our meal came we never saw the waiter again until he was ready to give us our bill. Eat elsewhere, as that meal of prawns alfredo and two ice teas was almost $80.00!

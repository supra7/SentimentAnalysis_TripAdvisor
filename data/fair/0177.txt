Hotel was well located. Rooms quite cozy and a comfy bed. Bathroom was fine, but as others have said...the toilet flush is really noisy and likely to wake up 'the other half' in the middle of the night. We did find that the door to the adjcent room was really thin, so got disturbed one night by next door's antics, but a quick phone call to reception at 3am and it was soon sorted. The only real grip I had was the attitude of the reception desk manager (whose name I forget) but had the charm of a brick. He was neither welcoming or terribly polite and, having just arrived in Seattle from Vancouver, I was shocked and disappointed at the welcome to the city. My tip to the hotel management would be to send this guy on a charm course...or maybe just get somebody else in. Other than that, an OK hotel in a convenient part of town. Cheers!

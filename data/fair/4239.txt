Arrived at the hotel at 11 and was told room was not ready. Returned at 2PM and room was still not ready. I decided to sit in the lobby and wait for my room to witness everyone else arriving after me receive their room keys. Finally at 3:15, I was given room keys. Upon entering the room I noticed that the bathroom trash was full and the toilet area had a strong smell like Urine. Called the Front Desk and they transfered me to Housekeeping manager. His excuse was that maybe somebody had checked into this room and then changed the room. (Awful as I thought that rooms were checked after any guest enters the room). They sent a room attendant to clean the bathroom but the smell never went away. Was not offered to switch rooms or compensation. The pool is nice and so is the beach. However, public bathrooms are dirty. Will never go there again.

This hotel does not hold a candle to other four-star hotels in the Midtown East area. The rooms are cramped, dirty and poorly laid out. Because of the small size, the walls and furniture are scuffed and filthy from other travelers trying to navigate the small area. The sinks did not drain (even after we complained), and toilet flushing sounded like the take-off of the space shuttle Atlantis. The walls and doors are so thin that I am now intimately familiar with the lives of the cleaning ladies. When we checked in, we had a 20 minute wait in the lounge area for our room to be prepared even though we arrived after 3 pm. The lounge was FILTHY, with used glasses and plates littering every flat surface. In places, the plates were stacked 3-4 high. We have stayed in many four-star hotels in the midtown area (e.g., Omni Berkshire, Benjamin, Grand Hyatt, Intercontinental). The W does not compare. This hotel SHOULD NOT be marketed as 4 star!

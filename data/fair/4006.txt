over priced - no value here Stayed here for the weekend. We were here for a family event. We asked if we could get connecting rooms. Not possible. Everytime we came and left the hotel we were attacked by panhandlers. We ate in the resturant Sunday morning 7 adults and 2 children for breakfast was $249. Rooms were small but clean. We brought our own beer into the mini bar, so they took the bottle opener out of there so we could not open our beer.We will not return.

I stayed at the Dauphine for a long weekend over New Years. While the location was great, the rooms were run down, and the elevators were very tempermental. We had to pry the doors open on numerous occasions. The breakfast was mediocre and the pool area and bar were cute. I would not stay here again. Walking through the french quarter I noticed many other hotels that appeared to be alot nicer. The Ritz had the same nightly rate as the Dauphine, had I only known... While the online rate for the Ritz was high and showed no available rooms, if you call up, they are very gracious and have rooms set aside. Give that a shot, or anywhere else...

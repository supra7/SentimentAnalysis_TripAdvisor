Pros and cons Pros: clean enough, convenient to street cars and some restaurants, good price for San Francisco, safe area, free parking if you drive.Cons: VERY noisey -- could hear conversations of neighbors -- loud party at 1:00 A.M. Powdered creamer dried up -- we threw it away and got same thing back. No AC -- when we said we were hot the office said they were not turning the pilot lights off yet. There was a box fan in the closet -- that helped with the heat and the noise of the neighbors.

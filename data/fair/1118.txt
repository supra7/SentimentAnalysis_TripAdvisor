The room was absolutely stunning, but the customer service needs a lot of improvement. The elevator guards were very rude when we were scoping around the lobby for something to eat. One of them had approached us and asked, "What are you doing?" was the first thing that came out of his mouth  needless to say, we didn't eat there or will stay there again. Another occasion, of poor service occurred on our way in from a late night along the strip  a guard stopped us as we approached the elevator, Do you have a room key for here? um a "Hi. Can I help you?" would be a better question to ask. And house keeping didn't take out our trash or refill our condiments for days. Other than that, the stay was comfortable.

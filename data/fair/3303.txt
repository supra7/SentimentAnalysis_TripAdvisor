This was my second stay in the New Orleans JW Marriott. The first stay was prior to Katrina and I was quite pleased with the hotel. On this second stay, I was disappointed. In my opinion, this is a poorly-managed and worn-out hotel that no longer deserves the upscale JW Marriott brand. The Marriott across from the Conference Center is a better choice at this time. The rooms at the JW are rather small, but that's the norm in NOLA. I had a corner room with a bit more space. The furniture was rather worn out (not "distressed" to make it look old, but simply frayed and chipped). The TV was old, the picture was fuzzy, and it completely lacked the color red (probably a burned out circuit). Sure, I was not in New Orleans to watch TV, but nevertheless. I had three additional problems with the room (the safe did not work, the light bulb above the shower was burned out, and the shower curtain was dirty). I reported these problems in the morning. The same evening, I returned to my room and surprised to find that the problems were not fixed! I called and talked to the Night Manager, who apologized profusely and promised to send someone right away. They eventually replaced the shower curtain and fixed the safe while I was out for dinner. They never replaced the burned-out light bulb. In general, I found the hotel staff (e.g., porters) to be inattentive and uninterested in their jobs. For example, they opened doors for customers while continuing to chat with their buddies. No big deal, one would say, but this hotel used to have impeccable service prior to Katrina. The Concierge Lounge is large and elegant, with decent views of the French Quarter. They serve an above-average breakfast. Overall, if you demand top-notch service and accommodations, I recommend waiting until Marriott decides to renovate this hotel (and upgrade its management).

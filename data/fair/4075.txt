Why does a five star hotel need to charge you for everything? I mean really 1.50 for a local phone call, 30 dollars to use the gym, 14 to have Internet, and the list goes on and on. Its tacky and poor taste. A hotel of this caliber should not come across as cheap and that's exactly how it comes across. They nickle and dime you for everything. Sure, their cliental can affort it but its still poor taste. My husband and I were there for 3 nights and 4 days. In that time housekeeping never paid us a visit EXCEPT at 8:00am the day we were checking out. Our room wasn't exactly the cleanest either. There were crumbs under the bed and the bathroom floor looked like it hadn't been mopped around the toilet. Gross. There were also some funky things in the shower. Sure, the Encore is pretty to look at but unpleasant things lurk beneath the surface. In my opinion its tacky. customers do not come first...its Wynn's bottom line You will not find class here. My husband and I will never stay again.

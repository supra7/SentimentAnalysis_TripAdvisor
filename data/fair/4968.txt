We arrived at the hotel after a 12 hr drive and expected something relaxing. We entered the lobby which was really small and no air conditioning. The bell boy and valet was very helpful. Staff was courteous but not friendly. The elevators were really small and I was glad that they were working. The room was ok. I first noticed the cobwebs hanging from the ceiling. It was kind of cramped. The furniture is all very old. The windows were so dirty is was hard to see out of it. The bathroom looked like it was upgraded but the door could not lock as the lock itself was hanging at an edge. The beds were comfortable and the white bedding itself was on the better side even though the duvet covers itself was broken at the edges. For ice you needed to call the fron desk which arrived quite quickly. As for the internet. It never worked just with the code. We spent nearly 2 hrs trying to get it to work. Some technical person came up to check but then told us we needed to call the internet provider to get it sorted out. My husband spent and 1 hr doing this. The next day the same thing happened. We never ate at the hotel as it did not look good. The most I saw in the restaurants was 3 couples. The outside windows needed a cleaning really badly. The fridge was there but it was a bar fridge not for our use. The tv had very little channels. If you are looking for comfort and luxury definately not the hotel to go to. This was a damper on our Chicago trip for sure. Good location was the only thing about this hotel.

All Looks and No Brains I've stayed at the Clift twice now, and both times my experience was mixed. The hotel itself looks great--it has clean cool lines, high ceilings, big windows, comfortable beds. A standard room is pretty small. I stayed in a corner room suit for three nights---the room is all glamour, and filled with light, and good views. Service however, is poor, spotty, and mostly indifferent. The staff at the front desk seem overburdened with phone calls, and handling guests--I always found them harried, and rushed--and not warm. At five hundred dollars a night (for a one bedroom suit)--I expect some kind of service. (the Ritz-Carlton, even though covered in chintz, has great service)In the absense of good service, I would at least appreciate a staff that were warm, and who could exhibit a modicum of charm in such a beautiful hotel.I would say that the best way to describe the hotel would be this, that she is like a beautiful girl at a party, who has nothing to say.

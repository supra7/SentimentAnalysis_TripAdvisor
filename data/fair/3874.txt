We rented the 2 bedroom, 1 bath suite for 3 nights. While the panaromic ocean views from the balcony were beautiful, it did not make up for the lack of service, the noise that we had to endure 2 out of 3 nights, or the general uncleanliness of the suite. The kitchen was lacking basic equipment like paper towels, dish soap or dish cloths, and maid service never cleaned our kitchen at all. Both days we came back at 4 pm and the rooms still had not been cleaned. There was loud banging all night from the kitchen/bar below, and pounding music 2 out of 3 nights well past 2 am. The shag carpet was disgusting, and the wifi did not work well. The towels were old and stained, and they didn't provided enough until our last day. They tried to charge us $479 per night, way over the quoted rate on the phone. After getting no sleep the first night we complained, and they immediately reduced the rate $100 (to the originally quoted price). After the last night of noise and having to phone front desk to complain, they took another $80 off the total bill. A nice gesture, but does not make up for the lack of sleep we experienced on this trip. I'm all for retro hotels, but under no circumstances would I recommend this one to friends. One note: the maids, when they did finally clean our rooms, were friendly and did the best job they could under the circumstances.

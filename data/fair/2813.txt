This place is stunning, and absolutely massive. The service, however, was consistently poor for a hotel of this supposed quality. A rude waitress who forgot to order one companion's entree, and then delivered it 10 minutes after the others with no apology or comment. At Sunday brunch I was seated in the first seating to a filthy table including a stained, used napkin lying on my place mat. We had to request that the hostess clean it up, and despite the great spread of food, the waitress was pleasant but incompetent (for buffet service no less.) Save your money, stay elsewhere (or at the Four Seasons next door if you want quality service,) and just visit the place, act like you belong there and wander around. It's over the top, but worth seeing.

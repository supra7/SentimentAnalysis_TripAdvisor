Do not stay here if you plan to sleep. I called the front desk about people partying in the hall after midnight. After multiple calls , security finally arrived. A man and woman stumbled off the floor, the woman draped herself on the security man and asked who complained . Security actually pointed to my room. I couldn't believe it . I was a woman traveling alone . The partying didn't stop but they also started to slide things under my door. 230, I called desk again . They said they would send head if security but never did. I left the next morning before neighbors woke up. Lot of money for no sleep and no compensation. I guess if you want to party then this is the hotel for you

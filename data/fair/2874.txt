My stay at Maui Coast in Kihei, Maui was spectacular. However, there is one problem regarding the customer service at the Tradewinds pool bar. I wanted to ask for service at the jacuzzi area, however, the waitress mentioned that she is too busy to entertain my friend and I. After exercising at the hotel workout site, I approached the bar again for drink orders and the waitress had the worst look as I asked her for drinks. I would understand that she is busy, remember, customer service is most important. Calmness and self-control is the utmost important component in dealing with customers. I was told by other customers that she had been acting like that all night. I will be traveling to Maui in June and I will be staying at the Maui Coast again, I am hopeful that this can be corrected. Please reply should you have dealt with this problem. Email me at www.frank.d.calvo@us.army.mil Thank you for your patience.

I'm sorry to say that this place was less than adequate for a four star hotel. Although the rates were resonable, it lacked the quality I expected. There are many, many places to stay in NOLA so I suggest that you look elsewhere. While the service was average, the rooms were very run down and need some serious renovation. The place had a mild odor that was enough to irritate me for the duration of the stay. There were several minor things that you also wouldn't expect. For example, one of our beds (which were all seriously uncomfortable) didn't have a fitted sheet. Also, it was pretty loud. One weekday morning we could hear all the traffic below, including an annoying whistler from a person directing traffic. If it hadn't been for the fact that they have a terrible cancellation policy, we wouldn't have even stayed in the first place. I tried to change reservations well over a month before we traveled and they would not even consider changing our dates... Overall, it wasn't the worse experience ever (and we travel a lot) but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone since there are many other nice places in NOLA...

We stayed here on our honeymoon at the beginning of July. I had read many reviews of this hotel before going, so I was prepared for what to expect, yet we were still both disappointed. We had let them know that we were a honeymoon couple in advance, and it was noted when we arrived at the hotel...the person checking us in even remembered to mention it. I asked about the possibility of a room upgrade (we had paid for partial ocean view), and he said he was giving us the best room he had available, but it was still in our same room category....We took the elevator up, only to find that our room was at the very, very end of the hall, as far from the ocean as one could possibly get. Granted, it did have a decent view, but it was a disappointment that the BEST room he could give us was still probably the worst room on the floor. The room was not terrible, but the furnishings were totally out of date...I think these furnishings were modern about 25 years ago. The balcony was dirty. The bathrooms are vile. The shower is basically a hose with a nozzle. Our tub didn't drain well. The toilet area (a separate room) never felt clean. Outside of the room ,the luau took place on the lawn on our side of the hotel. This didn't really bother us, since we were usually out while it was going on, and it was always over by the time we came back (even on our early nights)....the lawn was dark and quiet by 9 PM. The beach was nice, but the chairs the hotel provided were old and dirty, many broken. There were nicer umbrella chairs available for extra $. The pool was small, but we didn't spend too much time there...too many beaches to explore. The hot tub was small and dirty. We really loved being near Wailea however, and this hotel was basically a place to lay our heads at night after exploring the island. It served its purpose, but we wouldn't go back.

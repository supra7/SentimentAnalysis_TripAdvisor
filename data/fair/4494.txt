We stayed one night in June. We booked because of the great Tripadvisor reviews and we have stayed at two other jdv hotels with great success. (Try Hotel Los Gatos if you are staying in the Silicon Valley) While the staff was very friendly and helpful, we just don't understand the rave reviews. Our room was tiny. We could hear the noise on Bush street all night and especially early morining. Dual paned windows would have made it acceptable. Our sink was clogged and we had several black hairs in our shower. My wife was so grossed out by the bathroom she refused to shower there. Breakfast was very basic.

This is the lowest of the lowest of budget resorts on the island ! The place needs a paint job real bad and I believe it has being renovated in years!! In the room the carpet needed to be replace, bathroom fixtures falling off, sliding glass door no lock, and at least 50 cats roaming around the grounds. Think twice before you book this resort; you're better off staying at a Super 8 motel or either at a Motel 6. Stay away from this place or else you'll be very disappointed !!!! They must have paid alot of money for the Aston name just to draw the people in; don't be sucked in like we were.

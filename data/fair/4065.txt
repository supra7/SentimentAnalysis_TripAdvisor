My wife and I have been to Vegas several times and enjoyed all of our previous trips. This was the first time we had ever stayed in such an expensive place like the Encore but thought the price would be worth it. We were very disapointed when after checking in, we started discovering all of the hidden fee's for things like Wifi and using their Gym. I went down to speak to the front desk and asked that they wave the fee for just one of our computers. (By the way the charge was $13.99 per day per computer to use wifi). No luck, I even spoke to the manager but she wouldn't budge. From their it only got worse, they have a sign stating no outside food or alcohol aloud in the rooms. They want you to buy their insanly overpriced food from them. Trust me, STAY AWAY!

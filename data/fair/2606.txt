We stayed at the Dallas Sheraton for the National High School Debate tournament. Our reservations were made months prior to our arrival, and we clearly indicated that we were traveling with minors - just like everyone else who was coming for this event, but when we tried to check in at 2pm they had our high school students in a separate tower than the chaperons. I had to stand at the registration desk for over an hour to get that changed, but the rooms weren't ready until 6pm. Their excuse was that they had checked out 2,000 guests the day before. As a convention center, they should be checking in and out large groups on a regular basis. It wasn't like we showed up unannounced; this event had been planned for over a year. They should have enough housekeeping staff on hand to turn over all of those rooms in 24 hours. One of the people traveling with us was a "Star rewards member" and she didn't get into her room until 7pm! It was so poorly handled. When I checked out they tried to get me to sign up for their rewards program and I said I would never stay in another Sheraton as long as I live if I could help it. The beds were cheap, thin mattresses. There was a lot of garbage in the hallways that sat there for days before it was picked up.

I checked in late in the evening, but it is off season so there are many rooms empty in Seattle right now. The woman at the desk asked if I had a preference--which tower--i indicated i did not but i was eager for a room with a lot of light (after all it is Seattle). She said there was a nice North-West facing room, which seemed to meet my needs. The room actually faces west--but it is a solid wall. It was a funny shape--so the only windows were on the north wall--and there were fewer windows than most rooms. In fact, per the location map it was the smallest room on the floor, and with few windows, all of which faced north, unlikely to meet my only request. My rate was not the cheapest rate available, I am a Platinum status (VERY frequent Starwood guest), and there were many open rooms. It made no sense to put me in that room which would have definitely not been light. I called and requested a different room (I cannot recall the last time i did so). They were literally flummoxed. The next room was acceptable, but very ordinary, and by that time i was thinking a nicer experience would be nice. When i call to see if there was an early departure fee they did not even inquire as to why i would leave early. And when i checked out, they did not say anything. Very impersonal and disinterested service. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom grout not clean, and overall fairly dismal room. Two stars for the comfortable bed. Given the time of year, i checked around, and there are some lovely properties for less money than i was paying at the Sheraton. Now ensconced in one such property--and so happy i changed hotels. Not happy to pay the early departure fee but that is the last money that property will see of mine.

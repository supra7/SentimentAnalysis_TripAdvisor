I'm from montreal and we have a really nice and stylish W here in one of the trendiest districts in quebec, Canada. I expected the same from the W new york.....what a rude awakening it was when we got there.....The lobby is really modern and very happening in the evenings but the rooms are a disaster. They are old, decreped, small and dingy, not to mention also very dirty. I slept with my clothes on and felt dirty just washing my face in the sink. We booked a four night stay and ended up canceling the rest of the reservation after the 1st night and booked rooms at the st-regis across the street. One extreme to another hehe

I booked a night at the Cow Hollow Motor Inn based on a friend's recommendation. The hotel appeared clean and a great value for the price. Unfortunately, I woke up the next morning with bites on my arms, face, and legs. There are few mosquitos in San Francisco at this time of the year and the bites were not like any bug or spider bite I had ever had before. Everyone I showed the bites to agreed that they were definitely bed bugs bites! If not for the bugs I would have given the hotel a much higher rating!

We spent a good chunk of our trip to Maui at the Maui Coast Hotel. I was expecting a lavish, pampered experience for the price we paid a night ($230/night for just a standard room!). It was nothing more then a Holiday Inn or any other plain, run-of-the-mill hotel. Everything was just "ok". It is NOT worth the amount of money they charge! If you are looking for a really nice place to stay in Maui for a good price check out the Maui Guest House in Lahaina. They offered plasma tv's and hot tubs in every room, laundry services, internet, and free long distance calling. And they only charged $130. The Maui Coast was a dismall disappointment!

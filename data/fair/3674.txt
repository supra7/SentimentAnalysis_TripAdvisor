We stayed at the W for a three day weekend and booked the trip through quikbook. The elevator regardless of time of day plays annoying club music which you don't need at 8 in the morning. The room was small but nice. When we checked out the hotel attempted to charge us $700.00 more than the price we were originally quoted. When we caught the error it was fixed but there was not an even an apology for the error despite having to spend more than 20 minutes with the staff to correct the problem. The bell staff was also rude on occassion. Conceriege was great.

We also chose to stay at the Fitzpatrick Chicago Hotel because of good reviews on tripadvisor.com. At such an expensive rate, we really expected a top-notch hotel. I booked the room directly through the Fitzpatrick and specifically requested an early check-in at 1pm. We arrived at 11am and were told there wouldn't be a room available until 3pm. Suggestion: don't offer early check-in if you can't supply it. They allow Brittish Airways Crews rooms before paying customers. Our room wasn't dirty, as some other reviews have stated. The bed appeared nice until we tried to sleep that night. In a 4 1/2 star hotel, you expect fitted sheets on the mattress - no such luck at the Fitzpatrick. For sleeping, you have a sheet and a flimsy blanket. If you want a quiet room, don't stay here. We heard doors slamming through all hours of the night, along with sirens from the street 27 floors below us. The pool was cold and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in 5 years. We returned to our room the second day after housekeeping had been there to find our remote control was gone, as was our Robe. The robe is provided for your stay, however, if you take it, they charge you $75! I mentioned it when we checked out, and was told that we wouldn't be charged for it, but I won't be surprised if we are. Overall: it was too expensive. We probably could have had a more enjoyable stay at a Motel 6.

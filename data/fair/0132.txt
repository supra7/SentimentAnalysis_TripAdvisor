Since I arrived at the Moore at 2 am I didn't expect a great welcome but the front desk person was expecting me and even warned about the street noise in the morning ( which was nothing much if you live in a city). My room was huge, extremely clean with an enormous closet. The bathroom is very old ( i would say 60 years)...but the shower fixture is new...unfortunately made a very large crack in the tiles and left 2 cemented holes where the taps were. But the location..awesome..I could see the water from my room and it was an easy walk to pike market and to macy's to get the free buses around downtown...and to the airport (not free). Many places to eat and drink around...and Nordstoms Outlet store just 1 block down 2nd. The daytime front desk staff is not particularly friendly but they are knowledgeable

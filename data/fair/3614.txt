My best friend and I stayed here on a girls weekend. The lobby is totally W style so I was excited. I've stayed at the W in Dallas which was a completely different experience (in a good way). We get off on our floor and cant find our room bc there are no room directions on the wall. I've never heard of a hotel that doesnt have room directions on the wall. Anyway, we walk into the room and laugh. It was so small. I understand we were in Manhattan, but come on. My friend and I were bumping into each other the entire time we were there. There wasnt enough room to move around each other. It was that small. But OK whatever we're here to see the city not sit in our room. We had to call two of the three nights for housekeeping. They didnt replenish the water or toilet paper the first night. Second night it was six oclock and our room still hadnt been serviced. The floors were noticably filthy and the wall paper in the bathroom was peeling. The air conditioner unit was a joke. It was old, loud and sounded like it was dripping. THe spa experience wasnt much better. I schedule a mani/pedi and they tell me that I will be with two different ladies and since they have a 24 hour cancellation policy I can not cancel or i will be charged. I go get my pedi first, which wasnt the hour it said or anything special. Then I have to leave the spa and go to the gift shop to get my mani. I sat down there for 45 minutes before I was seen. All they were willing to do was give me some product. Seriously at this point I was no longer interested in my manicure, but again whatever. I was very disappointed in the W new york. I would not stay there again or recommend it to anyone for any reason. The bar was lame too.

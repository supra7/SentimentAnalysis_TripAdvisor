The staff was very pleasent. The problem was the room. It was small, not designed well and noisy. The room was on the 9th floor and we heard and felt like street level. Every traffic sound was as if we were on the street. The lobby was sound proofbut not the room. We also had an issue with the small flat screen in our room that was never fixed even after we reported it before going to the theater. Bathroom was very small with the only full size mirror on the inside of the door. You had to sit on the sink to view the full size mirror. Very dissappointed!

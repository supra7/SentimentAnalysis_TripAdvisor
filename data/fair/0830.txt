I'll start with the positive sides of this hotel : - The location of the hotel is good, it's near a trainstation and a metrostation (if you come from the Leonardo DaVinci airport, don't take the expensive Leonardo-express, but take the other train and get of at Tuscolana. Much faster and cheaper, the hotel is a 5min walk away) - The staff is friendly and helpfull. And I mean everyone on the staff: front dest, maids, breakfastpeople, ... But there are more negative sides : - The rooms are tiny and really dirty. The was blood on the curtains, the matrass (you could even see these stains through the sheets!) , the wall behind the bed. Stains practically everywhere.. (Not just in one room, we swiched rooms after the first night and they were both dirty) - The beds are not comfy at all. - The windows were very dirty. - The breakfast was acceptable, but not for a 4-star hotel. - The internet only worked half of the time. - We stayed for five nights (one night in one room and four in an other) and we didn't once get fresh sheets. - When you open the windows (and we had too, because the airco didn't work so it was hot in the room) there is a lot of noise. I also selected this hotel based on reviews, but I can't see why people were so positive about this hotel.

My family and I stayed at Penn Tower Hotel for two weeks when my Dad was admitted to the Univ. of Penn Hospital. The price is high for what the hotel offers, but the convienience of the hotel to the hospital was worth the price to have my Mom close. The room was decent. The bathroom was dirty, the sink was cracked & filthy. The towels didn't always have a fresh smell. The bedsheet was torn and there was no fitted sheet on the beds...just flat sheets. The fire alarm went off at 1am. My family along w/about 8 other people ran down 18 flights of stairs. Once outside we were told it was a false alarm. No one checked the floors...they just knew someone accidently pulled the alarm. My Grandmother had to sit before taking the elevator back up to the room because she was tired. One of the security guards said 'why did they even leave their room - no one told them to do that. The alarm says to wait in the stairwell for directions.' Yes, that's what Im going to do...Im going to put my trust in these people - right. The cleaning ladies were very nice. The staff at the desk were not always the most pleasant. I was under the impression that we would receive an extended stay discount..meaning after we stayed 5 consecutive days we would receive a lower rate. When I checked out I was told that they no longer offer that perk. I left two messages for the manager to call me with no returned call. I finally called again and was able to talk to her. She said they haven't offered that for a year now. We paid $165.00 (includes tax) for 10 days....thats a pretty hefty bill for a family who has a father in the hospital and will now have lots of medical bills. Like I said, the only good thing about this hotel is the convienience of being close to your loved one who is staying in the hospital.

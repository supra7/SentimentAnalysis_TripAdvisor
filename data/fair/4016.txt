Most Expensive Phone Calls The room was cute, loved Asia de Cuba but the service was terrible. They were rude and short to the customers, and I wasn't the only person saying so. And, I came here for a meeting, made a couple of phone calls within California, it ended up costing me about $12 every 3 minutes. I made 6 quick phone calls and it costed me $180! I was so appalled, I'm not even sure the company will pay for such a silly expense. This place is definitely not business-friendly.

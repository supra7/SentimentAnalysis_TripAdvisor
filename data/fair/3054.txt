My husband and I visited the Westin last week. We had a wonderful time in Maui despite our disappointing stay at the Westin. The pool area was over crowded: all the chaises are lined up elbow to elbow, and one day we couldn't even find two seats anywhere. If you're a couple without kids looking for a quite romantic hotel, this is not the place for you (or us!) All the elegance of the "Westin" brand was lost here. Meanwhile, the service was shoddy: from the front desk to the waiters. We had one very helpful conceirge who went above and beyond for us, but of the 5 different concierge desks, we could never figure out where to find someone when we needed help. Meanwhile, it wasnt until Day 3 of our visit that we learned the hotel offered an entire "Activities Calendar" for yoga, spinning, etc. I guess the person who checked us in decided that we didn't need to know about those activities? The gym was lacking in enough equipment even for me, and the stationary bicycle shook like it was about to fall apart. I often stay at a Westin in Cincinnati for work, and i was disappointed to find our room here was no nicer than that one (at $80/night!). We reserved the "Ocean Tower" at the recommendation of a friend who said its the newer building. I cant imagine what the older building looks like because we were not impressed with the room. The view from our balcony was fabulous, and probably the best part of our visit!

I booked a room in the Swissotel for my boyfriend's birthday, requesting a lakeview room and expecting to stay in a nice room with an impressive view. You would think that when booking a room in a prestigious hotel such as the Swissotel, you'd get your money's worth. This is not so. I've stayed in cheap motels with better-looking decor than in this VERY PLAIN, VERY UNAPPEALING room. I am the kind who pays extra for that touch of stylish ambience, and I got none of that here. While I admit that the beds were very comfortable, the room was spacious, and the bathroom the biggest I've seen so far in my hotel-going experience; I was amazed at how utterly commonplace and practically ugly the furniture, carpeting, and wallpaper was. The lobby is particularly unimpressive too - especially the hideously outdated carpet. The other thing - the purportedly fantastic view is not that great. There was construction going on outside of the hotel while we stayed, so that was not a particularly enthralling sight - but even we weren't in the midst of construction, I don't think the view would be anything spectacular. Also, the toilet barely worked. It got rather disgusting, as we had problems flushing. I was expecting a wonderful stay at a great hotel, and what I got was an AVERAGE room in a clearly OVERPRICED hotel.

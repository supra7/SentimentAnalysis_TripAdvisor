We are staying at the hotel now. Checked in at 10 PM and had repairs done till 11:30! Toilet kept flushing, sink leaked and bathroom floor flooded. Fixed it and this morning the sink leaks again. Have asked to move but have NEVER HEARD from a manager. NEVER been offered any complimentary anything. On a positive note, the staff is amazing but avoid this place until it gets a makeover.

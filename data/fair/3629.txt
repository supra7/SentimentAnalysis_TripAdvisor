This is the feedback I sent to the W New York hotel Manager. ============================================== Hello. I stayed at your W New York over the Labor Day weekend and I wanted to provide some feedback. The location and lobby are very nice, and the services of the WW concierge outstanding. My main issues are really with the room I was assigned: 1211. I am used to the small NY hotel rooms, but not to unkempt and worn out rooms, especially at a W hotel. This is a $300 plus room and not worthy of the many hard-earned points I redeemed for this 2 nights in this room. Here are some of the issues you should please try to fix for future guests: Torn furniture Chipped/paint worn cabinets/fridge case Loose wall paper Discolored/Worn out carpet Chipped and worn out doors I am attaching pictures of my assigned room.. and I have to say these conditions are truly discouraging and not up to my expectations of a W Hotel or any worthy hotel for that matter. We also had to ask that out shower curtain be changed 3 times upon arrival as each one had a very humid/moldy smell and it just made the bathroom smell horribly. In addition the safe in the room was locked and security could not get it open, but advised me I could use one of the downstairs safes and to ask at the Front Desk. When I went to the Front desk I was told by the same security person that he had just checked and there were no safes available. My friend and I had to carry our personal papers, credit cards and money with us throughout our sightseeing trip in NY.. not a comfortable sensation. I stayed at the W Mexico City for 10 months and had an outstanding experience there. Currently I am determined not to go back to the W New York again. What's going on at the W New York? Should I assume that W Mexico City is the exception or W New York the exception? I am skeptical to book at a W Hotel again. I hope you can fix some of these things for future guests. After my experience I read the W New York reviews in TripAdvisor, something I neglected to do prior to my trip because of the blind trust I had in the quality of the W Hotels. I suggest you take a look at these reviews. One would get the impression that guests were talking about a roach hotel. Needless to say I will be adding my experience there too. Regards.

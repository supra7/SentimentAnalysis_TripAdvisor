Good Value, Low Class The suites have small kitchens, a sitting area and a bar area to eat. The cable TV was very limited, the internet was not working (one reason we stayed was to have internet access to job hunt), our key cards had to be rescanned nearly every day, the light bulbs in two lamps were blown, and the shower did not work properly. According to the front desk staff, they had a shortage on wash clothes, we purchased 12 of our own and they were taken by the maid (same color but different style than the ones that belonged to hotel). When we called the front desk, they asked if we wanted to stop by and pick up one. When asked about ours that were accidently taken, the clerk replied that they did not know what to tell us. Occassionally all outdoor lights were off and when we had to leave before daylight, it was unsafe to go down the stairs. We would not stay again.

I recently stayed at the Hilton over the weekend of July15/16. The check in process was very unprofessional, and the front desk agent was rude. The food and beverage outlets were over-priced, and lacking ambiance. Our guest room was average and the view looked at a banana freighter. Most of the staff was not friendly and seamed that they did not care about their jobs. I was looking forward to my stay but was quite disappointed. I would NOT recommend this Hotel to anyone.

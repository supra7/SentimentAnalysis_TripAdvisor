Been coming to the KBH since 1978 off and on. This is the eighth time in six years and something has happened. Not sure if it is a labor management issue or what. No one smiles, no one says Aloha, pay for valet parking no one helps you when you return with your car. Upon our arrival no one was there to help with our luggage even though three employees were standing at the bell desk. If you were coming for the Hula Show with Rudy Aquino, he is gone and so is the great hula show. More than likely we will not stay here again and will be looking elsewhere to stay.

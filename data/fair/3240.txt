This hotel despite its grande name, is really just a dressed up Holiday Inn. Pretty much everything about it is sub-par. I spent 6 nights at this hotel (only due to conference going on) and will never go back. Here are some of my notes: ELEVATORS: hotel gone thru renovation, but they didn't update their elevators, as result guests end up with old, squeaky, circa 1950's elevators that choose which floor to go rather than follow guests' direction. ROOMS: I must admit that rooms are overall nicely renovated. The 42' plasma TV and HD television is the most attractive touch, but the rooms (for a 5 star hotel) have the following drawbacks: - Lack of tea/coffee pot with complimentary tea/coffee bags. - Lack of complimentary bottled water in room - Mattress sucks  too soft and saggy. My back started hurting after sleeping on this mattress. I prefer the harder ones offered by Shangri La (made by Simmons) SERVICE: Major improvement is needed here. Staff looks like theyve got other things to do rather than service guests. When we arrived, we had to unload our suitcases and take them inside ourselves, while the bellman was chatting up with a buddy of his 10 feet away. Front desk staff needs training on how to speak politely with customers. OTHER: This hotel charges $10 of handling fee for any packages that get delivered to your name. Ive been traveling around the world and staying at 5 star hotels and this is the fisrt time I encountered such thing as $10 handling fee. Same thing goes if you want to order a cup of tea or coffee  it will come with additional $10 handling fee. Not sure why they are doing it, but this is a major, major drawback for a 5 star hotel. In other words, I wasnt too impressive by the hotel and my experience. I would recommend thinking twice before committing to stay at this hotel.

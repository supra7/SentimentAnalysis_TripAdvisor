This is a very hip hotel, if you'll be out and about on Saturday until 2am this will be fine. The thumping kept us up all night after a flight in from SF. I paid $180 + taxes on Priceline and had this feeling I was going to end up here:( I did get a mini bar charge that I found later, but it's being cancelled now. Oops? The building is new, the rooms very modern, the bathroom spacious, the neighborhood OK. A wonderful bell hop. I can't believe that families stayed here.

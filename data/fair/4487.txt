If you are looking for spacious rooms and top-notch customer service, I'm sure there are plenty of places to stay in San Francisco. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. On the good side - the location is excellent - with TONS of things within walking distance. The bellmen were very helpful and always willing to answer questions. Unfortunately, the front desk is a mess. Customer service is not the priority at Hotel Griffon. Late checkins seemed to be quite common there, so don't expect to check in at 3:00, as advertised. Also, when they fill up they will change the room rate. Although we had reservations at $200/night, they charged us $270 for one of the nights because they filled up. It took several minutes of arguing with the manager to get this reversed. If you are a light sleeper, this is not the place for you either. You will hear every single thing going on in the hall and every door slam. The view from our window was terrible (I posted a picture). Its really a shame, because this could be a great place to stay. I wish I had read more reviews before we booked there.

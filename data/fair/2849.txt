I'll start by saying that my kids loved the water slides (ages 5 and 7). However even my seven year old daughter mentioned how bad the service was. There was a long wait for everything from concierge, waitress, room service, towels, housekeeping and front desk. Everything was so over crowded. It was like a sea of people who all needed something and was competing just to get some service or a lounge chair. There was definitely not enough lounge chairs and an even bigger lack of shade. We had our travel agent request a cabana ($225) 2 weeks before we arrived and we still didn't get one. I suggest bringing your own umbrella or buying one at the shops at wailea for $17 unless you book a cabana 6 months ahead of time. The pool deck was so dirty that you could not even walk on it with out shoes. The food at the Grand Wailea was very disappinting as well, I ordered fish from room service and it smelled so rotten, I could not even take a bite. I highly recommend eating at Tommy Bahamas, we liked it so much that we ate there twice. We are used to staying at nice resorts but this place overcharged for EVERYTHING!!! We were constantly nickeled and dimed for resort fees, valet charges, etc...And to top it off they don't even give a piece of chocolate at turn down service. Those are little details that even my kids expect!!! I will never stay here again!

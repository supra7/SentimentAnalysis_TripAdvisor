I stayed in February for the Cristo exhibition in Central Park. I got the deal from Starwood's website - 189 and as such, was not expecting the most elegant room in the place. However, having stayed at Ws in other cities - including two others in NYC, I was expecting at least the minimum W experience - small, but clean room, big comfy bed, premium bathroom supplies, etc. The W New York is a good -but not great hotel. It's dated as a W, and the room seemed unfinished and less than the level I would have expected - noisy AC unit, spots on the carpet, etc. The bed was old (banana shaped) and the sheets were not the ones used in Westin's Heavenly bed. All in all - not bad, but not great. Try staying up the road at the W Times Square - even with the deficiencies, the "show" you get from the that hotel in terms of decoration and the clientele makes it worth it.

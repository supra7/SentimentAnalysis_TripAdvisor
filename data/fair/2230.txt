Stayed here on business for two weeks. The Hotel is located in the Back Bay / South end. Excellent location for shopping, dining, bars. I was generally pleased. However, my room was totally inadequate, the cable TV signal kept fading out. Air Conditioning was awful, bathroom was very small. Plumbing was from the 1920's. Restaurants in the hotel were too expensive. Elevators were slow. Valet parking was too expensive at $36 / day plus tips. Business center was expensive to use - computers are $3 per minute. Fitness equipment is from the 1940's. Local phone calls cost up to $2.00 a minute! Room lighting was poor, carpet was old and dirty. Summary: Hotel is OK for one or two nights, but no longer, especially if you are an average size adult because you will become clausterphobic very quickly. Also, the hotel seems to book conventions as its main source of patrons so there are a ton of rowdy, obnoxious, inconsiderate people who clog the elevators, hallways, and entryways. Room service is also not that great. Alarm clark is iffy at best, so bring your own.

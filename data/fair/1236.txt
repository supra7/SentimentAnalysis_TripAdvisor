"Noise and mayhem in the hotel rooms at all hours." That sums up my experience. I give the facility 4 stars, housekeeping 4 stars, but hotel management 0 stars. I was here for a long weekend. I thought the airport travelers were well-behaved and mostly transparent. Some couples and large families though, staying here to attend functions or protests or youth sports tournaments were like crazy people. I was awakened all three nights of my stay by noise from an adjoining room. The location is a hidden gem if you are comfortable using the train to get to and from the central city inexpensively. I researched this long row of airport hotels ahead of time. Prices are great at all of them, this being one of the lowest. I will stay at a different one next time. The Eastwick station for the SEPTA train (it also services the airport) is a short four-block walk from here. And when it is time to leave, you don't have to worry about bad overnight weather because you are so close to the airport.

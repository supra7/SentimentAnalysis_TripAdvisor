First of all, be prepared to be rudely turned away until about 4PM for check in. Customers were lined up complaining about their rooms not being ready. Finally they gave into my complaints and sent me up to a room that the maid just began to clean. She called the desk and the moved us to another room. Five minutes after we got settled into this room, a family of five was using their key to get into our room. The same room was given to two guests. The floors were so filthy in these condos that we had to wear socks or shoes at all times. At the end of the day the bottom of your socks were completely black. The pool was nice, but not recommended for children under 4. The Floridays resort had a zero entry pool, this one was 3.5 feet and the kids had to all hang around the steps. The price and location was fabulous, and the gave you a free shuttle to Disney, but there were too many negatives to chang my rating. Oh, I don't want to forget the 2AM party on our floor by screaming, drunk teenagers. They were able to rent out rooms for their prom night. We had to call security and almost the cops.

This was our second stay at Ritz Kapalua, we initially stayed in July 2009. After this trip, we will be staying only at the Four Seasons Wailea. I traveled with hubby and my 6 month old. The service was terrible. The front desk manager, Zach something or the other, was not helpful at all. We were given a tiny room with a boring view, mostly of our neighbors. The AC in the room was not functioning properly and there were insects (probably because we were on the bottom floor). I tried contacting Zach stating explicitly that I have a 6 month old that I didnt want bitten by the pests and asking him what we could do to get a more comfortable room, but he did not return our call. Mind you, I was not asking for a comped upgrade, we wanted to pay. This Ritz is not worth it, please stay at the Four Seasons.

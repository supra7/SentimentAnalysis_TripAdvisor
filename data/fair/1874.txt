I guess that I cannot really complain too much because we were upgraded to a suite (special they were running), but a suite at the Holiday Inn would have been better. Valet is $20.00 per day, and there is no getting a hold of them on Sunday. The suite was anything but. Lights were blown out, furnature is not comfortable, and the bathrooms SUCK! It looks like the owners ran out of money and got the cheapest materials possible. The counters were formica (not stone), the tub was fiberglass (very thin), the shower head was barely attached to the spout. When I turned the shower on, the head blew off so that I had to screw it back on. The hot water ended half way though my shower. It looked like when the tile for the shower was being done, it mixed with the sealant for the tub to mix into a perminant gritty blob that looked like mold. The couches were vinyl. The bed was hard and unconfortable. Because were were in a suite, I assumed that the bedroom would be a little smaller, but it was barely large enough to put a full size bed (not queen). If you get a suite, make sure that you bring your own forks, knives, and spoons. They are not provided. There are no ammenities at the hotel. No spa or pool. The wireless internet had NO connection (and I was on the 6th floor).

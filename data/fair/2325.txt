The location was PERFECT. Very close to Boston Commons, where the freedom trail begins, Quincy Market and Aquarium. The elevator thing was NOT a big deal at all. My biggest problem was we checked in at 9:30 at night and our room was NOT ready and they could not give us a time when it would be. They gave us a king room ( for three of us) and we had a very uncomfortable night. They did move us to a room with two doubles in morning. When check in is at 3 your room should be ready by nine. Consierge was EXTREMELY helpful and pleasant.

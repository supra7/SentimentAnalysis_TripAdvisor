Not sure if it is #1 We stayed at the Casablanca for an anniversary long weekend in February. We loved the hotel - had booked through Orbitz, which had said king or queen bed. We were shown our room - very small and a small queen bed. Said no kings were available. No view. The pillows were nice, but the bed was extremely hard - felt like I had been at a slumber party and slept on the floor. You could feel the springs! After the 2nd night, we asked to be released from our reservations because the bed was so bad. Bedspread was stained (ugh) and the tub and sink drained slow (clogged?). They did release us without penalty and were extremely nice. We really liked the wine/cheese reception and the breakfast. The living area was very nice. Loved the location. We were told that because we booked through Orbitz we could not change rooms. This does not seem right - we really wished we could have completed our vacation there. I guess we expected a bit more given the hotel's extremely high ranking on TripAdvisor. We wanted to pass this along. We have stayed at several hotels in NYC and would have liked this one the best if we could have only changed rooms and had more comfortable beds. We might try to stay here again - but will book directly through the hotel as to ensure the larger and hopefully more comfortable bed.

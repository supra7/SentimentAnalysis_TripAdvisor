The rooms are extremely noisy because of the AC. Even with the A/Cturned off you hear a noise during the night that can be really anoying. And it's quite load. Other guests in different rooms and floors had the same issue If you want to sleep well avoid this hotel. Service,cleanness and rest were very good

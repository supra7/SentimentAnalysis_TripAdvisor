The Trump seems like a good idea-- very low rates ($85 gets you a room and an upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite) and the rooms are very nicely put together. The problem is that the upside ends there. The location is not good at all. To get to the strip, you need to either walk through the Fashion Show Mall, or on Fashion Show Blvd., which has no sidewalks because it's a construction site. There isn't nearly enough staff to run the place properly-- nobody to hail you a cab at the curb, nobody to open the doors when you enter, nobody to help you with your bags, and so forth. Any request from room service or housekeeping took more than an hour to fulfill, without fail. Very disappointed. I was definitely left with the impression that I didn't get a deal-- I got what I paid for.

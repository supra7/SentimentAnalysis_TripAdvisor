I was extremely disappointed with this hotel. We have stayed at other InterContinental Hotels around he U.S. and have never had such a bad experience. When arriving at the hotel, the bellman were standing around talking to one another while guests, including my husband and I lugged suitcases from our taxi to the front doors of the hotel. Not once did any one of them ask if we needed assistance. As we entered the hotel, the escalator was "Out of Service." These things happen. However, the check-in desk was upstairs and as we struggled up the steep stairs with our suitcases...no one again from the hotel asked us if we needed help. When checking in, we were told our room had a balcony. When we got to our room, we didn't have a room with a balcony but a room with a view of the parking garage next door. Sunday morning, we were told the restaurant was getting ready for Sunday Brunch, so we had to eat in a banquet room to the side of the front desk. After being seated, it took the wait staff fifteen minutes before coming to ask for our drink order. The room was not crowded at all, so we couldn't understand the wait. When our coffee came, it was cold along with our server's mood. If she was having a bad morning...why should we have to suffer? After dropping off our drinks, we didn't see her again for another ten minutes. If it wasn't for our having to catch a plane, we would have left and gone somewhere else for breakfast. however, we had no choice that morning. Breakfast was awful and it was a terrible way to end our romatic getaway. I will never return to this hotel again. It was a waste of money and was in no way a 4 star hotel.

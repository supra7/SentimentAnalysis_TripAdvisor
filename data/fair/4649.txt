We got a great rate on our ocean front suite (meaning that there was a separate bedroom). While the room was very spacious, and the view was breathtaking, that's where the good part ended. The resort seemed like a ghost town, with no restaurant and no bar, and strange, shack-like, run-down houses situated on the resort property (albeit, behind the main buildings). The door to our room provided us minimal peace of mind as far as security... it looked like someone had taken a crowbar to it at some point. Inside, it was pure 80's decor, which isn't bad except that the furniture and countertops are stained and marred enough for me to think they've been there at least that long. The bathroom was awful. Soap scum on the shower walls, mildew and mold stains, old fixtures (complete with lime encrusted showerhead), a toilet that barely flushed (hold down the button for 30 seconds), and one bar of soap for the sink AND the shower (don't forget to take it into the shower with you!) Find somewhere else in Maui to stay! I did.

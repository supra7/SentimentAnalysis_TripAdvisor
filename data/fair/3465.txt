After looking for a small boutique hotel in Manhattan on line, this seemed to be a good value. Although it wasn't the very least expensive it was relatively inexpensive and had Serafina as the restaurant downstairs. Upon check-in we went to the room to settle in and found that the shades were badly worn and one didn't close all the way. The furniture in this tiny space was chipped and very tired. The shelving in the micro bathroom was falling apart and the shower was a mix of tiles and faux tiles with mold in the corners. The toilet wouldn't stop running without some manual help and later in the stay it overflowed, which didn't seem to surprise the front desk. The king bed was comfortable but the sheets were too small for it, exposing the bed pad at the foot of the bed after 5 minutes of sleep. Restaurant was great,true to Serafina's reputation. Elevators are tiny and used by service staff ALL DAY! always waiting to get to the upper floors was frustrating to say the least. The lounge was fun, friendly staff helped warm up the worn look of the space. With a little paint and attention to detail this hotel might be comfortable but obviously no one is spending any money to keep up with the wear and tear a city hotel takes. Is anyone watching? The staff was courteous and as helpful as they could be. Save yourself some disappointment and aggravation and spend a little more to get a much better experience. I do understand the saying "you get what you pay for" but for 500.00 plus dollars for two nights, I expect something that's not falling apart. If you offer an in room safe, have it in working order, or remove it and save the space in the tiny area they call a room. Needless to say The Time has seen IT'S time. We'll take our money and our chances elsewhere next stay. J from L.I.

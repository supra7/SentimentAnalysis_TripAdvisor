My father and I recently stayed at the Frenchmen Hotel. I was disappointed by how run-down the hotel and by the rudeness of the staff. To be sure, the hotel (and New Orleans on the whole) has the element of being worn but charming. However, there is no excuse for being dismissive of guests -- especially in this economy. Every morning, the cleaning woman forgot something different. One day, it was the floor mat, the next day the hand towels. One day when I asked for cups as there were none, she had the audacitgy as to go into my room and verify that there were no cups in the room. I have no need to lie. There were no cups, period. In addition, my room was never swept or properly cleaned during my 6-day stay. From what I could tell, the only cleaning that was done was making the bed and swapping out the towels. And based on the dirt on the floor and dust every where else, cleaning was rarely done. On another occassion, I complianed to the desk clerk that people were partying in the hot tub at 4 a.m. His response was that I should have called the desk to report it at the time. Okay. But had the clerk been watching the cameras instead of the TV, he would have seen (and heard) the loud partying. Also, it's not the responsibility of the guests to maintain decorum. Finally, while my father was very very clear that he pay for his room with his credit card, they put both rooms on my credit card. This is yet another example of the hotel staff's lack of attention to detail and overall failure to provide a basic level of customer service. I love New Orleans and I know it's a party town. But we weren't staying on Bourbon Street and I have a right to expect a clean room and to not be questioned. There are many, many amazing places to stay in New Orleans, check those out instead of staying at the Frenchmen. I regret not paying more attention to the other negative reviews of this hotel.

1. I booked through Hotwire and I saved $8.27. I do not feel this is exceptable, considering they always make it look like you are going to save about 40%. I talked to a Hotwire customer service representative and he said that technically if I saved $1.00 it was not false advertisement. I disaree!! Do not use Hotwire,you have no guarantee that you will save more than $1.00. 2. I did not feel this hotel compared to any other 4* hotels that I have visited. 3. They advertise a pool. First it is under renovation and second it doesn't look like it will be done for the whole season (summer) according to the sign on the door of the pool. Second, the picture shows a roof top pool, but it looks closed in. This is not the case, it is an outdoor pool. So, even when it is finished, it will be open only in the summer months. Do not count on going to this pool for your children to swim. Pick another hotel!! 4. The rooms were not up to standards of a four star hotel. The sheets were rough to the touch also. There was no fan in the bathroom. Paint chipped, etc. 5. The location makes this hotel somewhat desirable, close to magnificant mile, but across the street from the Hospital. Sirens heard all the time. This would convince me to stay somewhere else. 6. Overall, I do not rate this a four star hotel.

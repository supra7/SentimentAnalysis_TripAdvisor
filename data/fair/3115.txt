Last year we received a coupon to come and enjoy the Westin Maui for a special price of $749.00, so even though I had reservations about coming, due to a prior experience at the same Hotel, we booked our family vacation. We also decided to extend our stay, so we stayed 4 extra days at the Napili Kai, then the 5 nights at the Westin and we stayed an extra night as well. At the Napili Kai, we had a lovely stay, but when walking into the Westin, the atmsophere changed. Our rooms were the size of a crackerjack box, and when the air came on in the room, a chunk of mold came spewing out of the vents! My children rented a movie which cost $15.99 each, and to check their e-mail they were charged $10.41 (4x) to check it 1 time. We decided to go to the pool and on one occassion I was verbally abused by one guest at 6:30 in the morning for removing a pair of shoes from a chair under a cabanna! This same thing happened the first time we stayed at the Westin! So, here I am already planning my vacation for next year, and thinking to myself what I don't want in a vacation when the Westin came to mind.

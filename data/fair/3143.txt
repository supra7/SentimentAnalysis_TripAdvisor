OK in the Oceanfront Rooms There are some very good things about The Marseilles, #1 being its perfect location. But of course, since it's one of the least expensive hotels in South Beach, it's not exactly a high end experience. It is a decent budget option in the right room.The ocean-front corner room was nice, quiet, spacious and a very good value. It seemed recently renovated with an updated decor. The bathroom is tiny and old-fashioned but was fine for us. We stayed in a non-ocean front room the first night and were bothered by the door slamming and loud neighbors, which we could not hear once we moved to the ocean-front room. The first room (3rd floor) also smelled funny, as did the 3rd floor hallway and the lobby. The pool, bar area, hammock grove and beach access were great. It's really good to be able to walk out the back of the hotel and right onto the beach or onto the beachfront walkway for biking or rollerblading, and it's rare in SoBe unless you're paying top dollar.The Marseilles is 2 blocks from Lincoln Road, 1 block from the Delano and 2 hotels down from The Raleigh. The Catalina across the street was a good spot for drinks and for breakfast. There's no scene at The Marseilles at night, but that's OK with so many other options all around.

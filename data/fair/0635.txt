We stayed in this hotel as a family with two kids. The front desk staff is very rude and inexperienced. Half of the service staff do not speak english. The place looks feels like a cheap budget hotel run on a very stringent budget. Even though the hotel's web page indicated that pets were allowed with no mention of cost. The front desk staff automatically charged us an extra $75.00 fee without even asking us, and did not even want to listen to our explanation. I would not stay at this property again or any other Embassy Suites. I learned my lesson

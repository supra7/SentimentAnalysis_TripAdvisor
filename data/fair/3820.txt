Very disappointing for a Ritz-Carlton. It's not a horrible hotel, but for the price, there are many better options. They need to spiff up the place for those who are willing to spend $300/night including parking. Shower in the handicapped room (the only king left when we checked in) was old and broken and caused a large puddle of water to accumulate on the floor. Also, we had to ask three times for shaving cream in the morning, not good since we had to get going for a meeting. The staff was very nice, but we will not stay there again.

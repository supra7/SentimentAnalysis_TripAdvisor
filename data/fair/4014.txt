A hotel that is not worth the money Stayed at the clift for one night as part of my honeymoon trip . The hotels lobby its ok Philip Stark style ....contemporary,modern etc. I stayed in one of their most expensive rooms , a Loft Suite (350 per night plus taxes )and was totally dissapointed by the bathroom facilities. A cheap courtain , a small tube are not worth the money paid. Besides this , the TV in the room is ultrasmall ridiculously small relative to the size of the room. The front desk offered a complimentary bottle of champagne that never arrived (i dont drink alcohol so that was not a problem). Bottom Line : Not worth the money they charge you there are 50 better places to stay in Sfco. (I am writing this comment regreting not having considered the negative comments i read on Trip advisor about this hotel when i made the reservation ...all were true)

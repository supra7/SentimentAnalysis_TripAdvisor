We knew the hotel is old but had no other choice during those two days. We paid $175/night for a room with "original" carpet and bathroom fixtures (old and stale). The clerk who checked us in was friendly; the rest of the staff were disinterested for the length of stay, including the manager. I guessed they thought they did us a favor for being there. Needless to say, never stay there again. Peter. Ps. The pictures in the website are really nice, not in reality.

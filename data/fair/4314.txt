This is a two star hotel not a four star! Wery old and sad rooms. We changed room during our stay but they was al the same. Hotel decides what temperature its in your room and they like it warm...Ok, its cheap and our one bed room suite was very big. Location is a litle bit off. We moved to Crowne Plaza at the U.N. after four nights. Smal rooms but up to date. Clean. Effective air-condition.

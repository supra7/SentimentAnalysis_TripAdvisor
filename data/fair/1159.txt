Clean large rooms. Only a few have view of water. Lots of highway noise. This hotel is not near the main attractions.. You must drive everywhere. They do not have shuttle. Expect little service. They might know where the cart is so YOU can take your bags to the room. It is an Eco friendless place... Translated that means virtually no daily service and no clean towels. I traveled with two teenagers but was only given two bath towels. When i asked for clean towels the hotel employee brought two i asked for third and was met with resistant. Staff is okay but not particularly helpful. There is no one at the front desk after 11pm the evenings so you are on your own if you need something. we had to leave early due to a family illness and the staff would not consider any refund though they were busy and could clearly could re-rent the room. At this hotel you do not feel like you are in Key West. It is literally next to the Home Depot. The strip mall across the road is convenient for groceries, the CVS and Dominoes Pizza. Not exactly the conch republic. This place is pricey for little service and bad location. If you have a large party, this will work well. Bring your own towels if you expect to have dry one.

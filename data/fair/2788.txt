I was privileged to attend an elite company trip last week at this coveted 5-star hotel and was both shocked and insulted by the poor customer service by both the wait staff at the restaurants and room service as well as the poor people skills of all those working the resort. Specifically, not only was the room service repeatedly untimely (over 1 hour) and the orders were not correct (but too late, by that time, just glad to have some food!), one of the room service guys didn't even knock, but just came ahead into the room unannounce claiming they were very busy, so he just thought he'd drop off quickly...?? Also, the waitresses around the pool and the pool eateries were minimally congenial at best and service pool side was very slow. Comparitively, I had attended a company meeting in Atlanta just 2 weeks prior at the Omni downtown and I will tell you, EVERY staff member had a smile on their face 100% of the time and always greeted the guests and asked what they could do to assist. Actually, one of the front desk ladies walked down the street 2 blocks after dark to get me allergy medicine and volunteered to do so! I mention this because this is the kind of service you expect from a 5 star - did I mention the Omni was not 5 star? Maybe it should be... In summary, I will continue to patronize those that demonstrate leadership in the industry with kindness, over-delivery of service, and a smile - it's that simple.

Even if we didn't have a terrible experience with the front desk about the inadequacy of our first room, I would have to comment on how the hotel has deteriated since our stay just a year ago. The staff is still extremely cordial (except for our checking in experience), but our room was in terrible shape. The sliding closet doors would absolutely not move. One was open so we had access to the hangers but could not use the safe which was behind the closed part. The magnifying mirror in the bathroom was on a loose bracket and could not be used because it hung so low, not to mention that the light on it did not work. The chair at the desk had upholstery so worn that the stuffing was coming through. It looked like it should be on the sidewalk for garbage pickup. This is very sad because we were looking forward to our return after a wonderful stay last year.

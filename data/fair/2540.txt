For $200 a night we had a tiny room and no hot water when we showered, unless we were content with a dribble, and I mean a tiny dribble. The view was of other rooms and a building. We could have stayed many other places with less "panache" in the meeting rooms and lobby and been more comfortable. I wrote them about the water pressure and they offered a free night stay: only at the Palmer House, only for me! Living in Alaska, I don't go to Chicago that often if again! So, I'll just take Hilton off the list of chains to consider.

My husband and I went here on our honeymoon and were dissapointed! We first went to the Grand Hyatt in Kauai, which was incredible! The customer service, food, and resort were the best we have ever experienced. The Hyatt Regency Maui was pure chaos. When we arrived, there were so many people waiting for their cars at valet and it looked like a madhouse! They were overbooked 15 rooms. There was construction going on in the lobby and all we could see were tarpes, not the lobby ocean view we were promised! Our partial ocean view room was a mountain view and the ocean could only be seen if you completely leaned over the balcony and looked to the right. When we called to tell them that there was a very foul smell coming out of our air conditioning vent and that our water constantly shut off while we were in the shower, they sent someone right up but then said the person that had the key to the closet/office where the airfreshners were for the vent was out until the morning. They tried to change the filter but it did no good. The water problem was never fixed. When I went down to remind them of the water problem and said that I thought it was ridiculous that they could not correct the issue and that we would hope that the service would be better especially snce it was our honeymoon, the manager outrageously and rudely said "everyone is on their honeymoon." I was shocked! Oh! There was about a 20 minute wait to get into the breakfast buffet every morning. This hotel could be better if they expanded to accomodate for all the people they have! They should focus more on quality rather than their clear focus on quantity to make more money.

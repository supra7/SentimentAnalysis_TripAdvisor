Wow, I just read a couple of review from folks who stayed at the Time around the same time I did and our experiences were pretty different. I was awakened one night at midnight by water cascading from the vent in the ceiling of my bathroom. Maintenance took 15 min. to get to the room for clean-up. It happened again the next morning. Each time, I was given a different explanation for the problem. I had to ask to be moved to a different room and it took the front desk all day to make one available for me. A promised call to my cell phone to tell me when I could move my things never materialized. The most frustrating part of the situation was that NO ONE apologized for the problem or the inconvenience. Overall, I found the staff unfriendly and indifferent to the guests. The common areas of the hotel are a little scuffed up and just this side of shabby. The room was nicely laid out, not too small for Manhattan, but again, the furnishings could have used some buffing and refreshing. The location is great if you want to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Times Square; otherwise, you're better off choosing a location a few blocks north, south, east or west. It was too crowded an area for me. I won't stay at the Time again.

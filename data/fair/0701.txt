Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights for an event and I was less than impressed to say the least. The hotel is located by the airport and with little things to do near by with the exception of a few fast food places. The hotel staff are not very acccomidating. I had booked my room 2 months in advance and had requested a fridge but was declined one at check in. There were no working ice machines anywhere on the 2nd floor and due to the strange shape of this hotel it would take 10 minutes just to get sw ice. Internet will cost you $15/day and I find this unacceptable in 2011. When you're paying $120+ nigt the Internet should be free. There was no WiFi in the conference area either:( The hotel restaurant is overpriced and the food is just ok. I'd eat elsewhere. If you need assistance the front desk staff lack any type of hospitality skills. I asked on arrival and my day of departure for a late check out (1.5 hours). I was given an extra 15 minutes or "additional chargers would take place". In conclusion, I would rate this hotel at a 3 star at the best and give it a 2/10 for value. Will not say here again.

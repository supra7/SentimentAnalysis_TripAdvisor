Stayed on the Intercontinental over MLK weekend. First the bad: We had a laptop computer stolen from our car while it was with the hotel valet. We, of course, realize that it was a mistake to leave it in there, and this may well have happened anywhere, but I thought I should mention it. We do not know that it was the valet who took it, but it seems pretty likely. We paid $69 for the hotel. It was fine for this price, but I would have been horrified if we were charged their normal rates ($300 for that?!?). It was an average room...no real ammenities to speak of. The furniture was quite worn, but I have no real complaints about the room itself. I never actually saw hotel bar/restaurant (Pete's) open our entire stay--including Saturday night. The concierge also keeps strange hours as he was gone by 7pm on Saturday. The front desk was a poor substitute for the missing concierge--remarkably unhelpful with directions or recommendations. The good: A fine location close to French Quarter and street cars. We got a very good deal. And, when we did report our stolen computer, the valet manager was very helpful with both us and the police, and seemed genuinely concerned (seemed like maybe we weren't the first.) So...stay here if it is really cheap, but for pete's sake, make sure you take all your valuables out of the car.

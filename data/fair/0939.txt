We arrived at the Hotel Aug 25, 2005, our first time to Hawaii and after reading many reviews I expected to be awe struck, I was not. Indeed the lobby is initally grand with the outdoor/indoor effect with the tropical plants and animals, but upon closer inspection it looks like it has not been updated since the 1980's; uncared for wood trim and fading mirrors. I expected the high prices but not the unhelpful disposition of some of the staff, my family and I booked with a package deal and they treated us like free loaders, I assume because our package included such things as breakfast, room upgrade and rental car, maybe if we were paying alacart they would have been more gracious, but in my opinion they need extra training in hospitality. I have been to plenty of hotels in the Carribean and feel the staffs to be far more courteous and friendly and the hotels to be more modern and updated. I was highly disappointed in the Hyatt. I have to say the few reviews I read before my trip that gave poor reviews about the Hyatt were quite accurate.

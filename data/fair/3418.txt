Family of 3 from Staffordshire England. We have just come back from New York for new year the hotel was pretty average the rooms quite large and clean the bathroom clean the air con didnt really work too well and was noisy, in our party of three there was only 2 double size beds so one of my sons had to sleep on the floor but not too much of a problem for the price of the holiday we would stay there again the staff were helpful and very pleasant. A tip though dont go to raffles next door for breakfast it was very nice but every item is individually priced but not very clear so breakfast cost us 79 dollars for the 3 of us which we thought rather expensive ie 7 dollars for a glass of orange juice. overall a very enjoyable time was had by all

Stay Away! My husband and I booked our stay through Expedia - I guess the Clift keeps its real rooms for guests paying full price. We could hear EVERYTHING from the next room (snoring, T.V., phone conversations, etc...). Not at all impressed. We've stayed at some pretty high-end, 5-star hotels and the Clift definitely wasn't one of them. We were not impressed with the hotel staff - I guess they're underpaid.Stay away.

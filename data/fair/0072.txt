My husband, daughter and some friends stayed at the Crowne Plaza in downtown Seattle for four days and three nights in August. We booked two rooms. The stay was great. We were in Seattle for PAX. While at the convention, we made numerous purchases. We had planned for this, and had set aside more than enough money for the trip. But when we checked out, the hotel charged our card, but did not release the hold they had put on the funds for the entire stay. Both rooms. This hold remained in place for THREE FULL DAYS after we had paid our bill. Because of this, we incurred 13 overdraft charges from our bank for insufficient funds! The funds were there, just held hostage by Crowne Plaza. My husband called the hotel to inform them of their mistake, and ask that our overdraft fees ($35 each!) be covered by them for not releasing the hold when we paid our bill (this is standard procedure). But he was told that this is THEIR standard procedure. REALLY?! Then why don't they inform their customers of this when they book the hotel so they can plan on having an extra couple of thousand dollars in their accounts if they are going to stay here. Is it because they know that the customers would choose to stay somewhere else?

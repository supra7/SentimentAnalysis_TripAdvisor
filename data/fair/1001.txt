We just returned from Maui where we spent the first 6 nights at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. My husband made all of the arrangements for this vacation and for his sake I tried to stay optomistic and positive. This hotel is dark, dated, and depressing. The room felt dirty (especially the carpet) and there were other issues such as the airconditioning not being up to par, the tub not draining after a shower etc.. I tried to adopt the attitude of this just being "a place to sleep" but the reality was that our children prefered to spend a lot of time at the hotel pool as opposed to the beach (which is spectacular). The pool and surrounding area is something you might expect to find on the roof top at a "Holiday Inn" in Hershey Park, PA. Outdated, dirty and uninteresting. We received vouchers for free breakfast buffet at the hotel's Mixed Plate restaurant. Another reviewer compared this place to "a college dining hall" and I have to agree, his assessment is right on the money! It was grimy and the booths were downright dirty. We switched to the Hyatt and that was a very different experience. The Hyatt is really a "resort hotel" and can't even be compared to what Kaanapali Beach Hotel has to offer. I would say that the Kaanapali Beach hotel is ripe for a takeover/buy out as it sits on the most premiere spot on Kaanapali Beach which is unarguably the best beach on Maui.

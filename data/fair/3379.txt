This hotel was absolutely awful. First, let me just say that I booked it thinking it was a budget hotel - based on many excellent reviews - so I didn't have particularly high expectations staring out. However, the price they had initially quoted me over the phone was much lower than what we ended up paying. The hotel staff was incredibly rude when we asked for an itemized statement upon checking in. I then asked about good places to eat, and they couldn't come up with any! I mean, really? It's NYC, and the hotel is located in such a fun, hip neighborhood - there were at least 20 places within reasonable walking distance that they could have recommended. The bed was the hardest I've slept on - a wooden plank would have been more comfortable. And to top it off, the street noise was almost unbearable in our room. I have stayed in hostels better than this hotel and I most definitely won't be a repeat customer. For the price we ended up paying, we probably could have found a much better quality hotel. The only perk is that it was bedbug-free...

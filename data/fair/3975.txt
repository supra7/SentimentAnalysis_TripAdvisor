Noisy, average hotel I thought I did my homework in planning our SF 4 night stay, but I chose the wrong hotel in the wrong area.Of course, it isn't the hotel's fault that I hadn't expected the area to be so noisy/touristy, but it had only single-paned windows!When checking in, I politely requested a quiet room. We were given a room at the far end of a hallway, usually a good choice, except this one (706), had a direct view of the cable car tracks on Powell. Our first night was so sleepless from the general street noise/sirens and the cable cars, I was ready to change hotels! Instead, we asked to be moved to a quieter room on the opposite side of the hotel, which did help. But I found the noise level from the street and the hallways/other rooms to be too much, even for an older property.Both rooms were quaint, older hotel style, the size we expected and nicely decorated. The bathrooms were very clean. The shower did seem to come and go, but that's to be expected from an older property.There are many good restaurants within walking distance.We found the beds quite comfortable. We also liked that the blanket was enfolded with a second sheet, so you never touched it and got that nasty, other-people-have-slept-here-and-touched-this feel.The staff was not exceptionally friendly, but courteous. They did pour the wine freely and friendly at the nightly reception!The breakfast was as expected---ordinary continental fare with bagels, fruit, and yogurt. Oh, and make-it-yourself waffles.All in all, if I stayed again in the Union Square area, I would choose a chain hotel which had good soundproofing.

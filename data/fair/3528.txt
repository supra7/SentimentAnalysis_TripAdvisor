We were disappointed with our stay. I don't expect special service but when you advertise perks for your SPG preferred guests, it should be followed up on. Even though we were are platinum elite on starwoods we were given the smallest room I think they have on the fifth floor with a view of pipes and a roof, outside our window were a bunch of cigarette buds. No SPG line on entrance waited 20 minutes to check in, no breakfast etc. There was only enough room to walk around the king bed, I hit my leg on the bed getting up and then almost walked into the wall. The worst was the bathroom. Despite living in NYC for years in the past and knowing everything in NY is small, one can't sit on the toilet without lifting up an arm because the sink protrudes onto the toilet. (Body size doesn't matter only a child would be able to be comfortable using the facilities) We booked with miles. I'm so glad I didn't pay for this room. After being given that room, standing in line, no breakfast etc., they did give a vouchers for drinks in the Whiskey Bar. SO that was appreciated. Hotel was clean and great location. That lounge has always been fun, I'd say just visit the lounge just find somewhere else to sleep.

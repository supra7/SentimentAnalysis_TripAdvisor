If you have young children I would not recommend this hotel. First, you should ask if a crib will fit in your room since not every room can accomodate one. Second, ask if your room is near construction. I tried putting my baby down for a nap and there was drilling and banging going on all afternoon. It took a full hour and three calls before anyone got back to me regarding this issue. Third, I called the concierge about children friendly activities. They were so busy that I left a message. Needless to say, no on returned my call. This is a swanky hotel for singles and young couples, but not for families w/ young children. I tried to contact the general manager during our stay, but his assistant took 48 hours to get back to me. In the end, they merely gave us a few starwood points as compensation.

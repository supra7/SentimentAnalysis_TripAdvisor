I can understand why people stay at the airport, for convenience, or in the centre to be close to the action, but why would you take the train two stops into the middle of a business estate, with a half hour tram ride to get near anything. Once was interesting, but after that it was a real chore. I was there for a conference. Glad I wasn't paying. The buffet food that was provided was almost inedible. The bar prices reflected the lack of competition. If you want a cheap bed in the sticks then fine, if you want to be near the action, forget it.

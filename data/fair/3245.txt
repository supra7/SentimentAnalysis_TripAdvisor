My previous experiences with InterContinental have been exceptional, which is why my husband and I chose this hotel for our recent trip to New Orleans. However, it did NOT live up to previous expectations. When we arrived, the desk clerk (Alexis, avoid her at all costs) was extraordinarily rude and blamed it on a headache and a convention in town. We were followed to our room by four drunk teenagers at 6 in the evening. I was willing to write that off to being in New Orleans, however, I wasn't willing to write off the large bag of trash sitting on the floor outside my room. A room switch ensued, to a room with no seating except a desk chair. Guest Services initially claimed that none of the rooms had easy chairs or love seats, which was absurd, since you could see the marks on the floor where the chair had rested! A request for the manager earned a different answer...and an easy chair. Two more calls to Guest Services were required to gain access to the mini bar and to request a "Do Not Disturb" sign AND another trip to the front desk to get both keys reset after being assured that this wouldn't be necessary upon check-in. The Assistant Manager finally tried to make it right with a hospitality basket on the second evening, but attention to detail and better customer service in the first place would prevented a majority of the problems.

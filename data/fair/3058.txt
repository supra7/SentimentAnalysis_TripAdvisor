We got married here in September and would have decided on somewhere else had we known we would have been treated so poorly. One would think that the bride and groom would be treated with some decency. We booked 7 nights for ourselves and 30 nights total through our friends and family. We checked in on Monday and saw that our room was sharing 2 walls with 2 elevators. Thinking that we could sleep through it, we didn't bring it to the attention of the front desk to change. Well...we couldn't sleep through it so asked the front desk around noon the following day if we could change rooms. We were told that they were sold out that night so we couldn't change rooms. So, because it never hurts to ask, we asked if an upgrade was available seeing as how we were getting married there in 4 days. The front desk manager said flatly, "No." I asked if it was because they were at capacity or because it was simply out of the question. He replied that it was "simply out of the question" and then informed me that other people actually pay for the rooms. Now we may not have actually paid for the upgraded room, but we DID bring several tens of thousands of dollars to the hotel from the wedding and room blocks. He offered no other options and no apologies. Because they were sold out that night, we stayed in the room by the elevators another night. We found out just recently that one of our wedding guests was given a room near an elevator that same day (a few hours later). THEY were upgraded. The property gets 2 stars just because it's beautiful. We travel to Maui once a year and will not stay here again.

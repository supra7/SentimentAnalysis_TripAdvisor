When travelling we usually stay in one of the Marriott family hotels with good experience. However, we found the experience at Marriott Long Wharf below Marriott standards. At time of booking (early June) it mentioned construction was to be finished by mid May 2011. Big surprise to find out at checking in that construction was far from over. First morning 7:10 AM we woke up at the sound of heavy construction machinery... Unacceptable! We were moved to another section of the hotel which was far less noisy, but ..... why put guests in rooms so close to the construction in the first place when other rooms are available??? Besides the construction sounds, the hotel is built in such a manner that the noise from public area below, lobby and/or events areas cannot be blocked from most rooms. That means when in your room you will certainly hear kids running around and doors being shut(throughout the night!). We were 'forced' to enjoy the music of a wedding taking place in the events area and sounds of breakfast taking place in that same area since the restaurant was temporarily under construction. Finally, service is courteous but certainly not friendly or warm. Rooms are spacious, neat and housekeeping is good. Marriott: Yes! Boston Marriott Longwharf: No!!

hotel rooms were reasonable. Very nice bathrooms with rainshowers. The room was recently painted and the smell was a bit strong. Two important flaws: Paper thin walls - I could literally hear the snoring next door; and hallways were in sad condition. The carpet has seen better days - loose in some spots, multiple paint marks etc.

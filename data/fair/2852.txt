The aloha is gone! What used to be a fabulous resort has turned into an overpriced average experience. The staff was anything but cordial from arrival to check out. We reserved an ocean front room in the Napua Tower. When we checked in, we were told that we had been "upgraded" to a suite. When we arrived at the very roomy suite, we realized that there was no ocean view-- the only view was of the gardens and someone's discarded underwear in the bushes in front of our lanai. Management was unwilling to move us to an ocean front room in this section, but rather downgraded us to a "partial" view- at the same rate- no concessions! The rooms are average in size and decently appointed for a supposed five star resort. The food continues to be severely over priced- hamburgers $14, hot dogs $12, fruity drinks $9... all served with an attitude that is not Hawaiian. Since Hilton's announcement of take over of management, attitudes seem to have slipped to all time lows on the islands. I certainly hope that Hilton can return this once heavenly resort to its once celestial status. Until then the Four Seasons will have my business.

I've stayed there for a week on a business trip two months ago. The lobby is wonderful as well as the location and that's it. The rest is completely overestimated. Most of the staff, with some exceptions, was not friendly and sometimes even rude. The food of the restaurant at the lobby is ok but overpriced. The room is small and old furnished and the TV has very few channels. The bathroom has no tube, was kind of dirty (but no bugs) and it was hard to adjust the temperature of the shower. The location is perfect - very close to the Art Institute and Millenium Park. The hotel offers no Wi-Fi Internet to its guests, not even at the sumptuous lobby (however, the restaurant does, if you buy something and ask kindly enough). I could give three stars to this hotel but as it's expensive and offers at most and average service I'll give it only two.

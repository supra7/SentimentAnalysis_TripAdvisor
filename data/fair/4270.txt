Other options should be considered if staying downtown. Also in a dead part of town for food and theirs was nothing to write about. Stayed twice in past 12 months. Both times found rooms very outdated circa 1970's flashback and plain for the price. $200-280 per night. Going back to LA in a few weeks and looking elsewhere to stay. Also Marriott asking $289 when other 3-4stars are at less than $200. I would never pay $289 for this dump. Nice lobby and it ends there. Each time had to move because of noise, given a room facing highway. First time found out when I couldn't sleep, second immediately asked to be moved and told no other rooms. I would of checked out, but couldn't get another place for around the same price and only had one night left.

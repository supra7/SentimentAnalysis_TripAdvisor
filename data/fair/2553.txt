The Palmer House, though 4 stars in the decor of lobby, deserves 1 star in all other areas. From the moment we made the reservation to the day we checked out, we were reminded (verbally and in writing!) that we were going to receive no special treatment because we booked on Priceline. When we made the reservation, we called the hotel to find out what kind of room we were going to be in and they said, "We can't guarantee you anything [from bed size, to non-smoking/smoking] because you booked on Priceline." When we were 20 minutes away from the hotel, we called ahead to tell them we were coming and they still refused to tell us what kind of room we would be staying in "because you (we) booked on Priceline." The room we did stay in was a TINY room overlooking someone's apartment window with a teeny bathroom with a shower that didn't drain... not the kind of room you'd expect at a 4 star. When our room was neglected for the 2nd time in a row by the housekeeping staff and we requested compensation from the Manager, he said, "I can't give you a refund or credit of any kind because I see in your records that you booked on Priceline." For our entire stay, we felt like we were being penalized for being savvy travelers and for using Priceline. All guests at the hotel (especially one that's a 4 star) should be treated equally, despite how much they paid to stay there. As two people who could afford to pay top dollar to stay at a hotel and who have stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels around the world, we were appalled with the way we were treated at the Palmer House... and Priceline should be, too, since they treat Priceline customers like the scum of the earth. **In addition, the concierge couldn't assist us in booking tickets for a show that, after we walked to the theater ourselves, wasn't even sold out! --Just another example of how unaccommodating the staff was at the Palmer House.

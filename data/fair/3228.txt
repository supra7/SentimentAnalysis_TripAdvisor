My wife and I came to the hotel for my birthday weekend. It's a gorgeous facility. The room was small but very nice. The location is great. However, $50 a night for parking is a little steep, don't you think? Hotels.com told me my reservation included breakfast buffet each day. The desk clerk said it did not. Basically, he hid behind the fact that "we don't control what they say". I forgot my HiltonHonors card and he said too bad again. He couldn't locate me in the system. On Saturday, My wife and I were out from 10AM until 5PM. We entered our room and were shocked to find that the room had not been made up. My wife called the front desk and they blew her off by saying that they were still making up our floor. Then, I called Guest Relations and asked for a manager. Instead of getting a manager, they asked me what was wrong and I told them. He said that I was supposed to call to REQUEST that my room be made up at a CERTAIN time. I couldn't believe that he thought this was normal. I finally waited on a "short hold" for about 10 minutes and then was connected to Adrianne (I'm not sure how to spell her name). She also thought that not making up my room was the norm. I just hung up on her. If this is standard procedure for this "upscale" hotel, then they're in big trouble. Am I wrong to expect to have my room made up sometime before 5PM or not? I don't think I am. I won't stay here again, not only because that type of service stinks, but more importantly because management thinks it's OK. Bad attitude, Roosevelt Hotel!

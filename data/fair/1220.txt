I read all of the reviews before booking this hotel, however it was a cheapest and had a great location and I was really just looking for a place to sleep. The room itself wasn't terrible- clean, bathroom organized a bit oddly but it was functional. However the problem came around midnight when someone started screaming or crying until about 2 am. It was loudest when it started because the window was open (lack of individual room temp. control) but even with the window open the noise still came in.

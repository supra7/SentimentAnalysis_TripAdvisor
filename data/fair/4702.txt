For those who would like to experience Hawaii and not just a row of high rise resorts that could be anywhere- we recommend avoiding the whole Ka'anapali Beach area, which is a strip of high-rise hotels and nothing else. That said, we also did not like the fact that the Sheraton feels huge and very corporate (the rooms gave no real indication we were in Hawaii)--and not suited for anyone with mobility issues (lots of walking and stairs, few elevators). Most of all there was hardly any of that "aloha" feeling and everything was over-priced even for Maui. You pay for chairs at the beach. You pay a resort fee. You pay way too much even for Hawaii for restaurant food. And the room service menu? Don't get me started. And the personal touch we did have- at the beach services kiosk- was just trying to sell us more stuff. They rudely suggested my husband buy their $180 sun glasses to replace the ones he was wearing. And he observed one staff person suggesting to a woman that her chest area looked dry and she should buy the lotion they were selling. Truthfully I feel sorry for the staff here who are probably trained to do that sort of thing. Also, while I appreciate the need for efficiency, the fact that you can do everything via tv (you can check out that way) means no personal touch at the hotel. The one person I felt sense of the Hawaiian aloha from was the gentlemen in the business center. Luckily even the row of high rise hotels cannot ruin the view (though I'm sure black rock and the amazing snorkeling there would be better without the addition of the hotels here). Even our 12 year old did not like it here. And forget getting a seat by the pool here unless you mark your spot by 9 am! Crowded beach etc. Definitely would not return.

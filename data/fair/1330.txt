I stayed here with several colleagues for 1 night in March. As there were quite a few us of attending an event the next day, the company went for the budget option. None of us had stayed here before so we thought we'd give it a try.... I really wish we hadn't! On the plus side, the hotel is well situated next to Euston Station. The rooms were clean and the shower was actually quite good as well. Unfortunately, that's all that was good. When I first entered the room, I actually thought the window was open it was so noisy. It wasn't just traffic noise either; I could hear the actual words people were speaking on the street below. Combined with that, the bed was very, very uneven and uncomfortable and I woke up with back pain which I just do not normally get sleeping anywhere. I don't mind basic hotels, but for me, some sound proofing and a bed that doesn't cause pain is still a minimal requirement, and this room failed on both counts. I was on the 1st floor which probably didn't help; most of my colleagues had the same issues as me although the noise wasn't quite so bad on the higher floors. Overall, there's no way I would stay here again. It may be cheap, but if you're struggling to stay awake the next day and your back hurts, then for me that's a false economy.

The best part about this place: Location & price. It's reasonably clean... could be cleaner though. There's that smell that old hotels tend to have. It was our first stop in our honeymoon, and we were jet-lagged. Hawaii is about 5 hours before us. So we had a hard time enough sleeping, without the really loud garbage truck in the morning. And we paid for the upgrade to get the ocean view. The noise is about 30 mins to 1 hour long. When I read the reviews online, I knew it was small, and I knew a garbage truck made noise in the morning. But I didn't realize it was that loud. You're there on your vacation. Sleep and rest are important. The noise is a deal-breaker, I will not be back to the Lahaina Inn.

The hotel was very nice. The staff was very courteous and helped us to check in a room a lot earlier than check in. Check in is at 4pm, which is later than most hotels. However, we requested early check in and received a phone call by 1:30pm stating we could check in. We were in room 1001, and the sink drained slowly. Also, it took a few tries to get the toilet to flush. The hotel charges $29 for parking, self per day, or valet. There is a $15 deck on the side of the hotel, or $20 deck behind the hotel which has access directly to the hotel without going out in the elements. For the $94 plus tax and fees i spent, i would deal with the small stuff to stay in a four star hotel for less than a hundred dollars.

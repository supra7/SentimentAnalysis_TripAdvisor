To be fair we usually stay at chain hotels so this was new for us. We got into town later than we expected and the parking was down the street from the Inn. When we got to the Inn, it was locked up and we had to use a code to get in since everyone had gone for the day. We had to carry all of our luggage up the stairs and when we got to our room it was so tiny, I couldn't believe it. The website did indicate cozy but I expected a little more room. We had just enough room to get around the bed in single file due to the large antique furniture although I am pretty sure the bed was a double. The bathroom was really small too with just a shower and nowhere to put out all of our toiletries so we kept almost everything in the suitcases. Also due to the antiques everything smelled really musty to us and the wood floor felt sticky the whole time we were there I am sure because we were near water but it was still an unpleasant feeling so we kept flip flops on any time we got out of bed. The room was not furnished to encourage staying in it because it was so small. I enjoyed being out on the balcony and didn't mind the people on the street. It did remind us of the French Quarter which we like. When I was in the room I was out there because I felt like I could actually breathe, however, we had to be careful going out because the door knob kept falling off and the only comment we got on that was "Well, it is an antique". We had requested this specific room based on a review in a travel book saying how romantic it was and how great the view was. We were in Hawaii to renew our wedding vows for our 25th anniversary so we had arranged to stay there for 3 days as opposed to 2 days on Oahu and we paid more per night than the other hotel. I have to say that I was disapointed but again I have never stayed in this type hotel before. I am fairly certain we will never stay in one again. The chain hotels are predictable at least.

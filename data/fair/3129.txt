We just returned from our 5 night (July 15 to July 20)stay in an very nice oceanview room at the Westin Maui.which we paid our money for. The hotel it self was great, a beautiful place but for over $500 per night you would think their "Resort Service Fee : $18.00 Per Room Per Day will be charged to cover the following services" would be uncall for. One of these services "Complimentary Self-parking" was alway full and not once were we able to get out rental car in. We had to pay an additional $10 per day plus tip each time we took our car out of valet parking. That was the only option we had.. "No access charges for local calls" We didn't know anyone to call locally but we did try to make a long distant call to Texas. My wife dialed the number herself and the phone rang 6 or 7 time and seeing our daughter was not at home she hung up, my daughter doesn't have an answering machine. We were changed by Westin, on our bill $10.04 for something like 9 minutes use and it couldn't have been more than one minute. We were with my wife's sister and her husband in ajoining room. They were as inpressed as we were. The beding was outstanding. We have stayed at several Westin properties but I think this one did it for us. We heard there was a mold problem but we didn't see any.

My wife and I spent three days at Homestead, it wasn't pleasant, but was tolerable. The best part of the stay was the kitchenette, it had a full size refrigerator, stovetop, microwave, coffee maker and toaster. It didn't have any forks and we needed to rewash everything before we used it. The freezer had a bad odor. The concept of Homestead was good, but the housekeeping was terrible. Overall the room was filthy. To make things better they need king sized beds at least for couples, a good hosekeeping staff and to pay attention to details. It would not be my choice again. The staff was friendly and helpful if you could find them.

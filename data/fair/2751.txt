I found the room to be noisy and carpet dirty. The window drape would not close fully. The bed and bathroom was average for an older motel. The ice maker in the hall did not work, had to walk a considerable distance to near the loby for ice. I was disappointed to find this Super 8 offers no continental breakfast. Only a coffee machine. I understood all Super 8's offered continental breakfast. My mistake. It upset me that the person behind the counter was annoyed with a couple of questions I asked, re: directions. Cheap motel. I guess you get what you pay for. This one does not stand up to other Super 8 motels I have stayed in.

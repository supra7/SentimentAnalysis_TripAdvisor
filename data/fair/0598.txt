We were excited about our trip to Seattle and our stay at the Doubletree until we were checking out - there was a $20+ charge per day for parking that was not disclosed to us by either Expedia or the Hotel at the time of booking our stay or at the time we checked in. We were also surprised at the time we arrived that there was a $15+ charge per day for Wi-Fi. I do not appreciate up-charges that are not disclosed in advance. The accommodations were fine but just ordinary. During our next trip to the Seattle area we will not be staying at the Doubletree nor will we be booking with Expedia.

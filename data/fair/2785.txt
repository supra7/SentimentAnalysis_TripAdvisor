We traveled to Hawaii with our four kids ages 4-14. We first went to Kauai which is unbelievably beautiful. After being in such a gorgeous setting Maui was a let down. The grand wailea tells you that all rooms are ocean view. They are not. There are palm trees blocking the views from the first 5 floors! The hotel has zero customer service and they charge extra for everything! Even the simple kids art activities at the pool are 25.00 extra a day. The servers were rude. Forget room service bc they don't even answer the phone. The beach has no service. We were paying a lot to stay there and felt like it was a money pit with Bo care for their guests. The food was terrible and expensive. It was not relaxing, indulgent or enjoyable there period. We walked over to the four seasons and for the same priced dinner a's wailea we were treated amazingly. The kids were given toys to play with. My teenager was given a teen menu even. The food was out of this world and their attention to their guests was top notch. We are regulars at at. Regis, ritz and four seasons properties and Hawaii was a big deal for us to travel to with four kids and the wailea was a huge key down and a waste if money.

Came to Makena knowing of bad reviews and didn't find the hotel ambience that bad. Room is comparable to a 4 star hotel. However any interaction with staff is horrible. I received a beachside massage that was the worst massage ever, I highly doubt the masseuse was certified. The poolside bartender said he hated his job. The event admin said he was too busy to book a whale watching trip and would call us back...he called us back while we were on the whale watching trip...good thing we booked it ourselves. Every morning my coffee at statbucks within the hotel cost something different even though it was the same order. Sunday at the pool is clearly bring your family to work day as it was filled with locals so much so that we left the pool. The hotel bones are good, the staff is horrible. Dining options are none, you will need to leave to go out to eat.

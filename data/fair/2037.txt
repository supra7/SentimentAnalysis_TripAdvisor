My family has stayed here many many times. We've always had good experences before our last one. The rooms are nice and a great feature is that the hotel is attached to the Copley Place Mall. We were staying here on April 10th 2009 when a masseuse was murdered a floor below us by the "Craigs List Killer". I know that this can happen in any urban hotel but I have to say that there is unrestricted access from the mall into the hotel. Absolutely no security at all,nothing. Anyone can walk in from the mall and go right into the hotel unobserved. It's no different than a roadside motel where the doors of each room open onto a parking lot. In contrast, when we visited the Westin Hotel at the other end of the mall, everyone coming in from the mall had to pass in front of the front desk and bell captain stand and was scrutinized by hotel staff. In the future I will staying at the Westin. I would never stay at the Marriot again. I would not feel safe.

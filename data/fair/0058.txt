We arrived from a long, arduous overseas flight with our 12 month-old baby and checked into the Kings Inn at around 10pm. Juggling bags, baby and a pram we made our way up the stairs. The rooms were small (no problem) and clean, but perhaps a little TOO clean - the carpets were extremely sticky and smelt overpoweringly of chemicals. Asked for a spoon to feed bub - no, we don't have any spoons. OK then. Continued struggling up and down the stairs over the next three days with a pram, even had the help of the front-desk attendant one day. You can imagine my surprise when on the last day I noticed an elevator one of the corners of the hotel... Unhelpful staff, yes, but the location was great and the streets were nice and quiet. I'd only stay here again if I were absolutely desperate (and single). The price should have been some type of warning...

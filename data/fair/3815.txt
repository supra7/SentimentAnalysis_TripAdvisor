Just a heads up for anyone who might stay at this hotel. My ipod was stole from my bag which was left with the Bell Desk. Since I had to check out before I actually had to leave the hotel, I left my bags with the bell desk at the front of the hotel. A suitcase and a backpack. A thief went into my backpack and took my ipod. Thinking back, I realize that their bag room is not secure at all. Not only do all the bell men go in and out, but anyone could walk in there. It's not secure at all. I do have to say that the security department at the hotel has been helpful (short of replacing my stolen property).

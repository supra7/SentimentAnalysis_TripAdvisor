We stayed for one evening in the first week of November. We stayed on the 5th floor. The room was very warm when we checked in. It had a western exposure so I could understand that. We called the desk and asked for a fan. They brought us a box fan that had filthy blades. When I turned it on I got a shower of dust and unknown particulate. The breakfast was OK, Quiche was overcooked (scrambled) and oatmeal needed some attention. The T.V. volume would not allow one to watch TV from the bed. We could not hear it. The staff, other than one of the gentlemen who worked the desk were terrific and helpful. The aforementioned desk attendant had an attitude and was snobby and unfriendly. Location is great. You can walk anywhere from here. The room was tired and reminded me of my great grandmothers old guest room. Two thin bath towels and a box of coronet tissue tossed on to the back of the toilet were the amenities in the old bathroom that had a constant drip. The showerheads are about as spartan as they can get. I say upgrade a few things boys. Overall...been there, wont be back.

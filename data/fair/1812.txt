I was not impressed with the condition of the room I received. It seemed as though everything in the room was stained, soiled and damaged. A few of the low points: disgusting stains on the bed skirts and covers, dead bugs splatted on the wall, stained and damaged easy chair, bedside table with a broken leg, side chair that was heavily marked with ink pen (looked like a kids art project), toilet that did not flush properly and that made erratic noises, stale dank smell in the room, each bed had different color sheets, etc, etc. Wingate bills their properties as "built for business". I would be very disappointed if I was stayting here on a business trip and would probably check out and go elsewhere. I had a one night stay for a leisure trip at a cheap rate, so I stayed the night and left early the next morning. The hotel seemed to only have a handful of occupied rooms on the Sunday night I was there judging by the wide open parking lot and virtually empty public areas. One final note, this hotel is not very close to the Market Center, which is a few mile south on I-35. It is adjacent to a seedy industrial area and closer to Parkland Hospital and the Medical Center. It's also directly next to the Penthouse "Gentlemen's" Club.

Run!! Just returned from 7 nights at Majestic Elegance. If I had had my way, it would have only been 1 night at Majestic and 6 nights somewhere else. There are literally too many things to list that went wrong, but in short, do not expect the room you booked and paid for (in our case 3 Ocean Front Suites in the private Elegance Club), do not expect help from the desk/management, do not expect a 5 star property. When we were shown our three rooms at check in, not only were they not suites, there was not even an ocean view (rather disappointing when you paid for Ocean Front!!) We were promised that the next day our 3 suites would be available and not to unpack. Next day....surprise!...only 2 suites available despite their representation to the contrary and only one of them was ocean front (by the way, this was never resolved) I have been to over 15 all inclusive resorts throughout the Caribbean and have NEVER had such a frustrating experience as dealing with the Majestic Elegance. If you choose to ignore my advice and go to this resort, do not waste your money on the Elegance Club. The other rooms are just as nice and the private beach is anything but. For the sake of the wait staff and bar staff, I must say that their service was 5 star. They were courteous and helpful (this was a key factor in that alcohol was plentiful and necessary to tolerate the frustration from the management...maybe the service staff should run the resort...)In conclusion, I cannot recommend this resort. If you have already paid for your stay, look into a refund and stay at one of the many, beautiful and established resorts in the area. The Majestic Elegance is just not ready yet!

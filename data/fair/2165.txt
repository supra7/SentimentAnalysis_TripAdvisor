Where do I begin? The place is OLD and somewhat, but not much updated. The rooms are small and the Towers level is a joke. The lounge doesn't seat 1/2 of the people who are on the level. The first room I had was adequate in size, but the internet and phone did not work. When I reported they said they knew it was bad, but booked the room anyhow. They changed my room to one with a view of an airshaft and the size of a shoebox, I guess in retaliation for complaining. In addition, I sent laundry out, it came back, shirts requested folded, on hangers. All in all, they need to just give it up. The service is awful. Easy to understand why Starwood deflagged the place.

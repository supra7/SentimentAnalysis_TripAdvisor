Arrived for a one night stay to a room with a "kitchenette" - which would have been helpful if we were staying longer. The indoor pool was under repair and partially roped off and the the "hot" tub was more like a "warm" tub. The bathroom fan and heat lamp were about falling out of the ceiling. Finally, when arriving back to the room at about midnight, it smelled of cigarette smoke - despite being on a non-smoking floor. Called the front desk and no other rooms were avail and was promised someone would be up to check it out. Waited for an hour...no one came! smell was strongest in the bathroom so I assume the guests in the room next door were smoking and the odor was coming from there. Had it not been midnight, I would have packed up and went elsewhere.Ended up spraying body spray to get rid of the smell and kept the bathroom door closed. Upon checkout, I informed the front desk manager and she did apologize and gave our family coupons for free breakfast in the restaurant. Would not recommend or stay here again.

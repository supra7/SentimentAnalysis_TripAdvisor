This is not a new hotel. It actually is an old Elks Lodge. We had some problems with the reservation and were given a renovated room on the 10th floor- the "royal court". It was newly renovated, but very small. The bathroom was not big enough for two people-not enough shelf space. The lobby is dark and the furniture old, dark, but comfortable. We did have some problems (the maid missed our room one day, the TV was out, cold air continually flowed from the vent in the bathroom). We reported each problem and the VERY attentive staff saw to it within the hour. I will give them points for that. the household staff goes out of their way to say "hello". There are literally dozens of hotels in the Union Square area. This one has a great location, but I think next time in San Francisco, we might try another hotel.

The lobby, restaurants and pools are really beautiful. The Hyde Park Restaurant was fantastic! The rooms and the housekeeping are a different story. Our first room had a broken closet door and the tub was dirty! We asked to change rooms but did not get anything better. The room was still not very clean and can you believe it- the doors were broken on the closet!! When housekeeping did " clean" the room it consisted of changing sheets and giving us new towels. Bathroom was not cleaned , trash cans were not emptied.. Just terrible.

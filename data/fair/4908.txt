I stayed in this hotel when there was also a Bears game and they were woefully unprepared for the influx of people. The lines for registration snaked all the way to the elevator banks. And the front desk staff dealt with folks with a general disdain (though the valets were nice, I guess they should be for $45-which is much higher than parking usually is in the city). Having booked the room through Priceline didnt help, Ive noticed that a few hotels treat Priceline folks as little better than pond scum and these folks fall into that category. Room service quality was great, but the prices were outrageous. $50 for soup, shrimp cocktail, and a salad. The rooms and common areas were bland and far from a top flight hotel. It was clean, but unspectacular. Kind of like a Courtyard by Marriott, which is probably much cheaper, unless you go to Priceline which is what I did. I cant fathom spending over $200 for this place. Location is fine, a 3-4 block walk to Michigan Avenue isnt that bad and the views are above average if you can get a good view, the northeast views are best. I expected more from this hotel for its rating. Given that this is their last hotel in the US, I imagine theyll be selling it off soon to some other industry leader. As a result they wont be upgrading it much any time soon.

When you first arrive, the outside is beautiful and your right across from the Waldorf. The lobby is a site to be seen and has plush seating ( but don't count on getting a seat at night.. its packed.. mainly by people who don't even go to the hotel!) Check in was quick, but the elevators are very very slow and small. They play music that is " soothing" but it ends up being annoying ( its maily French rap). We got to our room on the 16th floor. We commonly called it "our closet", for the rest of our trip. The room was very small. The king size bed was the only savior. extreamly comfortable, but its an over glorified feather bed with a satin duvet. The bathroom was basicly the size of our closet and had no counter space! The shower was nice.. good water pressure. The Bliss products they give you are very nice and they are replenished everyday. The air conditioner was on FULL BLAST for 3 days and it never got cold in our room. It was ok during the day .. but sleeping at night with the heavy comforter make it way to hot to sleep sometimes. Nightlife at the W NewYork- the bar in the lobby is EXPENSIVE! Don't bother.. the drinks are way too strong. We purchased 2 cocktails and it ended up to be $ 24.00 before tip! I know its NYC but at least make a good drink! The wait to get on an elevator could sometimes be up to 15 min! Once your on.. it seems like it stops at every floor. All in all.. its an ok hotel... but not worth the $300 a night! Go across the street to the Waldorf for that kind of money!

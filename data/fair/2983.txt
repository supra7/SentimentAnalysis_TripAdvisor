The tone of our honeymoon was set when we dealt with the passive aggressive front desk person on checkin. She was better qualified to tend phones for my credit card company than to present herself as the face of a 5 star resort. While the grounds, rooms and location felt like the Ritz, the service was inconsistent at best and not what one would expect from a 5 star hotel. As an example, we were horrified by the sight of cockroaches not once but on three separate occasions in our room. The response of the Ritz staff was to inconvenience us by supposedly sending an exterminator that prevented us from entering our room for a full day. When we finally entered our room we were greeted by a cockroach on the back of the bathroom door. After describing our greeting to the front desk we didn't even get an apology, much less an offer to discount our rooms or even a free drink at the hotel bar.

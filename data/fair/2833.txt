Who runs this place - Montgomery Burns? There were many times my wife and I muttered to ourselves, "You cheap [--]" Charging for housekeeping? Charging for a lousy beach umbrella? Graciously providing packaged processed coffee, and NOT Kona? At THESE prices. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP! OK, the pool areas are pretty cool and well designed, and if you're looking for a Snazzy Jazzy resort, to LOOK AT, this is it. But the "Upscale Resort" appeal stops there. It's not as if there was bad service, but it ceratinly wasn't great. You'd get the same at a Ramada. The sunsets on the beach are beautiful, but why not enjoy them with a $7 beer or a $14 drink? The place is relatively clean, but it's obvious nothing has been done since it was first built. It's aging and it shows it. Do NOT order room service. The food is God awful. In fact, with the one exception of the PU PU platter at Humu Humu, the food was mediocre at best, and just plain BAD. Eat off sight if you can. The buffet at Kincha, the Japanese restautant was OK, but on par with what one would find at a Holiday Inn, NOT the Grand Wailea at 400 bucks a night. Food at these places should be top notch - NO exception. The "GW" is just not worth it. Think of paying full price for a top of line Mercedes and then hearing, "Would you like an engine?" ; "I'm sorry, door handles are extra." ; "Oh, you want tires... there's a charge for that." I'm sure the owners and managment of the Grand Wailea are satisfied with their hotel, but this nickel and dime nonsense and sub par service will catch up with them.

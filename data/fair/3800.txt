This place was recommended by a colleague. Maybe the building I was in is a bit outdated but the room layout is like the rooms found in the Holiday Inn with weak mattresses, the bathroom sinks outside the bathrooms, and AC units turned off (possibly to conserve energy?) with the outside temperatures in the high 70's allowing the stale air in the room to smell like the carpet is drenched in urine. The room was not as cleaned as I expected for this "Grand" resort for the nightly cost. I would not buy into this place as a timeshare.

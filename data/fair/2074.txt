We just came back from 3 nights stay at the Marriott Long Wharf in Boston. Whatever can go wrong went wrong with our stay. 1. Marriott made mistake with our reservation so we were placed in their small standard room with 2 double beds for $299.00. We were party of 2 adults and 2 teenage daughters. We were told by CARMEN at the front desk that they didn't have the corner unit that I requested. She said that our reservation didn't request the corner unit so that when the corner unit next to us opened up, we couldn't get it. She had to give it to someone who REQUESTED it. Finally around 9:30, we decided that this wasn't going to work so that we called in to shorten our stay. ROCHELLE from the the front desk immediately searched for bigger room for us and found the corner unit which we were told were fully booked. She apologized for the misunderstanding since our reservation shows my request for the bigger room. 2. Our third and final night, room next door left their joining door open and decided to have a LOUD LOUD sex session at 10:00 pm. We were all watching TV. My husband tried to match the volume with TV but they were louder. Thank God the session were interrupted by a phone call from their friend. After 3 calls to the front desk went without any action, I went down to ask if anything can be done about this. ANDREW placed me and my daughters in another room for no charge. This room was located right above the street level bar which were filled with at least 50 young patrons. They all left by 2:00 am. My daughters slept with pillows over their head. At least this noise was preferred to the other noise. Beside our events, we were extremely happy with the service from rest of the staff. This will not deter me from other Marriott hotel/resort since I have stayed in so many without any incidents but I will ask more questions and double check with my future hotel bookings.

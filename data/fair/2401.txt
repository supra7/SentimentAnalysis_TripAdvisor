Great service from the front desk, beautiful rooms, and a very friendly doorman. My only issue was, I went to the hotel bar/restaurant at 10:00 PM, to get a glass of wine. The male staff members were standing around discussing their plans for the evening and looked annoyed that I walked in, despite the fact that they didn't close for another hour. I ordered $13 dollar glass, but the waiter made me sit in the lobby with it because "I needed to to order some food if I wanted to be seated at the bar" I came back a few minutes later and told them I didn't want to sitting in the breezy lobby in the middle of Feburary with my wine. They rolled their eyes and found me a table close to the door. I realized that they were more interested in closing the place early so they could go out on the town for evening. The attitude was disgusting, and I'd stay at the Palmer House next time.

This is as much a resident hotel as a guest hotel; thus there is no service mentality among the staff. Similarly, common areas such as the lobby are locked and there are numerous petty rules. My room was not as small as other reviews have described, but its furnishings were inexpensive and in only average condition (the bed was particularly bad). The shared bathrooms are what you might expect in a 100-year-old YMCA -- clean, but very institutional and uninviting. Really, the only good things about the place were its location and the view of neighboring townhouse backyards.

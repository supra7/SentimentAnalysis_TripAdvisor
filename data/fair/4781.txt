My boyfriend and I stayed at The Lennox for two nights during a trip to Boston and Cape Cod. Our trip started in Washington DC and we had just stayed at the Palomar Hotel (a Kimpton Boutique) and been very spoiled. We checked into the Lennox at $100 per night more than the Palomar and expected old fashioned luxury. Instead, we found a small, pokey room, unfriendly staff and a disappointing stay. There was only enough room at the end of the bed for one of us to walk by, the bed wasn't very comfortable and on a couple of occasions, the desk staff weren't very helpful. They even asked the car hire company to move the car they were delivering to us and we were in the lobby waiting to step outside! At $260 per night I expect a lot more!

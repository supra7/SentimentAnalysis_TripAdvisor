Although the hotel was lovely the bathtub is dangerously slippery! We had 3 rooms and everyone slipped getting into the tub. I slipped and fell bruising my leg and hitting my head. Fortunately no bones were broken but my bruises are extensive. There are no anti-slip pads, mats or handles in the tub. There was no manager on duty but I did file a report with the head of security and sent an e-mail to the manager. I would be interested to see if the Hilton fixes this problem.

The Good: Great location. Stayed on the 34th floor facing the lake, river, and Navy Pier. Wonderful view, especially on Saturday night when the pier had fireworks. The Bad: CONSTANT elevator noise Loose carpeting Shower leaked all over floor High pitched tone from air conditioner (maddening!) Staff not very helpful or friendly Overall, a so-so experience; will not stay there again.

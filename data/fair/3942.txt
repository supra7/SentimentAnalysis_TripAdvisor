Tricky review. I'd stayed in the Rex once before and really enjoyed it. It's centrally located to Union Square and has a nice 1940's feel to the decor. This visit was well below par. We checked in early but happy to leave our bags and return later etc for the room. When we came back we were given what was probably usually a 1 person room , 1 small double in a very small room. Toenail clipping also found on the floor. Bathroom curtain didn't cover the window so left a foot of open glass exposed. Then we had the dreaded "roll together bed". We probably should have complained but the hotel was very busy and as we were only staying 1 night we maybe got a bad deal and were too tired to argue or discuss. This is a Joie de Vivre hotel like the Drisco (which we loved) but the staff at the Rex were cocky and unapproachable and I felt the service was overall very poor. We weren't informed of anything on check-in (there is coffee, wine etc which we found out by overhearing other people later) One saving grace, I don't know the barmans name in the wine reception but he was great fun and saved the experience!

I have been a SPG Platinum member for 10+ years and have never been to any location worldwide including Honolulu where I was not treated according to the rules and beyond. This property was quite disappointing as room upgrades were disgusting, staff was very tough and what surprised me the most was when I asked for a 4pm checkout and was denied. I was told that it was based upon the availability. I have never heard that before and some of the SPG properties have actually accomodated me until 6pm as a courtsey if I ever had a late night flight. Most of the rooms have limited views and I recommend there sister property Westin next doors. This is my first negative review of a SPG propert in 10 years:-(

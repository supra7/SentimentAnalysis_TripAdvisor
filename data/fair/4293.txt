I lost my father four months ago. My husband and I decided to take my 74 year old mother to NYC to see a show for her birthday. The first birthday without her husband in 41 years. We chose the Beekman Tower based on a close friend's referral, though she had not stayed there for some time. We are very sorry that we chose this hotel. My mother's room was horrible. Outdated green carpet that was so wrinkled and stretched with age that she had to be carfeful not to trip over it. Wallpaper was peeling from the walls. To top it off, the HVAC system in her room was broken. When we asked to move her to another room we were told that the only room they could move her to was a smoking room. Our room had furniture that was falling apart, carpet that was so old it was thin in places, more peeling wallpaper, and a toilet seat that had some horrific looking stain on it. From our perspective the Beekman Tower is outdated and tired. Decor aside, the real probelm with the hotel is its unwillingness to go the extra mile for its guests. At checkout we were offered a pitiful $25 off the cost of her room. While the front desk people were very nice when they told us they couldn't do anything for us, the manager was nowhere to be found and WE were expected to call HIM to try to work things out. after the fact. Hotels are a dime a dozen in the city. Do not waste your time or money staying the Beekman Tower.

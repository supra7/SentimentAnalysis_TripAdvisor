I have stayed in many hotels. This was close to the all time worst I've stayed in in 25 years of traveling. I paid for an "executive suite" thinking I'd get a renovated room. When I asked the front desk person, she said, "they're all renovated." When I got to the room, if I hadn't already paid for 3 nights, I would have turned around & walked out! The bedspreads, nightstand & dresser were "updated." The shower tile, sink & toilet were "updated." But, the bathroom & kitchenette windows were very old & not secure. The huge sliding glass door that opened to the walkway barely locked, the chewed up gap across the bottom of the door to the room was so wide, critters would barely have to sqeeze to get through. There were multiple mouse traps & "droppings" in the kitchen. The lamp shades looked like they'd been tossed around a few times. The clean towels & wash cloths were still damp. The good news is, when I checked for bedbugs, I did not find any evidence of them. What I don't understand is, when I walked across the property to my friend's "executive suite," it was like they were in a different hotel - - it was fully updated - - like a real hotel! The hotel staff were pleasant. The continental breakfast by the front desk every morning was adequate. The proximity to Hollywood Blvd attractions is convenient.

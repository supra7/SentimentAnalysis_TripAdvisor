so it's not very clean or spectacular even though the price is deceiving, it's still the comfort inn. i suppose it's my fault i waited to late to get a hotel bc for the same price a few months earlier we could have gotten into the waldorf. but i paid all this money over $300 a night and it was a comfort inn and the worst comfort inn i've ever stayed at. ive been to several of them throughout america and they've been pretty decent and good value for what you pay, clean, nice facilities and staff but none of this was true for the one in NYC. we also paid for/requested a king size bed but got two full size beds and they wouldn't change it. and they had the smallest weirdest pillows to sleep on which made it awkward to sleep, they were half the size of a standard pillow! location is decent but try to book farther in advance for a better hotel, bc if you're going to do new york, do it right.

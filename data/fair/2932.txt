We do not recommend this hotel. The cleaning staff and breakfast staff were excellent as the banyan tree staff, otherwise we were incredibly dissappointed. The concierge was particularly poor. We had to drive to other parts of Maui to enjoy our stay. Because the ritz is on a hill, it was a completely different day at the hotel- much cooler than other parts of Maui. Plus it was at least double in cost for everything. It is not worth the money.

Only so-so This BB is in a beautiful old mansion in a great part of town (Cow Hollow) with many shops, restaurants, and cafes within walking distance. The room was comfortable but the bed was too soft.However, there are a few problems. The place is looking a little shabby and needs new wall paper and a new coat of paint. Parking is very hard and once we found a spot, we didn't dare move the car. The breakfast was a joke: a carton of juice, some Philly cream cheese, and sliced bread out of a bag. No fresh based bread, no fancy cheeses or fresh squeezed juice.Overall, I expected a little more at this price.

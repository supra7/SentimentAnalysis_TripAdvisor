I've been attending A-kon for the past three years and love it. but this was my first year of staying in the Sheraton and I was not at all impressed. I understand that A-kon is a mess and a huge stress on the staff, but even allowing for that my best friend Claire and I were not treated decently. When we first arrived we were very happy with our room; there weren't enough towels for both of us, but we decided that I would take a shower the next day after fresh towels arrived. No real problem at that point. It was on the second day that issues started coming up. Claire always travels with her own pillow and blanket because she has trouble sleeping otherwise. When we arrived back at our room Friday afternoon, we saw that the room had been cleaned. Somehow, this included picking up Claire's blanket with the blankets. On top of that the bed was made without a fitted sheet and there were no fresh towels. Housekeeping did not come back by our room until Sunday night near midnight. Two of the three times that we reported the blanket missing (Friday night and Saturday afternoon) we were sent to several places before finding anyone who could help us at all. The only person who was truly helpful in this situation was the man who worked in the Business Office who took a lost and found report with me. Two and a half weeks later...no sign of the blanket. I am beyond displeased.

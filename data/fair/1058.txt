Pros: * Good location: 2 stops on street car from Sultanahmet area & near fish restaurants * Very service-oriented & helpful hotel manager, Ramazan Gol * Clean bathroom, sheets, & blankets * Free Internet Cons * Very noisy, especially if your room is near the staircase from lobby * Dirty floor/carpet in room * V. small, claustrophobic room with a somewhat grimy feeling * Very poor lighting * Desk staff other than hotel manager friendly but in general incompetent: a message we left for 2 friends at 10PM was not passed on to them when they arrived at midnite -- in fact our friends were told we had checked out! Our friends never received the message during the next 3 days.

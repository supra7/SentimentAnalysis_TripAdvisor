Booking a trip in absolute Christmas/New Year peak period and conscious of high occupancy rates is always a risk but our recent holiday experience at Westin Maui was nonetheless disappointing. The apparent (?) release of a new reservation system causing long laborious checkin queues certainly didn't help and cannot be blamed on reception staff. Service generally throughout our stay was poor, no greeting nor bell service evident at all, self parking 'full' requriing valet every time. The incredibly expensive ocean front room was extremely tired and cramped with an ancient bathroom and poor quality / insufficient soaps and lotions. Food at breakfast was inferior and we continued throughout our stay and subsequently to battle with discrepancies between our reservation (which included pre paid breakfast) and what was received at the hotel as to our entitlements. Many hours were spent in the long queue to try to sort this out and remains unresolved at time of review. Dirty plates from in-room dining remained in the corridors throughout our stay and there was a general down at heel/low quality feel. We have been Starwood members for a long time and have visited this hotel many times over the last 20 years as it has a great location however now it is in complete contrast to a fabulous stay at Four Seasons Wailea which interestingly cost less for the same peak period. No question what our future decision will be..!?

The internet signal in my room (1816) was so weak as to be virtually unusable - and the connection speed ridiculously slow. Not good if you are doing business. I had to sit on the floor by the elevators (no chairs in the corridors) to get wi-fi signal - as there's none in the lobby for guests - that I could find. The dinner menu is seriously boring....the breakfasts OK, except for the day that coachloads of people filled the restaurant and lined-up outside in the lobby. The Hotel can't cope with a coachload of people all at once. The Welcome at check-in was cool. The room itself was comfortable, if rather cramped around the bed. It's confusing that there is another Westin in the Horton Center very close by. One of them needs a different name.

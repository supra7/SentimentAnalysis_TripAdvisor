This was our 4th or 5th stay at this hotel. A great location. About 10 or 15 minute walk to Pike Market. On the free bus line. Nicely appointed lobby. Front desk personnel are somewhat "aloof". Could be friendlier. In room internet at $9.95/day. Too many hotels now days are going to free wi-fi and we are starting to look for hotels that offer it. Located in an area where there is massive construction. A couple of cranes nearby with one of them directly over the hotel. That's abit scary to see. Lots of daytime noise due to the construction. No parking at the hotel but there is a public parking garage across the street at the Hyatt. Rooms are currently being refurnished with new furniture. That could be nice but the new furniture is really over-sized and makes the small rooms even smaller and doesn't allow for a body to move around the room. Restaurant (DragonFish) attached to the hotel serves awesome chinese food. Overpriced though. Try eating during the evening happy hour (10pm-1am) and get several appetizers at a low price. Some other restaurants in the area within two blocks (Vons, Cheesecake factory). A starbucks is across the street in the Hyatt. I do think this hotel is going to raise their rates and won't be worth it unless they pay attention to what guests on here are saying.

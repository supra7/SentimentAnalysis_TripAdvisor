Ok if you're on a budget! Like other reviewers mentioned before me, I was a little hesitant about staying at this place. There're reasons for that.....the room is semi-wet and smells moldy. (I brought an air freshener to neutralize that.) There's no guaranteed parking if you rented a car. I had to hassle with them to guarantee me parking every day of my trip. The electricity went out and it could not be fixed. I had to move all of my belonging in the middle of the night to another room. If you're on a budget, this would be the ideal place to go. The staff are approachable and accomodating. It is a quaint small room with microwave, bathroom, cable tv, etc. It's within walking distance to the beautiful beach of Waikiki, the International Market Place, and numerous restaurants/stores/shops. This trip was still great regardless of where you stay......Make the best of your trip where ever you are.

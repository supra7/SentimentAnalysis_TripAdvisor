I was put into Room 11, a room on the ground floor right next to a busy bus lane. Every few seconds another huge noisy double decker bus would thunder past the window, mere feet from where I tried to sleep. I can not over stress this point too much-- the buses did not stop all night long. Quite possibly the worst nights sleep I ever had. The window blind didn't cover the window properly, the room smelled and orange peelings on the stairs were there for all four days of my stay but this is small beans when compared to the total lack of sleep I got. To rub salt into the wound, some drunk yobs hammered on all of the street side windows at 4.30am one night yelling 'WAKEY WAKEY'. The joke was on them, I was never asleep to begin with. For 100 a night this is a very very poor offering.

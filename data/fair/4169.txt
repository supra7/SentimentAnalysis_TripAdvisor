I chose to spend my Columbus Day weekend in Seattle, only about a 3.5 hour drive from the Portland area, where I reside. I have personally never been to a Travelodge and after my visit there to the City Center Travelodge in Seattle for three nights, I won't be going to another one and I highly advise that you don't either. Why you ask? Aside from looking ratty and dingy, the service was horrid and the bed, dreadful. Let me explain. One afternoon, after arriving in the room, we found our beds made but our bathroom completely void of towels. So I politely call the front desk and ask them to deliver towels to my room and they said they would do so. A half-hour later still no towels, I call again, and ask for towels and they said they would bring them up. Over an hour later, there are no towels and I finally go down to the desk myself and demand the towels. I've just adduced a good example of how nonexistent the service was at Travelodge. Let's move on to the bed. This won't take long to describe. Just imagine sleepping on a mattress but with next to no cushioing or padding, just the metal springs. That's what it felt like. If I wasn't so damn worn out after sightseeing, I would have had serious problems sleeping on it but I survived. I think I've adequately stated my case here and if you consider yourself an intelligent and prudent traveler, you will not go to the Travelodge at City Center in Seattle and if you must, pay a nominal amount more to stay at a hopefully newer hotel/motel with better service and a real bed. I have more to say but you get the idea.

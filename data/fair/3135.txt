Stayed three nights here at the end of June. I was expecting far more, given the numerous positive reviews on this site. My main complaint concerns cleanliness: the sheets and blankets had several stains, and the carpet had lots of pet hair, as if nobody had vacuumed. The halls reeked of cooking food (and not in a good way). Management was friendly, and the internet worked very well. But unless you're staying for an extended period of time (when, presumably, you would be bringing your own toiletries) it's a bit annoying to come for a short trip and have to supply your own bath products and have no housekeeping (especially when the room could have used cleaning).

When we arrived it seemed like a clean room. After 5 days it wasn't. I thought motels cleaned your room daily. Maybe I,m mistaken but twice I had to ask for clean towels and toilet paper over the 5 nights we were there. We never saw a vacuum cleaner or any signs of one in our room. Outside was well kept amd clean. One night I called the desk for towels and was asked if I left my maid tag hang on the door, I told him it was hanging there since 11:30 AM and it was 6:00 PM. Why do I have to ask for maid service.... The staff was very friendly but I think they could do a lot more when it comes to the rooms.. The pool is small but adequate for the motel.. Its always clean and lots of chairs.. The noise, now thats a whole other problem.. the second night someone was beating on the door next to us and cursing . The next two nights the other neighbors thought that they could fight curse and swear untill 4:30 AM out on the balcony.. Not a very restful place. The annex building was the same as above as we had relatives in that building..The beach was only a 2 minute walk at most not bad..

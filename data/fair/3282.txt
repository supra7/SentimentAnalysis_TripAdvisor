Hotel Villa Convento is charming. However, we stayed there over the New Years period and were paying $330 per room per night. Ok that's a busy time in the French Quarter, and the location is excellent. But when you see what you get for that price...rooms with large holes in the walls, bricks walls that haven't been treated properly so that you're covered in red brick sediment it seems incredibly overpriced. On New Years Eve, there was a group of people who sat in the communal garden until 7am keeping the whole hotel awake. When we spoke with the receptionist about it, she said they had had the same problem with this group the previous year!? And yet did nothing from preventing it this year? I would say on a positive note that the staff were very friendly and helpful. But this place needs a major upgrade if it expects anyone to not feel ripped off at these types of prices. At $100 per night I would have said good deal. But be warned, things really are falling apart. Other things to be aware of is that the hotel falsely advertises that you will have a nice breakfast everyday in fliers and quite obviously online with photos, etc. This is 100% not true. There's coffee in a thermos at reception and of course a lovely cafe across the street where you pay for your own. Parking was a fiasco. Rather than investing in a key card system as you find at the hotel itself, you have this huge hassle of collecting the key from reception, walking to the garage (10 minutes) and then returning the key to reception, which means going through the one-way system and traffic. The key and lock were also not working properly, so it was the norm to stand trying to open the garage door for up to 10 minutes! All in all a place with promise, but at the moment way too shabby for the prices they charge at peak times.

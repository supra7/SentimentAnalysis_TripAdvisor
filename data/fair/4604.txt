Not worth the money This leg of our trip (over New Years) was a total disappointment. The hotel looks out at other hotels, especially the roofs and exhaust fans. The balconies are small and claustrophobic. The elevator has a mind of its own - whether it will open when you call it or whether it stops at your floor even though the button is lit up ... you take your life in your hands! The pool is on the top of a parking garage and wasn't open for 2 of the 5 days we were there. We had tried to change our dates to stay and they were not helpful at all in accommodating that request. Our room had 2 double beds in them that were barely big enough for one person let alone two so my partner and I ended up sleeping in separate beds (how romantic). The restaurant was only open for breakfast until 10 am. If you arrived at 9:55, you were out of luck as they were tearing it down. Same for lunch... be there before 2, or again, you're out of luck. Cashing travellers cheques was another nightmare. They will only cash $200 at a time. Like, come on, that's not even the cost of a dinner!!! It was an extremely disappointing visit and we will not be back.

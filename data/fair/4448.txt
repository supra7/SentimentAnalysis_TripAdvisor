Travelling the US on a weekly basis, I see it all and have established standards for value. When dropped off at the hotel by a taxi, I was not greeted by the hotel employees standing outside even tho I had 4 bags, was not offered help until I had wrestled the bags into the hotel myself. that is expected at a Motel 8, not at a Westin. the front desk associate was pleasant, told me I had boxes delivered for the conference, which could be delivered to the conference area when needed. The day the boxes were requested, they could not be located for hours. The room was small, the bathroom poorly lit, especially for a female traveller, the room was not organized for business or leisure. Why have a desk situated away from the large flat screen, or why have a large flat screen? The king room was set up for a single traveller who planned no time in the room. This hotel was located next to an office complex which I am sure populates the hotel with out concerning the hotel to raise it's standards. Food service was fair, the coffee was horrible in the restaurant, banquet services and even the so called Starbucks in the lobby. the iced tea was worse. One evening banquet had a decent entre. If the conference is held at the same location again, I will find another hotel.

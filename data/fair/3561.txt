We stayed at this hotel this past weekend, and have stayed at W's all over the country, and we were shocked. The room was tiny,,and i mean tiny, now we live,and work in ny and have lived in nyc, and we were shocked at the size. The room would be perfect for a hobbit since the queen bed was actually only a double size bed, don't bring more than one luggage because there is no room for more than that. the rooms are hot and stuffy and the heating/ac system would not cool the room. the bathroom was tiny and cramped. now we had friends also staying at the same hotel and their room had the same problems. The staff was excellent, which was the only good thing that could be said. I would not advise anyone other than a hobbit to stay there. They actually post a sign in the bathroom saying something like does size matter, we know its a small room but it comes with big perks, that every room comes with a laptop with free wifi,,,but the laptop is a slow as a desk top from the early 90's with dial up access, and thats when it wasn't crashing. And the room did have a nice flat screen but it was mounted to a pole in the corner by the bed where to get to the other side of the bed you had lean over since the tv was in the way or you'd hit it. just bad size,layout, and thought process in the design.

Not worth the money Only stay here if you can get a room for under $300 USD. I have found many great hotels around the world because of the reviews on tripadvisor. This is the first time I have not agreed with the majority. The service at the hotel is apparently not what it used to be. I booked the hotel for a weekend for my parents. I wanted to pay for their stay and stopped by the hotel (I live in NYC) a few days before and left my credit card info. The clerk at the desk assured me that all would be billed to my card and most importantly, that my parents would not see the bill. He even said he would make a note on the reservation that they were not to see how much the rooms were. Well, I saw my mom after their stay and she handed me the bill which she was asked to sign that included the charges for the room. :-(The first room they were given on the 3rd floor had garbage left in it and imprints in the bed from where someone had been lying on it. My folks called the front desk and the manager asked what would you like to do? What kind of question is that? My mom said she was not happy about sleeping in a bed someone had already laid in so they offered them a new room. That should have been the first thing out of the manger's mouth, not what do you want to do?. The room they were given on the 6th floor was small and a bit worn around the edges. They were also promised a bottle of champagne on the second night for my father's birthday which never arrived. My parent's called the front desk who proceeded to question whether they were telling the truth or not about the missing champagne.The area around the hotel is under heavy construction so make sure to ask for a quiet room. This was at least a request that the staff at the Casablanca honored for us.

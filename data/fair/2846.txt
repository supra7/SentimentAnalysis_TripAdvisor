We stayed in Grand Wailea in July 2006. We were in a group; we had four rooms. All four rooms were in a very unkept condition. The walls were very dirty. Wall paper was peeling of the wall. The shower doors were in very bad condition. There were spots on the carpet. A few of us got a rash; from the pool. We met other people with same conditions. We were told that the hotel, will be remodeled next year; which will take a few years. I think this hotel must avoided during this time.

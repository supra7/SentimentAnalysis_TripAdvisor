This is a very dated hotel and the rooms are in desperate need of renovating. Our hearts sunk when we saw the room. Dated carpet and old wooden furniture. The bathrooms are very small, the shower is over the bath and the toilet is not seperate. We had been to two other islands previously and both of the hotels there were beautiful and we thought we had done our homework on the Maui hotels but we were so disappointed. The pool area is large but the sun lounges are packed in like sardines in a can with hardly any shade. I am sorry but I could not recommend this hotel.

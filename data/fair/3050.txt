The standards, training of staff are so far below what a Starwood Elite memebre will expect. Therre asre no ameneties nor services for Platinum memebers. Rooms are tiny, cramped and there is no place to put any clothes unless you have come for justa few nights. Beach chairs have to be booked in adavnace and are rented by the week- no spontanaity here. Not very large facilities compared to size of the resort or sooms thay have.

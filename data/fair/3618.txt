Arrived with high expectations after staying at other W Hotels in NYC. First room was in need of a make over with water stained light shade and threadbare carpet and paint scuffed on the window sill. Add to that renovations taking place outside the room too we moved. Second room - little better - still very small but clean and tidy. We ordered the celebration pack but this was not given on arrival and had to ask for it, but was told we had to ring different numbers to get the items. Disappointing and not the stay we hoped for given our previous experiences... Location though is superb

Attitude at the Clift Upon arrival at the Clift, we were embarrassed at the behavior of the desk clerk, who VERY loudly announced, to all around, that we were lucky that we got the room we got, because we were booked by Priceline. This incident was shortly followed by the concierge, who, while starting to advise us, took a call and proceeded to help the person on the line, rather than to explain that he was in the middle of helping a guest, and getting back to that person. THEN, we decided to eat dinner at Asia de Cuba, which is in the hotel, and got a really snotty attitude from the hostess! The dinner was great, though. In addition to all of this, the room was lacking any place to unpack, or set things down in the bathroom. We felt it a rather inhospitable stay. As far as we were concerned, the only people who would enjoy this place are those that enjoy being abused!

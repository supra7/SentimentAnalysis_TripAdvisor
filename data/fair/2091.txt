I stayed at this hotel shortly after Christmas. I came in one evening and found a small rat (or very large mouse) in my room. They moved me to another room - and I found a large mousetrap under the bed, hugging the wall. (Nowadays, I always do a quick bedbug check whenever I check into a room, and as I was examining the mattress I pulled it away from the wall and saw the mousetrap). All hotels have issues with vermin, even new hotels, but this is the first time I have ever seen a rat / mouse in a room, at least in North America. The fact that the second room had a mousetrap under the bed (which I have also never seen) indicates to me that this is an ongoing problem at this hotel. Given the hotel's age and the fact that the rates were reasonable, I found the hotel was, for the most part, well maintained and comfortable. But as I said, the fact there was a mousetrap in the second room indicates to me that this is a problem which needs to be dealt with.

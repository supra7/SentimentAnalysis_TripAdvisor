We stayed there 8 nights. I would not stay here again. The view and the valet attendants were the only good things about this hotel. We had an ocean front room and it was beautiful with a large Lani. As you walk out the front door to the room we had a beautiful mountain view. Front desk clerks were very slow, unconcerned and not friendly. Housekeeping was the worse I've ever experienced. I showered with my shoes on and slept in more clothes than normal... not kidding. It's an older hotel which I don't mind but I still expected clean. Old shouldn't = DIRTY!!! Amazing view of a beautiful beach but I would have rather paid 1k more for a better hotel. We were very active and stayed out of the room as much as possible. Eat away from the hotel for better food and prices. I almost forgot it literally rained in the hotel and they had several trash cans sitting out to catch the rain. Not new leaks from looking at the ceiling. Stay at this hotel at your own risk! Another good point Maui was gorgeous and we drove around the entire Island.

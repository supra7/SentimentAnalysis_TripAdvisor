I stayed in this hotel twice in a couple of years, on business travel. The hotel in general is just fine and near the downtown and convention center, but it is near by the highway and you can ear the cars all the night. The windows are not prepared for this kind of noise, and i couldn't sleep a single night in the last time i visited seattle.

Hmmm... Firealarm at 3 am and walls like paper.. Stay again? No We stayed here for 2 night in November. Although the hotel looks great and has great location, it misses 2 basic things which make a good hotel: good communications and a good nights rest. First, our room was so not-quiet that you could hear any conversation in the next room word for word. And not only that, but also the neighbours TV who was watching porn all through the night... Secondly we had an incident where the firealarm went off at 3 a.m. A very shocking experience which I never hope to go through again. After about a minute of a alarm at about 80dB and sheer disorientation and panic someone annouced that we should remain calm. Wow, this guys was helping us. Again about a minute later while we were halfway the stairs it was annouced that the SFFD has given the all clear. That was before any fire truck had pulled up before the hotel (which happened 2 some minutes later) So ok, next morning we expected a Sorry and an explanation, but too bad the hotel management felt no need to explain this to it's customers. Too bad. For us that was an experience of once but never again. If you are going to SF, there must be better options out there in the same pricerange with better service.

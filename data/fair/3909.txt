This place is nearby the worst part of town and it shows. There are homeless people and druggies everywhere. My friends and I made the mistake of walking to dinner. While trekking only 1 mile, we were approached by numerous street people, witnessed a woman urinate in the street, and found ourselves in the middle of a vulgar screaming match because some toothless woman punched a toothless man's pitbull as he walked by. Classy for a diva, right? Enough abiut the neighborhood, the hotel itself reminds me of an apartment building. The bathroom is so small that the sink is placed in the sleeping area instead. It was clean but you can tell the building was old and they just hastily slapped paint on the walls to make it look hip. I don't plan on coming back. Stay away if you can.

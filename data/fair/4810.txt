Don't expect to sleep in at this hotel...hammers banging early in the morning...scaffolding in front of the elevator doors...only 2 availbable by the way..better ask for a view because out of our window all we saw was some piping on the top of a roof..no view at all....front desk contacted about the hammering and they commented they didn't know where it was coming from???? very pricey considering the renovation going on...on a positive, the room was clean and the location was superb but would not stay there again

Not up to normal W standards, especially the rooms on the 2nd floor where it is very noisy with traffic going into the spa and gym constantly. Unfortunately, our aroom was next to the janitors closet so there were even more noise especially early in the mornng. The washrooms had no ventilation so the whole room (since they are very small) gets steamy and warm after a shower. The shower curtain does not keep water in the shower area so we wasted a lot of towels covering the bathroom floor. The lighting was the worse, it was always night in the room The best part of the hotel was the ambiance of the lobby and the helpfulness of the concierge. Location was perfect as walking distance to most shops and attracitons.

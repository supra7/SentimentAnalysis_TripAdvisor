Nothing special! I had never stayed at a Lexington Inn before, and if they are all like this one I probably won't again. We checked in about an hour early and was told our room was not yet ready; no problem since we were a bit early. The clerk said she would upgrade us, but I don't know to what, since we reserved a 1 bedroom suite and that is what we got, but it was a very small one! When we went in, the bedroom light was burned out and the tv remote would not work, but they fixed those problems soon after I let them know.The diverter in the tub/shower was broken, which I found out by turning on the water, expecting it to come out the spigot; instead it came out the shower head! What a wake up that was with the water still being cold! They advertised having high speed wireless access, but it was not working and even when asked would not give any credit for that. When I opened the oven up, I found a very nasty broiler pan that looked like it had not been washed after someone cooked some steak a long time ago. I guess the maids don't bother to check such things. Makes me wonder what else they don't check!We were on the 2nd floor near the elevator, which worked fine going up, but if you wanted to go down from 2, you had to push the up button to get the thing to come up! I used the stairs instead most of the time.If nothing else was available, it would be ok.

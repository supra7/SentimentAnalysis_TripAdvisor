We stayed here in early October for two nights in the ocean tower with a full ocean view. Even though the room was free using SPG points, my wife and I still feel ripped off. The few positives include: - easy access to lahaina with free shuttle access. The shuttle driver is one of the few employees that actually provided good service - next door to whalers village. We love the poke tacos at hula grill! Everything else about the hotel was a disappointment including: - paper thin walls. I could hear the neighbor snoring all night - the hotel is very understaffed. It took 15+ minutes to buy a cup of coffee, we did not get a lei greeting upon arrival, and the front desk would take over a minute to answer the phone - the rooms are small, dirty and in disrepair. Stains are all over the room, our balcony table was cracked, the bed resembled a canoe and the ac constantly cycles on and off every minute. - poor treatment for spg members. This is the first westin that has denied a late checkout request even though it is one of our gold benefits. In summary, if you are used to a high quality westin experience stay away less you will be disappointed. . -

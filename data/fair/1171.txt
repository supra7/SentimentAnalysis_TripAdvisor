We were very disappointed and would not stay at Parrot Key again. As regular visitors to Key West, we thought we would try something different but felt we made a huge mistake. Positives: beautiful grounds, nice pools, relaxing atmosphere, very clean, great beds, nice accoutrements, select front desk staff are awesome, Jeanie at the bar is great Negatives: restaurant has limited hours and very limited selection, very limited parking, no smoking anywhere on premises, front desk not responsive to requests(needed toilet paper and had to go get it myself), front desk worker made a horrible recommendation for an electric car company that another front desk worker said "she would NEVER have recommended", housekeeping is very inconsistent(they came one day at 5:30 when we were getting ready for dinner - a little late), one of the servers at the restaraunt was horrible, the hotel is too far from everything, the "resort fee" is quite baffling, there were no throw rugs(nice to have a spot to catch the sand), there are no windows in the workout facility, it's too far from the action In a nutshell, it's just a bizarre place. The inconsistencies made me think that there is either poor management or they just haven't quite gotten it together yet. I am generally easy to please, but I was disappointed. Difficult for me to understand the rave reviews because we spoke with other folks staying at Parrot Key and one was moving to another hotel and the other couple was just passively disappointed like my husband and I. Parrot Key has potential, but I will choose differently nexy time.

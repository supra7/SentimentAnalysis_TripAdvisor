I am a HIlton Honors member and have stayed at many Hampton & Hilton properties. After I arrived at the Las Vegas Airport Hampton and pulled back the bedsheets, I found numerous long black hairs on the sheets. I'm not a complainer, so I waited until the morning to report this situation to the desk clerk in writing. Several weeks later I rec'd an e-mail asking how my stay was. Once again I reported the dirty bedding. Hampton is supposed to have a 100% satisfaction guarantee, and to date I have yet to get a reply of any sort from either the note I left with the desk clerk or the 15 min. long Hampton survey that I filled out online. It will be the last time I stay at this location and I will not suggest it to anyone I know. After staying at hundreds of Hampton Inn's, I am very disappointed with the non-response from Hilton.

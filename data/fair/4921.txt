Our room smelled so much of tobacco we asked right away to move. We were accommodated the next day, and the staff was cooperative. The rooms are very bare bones and the hotel is quite shabby. The rooms are clean. In the first room, the sink faucet did not dispense cold water. There's plenty of hot water however! The curtains in the second room did not work. Considering what hotels cost in Chicago, which is a bit of a mystery, more expensive than Washington, DC and several European cities, it's a reasonable alternative, but really way too worn. There's an excellent Italian restaurant, Gioco, within walking distance, and a Trader Joe. The restaurant next door isn't bad, but the service is slow. Yolk further on was much better. There are Michigan Avenue buses right outside and views of the Field Museum. It's an OK location if you're not looking for night life. Taxis are also very expensive. I'm giving the hotel two stars because the staff tried to be helpful. But did that room stink! And I have a $25 charge I have to dispute. There's no refrigerator so no bar charges.

Attentive lobby staff and courteous employees--to a fault. Good location if you are travelling from abroad. However, the hotel floor I am on (fifth floor) reeks of sweat. The rooms are sad and tired... this place hasn't been painted in years and years and there are pock marks and scratches on all of the walls, all of the fixtures, the bathrooms are clean but the equipment itself is tired, old, and worn out. The bed sheets were eminently adequate. This is supposedly a boutique property. It isn't. It has a wishful thinking mentality within the Chatwal family of hotels and it either needs to be sold to kinder, mor caring owners, or it needs to get an injection of cash for a major refurbishment. At $250 per night this is hardly a bargain given what one gets. Especially because the room is just depressing. I can totally see someone having a breakdown of sorts here. EVERY wall in my suite is blank--both in the sitting room and in the actual bedroom. But for a TV that is plasma this could be a fleabag motel on 11th avenue. And the furniture, though perhaps sleek in its first three years of use, is seriously in need of replacement. Overall two thumbs down. This property is part of the "Preferred" Family of hotels. It doesn't deserve to be. I came for a boutique hotel and I got the Howard Johnson's motel--without the car.

Its cool that the hotel is built on a pier but you only know that if you agree to pay an extra 50$ per night to get a water facing room. There is not much of a common area, no pool, no spa, no nothing (no basic stuff u d expect at a 4 star hotel). Over all the interior feels like you are in an old cruise ship. The passages are dark and narrow, rooms really small. The decor is like an old lodge (to make you feel like you are staying in a small family owned motel.) The bathrooms are very small but nicely redone (with contemporary fixtures that obviously dont match the rest of the lodge decor.) I was also disappointed with room service. we ordered for breakfast and requested for extra sweetener and creamer ( as we had run out of the provided 2 sachets of sugar and 2 equal sachets the previous day). The breakfast arrived after 45 mins. They brought us creamer but forgot the sweetener. I called room service again but they said it would take another 30 mins to 45 mins. I requested for bringing it asap and followed up with another phone call but the sweetner NEVER arrived and I could not even get a cup of my morning coffee! They tend to cut costs on moisturizer, toothpastes, etc as they donot provide them even on request! They were kind enough to provide towels and shampoo conditioner! The bed was old with loose springs - I felt I was jumping up and down the entire night! The business center of a 4 star hotel was a tiny tiny room with 2 computers and a broken printer!

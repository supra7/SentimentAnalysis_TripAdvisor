The suite we had was just OK for $ 500.00 per nite. Should have stayed at the Four Seasons, but this hotel was written up as a great hotel and our family that lives in Seattle thought it would be nicer than it was. Front desk staff did not know directions to hotel. Wait staff in restaurant was rude and we had 2 middle age children with us and we asked about different options for them and her reply was " We don;t get many families here with children! so there are no other options." Also bell desk was annoyed when one of our parties was lost and kept asking where he should be going.

Definitely NOT what I expected, rooms are small and cramped, Bathroom was not cleaned very well as there was some gross hair balls on floor and scum/filth on tile floor in bathroom. If you want WiFi for business forget it! unless you want to pay $12.50 per day to use something that should be a free.its NOT the money but the principle of cheapness! Staff was actually very courteous and nice at the Bost Park Plaza and beds were comfortable and plush. I checked out and went to Seaport Hotel and I am so happy I switched. They had Very, clean rooms, incredibly comfortable beds, free WiFi, awesome location, and great atmosphere. If you actually read this take my word for it and pass on Boston Park Plaza unless your a history buff and want to stay just so you can say you stayed there.

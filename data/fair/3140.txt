OK Hotel - but old and run down When we pulled up the valet said that parking was $35 a day for valet or $25 for the parking garage. We arrived at the hotel at noon and were told our room was not ready yet but that we could check our bags and go use the pool and beach. When we wanted to get a parking ticket from the front desk we were informed that the parking garage was full and that they only have limited spots and that we would have to pay the $35 for valet. I thought this was shady and that we should have gotten valet for $25 since the garage was full.We were given a couple 2 for 1 drink coupons for our room not being ready yet. When we tried to use them back at the pool bar for 2 Coronas that they had already opened and poured, we were told that the coupons were only for domestic bears and frozen drinks event though there were absolutely no limitations on the coupon. So $14 for 2 beers - CRAZY!!!!The beach area was very nice and the hotel is in a good location. The pool was small with limited seating but nice.The rooms were definitely old and run down, but for the price we paid, they were fine.

We booked 3 nights at the hotel and was given an upgrade to a 2 bathroom suite the hotel was beautiful, Hilton should be given a metal for restoring this to its former beauty, but should reconsider how they treat customers. After the first night in the room we were rudely awaken by banging on the door. Please know that the do not disturb sign was on the door. The house keeper handed me the sign and asked if she could clean the room. After slamming the door in her face and contacting the front desk and advising what had happened. They advised they were extremely sorry and would correct the problem, which they did for about 4 hours. Then someone came up and told us that the hotel tower was closed and we were not allowed to be there, after contacting the front desk they advised that was there mistake and would move us to the other tower. So for our inconvience they down graded our room, and when the front desk manager came out, she was extremely rude. Being a Diamond memeber with Hilton and having received some of the best service at hotels in there company I was shocked that they would hire someone this poor at customer service to run there flag ship hotels. The hotel is beautiful and a must see, but I would pass on giving them my money again. The restaurant inside the hotel are ok, the room service was exceptional. Truffle oil french fries were out of this world.

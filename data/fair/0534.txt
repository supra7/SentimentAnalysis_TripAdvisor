My best friend and I were coming to Seattle for my birthday, and wanted to stay someplace really nice. I thought I would save a few bucks instead of stay at the Hotel 1000 or the Alexis, just to have extra spending money. Boy, do I regret that decision. The staff was snobby, and completly self focused. The room was alright. It was NOT worth the $260 we paid though. The bathroom was crowded and grimey. We had like a yard sale quality iron and ironing board. It was just a bid disappointment all in all. Though I will give them credit, the beds are comfortable, and the lobby is nice. Thats all I can say about the W.

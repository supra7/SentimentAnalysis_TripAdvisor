Good location but dowdy hotel and unfriendly staff The location is the only good about that hotel, all main attractions of South Beach are within walking distance. The hotel is very old and has not been renovated since it was built in the 30ies (at least it doesn't seem to be). Everything is a bit dowdy and the staff is really unfriendly. The rooms are quite ok and clean but it is not possible to open any window. Beware that the hotel is very noisy, we didn't find any sleep the first night because of machines located on the same floor and neighbours coming home very late at night. The hotel is a good bargain if you want to stay right on Collins Avenue, it has a good location and is located right next to the fancy hotels like the Delano. Still, there are much nicer hotels for the same price, we compared prices and there are some small Hotels on Ocean Drive for the same price that look much nicer.Don't eat breakfast at the hotel, it is absolutely overprized. Even on Ocean Drive breakfast is cheaper and you get better things.

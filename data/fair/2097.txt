I recently stayed at this hotel for a business conference and was alarmed at the level of concern for safety at this hotel. Upon checking in at 11pm, I went to the room that they hotel staff had assigned me to. After entering the room, I noticed that there was a room service tray on the desk. I then looked at saw a roomkey holder on the bed. They had given me keys to someone else's room! When I went down to the registration desk to inform them of this, the staff member did not apologize but instead asked me if I was sure about what I had seen. Finally he gave me a key to another room that thankfully was unoccupied. Definitely make sure you lock both deadbolts if you stay in this hotel. This hotel is in a great location and has an amazingly beautiful lobby and ballroom space. While the room is in a great location, I was expecting a little more in the room based on the price we paid. I know this is a historic city, so the the size of the room did not bother me. However, I was amazed that my room did not look like it had been taken care of/updated in several years as the bathroom still had old tile, the floor boards were missing paint chips, etc.

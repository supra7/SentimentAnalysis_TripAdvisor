My husband and I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton from April 23 - April 29th. I was excited to be staying at my first Ritz. However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. Upon entering our room, we were overcome by an awful musty odor. The decor was not only terribly dated, but dirty as well. The carpet was stained and faded. I heard the hotel is going to be closing for renovations and none to soon. The staff and the service were a huge disappointment. We would come back from excursions at 3:00 p.m., in the afternoon to find our room had not been cleaned. When the room was cleaned, the trash was not emptied or the bed was made, but the bed spread was lying in a wad on the floor. I had to ask two days in a row for wash cloths. They had our check out date wrong and we had to call twice and then go to the front desk to finally get it fixed. Upon leaving, we phoned the bellman and asked that they come up to get our luggage. After 20 minutes, no one had showed and we ended up dragging our luggage down ourselves because we were afraid we were going to miss our shuttle. The grounds are nice, the pool and beach are lovely, but the rooms and the staff are awful. My husband and I have traveled all over the world and we were dumbfounded by the treatment we received at this supposedly five star hotel. Save your money and stay somewhere else!!!!

We went to go see the Toulouse Lautrec exhibit. Got a package through the hotel which was nice of them to offer (on the club level). The club level was nice, but some of the guests of the club level appeared not to be the same calibre as most - it was weird. Nice hotel, but not spectacular. View from room was okay, not great. I also called the concierge in advance and bought expensive tickets to a Cubs game through the hotels suggested broker. We got the tickets just fine, with a nice typed letter, etc. But, when we went to the game we were told that the game time had been moved and that we completely missed the game. I tried to approach the management about this, since being from out of town, not sure how we would have known this, and I got back a typed note with misspelled words in it - and nothing else - basically just - it's not our fault. Poor customer service.

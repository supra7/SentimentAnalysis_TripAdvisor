I got married quietly in a nearby winery and decided to bring a few friends to this restaurant to celebrate. Most of the staff were snobbish, especially the restaurant receptionist. The valets were impolite. The tasting menu is okay, but not worth the price. The service is slow. And the prices on the wine list were very overpriced, for example, a bottle of red Coppola which is normally $35 is almost $200. I would advise that you bring your own bottles and pay the corkage. The average bottle of wine is $400-600. Finally, the bill took forever to come. This dinner was the black spot on my wedding day. They didn't make it special at all. Skip the restaurant. I really regret booking here. They ruined my evening.

I usually stay at the Golden Nugget when I stay at Downtown Las Vegas. The service there has gone so far down( see my review Aug 2010) I decided to go some where else this trip. I chose the Freemont because the rooms were renovated, it is on Fremont Street and the price was decent. The staff was excellent. This is one area where the Fremont does well. When I checked in I had a room which faced the Fremont Experience. The room was noisy. I went back to the front desk and Melissa changed my room without a problem. The room which was a non smoking room smelled with old cigarette smoke. We travel with coffee packs and placed them on the A/C which helped somewhat. The bed felt damp which we assumed was from the sheets not being throughly dried. The room although away from the crowd of Fremont Street was still noisy. We bought ear plugs at a local Walmart. The brunch buffet was good and I have to thank Ramon for keeping the champagne flowing. Despite the great staff I will probably not be going back due to the room size and the 10 channels that are only available on the TV. How can a hotel in this day and age not have cable? I will probably stay a a sister hotel Main Street Station or the Plaza which is going through a complete renovation. Too bad the rooms can't ne as good as the staff.

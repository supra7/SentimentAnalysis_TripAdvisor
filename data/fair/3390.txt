Nice hotel, at this price. First room offered was a single (that claimed to be a double). I could not see two 200lb people getiing into the bed. They changed our room for a better one. Main problem was the buiding work going on inside the hotel. They had completed the restyling of first four or five floors, but the work was still going on as we could see every day. Men carrying plaster board in the lifts and old units out meaning that only one of the two lifts was available most of the time. Place was dusty desoite the constant effort of the staff. Should be OK soon, I hope,

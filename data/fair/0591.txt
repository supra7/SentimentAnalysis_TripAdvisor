I stayed a handful of nights at the Roosevelt last month, and aside from its location close to the conference center and within easy walk of most of downtown, I would likely not bother staying again. The desk staff weren't at all impolite when we arrived, but I had a palpable sense of being sized up and found wanting. So it was that we were given a room next to the elevator (not noisy, as it turned out, but still) and overlooking the inner roof and vents. No view to speak of. It was a dark room, and oddly laid out. The bathroom was an unremarkable size, but had very little counter space for two men to set out shaving gear. The decor and furbishings were too dark for how little light came into the room, and they were not all that stylish. The beds were overly soft. I found myself slipping down to one side of the mattress each night as well. I was also dismayed to have to pay for Internet connection in the room. Given the likely great number of conference attendees who stay, the hotel should provide connections at no charge. The location sells the hotel, but even then, many other hotels are not much farther for walking to the conference center. We had no problems at the hotel that merited complaints to the desk, but it was below average accommodation for the accumulation of smaller things.

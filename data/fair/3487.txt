This is not a typical hotel room. We stayed in a suite since there were three of us. Here are the issues we had: 1.The sofa beds are horrible and we had to ask someone to come up at 11pm to make the sofa bed up. 2. Remote control on TV's didn't work even after telling the front desk about it. 3. Luggage took 45 minutes to get to tthe room. 4. No ipod/MP3 hook up to the Bose system as advertised on their website. When I asked about it there was no apology and a denial that the website indicated such. 5. Hallways are very dark. 5. No dressers - just a closet and a leaning ladder rack. 6. Lack of character - tried to be minimalist, but the place comes off very cold and uninviting. Good things: 1. Very spacious rooms. 2. Great amenities and space in the bathrooms. 3.Good lighting. 4.Starbucks on the corner. 5. Great location - two blocks from the NWRQ line. Probably would not stay here again.

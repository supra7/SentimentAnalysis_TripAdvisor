It's just sad to watch it happen. A hotel with a great staff and great location is slowly, slowly declining. The Hotel used to be the highlight of several trips a year for us. Lauren Bacall taught one of my daughters to swim in the pool, Brendan Fraser charmed my kids with some of his wedding cake, and Reese Witherspoon helped me find a watch we lost by the pool. Today, the property starts to feel musty and neglected despite the terrific staff (some of whom we've know for over 20 years). The coveted north wing rooms with their own parking are no longer - cranky furniture, just plain weird bathrooms, and smokey fireplaces aren't kept up. The once plush cottages and beautiful grounds are running down - the jarring mixture of extraordinary plush and cut corners starts to grate on us at over $1000 per night. Musty old Reagan-era types get a smart salute from the Manager and Kathleen Turner's natural underarms flow in the bar while civilians get sniffy treatment from the newer staff members who just don't have the grace of the good old days - like 2005. If there was one place that should be able to deliver on luxury and coddling, it should be the Bel Air. It just isn't cutting it.

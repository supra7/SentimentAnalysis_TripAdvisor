It was the afternoon before Christmas day, we arrived an hour early around 2:00 PM and they could not give us a room, could not let us go into a room in the process of cleaning, so my wife and daughter became ill during the wait. I asked the desk clerk to speak to the manager, I was told he was too busy! I finally got into a room around 5:00 PM. I have had better service at a Motel 6. Never, ever coming back to this hotel. They definitely need a new hotel manager. I will be writing directly to Westin Corporate to voice my views.

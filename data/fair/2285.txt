I selected this hotel because there was a shortage of rooms in Boston this particular evening and I was visiting a relative in a hospital. I had reserved a king bed and was told that had been given to someone else, so I got a room with 2 full beds. Not a problem. After ordering room service for dinner, I went to bed as I'd traveled all day and had been at the hospital. The TV which I wanted to watch in bed, was not working. I called Front Desk but didn't want anyone to come up at 11pm to check the TV, so I turned in. I was asked if I wanted the key to the mini refrigerator, which I accepted. The key didn't work. The bathroom overall was fairly clean, with the exception of moldy silcone around the basin and some "personal hair" (not from anyone's head) in the sink and toilet. The carpet in the room looked really dirty--I wore socks. The internet connection cost around $13.00 per day. Fortunately I was there for only one day. I got lost on my way in and when I called, whomever answered didn't seem familiar with Boston at all. For what I needed--a place to sleep after a stressful day--it fit the bill. I'm glad I was not there on leisure because I would have felt ripped off.

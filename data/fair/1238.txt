At the Front Desk during check-in, the desk clerk and another Marriott official were discussing the wet carpet, musty smell,and "sub-standard" condition in the room. He said that it was due to hurricaine Irene. The desk clerk said that the room we were to receive had a leaky air conditioning unit. Next we were told they did not have the complimentary 7 days of parking that was advertised on the web site, but that we had to pay to leave our car. Funny, I saw these same complaints on other reviews (except that the wet carpet was due to recent shampooing).

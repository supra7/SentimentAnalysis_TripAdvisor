A 3-star hotel with 4-star aspirations. I booked through Hotels.com and got a nice view room on the 31st floor. Problem was, from 5 am until 10 am, whenever an adjacent room turned on their plumbing, I heard loud knocking (read "wake you up" loud). When I complained to the front desk manager, he condescendingly explained that all hotels had noisy plumbing. WTF! Got moved to another room. Won't be coming back here. Also, a longer walk to the Mag Mile shops than I had thought.

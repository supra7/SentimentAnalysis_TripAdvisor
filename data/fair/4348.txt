Too noisy Just got back from the Casablanca and I was not impressed at all. The location is just 20 yards from Time Square ( the Oxford Street of New York). Fine it you want to be in the thick of things but can be (is) very busy.The staff are welcoming, helpful and efficient. The room we had though was not up to scratch. It was one of the larger rooms with 2 x double beds, but it was located at the back of the Hotel. Therefore it was situated by the very noisy air conditioning fans from the other buildings around and about. It also suffered from no natural light at all. I would suspect that most of the rooms to the rear of the hotel also suffered the same problems. The only way we could get to sleep was to shut off our own air conditioning and close all the windows. \we had to rely on the ceiling fan to provide any cooling at all.

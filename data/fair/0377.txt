The Edgewater is a sweet little lodge. It has beautiful views of the Sound, and a great spot right on the water. I did not find it hard to walk or take a short taxi to downtown Seattle. The decor is lodge-y: exposed beams, big armchairs, river-rock fireplaces. I was in Seattle on business, but felt like I should be heading out for a day of skiing when I left the Edgewater every morning. The big problem: my room was literally freezing. A maid informed me that the hotel does not turn on the heating system until it reaches a certain temperature outside. When I stayed there it must have been in the 40s--brrrr. But managemnt did not think it was cold enough to turn on the heat. There was a fireplace in the room, but it took hous for that to heat the room. In the meantime I sat there with my jacket and hat on. The first night I was so cold that I left and went to my boyfriend's hotel (he happened to be in Seattle on business at the same time as me). The other thing abouit the fireplace is that you have to press the re-start button every hour for it to work, and so there was no heat in the room during the night, unless you want to get up every hour and press the button. It was SO cold in the mornings. I would not stay in the Edgewater during the winter months. Summer would be much better. I had a priceline deal for $150 per night. Which would be a steal for that room in the summer. As I stayed in the winter, it was totally inhospitable.

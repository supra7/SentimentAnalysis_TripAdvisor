We picked up this hotel based on the price and the location ( subway station just outside the entrance ), but had we known there was no lift would propably had picked up another one. The rooms were tidy, but REALLY small, they look a lot bogger on the hotels web page. Staff was very friendly and helpful and the lobby real nice. Wifi only worked in the lobby, not in the rooms. It was a BIG struggle to get in to our room, 4 th floor, no lift and very narrow and steep staircases. Our youngest children were 3 and 5 and we had 6 huge luggage ( a 4 week trip ), fortunately the staff helped us carry the luggage.

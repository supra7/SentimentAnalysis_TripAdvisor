We arrived Halloween evening and spent 3 nights in New York and the party in the lobby never seemed to end. We wished we had come down at 4 AM to see if the lounge emptied when we weren't looking! This did not make our room noisy but the lobby is not a restful refuge either. Because the room was a little warm, we left the window open a bit and I probably don't need to mention how noisy that was, even on the 11th floor. The room safe would not open and I was miffed that they would not fix that because they were going to renovate the room soon. The offer to store things in the front desk did not seem convenient and when one is paying over $450 a night for a room, expectations are raised. We were upgraded from a 'cozy room' and I went back down to the desk to confirm that as the room was so small. I have often stayed in larger rooms in Europe! Friendly service, clean rooms in good repair at a location that worked well for us, its just had to justify the value for the money.

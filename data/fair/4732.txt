My girlfriend and I just got back from staying in here and let me tell you the location is great! Half a block from Front street, which means easy access to the all the bars which is great late at night, no getting into your car after a few. However that is just about it. When we checked in we were told they didn't have the type of room we booked, all that was left in the price range we booked was a room with two twin beds that were too heavy to move. So we paid to upgrade to a double bed in a very tiny room. We were also told we could park in a lot just up the street. Great except they didn't tell us we were going to be paying for it. Not that 7 bucks a day is bad in Lahaina but it would have been nice to know upfront. Over all if you don't care about having a small dank feeling room this is a good place to stay. (please read as: if you are never going to be in your room than this is a good place to stay) If you want some alone time or if you go out late and want to sleep past 6 than I would find a nicer place to stay.

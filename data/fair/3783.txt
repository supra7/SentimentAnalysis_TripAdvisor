The Arizona Grand is no resort. Average rooms with poor amenities. A washroom so small you need to open the door to turn around. Dirty pool and dusty unkept common areas. The real problem is no one seems to care. The focus of the hotel seems to be the corporate client including weddings, meetings and time share. The hotel guest is treated as an inconvenience to the staff. There is a $30 daily resort fee which doesn't include internet. The water park was opened for only 5 hours per day on the weekend. Of course private parties could rent is all night, but not for guests. Breakfast at the hotel is around $12 for eggs and $4 for coffee. Really?? We almost hit or got hit by the golf carts that tear around the resort day and evening. Won't be back.

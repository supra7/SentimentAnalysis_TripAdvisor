The Maui Sheraton is in a good location, however the property is in desperate need of a major renovation. Compared to neighboring hotels on the strip, the Sheraton's public areas are not beautiful or impressive, like the Hyatt or Westin nearby. The property is large. If you are in a bldg 6 room, you must take multple stairs / elevators-- a real hassle. The people were friendly. Service was 'Just OK'. Would stay somewhere else next time.

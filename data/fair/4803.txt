Though this was a rather pretty hotel, with plush beds and modern baths, there was serious oversight with the staff. When I checked in I was given a key to a room that was still occupied. I do not mean that house keeping had yet to come, I mean that the previous guest had yet to vacate. I do not understand how this happened, and my questions through the hotel's website go unanswered. I was honestly uneasy staying there. If they could so easily issue me a key to another guest's room what was stopping them from giving the key to my room away. I expect such antics from a hostel, not from a well appointed hotel. I also expect management to respond to such serious issues.

My father was in HUP for an emergency double bypass, and after spending two nights in the SICU family room, we decided to stay the night at the hotel. The price is disgustingly outrageous for what you get.. $145.00 a night. And thats the HUP discount  rate. This doesnt include parking. The rooms are extremely basic. Two double beds are all they have. Theres no room service, however there is an extremely overpriced sandwich shop on the ground floor if you really get hungry, or McDonalds across the street. No vending machine or ice machine on the floor I was on, despite the ice bucket that was provided to us. The bathrooms are very small and not very clean, with a half used roll of toilet paper on the dispenser, and only hand towels on the bath rack for use. The room also smelled strange, like body odor. The staff was pleasant, however I had to go back two times because the key card didnt work, quite nerve wracking after all day worrying at the hospital to come home to not being able to get in. The one saving grace was the absolutely stunning view of the city and University stadium. We ended up checking out after only one night and staying in the family room the rest of the time. All and all, this hotel should be ashamed of itself for the price gouging of visitors and family members of people in the hospital.

This is the second I have stayed here - this time for 4 nights. The location is great and the rooms are tidy and clean. Just beware if you are claiming the AAA discount. I am a NRMA member and was entitled to the AAA discount and they refused to honour it despite numerous calls and faxes from NRMA and AAA. In the end we gave up despite having to pay an extra $160 US.

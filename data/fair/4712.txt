We may have made the mistake of visiting Maui during 4th of July week, but we found the Sheraton to have quite poor service. Food service was slow, concierge service was slow, front desk service was slow, valet service took 10-15 rings before answering calls. Cleaning service was non-existent one day. Staff never came to the room to collect towels or make the bed! We did not feel that we received our money's worth at this hotel. As indicated in other posts, the pool chairs were all occupied by 9am, Black Rock beach was full by 10am. It felt like you were always fighting crowds within the resort, and this was supposed to be a vacation! The gym is also quite dilapidated. Also note that they brag about the '3 resorts in 1' deals with the Westin and Marriott down the shore. But the only 'privelage' you have with this deal is that they will allow you to charge your room for any meals or service charges you incur at these other hotels. You are NOT able to use their pools or fitness centers. The Westin fitness center charges an extra $15/day for usage. On the positive side, you really can't beat this location, especially if you enjoy snorkeling. The rooms were well appointed (bed quite comfortable) and the patios had nice views. I'm sure this hotel would be adequate for families. For couples looking for a romantic, quiet getaway, I would recommend Wailea, not Kaanapali. We visited the Grand Wailea - it was beautiful. We had dinner there as well, service and quality was outstanding.

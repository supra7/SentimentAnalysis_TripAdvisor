this hotel is very basic it is ideal for someone who just wants somewhere to sleep in and will be out all day the facilities are none existent you cant even make a drink in your room as they dont even supply a kettle, you have to ask to borrow an iron ,and the rooms are small even the delux which we had only had a bed a bedside table on one side and a tv mounted on the wall it was on suite and clean in the rooms but the stairs are a killer, the paintwork and carpets are ancient, it is handy for the subway into thecity centre, it is quite a way from all the sights

Rooms are nice, location could be better (the hotel is just outside the Strip), general atmosphere has absolutely no WOW-factor (unlike most of Vegas luxury hotels) and the service is terrible. One day there was a strong wind, which was after a while followed by stormy rain - but nobody from the pool staff bothered to take inside small objects from the pool area. After the rain was over for the next two hours all those towels, pillows and chairs were still floating in the pool... Another day there was a fire alarm in the building - so all guests were evacuated though emergency stairs. Guess what we saw when we left the building through the emrgency exit- in the lobby people were checking in, the restaurants were serving breakfast and the staff said they had no clue about the evacuation... And talking about theft in the hotel. Once I left a piece of jewelry in the pocket of a bathrobe - to find that bathrobe was replaced (and the jewelry was never found - surprise surprise). Stay away from this place - there are other hotels in Vegas which are truely great, cool and friendly.

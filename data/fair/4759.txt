This place sucks. A/C doesn't work in room. Sweating like a pig right now. The food at one restaurant was pathetic. Mahi Mahi on pasta... the fish was dry and way WAY overcooked, rotini noodles with crappy sauce and pretty much tasteless. The service is okay - the staff tries to be attentive and help you with what they can, which ain't much as it turns out. AVOID. John

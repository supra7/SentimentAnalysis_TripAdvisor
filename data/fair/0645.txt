We stayed here two nights because it was convenient to be close to the airport. The hotel claims to be one of the quietest near the airport, but I can't imagine how this is possible. The first night I heard every plane and car go by, and the people in the room next door. But on the bright side, the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. We didn't try the free breakfast, but it looked like they had a lot of good stuff. I peeked into the fitness room, it was very tiny with one treadmill, one bike, one elliptical, and some weights.

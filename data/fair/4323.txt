Just OK We booked a deluxe King at the Omni. The room was tiny, I mean tiny. The room did not have a closet. Clothing was to be stored in the armoire which was fine except when the doors of the armoire were open you could not get around the bed. Also, if you used the footstool for the casual chair then once again you could not move around the room. After checking in the front desk called to ask how we liked the room. I told them it was unusually small...I was told that all of the deluxe King's have that configuration and oh well. The stopper in the bathtub did not work, the sink faucet was so jiggly that it rotated. The carpet had a major black stain in the center. I'm not sure what is going on in what used to be a lovely hotel.

I stayed at this Westin once before in 2004 when budget was not an issue and I found it acceptable enough to give it another try. What I experienced on the second stay has forced me turn my back and I never again plan to rest my head at this Westin. The issue--structural age of the two towers built in 1982 and interior age of the rooms no longer make it a viable option for the going rate (min $240 USD). On Nov, 11th and 12th the Northwest U.S. and Canada experienced the strongest windstorms of 2007. I acknowledge that I may be writing this review in bad timing since I was present on the 21st floor of the N tower during those two days. Either way, many guests-including myself-experienced a long restless night of a creaking wood structure and wind whistling through poorly sealed windows. Many reviews of this hotel note the same point--the age of the towers, rooms and amenities should be addressed and I'm certain that Westin will either invest in a major structural retrofitting or sell the property to avoid a much needed upgrading. The Westin Workout room by the pool is small and is comprised of 3 bike machines and a Core workout ball.

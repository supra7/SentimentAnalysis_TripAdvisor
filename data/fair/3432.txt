I was very disappointed in this hotel. It had been getting some good press and I expected it to be nice. The room was clean and the location was good for me but the floor my room was on was noisy all night long and the room was very dark. The desk staff was unhelpful and unsympathetic. The room was not a good value. I've stayed in other New York City hotels at the same rate and been much more satisfied. I decided to give this one a try based on its reviews. If I had wanted to be kept awake all night long by loud partying I could have rented a dorm room for a lot less money.

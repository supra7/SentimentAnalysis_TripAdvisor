We were lodged at the Renaissance through a bid on Priceline and reside locally in Seattle. We were assigned a room with an adjoining door to the next room--we assumed no one was in that room. Wrong! We could hear everything that was happening 'next' door--in this case there was a young excited child -- making sleep difficult (at best) and taking away any chance of a restful stay for us. The room needed a boost in temperature so we turned on the heater/AC system--we felt like we were on the runway of a major airport---extremely LOUD in room heater--not 4 star quality!!! The staff do as best they can, but one has to wonder what management is thinking when they cluster people in rooms that make sleeping impossible-in a hotel that was no where near capacity. The remodeling and updating appears to all be superficial, as the experience was less than satisfactory. I spoke to the front desk, and they felt that when the neighbor checked out--everything would be fine. True, except why were we assigned a room like this to begin with? This is the first time I've felt like a second class citizen at a hotel--and it happened in Seattle at the Renaissance.

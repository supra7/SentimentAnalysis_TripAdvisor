We booked Priceline $58/night and it seemed like a great deal. We did not expect all the upcharges being so far away from downtown. $16 parking was extremely excessive especially when this is a location where land is abundent and cheap. I've paid less in downtown Seattle. $9.95 Internet chage is expected at a full-service hotel, but this hotel did not seem to be full-service. Pool and hot tub were out of service. Nothing is convenient, you have to drive far for good restaurants and amenities. Pros: - Near airport (great if you are catching a flight) - Nice business amenities (if you are there for a conference) - Clean rooms Cons: - Very expensive parking - Not convenient location unless you are going to the airport - No pool/hot tub in service, they are being torn up - medicore service

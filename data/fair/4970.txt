I booked thru hotwire for 100, where you don't see the hotel. Bad idea! Customer service agent wasn't so nice at all, tried to be friendly to her (Yana) not happening.. I get to my room, Ned skirt dirty with white stains and ripped at the bottom. the chairs had Nasty dirty stains looked like urine and they were torn. The old zenith tv from when I was born in the 80s, had stains around the frame, the cabinet it was in one door was falling or leaning the hinge was broken and the other door had the knob to open cabinet missing. I understand historical, maybe that's why the furnitures wood was chipped. The bed had a mink cover to hide the rips and tears on the blanket, and not sure what else was meant to cover the tears on the sheets and a stain on sheet.. Ugh.. I'm thinking the plush pad was nice or was it one of those covers to so bed bugs can't get on top.. I didn't see any and don't plan on it cuz I'm checking out.. The bed shirt was ripped and had white stains that looked like they could have been easily washed out. The bathroom was the only decent thing, for the 1/2 I'm here I was ok sitting in there. It's like a closet tho, the toilet was right next to tub, no space between shower n toilet. If your claustrophobic don't go in there altho it's the nicest thing I saw so far.. For the price, not a good deal!!

Do not stay at this hotel expecting the level of service you might receive at other W hotels, or even at a Motel 6. While the room and facilities were fine, the service was, to put it mildly, abysmal. At 9 am each day, you can hear the person responsible for the mini bar knocking on each door, loudly announcing "MINI BAR," slamming doors, and chatting with the housekeeping staff. Each day of a 4 day stay, I was asked by the housekeeping staff "checking out today?" When I said no, I was asked when my partner would be leaving the room for it to be cleaned. An answer of "10 minutes" was routinely greeted by a sigh and rolling of the eyes. A request to change rooms, which was confirmed by the front desk, and by phone the day of, was not honored. Apparently there was a miscommunication among the staff. When I confronted the manager about it, I was treated to significant amounts of "corporate speak" in which I was informed that I had met "challenges" during my stay. I didn't meet "challenges;" the hotel made "mistakes." While the manager tried to make things better, a $50 voucher for breakfast doesn't do much good when breakfast for two is over $60. The coup d grace came a week later when two separate sets of letters and DVDs failed to make it to their recipients. A call to the hotel simply elicited the response "we deliver all mail to the post office, we're not responsible for what happens to it after that." Amazingly, after 5 years of Netflix, this would be the one time that the post office misplaced 3 separate DVDs. This level of service is not indicative of W hotels in general, which have been great. In terms of rooms, you should request a room on a renovated floor. The unrenovated floors, on which I stayed, are decorated, as a nice Texan on the elevator put it: "as if by some housewife who picked up some stuff at Target."

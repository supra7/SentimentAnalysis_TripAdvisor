The only reason I gave it even a "2" rating is because of the excellent location and Dolores at breakfast. We loved being in a nice area and within walking distance to everything. If we had a different room it might have been better, but we had a tiny inside room with a tiny bathroom. We reserved a rollaway bed but were told on arrival that our room couldn't have a rollaway -- only after demanding a different room was the rollaway delivered, and the employee who brought it was quite surly. Other than repeatedly pitching her favorite tours, the desk attendant our first day was uninterested in helping. Not many amenities here, although the price was $219+. Courtyard was pretty but full of biting insects. 10.19.04

Sadly disappointed in this hotel. The conference I attended was in the hotel. In three meals, not once did they serve coffee although the cups were there. Food was barely edible. Front desk staff were surly; wait staff provided very poor service. Rooms were very average at best, slightly run-down. Business centre was very expensive as was print service. WIll not return.

Stayed at the Higland Gardens for five nights in August with our two children. The location is fantastic for that part of town (two blocks from the Chinese theatre, Kodak theatre, Hollywood walk of fame etc. It's also within easy reach of Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Westwood and Santa Monica. However, the hotel's not great and although we'd emailed prior to our visit and asked for a renovated room we never received a reply. It may have been because the better rooms cannot accommodate four people. On arrival our room smelled so bad that the children wouldn't even enter! We asked to change but they didn't have anything else. We had to buy a room spray and plug-in but they didn't make much difference. Although the room was probably clean it didn't feel it i.e. the carpet was stained and the bathroom was rusty all around the bath. Also they state that there are hairdryers in the room but you have to ask for one from reception. This isn't a problem as long as they haven't all been loaned out. One big plus was free parking and the staff were friendly. Also internet access in the lobby was very convienent. It was great having a laundry room too. Would I stay there again - probably not.

Musty, and damp hotel. The Seattle city jail is less than a block away. Need I say more? Staff was nice, but they were probably scared to go outside too. This hotel needs a overhaul. Stayed there only to capitalize on Marriott Rewards and save points. Stay at Hyatt folks. This is my 1st negative review.

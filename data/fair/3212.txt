I stayed at the Dauphine Orleans Hotel because of the generally good reviews I read on Orbitz, TripAdvisor etc. The location is great, smack right in the middle of the French Quarter, though the hotel is old and not gitzy, it is kept tidy and relatively clean. The French Quarter's known for its old buildings, so I took it in my stride when the bottom of the toilet's cracked and exposing some weird colorations. The porter's are friendly, manager's are fine, but I have a bad experience with a young guy behind the desk. Approaching him for help to look up my delayed flight time is met with reluctance and eventually no help. It was very bad attitude and I wonder why he's there.

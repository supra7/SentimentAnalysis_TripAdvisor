Ended up staying here a few years ago on business for 4 nights. I chose this hotel because I really wanted to stay in Manhattan, and it was the only hotel in Manhattan with room availability I could find the nights I needed it, that was within my company's reimbursement limit. This hotel has tons of potential - the rooms are nice, very large and well furnished, and the location is good. That's all for the positives. On the downside, the hotel was simply not well maintained. The carpet was dirty, and it was ripped where the cable to the TV was supposed to be running under the carpet. Looked like it had been that way for a long time. Similar situation in the hallways. The front desk / lobby area is a joke - its so small that if another party of 4 or 5 is coming or going at the same time, you'll feel cramped just trying to get in or out. I really felt claustrophobic there. To be fair, probably not untypical for many hotels in New York, but the other two I've stayed in didn't have this issue, at all. And the front "desk" isn't even one - there's a small office off the lobby, and the staff is in this office. There's a split door with a small shelf on top of the lower half. This is the "front desk".

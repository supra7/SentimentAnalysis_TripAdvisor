I stayed at this hotel for a conference. When I arrived at the hotel, the line to check in was almost to the entrance. I waited about 20 minutes. There were two people working at the front desk on the first day of check in for a major conference. During my stay, my coffee maker stopped working. It took two calls to get this replaced. Finally, when I checked out, my bill was incorrect. I had to get a manager, who was neither helpful, nor friendly. Despite the fact that I had a reservation code with my correct rate, the manager refused to look at this. I finally had to pull the conference organizer from his lunch to have the rate corrected by the manager. When I checked out, there was no apology for this inconvenience, nor thanks given for staying at the hotel. I would NEVER stay at this hotel again nor recommend anyone else to.

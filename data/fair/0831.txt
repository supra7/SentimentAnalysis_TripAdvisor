My partner and I were keen to stay at this hotel having looked at their website. We stayed in Rome for three nights on a two-week tour around Italy. The cinemusic hotel was the most disappointing. The rooms were very small and were meant to be sound proofed - they weren't we could hear noises in the corridor and in the street. There was very little room to hang up our clothes in the wardrobe. The bar was not in operation - when we asked about it we were told there wasn't any personnel. There was supposed to be a jacuzzi on the roof terrace and after a long hot day walking around Rome it would have been very welcome - but we were told they needed to clean it out and they didn't have the time. My partner wanted to change some traveller checks and was told he couldn't. I found the staff vert rude and unhelpful compared to the other hotels we stayed in during our Italian tour. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!

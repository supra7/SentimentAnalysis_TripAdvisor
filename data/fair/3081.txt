My husband, my baby, and I spent 5 nights at this hotel in May 2008. We thought the lobby, beach, pool, and location were outstanding. When we got up to our room, a felt like I took at trip back to the 1970s. The room needed some serious updating. The carpets, wallpaper, curtains, counters were really worn down. The glass patio table on the balcony was broken in numerous areas. The glass bathroom lamp had a crack that went all the way through. There was dirt on the chairs and tables. I couldn't believe that this room belonged to such a well renowned hotel. I went down to the front desk, the representative assured me that the broken glass on the patio table and bathroom lamp would be fixed. It didn't get fixed until I complained again 2 days later. The overall character of the staff was a big disappointment as well. Any apology was insincere. On the last day we were told by the bellhop that we would be able to use the pool and then wash up in a room before we left. When we attempted this we were told that this was unavailable and had to change in the bathroom instead. again, this was met by a sour apology by the hotel manager who gave me her card and told me that she would "hook me up" next time i stayed at this hotel.

unpleasant We stayed at this hotel for seven nights in May. We found it to be an unpleasant stay, the rooms were v. small with no air conditioning and no closet, just a small cupboard. The bathroom was small with no window and poor ventilation. The towels and bedding were not changed regularly. A coffee maker was in the room, but no cups, coffee, paper etc. The reception was only available during the day and you had a key to let yourself into the hotel after 11pm. The breakfast was in the cafe / deli next door and was not varied in any shape or form- potato, eggs, toast or bagel and a drink. It was not pleasant and the best thing about it was the location, being very close to Chinatown and Union Square. Not sure why it is marketed as a 3*, should be a 2*, not recommended.

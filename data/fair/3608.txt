Just got back from a quick get-away to NYC and stayed at the W Hotel. There are many others in the same price range that are better. The hotel seemed to be more interested in pizzazz than function. The rooms were incredibly small - even for NYC. The air conditioning barely worked. And the room was dark. Would definitely skip this hotel.

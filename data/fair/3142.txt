Great Location Terrible Customer Service Stayed At the Marseilles for one night before our cruise. Here are the pros: Beach and boardwalk right out back of the hotel with a nice hammock area. Hotel is close to Lincoln Road and a 20 minute walk to Ocean Drive with many breakfast specials. It is also in an area of many higher priced hotels. Here are the cons: Hotel had a funky funny smell. The front desk staff was extremely rude and indifferent. It was the worst service I have ever experienced. The hotel also needed a good carpet cleaning job. If you wear white socks in your room they will be black. I will probably stay somewhere else next time.

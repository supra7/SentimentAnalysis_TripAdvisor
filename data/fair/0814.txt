The idea behind the resort is great: intimate resort with great dining. The good parts: Food at Sabores restaurant was excellent. Breakfast was great. The chef was very nice and had lots of great suggestions. They are happy to accommodate you and provide you with any food you would like to eat. Food was probably the best part. Lots of fresh fruit. The bad parts: - Reception took forever to bring luggage to peoples' rooms so that guests eventually had to get luggage themselves. - Rooms are dark. - For a gourmet dining the house wine is pretty horrible. Instead of charging at least $42 USD per bottle of wine, a small premium should be charged for good wine. - Beer felt watered down. - Snorkelling expedition highly overrated. The coral is dying. Too many boats, too many tourists. Also, Luis did not disclose when he quoted the price that it does not include a $2 fee for the national park. This should be disclosed upfront. - They really push the alcohol on the beach. - Sewage smell - Rooms that were booked were actually under renovation. - WIFI not included (for the price, it should be). - For the price, airport transfers should be included. This place tries really hard but they need to invest more in training their staff to really be able to justify charging the price they do.

Over the years I've stayed at many Thompson hotels on both coasts (Roosevelt, GuildHall, Thompson St, 6 Columbus) but this was by far the most disappointing experience. While the rooms are large and well designed, I was staying in a corner room #1000 with balcony (great views of LES) and found the noise (til around 2am) from the bar/restaurant and from the hallways more disturbing than that from Allen Street and nearby Houston. Admittedly I had jetlag from a 22 hour flight from Australia but hotel-sponsored noise is the last thing you want anywhere when you have to front up for a two way conference. While the staff are pleasant, the hotel simply lacks ambience of any kind, whether it's in the lobby or the bar/restaurant. Not to the usual Thompson standard. And when are they going to implement a loyalty scheme as they continue to expand? I won't be staying here next time I'm in NY.

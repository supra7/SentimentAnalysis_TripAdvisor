I stayed at this hotel for two days with my sisters, their children, my brother in law and mother and was not satisfied with the cleanliness. The sheets on the bed were dirty, the comforter actually had a few blood stains on them and I was given a dirty towel on another day. I stay at hotels frequently and would not stay there again on a return visit. The cost was $300 per night, and it wasn't worth it. Also, when I called the front desk and requested management, told them about the dirty comforter and asked to have them change our sheets, it took them about five hours to come up to the room. It didn't seem as if they were worried about satisfying customers.

Breakfast was good... and the proximity to sights and streetcar was good, but not much else was. The staff was not helpful. The hotel was so noisy at night (you could carry on a conversation through the walls... which wasn't fun staying next to a bunch of drunk sorority brats). We were woken up several times nighly. Our room was very small and clean when we arrived, but was housekeeping was strange after that. We started the week with 3 of each towel (Bath, hand, and face) by the end of the week we were down to 1 of most of them... even though we had put them back on the rack to show we would use again. The bathroom did not have a fan, so if you took a hot shower the room got very humid very fast. The neighborhood is a little rough. There are lots of people loitering arround in front of the nearby closed-up movie theater or tatoo parlor. I wish we had spent a little more and stayed somewhere else.

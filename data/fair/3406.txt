We got our 'Helmsleys' mixed up - there is another one on East 42nd St. We paid $320 a night and got a suite as we had our little boy with us. Staff amazing, you wouldn't find friendlier, more helpful staff anywhere. Lifts were brand new and BOTH worked fine. Breakfast was a big bonus. Housekeeping was excellent. Newspapers outside your door every morning.Great water pressure on shower. Brilliant location for everything. HOWEVER.....Room and hallways were really quite disgusting, very old, jaded and yes carpet was dirty and fraying. Electrical sockets were falling out of the wall, bathroom door had rotted through and the icing on the cake on our second to last night as we sat and watched TV, a mouse ran straight across the room in front of us. Screams ensued and management knocked $100 off our final bill for the unwelcome visitor. Next night we found little bags of rat poison under our beds. It has obviously once been a beautiful old hotel and you can still imagine it in it's heyday but it really needs to be shut down and refurbished. Felt safe there despite it's appearance. Wouldn't stay there again until refurbed.

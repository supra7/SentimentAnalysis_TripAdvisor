We booked this 10mths advance to get a sale room rate. If what you are after is a cheap as chips, no frills, central hotel then this is for you. It is a 2min walk from Euston station. Down side is it is exceptionally noisy at night (being opposite a huge bus stop and round the corner from a station) so I would recommend ear plugs!

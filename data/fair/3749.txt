First, I would like to state, the staff was great, very nice and sympathetic. This is a great place if one is travelling for pleasure and you prefer to bathe rather than shower. Every time someone in the hotel flushes the toliet or turns on the water, the shower becomes SCALDING hot, I was constantly adjusting the temperature to adjust to the extreme changes. If the shower was the only issue I would give a higher rating; however, the internet issues were atrocious. I was attending a conference at the Hyatt and due to company restrictions could not stay so we decided to stay across the street at the San Carlos. We arrived on Sunday and could not get an internet connection until I returned home. We actually had to "borrow" wifi from Arizona State and even that was iffy. Another guest mentioned she had to sit in the stairwell in order to get a signal. My colleague and I carried our laptops to S'bucks, Subway and the Irish pub next door so we could work. It was horrible. I would only recommend if the hotel updated their plumbing, wireless and cleaned the carpet more frequently. Oh, one more thing, if you decide to stay, bring earplugs; you can hear EVERYTHING from the rooms next door.

This is a nice hotel, but definitely should be boycotted based on the shoddy valet service. Here's the nightmare: valet company "lost" our car. They had no idea where they had parked it. We waited over an hour for our car -- and then they gave us cab fare to meet the rest of our party. The car was eventually found, but the valet company's remedy was to refund us the one-day parking fee. (No remedy was offered to others in our party who were also staying at the hotel and who were waiting to get into our car.) The hotel management is strangely indifferent to any concerns/problems with the valet service. And of course, the valet company never returned any calls made to the valet stand or to their regional headquarters in Florida. Save yourself the headache and stay somewhere else.

Stay somewhere else... The bar and lobby were great and so were the staff, however the rooms were small, walls extremely thin and it's not what you'd expect for an upscale hotel. I've stayed at Morgans properties before and The Clift doesn't compare to The Shore Club or any others. Next time I visit I'll definitely stay somewhere else!

Stayed here 3 nights prior to cruising up to Canada. What kind of hotel in America doesn't have complimentary tea and coffee making facilities? Unless you want to pay room service prices you must trawl downstairs to make one yourself in a plastic cup and then trawl all the way back upstairs to the room. A very expensive hotel and certainly not worth the money

Actually a really friendly hotel for it's size,smart modern and the restaurants were excellent--but,and it's a big but,They have these express elevators which make the sound of a jumbo jet taking off.Like other reviewers i don't think it's a problem they can easily cure.For all the nice beds the nice staff etc. you can hear the elevators wherever you go in the building so I cannot recommend this hotel

Now understand, on Maui you have dozens of great resorts to choose from and this is NOT one of them for a variety of reasons. First and foremost is the location. Kapalua is the coldest, windiest, wettest resort location in western and southern maui. We stayed 4 nights in Ka'anapali 15 minutes south and never saw a cloud. The next 4 nights we stayed at the Ritz and never saw the sun (although we rented a car and spent each day at our former resort, the Maui Sheraton, a much better choice). The grounds are beautiful, but the same goes for every hotel on the island. The rooms, however, are NOT. The bathroom was great, but the sleeping area could have been a budget room at a cheap vegas motel (not joking, if you dropped me in there blindfolded and had me guess where I was, I would have said the Imperial Palace in Vegas). The hotel has a very victorian, stuffy feel which is not what you want from Hawaii. You can tell the paintings and chandeliers are expensive, but that is sad considering that you can barely see the ocean from the hotel. Morale of story: If this was not hawaii, it is a good hotel. But it is, and by Hawaii standards, it fails. For the amount of $$ you'll spend on a room here, there are MANY other better hotels to choose (Westin, Hyatt, Grand Wailea, etc, etc, etc.)

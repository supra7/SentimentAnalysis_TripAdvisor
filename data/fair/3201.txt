My husband and I stayed for four nights over new years in the Herman House suite, room 243. Pros and cons, based on our experience. Pros: Exceptional location in the FQ, lovely courtyards, and a decent free breakfast. The hotel had very interesting architectural features. The parking staff was very attentive and would promptly call you a taxi when you needed one. Cons: 1) Upon arrival after a long flight, we had to wait for over an hour for our room to be cleaned. We arrived after the 3pm check in time. Not too much of a big deal much, but we were tired and the wait was irritating after traveling all day and being up since 3am to make our flight. The front desk gave us some extra drink tickets for Mae Baileys to compensate for the wait. 2) One of the main reasons I choose this hotel is because many reviewers said it was very clean. I couldnt disagree more. The place scared me; it had a slight port-o-potty odor. I went to the Walgreen's on Decatur and Wilkinson and bought Lysol disinfecting spray and gave the entire room a once over. If you stay in this room, I left the remainder of the disinfectant in the TV cabinet in the bedroom. 3) We came back to our room after being out and about all day to find our room door left OPEN, yes wide open! Im sure the housekeeping staff just didnt pull the door shut to latch it, and being an old building the door wont stay closed unless closed properly. Nothing was missing from our room, and Im sure it was an innocent oversight, but OUR ROOM DOOR WAS LEFT WIDE OPEN FOR SEVERAL HOURS. 4) Upon checkout, the front desk didnt bother to ask us how our stay was.

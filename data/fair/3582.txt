This hotel has all of the amenities of the W chain - spa, gym, noisy nightlife, etc. Unfortunately, it is in a renovated older hotel building and the HVAC system seems to be original issue. It is very difficult to calibrate and it goes on and off with a bang, making it difficult to get a good night's sleep. I have stayed here twice, in different rooms on different floors, and had this experience both times.

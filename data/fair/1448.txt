We stayed at the Clarion because of the rooms it offered -- 5 guys each wanting a bed. We reserved a room with 3 double beds and a room with 2 queen beds. When we arrived, we were told that all of those rooms were already occupied, but that we'd be given up-grades. The up-grades both turned out to be rooms with 1 queen bed and 1 fold-out couch. They were considered up-grades because they were suites -- that means a small kitchen area and a really small bathroom. Also, the cards programed as room keys didn't work -- even after three repeat efforts by the front desk. Each time we wanted into our rooms, we had to have the front desk send a maintenance guy with us. I strongly suggest that you view reservations at this hotel with sketicism.

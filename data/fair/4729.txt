This was our 4th stay, but first since ownership changed, and will be our last time. There have been renovations, and for us the only upside of that was a nice redo on a bathroom. The downsides are plentiful. No closet in the room (#5), one dresser that was so mildewed that you could smell it coming into the room, so we had to live out of suitcases and hanging clothes on a hook on the wall. The room had no chair to sit in, no lighting except the overhead. Even the common area that was a nice feature in the past was gone, so no fridge to keep items in, no lounging area, no breakfast snacks, no board game area. The Lahaina Inn would be better described now as a fancy youth hostel, not a place to relax. Save your money, there are much better choices in Lahaina for less than what this place charges.

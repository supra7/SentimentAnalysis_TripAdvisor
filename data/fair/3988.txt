Not what I expected . . . I stayed at the Clift while on a business trip to San Francisco along with several of my colleagues. The hotel is much different than any I've stayed in the past. The lobby is quite unique with the decor akin to East meets West (or so it seemed to me). The furniture in the lobby is very uncomfortable and is probably more for show than sitting. The decor included a grossly oversized chair that I dubbed the Paul Bunyan chair. As others point out in their review, the lobby bar is quite a hot spot. On the Friday night that I stayed there, it was packed and people were lined up on the street waiting to getting in. The hotel is very dimly lit throughout. The lobby, restaurant, the common areas, elevators, and my guest room had low lighting. It was nearly impossible to read anything while in the lobby due to the lighting. While the bed in my room was very comfortable, the room was small with a tiny closet and bathroom. There were no drawers so I lived out of my suitcase while I was there. There were two small plastic cubes in the closet and these may have been intended to substitute for the drawers. Also, there was absolutely no storage or counter space in the bathroom. The TV was tiny; I don't remember the brand, but it is one of the small ones you get at Sam's or Costco for $100 - $150. I was amazed that the hotel charged $14.95 a day for internet access. Many hotels provide that free of charge these days.I will not stay at this hotel again. It was pricey for the lack of amenities, and far too trendy.

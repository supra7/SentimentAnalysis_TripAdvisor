I am writing this a little over a month since we checked out with hopes the management would make things right. No such luck... What a disappointment. I will start with the good and move to the bad. I don't believe in bashing businesses on here, so here is my honest opinion. It is very clean, and has a cozy feel. Multi-level rooms make for a nice change to the typical hotel room. The walking distance to some convent stores is nice. Here are the problems. Our biggest complaint is all of the VERY LOUD construction going on from early in the morning to well after 7:00 at night. Relaxing by the pool is not an option unless you enjoy the constant banging of hammers and the loud crashes of boards and debris. I understand the news to maintain and improve a property, BUT WARN THE GUESTS WHEN BOOKING THAT THIS IS GOING ON!! We made a complaint to the unfriendly staff, and I don't think that they could have cared any less. We contacted the manager to see if they could at least drop the pointless $25 a day resort fee and all we got was a quick no. If you stay here you will be charged this fee. I have no problem with that IF there is something in return such as transportation to near by attractions, bikes or water sports equipment, Ect. We inquired why we were charged the fee here with none of the mentioned features, and their response was it was for landscaping, free drinking water by the pool, and a useless stretch of sand to set on with VERY limited views of mediocre water. Things that I think just come with running a place. Moving on the road noise is bad when setting on the balcony, the parking is far away, and the pools close at dusk. No hot tub was a let down as well. It has potential, but until attitudes change, I would stay at one of the MANY other beautiful resorts or B&B's in wonderful Key West.

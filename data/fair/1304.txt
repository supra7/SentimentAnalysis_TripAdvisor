Staff made me feel awkward from the minute I tried to check in. I arrived at 14:00 on a Friday afternoon only to be told that I had to pay an extra 10 in order to check in before 15:00. I explained that I would rather read my paper, have a coffee and wait an hour -the lady looked shocked! There are no chairs to sit on in the reception area so I ended waiting in cafe nero. I tried to check in again at 14:55 only to be told once again that I had to wait for exactly 5 minutes! Ok fair enough maybe it is something to do with their computer check in system, although doubtful. I am a young female traveller and was placed on the ground floor which I didnt appreciate. The first thing that hit me was the nasty overpowering air freshner filling the corridor outside the room. The room was totally stuffy and the window had the handle removed so it could not be opened (this is the case for all rooms). I asked to move rooms and have the window open as my chest didnt feel great after sitting in their for a while (I dont have breathing problems so I can only imagine what this stuffy environment would be like for someone who does). I was given an allen key to open the window but didnt get any sleep that night as I was on the ground floor with people walking directly past the window. Without the blind down completely speople could walk past and look straight in. The bed was medieval my whole body was aching the next day (I have never complained about a hotel bed before). There was no mattress protector and the sheets were thin enough to see the mattress pattern. I will say there were no pillows because a 2cm thick flimsy piece of foam doesnt count as a pillow in my opinion. I didnt bother with breakfast etc I knew I would be disappointed. So overall I was unable to arrive, check in without problems and have good night sleep. Disappointing

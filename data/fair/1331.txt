Ok the hotel is pretty clean and modern but thats where the good points end. I had a lower ground room near the bar. 2 single beds (with single linen) pushed together should not be classed as a double. No furnishings other than the bed and a desk. Room looked like a hospital room. Very unpleasant and not worth 120 per night.

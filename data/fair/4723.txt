We stayed at the Sheraton in Maui a few days. I was disappointed in the rooms. They are in desparate need of upgrading. The grout is discolored and cracked, the wallpaper stained and peeling. the A/C unit very loud. The furniture very old and worn. Fortunately the beds and pillows were very comfortable. The hotel has a nice location near black rock and walking distance to Whaler's village. The pool is lagoon style and very layed back. The Sheraton allows you to use its sister property at the Westin. That place is much nicer than the Sheraton, at least on the outside, I can't vouch for the rooms, and the pool is great. I guess it depends on what you are looking for in a hotel. The Sheraton was expensive and quiet, the westin had lots of activities and was busy.

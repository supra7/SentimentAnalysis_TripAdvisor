Two of us stayed here for two nights. The first room given to us was very dark. The one window let through very little light. We were given an option of a better room on a higher floor for the same rate, or a suite (actually 2 rooms) on the 7th floor. I took the suite although it cost more than $230 a night. It looked good, but overall, the stay was disappointing. There was no door man to help with the luggage. I had to lift bags up the steps into the lobby myself. On check in, I was not told that the cafe/restaurant would not be open that night and there was no room service dinner available. We were very tired having just arrived from a 6 hour flight and did not know about the restaurant til we called that evening. Next morning, I was told by room service that breakfast would arrive in 20 minutes. It took an hour. Cold toast, weak, undrinkable tea, and fruit for two came to more than $40. The breakfast arrived with no milk, no spoons, and no plates except those containing the fruit. Later, the manager told me room service "never" said "20 minutes" but next day, they told me the same. This might seem trivial, but we had a really important appointment that morning and had to rush to make it on time. Wireless did not work in the suite. We tried many times and connected to the internet twice in about 20 tries. The phone system is bizarre. The front desk said it did need a written tutorial to help each guest! The manager did apologise for the problems on check out. When hotels are promoted in city style guides, as is the Rex, beware. They are often dark, made-over old city hotels with new paintings, fresh paint,and a hype about them, but the same old elevators and same old phone systems.

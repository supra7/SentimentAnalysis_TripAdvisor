This hotel was everything we expected for 44 in central London. Good location, easy accces to tube and elsewhere. Bed linen, bathroom and towels crisp and clean and very good TV - however, curtains stained and you would not want to put your bare feet on the carpet ! Plug sockets are not easily accessable, when we found the socket for the hairdryer it was hanging from the wall!! I reported this, so hopefully it will be repaired?! If you are on the top floor (room 24 -25) you need to be aware that there are 7 flights of stairs, roughly 100 steps and no lift, so not good for people with mobility problems. Breakfast fine, toast, cereal, eggs ( hard boiled) and jams, with friut juices, tea and coffee - but breakfast room a little compact. The hotel suited our stay for 1 night - but room could do with a good lick of paint and electrics need sorting! Would stay here again if nothing better available.

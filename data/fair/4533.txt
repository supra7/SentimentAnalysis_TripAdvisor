We were very disappointed in our stay at the Mount View. On-line, it got decent reviews, and the pictures and descriptions looked nice. Upon entering, the lobby was very nice, but beyond that, not much good about it for us. The desk staff were friendly, but not very hospitable. There was actually no service at all in my opinion! Our room was OK, clean, the bed was comfortable, however, there was absolutely no view. We opened our windows to find a rusted out trailer out back in a field of weeds, and two flower boxes outside our window with dead flowers. There were no screens on our windows, so we also could not enjoy the fresh air. The bathroom was very small, and the shower head sprayed water everywhere. In the morning, we went down to the lobby for coffee, and found there was none, and when we asked, they said we had to wait for breakfast. We were GREATLY disappointed in the "breakfast" brought to us as well...dry baked goods, and apple and banana, and cold coffee. We went out for breakfast both days! We will NOT be returning, and felt we got nowhere near our money's worth!

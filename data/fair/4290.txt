I wrote a review before but it has not appeared on this site. At this point now, my main complaint is that I never received a reply from management when I expressed my issues of inconvenience that we had during our 3 night stay. I emailed the hotel after our stay and did not get a response. No response shows unprofessionalism.. The hotel is fine for the priceline price. The bathroom was tiny and did not have a fan. The restaurant/lounge would not let us sit at our choice of vacant tables that were available at 10pm at night, instead they wanted to seat us in non-scenic tables. We left the lounge instead and did not return. There is an outrageous internet price of $12.00 per day although it was not specified as such when we booked. We took our computer to Starbucks and a pub instead to find places of interest to visit. Otherwise, it was ok. We probably would not stay again due to the inconvenience of no complimentary internet.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. When we arrived the room looked very nice but after the first day that all changed. We were given no refills on shampoo, conditioner or soap after using those supplied upon arriving. We always bring some of our own along so I didn't even ask. Just assumed they would restock after use. As others have mentioned the sheets felt more like some sort of paper. The rooms were not cleaned very well the whole time we were there. Cups of water were left sitting on the desk until I emptied them and rinsed them. Do not expect to sit outside of the hotel and not be hounded by people begging for money. We heard about every line you could possibly think of. Really a Seattle issue that I believe the city should deal with as they were everywhere! Upon check-out we found that we were charged $35.25 plus 7.75 tax for valet parking but we did not have a car there. I tried calling the front desk to get the charges removed but no answer. Ended up having to go down to get it taken care of. All in all I would not recommend this Sheraton. As mentioned by others there are plenty of hotels in the area at a cheaper rate.

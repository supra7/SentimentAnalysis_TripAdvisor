Concierge and bellmen were wonderful but that's where my positive experience with this hotel ended. Check-in was painfully slow and treatment I received was very poor. Expressed concern about personal safety when I was put in a room at the end of a dark hallway, near the electrical closet and ice machine, with no other nearby rooms, and received standard language about "safest hotel in NYC", etc. Felt like I was listening to a recording. As a single woman traveling alone, I expect my concerns to be taken seriously, but they did were not at this hotel. I don't understand the appeal of W - dark, oppressive hallways, poor lighting in room, expensive internet access. I do like their Bliss toiletries but that's about the only aspect I enjoy at W hotels. Also, hotel was very loud, making sleep difficult.

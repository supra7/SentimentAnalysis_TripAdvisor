I used resortquest Hawaii to book my stay. The hotel was older, which was not an issue. Overall the stay was okay because the hotel was centrally located. We had a rat in our room and we thought the resortquest website exaggerated. The oceanfront room we were supposed to have was fine, but the ocean was across the street. Overall, if you are looking for a cheap way to stay on Maui then this is your place. I would recommend something closer to Lahaina.

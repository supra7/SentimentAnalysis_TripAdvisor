The hotel was conveniently located right in the heart of the French Quarter, however after our 5 day stay we would have much preferred to be closer towards Canal street. The hotel staff was pleasent but the room was pretty mediocre. The bed was absolutely terrible, we woke up each morning with a different ache thanks to several springs poking out of the mattress. The ratty comforter was immediately removed and stashed away. The bathroom was large and had good water pressure. Our room was right above the main lobby and had a balcony in which we were a little afraid to sit on due to the condition. The room was also quite dark at night having only table lamps. Finally, we missed not having a restaraunt in the hotel. Overall, not bad, but saw many other hotels that we wished we would have booked instead.

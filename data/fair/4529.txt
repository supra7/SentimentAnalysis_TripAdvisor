Wow, where do I start. Maybe the guy standing outside the front of the hotel urinating against the wall when we arrived. There is a very popular gay night club on the corner and it get very crowded with the outside lines. Saw a few alteration and fights on the nights I was returning to our room. It is a few blocks from Times Square so it is very convenient. Rooms are very small but the staff was helpful when the shower plugged up, air condition started smelling like it was burning. Elevator waits were long. Lobby was packed with luggage everywhere and no where to sit down in the lobby other than the four seats which were always taken. This was my 5th trip to NY and I have stayed in much nicer but costly hotels. So I guess the moral of the story really is ..you do get what you pay for especially in New York.

I came with high expectations but was disappointed. My disappointment started with the check-in. After waiting in line for 15 min and various people cutting in the line, I finally checked in. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. But the place was falling apart: the door did not lock unless slammed; the bed sheets looked a bit dirty; the blinders did not open and so on. Both mornings, the hot water was not hot. The internet service was crappy. I could keep going on., but in summary, I believe the hotel is not worth the money and do not recommend it.

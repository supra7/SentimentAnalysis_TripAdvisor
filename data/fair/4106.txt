Fifty Fifty at the Hotel Bohme Stayed at the Hotel Boheme for the last two night in the San Francisco, Napa Valley, Carmel vacation. We had three people in our party the first night we had a fine room with two queen beds. We knew we had to change rooms the second night to a queen bed and a futon. Well the futon turned out to be a small dirty cushon on the floor. The room window was next to the exhaustvent of the restaurant on the first floor it sounded like a jet engine. We got no sleep that night. The hotel is on the second floor with only a very narrow stairway.The Hotel is in a great location in Little Italy. Just make sure you do not stay in Room 207. or if they request a futon run to a different hotel.

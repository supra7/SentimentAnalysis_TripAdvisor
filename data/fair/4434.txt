I normally always stay at this Westin, and they are absolutely wonderful. This last time I was there they were under construction which was fine, but when I was placed on the Starwood guest floor, I was very dissapointed because when I walked out of my bathroom there was a cut out of my ceiling in the hallway. All I saw was that it was pitch black and that's all I could see. I was so upset and called the front desk. They were short staffed so I was told that I could move rooms, but they had no more Starwood rooms availiable, and that if I wanted someone to bring me a new key I would need to wait about 15 minutes. I said fine, but was very dissapointed in the service let alone the privacy that I felt was violated by the hole in my ceiling. Nobody offered to help me move my belongings as well to the new room either. I was dissapointed to say the least considering normally they are a great hotel.

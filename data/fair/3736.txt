When we checked into the Staybridge Suites, our first room had "lovebugs" all over the stairwell and inside the room. When we complained, we were told it's just the season for the bugs. I said we were leaving and they found us a room with no lovebugs. The carpet and the bathrooms were dirty. I commented the bathrooms in the Disney parks were cleaner. The location was good and the pool was fine. I would not stay there again and I would not recommend it.

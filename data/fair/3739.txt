Our reservation said 2 bedroom suite. They gave us room 545, a one bedroom suite with 2 beds and a sofa bed. When complied about the 2 bedroom suite they said that they call it 2 bedroom because it has a bedroom and a living room (????). Our room was facing some kind of engine that didn't stop working all night long, and it was like sleeping inside an helicopter because of the noise. They don't have safe in the rooms, so you have to leave your stuff on a safe at the front desk. That shows how oudated is the hotel. The lobby of the hotel looks nice, and the breakfast is good, but the room is relly outdated and they lie about the 2 bedroom suite.

I stayed in this Thompson Hotel from 2nd Feb. to the 7th Feb. 2012 and we were very disappointed to say the least. We are regular visitors to Manhattan as I have family there and decided to head downtown as we normally stay in midtown. So we choose what we thought was a trendy, modern hotel with cool hang out areas, bars and restuarants!!! Oh how wrong we were, I arrived to meet my friend who had already arrived and she told me she was on the 7th floor terrace bar, I said who...hoo and headed up to meet her. The "bar" is really only a terrace/deck with worn material on the not at all comfy or cosy couches, no atmosphere and served me my long awaited Grey Goose/Tonic in a plastic long glass....I was paying a good deal of money and I got my drink in a plastic glass, was I back at my festival days...So we then asked where the "real" bar and trendy restaurant that we had read about on the website when we booked the hotel were to be told "oh we are sorry but they are closed as we are changing mgmt companies"....Needless to say we were annoyed, we only booked the room a couple of weeks ago and we booked based on photos we saw of the hotel amenities on the internet, but we could not find the places that matched there nice pictures in the hotel, we should have been notified about this at booking time...OK granted the room was very good, really spacious, comfy beds and lovely sheets....But it ended there....There was always about 8 staff in the lobby to any guest so it wasn't exactly the type of lobby you wanted to hang around, as you felt eyes on you all the time...Overall we were so disappointed at this quite high priced hotel and I expressed our disappointment on our last day when we were checking out and really the response we received drove me to write this review, it was an indifferent response, and I just thought...thats it I'm writing this review....so my advice don't stay in this hotel, unless they can guarantee everything you see in the photos is actually there for you during your stay...:)

Our stay was just ok at best! we didn't stay at the hotel very much except to sleep and "eat" in the morning. the "continental" breakfast was ok at best, they didn't have much variety at all! some bread, cereal, milk and juice is all you'll get. I liked the clean lobby and entrance areas. The front desk people weren't that friendly, except for a nice Vietnamese girl, unfortunately we saw her only once upon our initial arrival! the others we're not rude per say, but acted clever and tried to rip you off in a sly sort of way. There was also so much noise in the hallways upstairs we even had to call security! We had clearly payed for our room thru Orbitz before leaving for Dubai and even had a print out of our receipt with us. Upon checking out, 2 days later, they said the receipt was invalid and told us it was only a reservation, not an actual receipt! After some arguments we ended up paying for the room (again), just so we could shut those guys up because we weren't going to win our argument. After coming back from our trip we checked our credit card statement and guess what we saw? Obviously, the double charge for our room! After some appealing and disputing several times with our credit card company investigated the matter and kindly refunded our money back. WHAT A HEADACHE!!

Just returned from a week at the Westin. We have stayed at many different Westin Resorts around the world-and this was the least impressive. Since we were delayed leaving our point of origin-we didn't check in to the hotel until 6pm-having called from the airport in Oahu to let them know we were going to be delayed. We had the worst possible room-right next to the elevators-and with a mountain view(which was really pretty)-our room was several floors above the main entrance-which caused for lots and lots of noise. There was a motorbike reving its engine at 6am one morning-it was a bit annoying. The pool area is nice-fourtunately they have an 'adult' pool where no one under 18(or 16?) is a 'allowed'. It did help relieve some of the noise inthe pool area. However-space was very limited-and there were many cases of 'chair reserving' and chairs going unoccupied for many many hours. The hotel restaurants were average-the staff was okay-pleasant, but never went out of their way. I'll be blunt-there were far too many children running around this resort-and many were left unsupervised and badly behaved. As Starwood preferred members-for a few years-we found that while we had an awesome time in Maui-we would not return to the Westin. Oh-and about the rooms being too small-I don't know how anyone could fit all of their clothing and shoes in that TINY armoire they provided.

We were flying out of Love Field early one morning for an out of state family wedding and decided to stay here to save a 4:30 AM drive into DFW. We stayed here on points earned. We booked a queen suite; easy check in; nice gentlemen at the front desk. This hotel is in need of a good updating. The carpet in the halls are very worn; holes in some places. The room is very tired and decor dated. We booked for three adults; our 21 year old son to use the sofa bed. The first room was equipped with a sink, microwave, and fridge. A desk/chair, sleeper sofa, coffee table, and television are in the front room. Double doors open into the bedroom. A television is also in this room. The mattress on the bed needs to be replaced; sheets were dingy. Carpet was old and worn. Checked the sofa bed upon arrival; dirty sheets from food and 'stuff' falling thru the couch onto the sofa bed. Sheets were stained with what looked like blood that didn't come out in the wash. Slept like a typical sofa bed. Found hairs in the tub; towels were very thin and big enough to cover an elementary aged child. The bathroom is relatively small; the sink is located just outside the bath area. Tight space to move around in. The breakfast was presented nicely but was standard continental breakfast fare. The exception was the variety of juices and flavored coffee creamers offered. The breakfast area is large. The business office has one computer. The pool is indoors and was not open when we were there. My son checked out the fitness center and said he didn't want to use it - too much out of date. The only people from the hotel we encountered were two different gentlemen at the front desk and the young lady running the breakfast area. They were polite and professional. While this is a good location for Love Field we won't stay here again. It may be a good deal but it needs better cleaning and is in serious need of a remodel.

I was meeting my wife for a weekend retreat before deploying to the desert. She flew in from Orlando and I drove from LA. She beat me to the hotel so she checked in and waited for me in the lobby. I was so excited to see her and how much I was looking forward to the short weekend I would be seeing her before I go away for the next 5 months! We had a room facing the strip on the 35th floor. We went to the room and the maid was just finishing up? I thought that was strange. After they were done I put my key card in the slot and it didn't work. So I had my wife wait and I went down to the front desk to fix the problem. No biggie, but no apology. I got back upstairs and my wife said that another couple had said they were in that room! My wife told them they must have had the wrong room and sent them on their way. I tried the key and again, it did not work. I grabbed a maintenance man and they let us in. We were tired and just wanted to get a bite to eat. Once in, we started to get settled. We noticed our slippers were missing so we called the front desk and they brought up a set. There was another knock at the door and it was security asking us to leave there was yet another couple with them! Triple booked the room? No. They gave us the wrong room number. So we picked up and moved. 2 hours. No apology, still. I paid full price for this room just like every other customer in that hotel and just because I am not a high roller, this is how I am treated? Not a real caring staff, I think they need more training in customer service. You may want to give this new hotel some time to work out the issues before you book. The slot machines are not the best, there are not that many tables being worked and all the clubs were closed due to some movie production or something, they didn't even bother to tell us. The room was nice, but the hassle and inconvenience put more of a damper on the stay than the rain did.

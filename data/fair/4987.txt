Our travel agent booked this stay for us, so we hoped we would get one of the better rooms. Not the case. For $269/night, we were shown to a tiny, dingy, musty old room with a window facing a blank wall. The furniture was outdated, and wallpaper tried unsuccessfully to mask a large crack in one wall. The bathroom was not big enough for two people. It really did have old cracked tile on the floor and the shower was mildewed beyond belief! I called the desk clerk immediately and simply said the room was unacceptable and asked for another. She said she would call back in two minutes. After 15 minutes without a reply, I called again; she had forgotten! This time she said we could move to one of their "nicest, recently refurbished rooms on the club level" and when we got there had to believe that The Whitehall just doesn't know any better. The room was larger, with no apparent cracks, and a little view of the city around the corner of a brick ell. However, the dark granite that replaced the old tile in the bathroom didn't quite hide the mildew in the corners, and the furniture was exactly the same as in the first room. One good thing stood out--the beds in both rooms were the same: very comfortable, with luxurious fine linens. We were never offered the club level amenities, but what kept us here for 4 nights was the concierge staff (Tim is exceptional!), the location, and the bed! Take away those three things, and you have an $80/night Best Western with so-so housekeeping. By the way, our friends' room had such lumpy carpeting that it was a trick to negotiate walking; they were shown another room but it wasn't much better. They did, however, have much newer, nicer furniture than ours!

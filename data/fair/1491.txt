We booked this hotel online before we had read any reviews, wish we had read the reviews first! Some of them proved to be close to the mark. We travelled from Scotland to visit the Memphis sights, and boy, did we live in one! The pool certainly was not for swimming in,the breakfast was pretty substandard, compared to the other hotels we stayed at for the same price range,and the rooms were below average. However, the guy behind the desk was really helpful.There was six of us in our party, and the shuttle bus proved to be a bit expensive at three dollars each, one way,for a five minute ride, especially as most hotels offer a free shuttle service. This did not stop us having a great time in Memphis. Beale St Rocks!!!

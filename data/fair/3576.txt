Being able to sleep and relax seemed unworkable. Every morning I would awake up because of all sorts of different sounds outside my room. The doors were banging constantly and it was not my neighbors coming in or going out; it was the maids who were at the hallways talking loudly and laughing, even swearing at times. Towel trolleys were squeaky and therefore aggravating and do not forget that this was every day; it was not a singular incident. Shouldnt the personnel be more careful and sensitive to the retreat and tranquil of your clients? Isnt there anything else you can do with insulation? Another thing was morning beverages. Couldnt there be a coffee machine in the room? Isnt there anything you offer free of charge to your customers, not even a cup of morning tea? Not to mention that they didn't even have free WiFi... My stay there was tolerable and not in any way wonderful. I would not be recommending these hotels to my social contacts, absolutely not at this price. It is out of the question.

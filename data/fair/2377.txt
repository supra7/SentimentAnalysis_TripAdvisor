The Hampton continues to live up to its reputation of poor maintenance and physical condition of basic things such as closet doors and shower curtain rods. This room's closet door handle was coming off, the shower curtain rod was almost falling off creating an issue with the shower curtain sliding into the center - allowing water to escape onto the floor. The iron water fill cap was broken off so it would splash on clothing when moving it. All plumbing was extremely loud. Positive side - your air conditioning was low on noise.

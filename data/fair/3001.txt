My boyfriend and I returned from a trip in Maui in October. Hawaii was wonderful and we had a great time. It was beautiful weather, but the Whaler was pretty dissappointing. I looked and searched for a hotel for months. And I used this website. We got there and no one helped us with our bags. The condo was being remodeled and no where, were there signs of the remodeling. The staff also failed to mention it. We woudln't of been so surprised if we were notified. We parked in the underneath parking which was pretty croweded during our stay. We had to put our luggage in a shopping cart and push it to our room. It was actually pretty funny and made a great picture. As we got upstairs we were greeted with torn out lighting fixtures and cans of paint lying in the hallways. There was dust everywhere from the sanding of the walls. The room was spacious, though we weren't greeted with the pineapple in our fridge. We tried getting a new room to no avail. Two days after our stay we were able to change rooms, that room had the pineapple and was a lot better. The next day as we were going out we found out the jeep we had rented and parked in the Whalers' parking structure was overflowing with water. We left the top of on our jeep and the pipeing had leeked into the jeep. Fortunately, for us the weather was hot enough and we parked the jeep outside the structure and it dried pretty fast. The Whaler is a convienient place to stay at if you want to be by the big resorts and the Whaler Village(a shopping mall) made up of great stores. Its also in close proximity to Lahaina where there are great restaurants and shopping as well. I recommend the trip to HANA! That is made the whole trip worth it! Hana is gorgeous. I would recommend for anybody to buy a book to familiarize yourself with the island and available activities. Hawaii is a wonderful gettaway!

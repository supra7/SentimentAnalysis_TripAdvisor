I am a Platinum Starwood Member, and spent 3 nights at this hotel. The room was pretty small and the Front Desk staff was inconsiderate and pretty much lacked interest in my dissatisfaction with their service. Also upon checking out, they refused to cash a travelers check even though I was a top tier member, had spent three nights at the hotel and used a Platinum credit card to settle my bill. I will not stay at this hotel again.

Okay, I stayed in this hotel twice and that was a number of years ago. Looking at the reviews, not much has changed. Back when I stayed here (1983 & 1988), it was just acceptable, nothing splashy. Rooms were just acceptable for cleanliness, not sparkling clean, that is for sure; staff was nice enough. The hotel has a nice nostalgic feel to it, like back in the 1940's or 1950's. It is a shame though. With a complete renovation job: total clean up, rip out those ghastly rugs, painting, wallpapering, etc, ....this hotel would be a gem. It is in a good area in Hollywood. When I was there, I got the room at a rather cheap rate, so I wasn't bothered too much by its 'imperfections.' If I had spent big bucks $$$ on the room, THEN I would have been really ticked off. It was okay for budget travellers such as myself, who got it at a reduced price. There aren't many bells, whistles, frills at this place, so don't go expecting any. It is a basic type establishment. Would I stay here again under these same hotel conditions?? Well, I would definately look for somewhere else which was cleaner at a reasonable price. If I couldn't find anything else, then I would stay here again, albeit reluctantly. On both visits, I coincidentally got the SAME room! As for being a spacious room, it was okay. One last note, I found the underground parking garage drab and dull; I personally felt safe enough being a male.... a female may feel otherwise, especially at night. In short: Hotel is okay for the budget traveller who is not picky. ps... Keep in mind I was at this hotel many years ago... this review is just to show you what it was like back then. Many similarities still exist !

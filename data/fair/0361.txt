After booking a room for $204, my husband and I arrived to what seemed to be a great hotel. After finding they had mistakenly reserved a room with two twin beds for our romantic get away, they were able to find on room with a king size bed.....right next to the parking lot. The room was the size of a pea and the walls were PAPER THIN. I could hear the people above us, next to us and in the hallway. This hotel was basically a Best Western on the water. TERRIBLE.

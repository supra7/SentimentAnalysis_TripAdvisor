Nothing to remember. Like standard Marriott with better furniture and colors. Very expensive. The staff try to be polite only because management says they have to. The pool area is beautiful and very large but nobody takes care of used/empty chairs. In the afternoon there seem to be no vacant chairs although people have already left. This northern part of the island is more windy and rainy than southern.

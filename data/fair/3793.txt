This was our second stay at the AZ grand. The package we booked over the phone was not the package we recevied when we checked in! Hotel ignored our complaints about housekeeping. Room was filthy, asked for an extra pillow, never received it. Asked for extra towels only for housekeeping to take them the next day. Never had any coffee in room...we just got to look at a coffee maker. Floors never vacuumed. Patio littered with beer bottlecaps, empty water bottles and cigarette butts. Food is always good at the Lobby Grill and Bar. Marketplace staff had a horrible attitude and should have their Starbucks affiliation taken away since the coffee was horrible. Wait staff at Oasis was great! Food was great at the Oasis grill. The Oasis part of the resort needs some work. It was filthy! Empty food trays, cups and trash everywhere. So when the wind blew, the trash blew into the wave pool and lazy river. No one ever picked this up. On the last day of our 5 day stay, housekeeping knocked on the door at 8 am to make sure we were checking out! Check out is at noon. NICE! Recommend to others to spend the money and stay at one of the Scottsdale Resorts. Same price and better quality. We will next time.

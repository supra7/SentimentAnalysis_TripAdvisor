I stayed one night in this hotel. I arrived early from Bangkok (around 11am), and despite my request of an early check in, there were no rooms available. Never mind. This can always happen. So, I checked anyway in, just needing to collect my key on the way back from the show I was attending (btw, the expo is really next door). I left my luggage at the concierge. I took out all my valuables, leaving in just a travelling wallet with inside some flight documents, my driving license, and few dollars. And also the keys of my house. When I got back I collected the bag, not even thinking to check that everything was inside. Only the following morning (early wake up to take a flight to MAlaysia), I discovered somebody took out the wallet. I am not complaining about what's happened, as it is my fault to leave something inside. I am just complaining about the attitude of the manager. He just recorded what's happened. No big excuses, or at least sympathy... He asked my e mail address to let me know the result of the investigations..... And I did not here anything from them. Not even an e mail saying we are sorry for what's happened. I repeat: no complains about the hotel; no complains about somebody stealing something from my bag (even if this should really not happen in this kind of hotels). I have just a bad taste in my mouth for the way in which I have been treated.

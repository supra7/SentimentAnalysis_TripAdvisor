This hotel is probably one of the best in terms of location for shopping and restaurant etc. but the staff are a bit clueless. Every time I called down to the Front Desk with questions it felt like I was putting them out. Their tone of voice was no better than a 13 year old with a bad attitude! Not to mention when I checked in they yelled my room number out to me, not a good idea as a female travelling alone... The back breaker was when I called the concierge asking what time the mariners game started that day as I had tickets, he told me 7pm. When I got there at 7pm the game had been on for one hour as it started at 6:05!! Pretty basic information for a concierge to screw up on! When I had got back to my room the first day I was there housekeeping had still not been to my room, I had left at 9am and it was then 3:30. I called down to the front desk to find out what time housekeeping would be coming by as I wanted to have a nap before I went to the game. Their answer was they can come now or not at all as they leave at 5pm, how that was my problem I am not sure as they had all day to clean it... The restaurant was great, the service alright... The food was awesome and the prices are pretty good. Over all I would probably only stay here again based on location alone, it would have to be a good deal as well or I would stay at the Vintage Park or Pacific Plaza hotel.

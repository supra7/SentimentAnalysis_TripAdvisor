I want to warn anyone that has booked a room facing the courtyard that there will be constant, very loud noise from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm Monday-Friday. We booked through an owner for 2 rooms, on high floors, one back from ocean front in tower 1. We were not told of the construction and awoke on the first morning to a loud jack-hammering noise. We called the realtor and management company and they ended up moving us to a 2bdrm ocean front unit. I would not advise getting any room that faces the courtyard until the construction is complete. You cannot sit on your lanai because the noise level is so high. We picked our rooms because they faced the courtyard and on a previous visit, it was the perfect location to hear the ocean, not now though. Run, dont walk, away from the Whaler until the construction is complete!!

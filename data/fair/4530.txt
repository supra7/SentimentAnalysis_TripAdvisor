We stayed for the week after Christmas. The rates were good. However, the rooms were very small. In addition, for a hotel with 36 floors, it only has 2 elevators. It sometimes took up to 10 minutes to reach the top floor (our floor). Often, the elevator was already full because people from the lower floors had to get on and ride up because otherwise the elevator was full. Also, every morning breakfast was free. However, the line typically stretched into the lobby which meant another wait of 10 minutes or so. Finally, the business center has only 2 computers. Typically, if you were able to get the computers at all you had to wait about 20 minutes to have one open up. Another problem, whether this was just our floor or if wide spread, i'm not sure but housekeeping did not give us toilet paper. We finally had to contact the front desk to get some, which took 2 calls and over an hour wait. The key word for this hotel is WAIT for everything.

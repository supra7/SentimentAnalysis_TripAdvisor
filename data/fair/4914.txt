My husband and I travel quite a bit and just returned home from a Chicago vacation. We loved the city but were not impressed with the Swissotel at all. The employees were very rude to us and did not care if we were treated with respect or not. Upon arrival to our room we found that our TV was not properly working and would begin making an awful noise after being on a channel for 3-4 minutes. I called to request someone look at the TV and replace it or allow us to move to another room. I was told an "engineer" would be up to look at it but no one ever showed up. Needless to say we spent 4 days with a bad TV that was annoying to say the least. The room was okay but I have stayed in much nicer for much less money. The package advertised free internet access and we found they offer internet access for $9.95/day! I also read in the welcome book that local calls were free and we were charged for the 2 LOCAL calls we made when we checked out! All in all, I think this hotel is HIGHLY overrated and there were much nicer hotels with more to offer for less money all over downtown Chicago. If you're looking for a nice, plush place to stay, keep looking and spend your money elsewhere.

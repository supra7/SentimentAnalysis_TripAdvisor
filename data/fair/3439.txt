I stayed here just after Christmas (2011) and was quite disappointed. Shared bath I knew about; okay, the room doesn't cost much; i made concessions. Unfortunately the toilet stopped working in one of the 2 bathrooms and the staff, nice as they were, couldn't make it work reliably. When I used the other toilet it was so cramped I had to move my legs to the side to close the door. In my room the window was small and so dirty I could barely see the courtyard below; the bare steam pipe that provide the heat couldn't be turned down so the room was about 85 degrees most of the time. The carpet was really gross.

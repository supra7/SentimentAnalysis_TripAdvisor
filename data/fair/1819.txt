The rooms were clean, furniture was to update and the location is conveniently close to the highway. Unfortunately, our ladder was stolen off our car and the front desk could not do anything about it. The "security" camera was blocked by a tree and the front desk said they wouldn't be able to see the license plate even if it wasn't blocked. The front desk was not friendly or helpful. Our keys expired every other day even though we were in the system to stay for an entire month. We left early due to the reasons mention.

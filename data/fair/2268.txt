I've just returned from a stay at the Eliot Hotel and this place, in particular the restaurant, is a rip off. Apparently, in the restaurant's system Hash Browns = Eggs Benedict, and when you tell them you did not order Eggs Benedict they refuse to remove it from the bill. Also, the "buffet" breakfast has less items than a continental breakfast. Everything else about the hotel including the rooms, bed, bathroom, lobby is merely standard. Oh and the heat in the hotel does not work for more than a few minutes at a time. You have to stay under the covers to keep warm. Not what one would expect from a boutique hotel. Save your self the hassle and stay elsewhere.

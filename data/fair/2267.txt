We were so looking forward to our stay at the famed Eliot Hotel in Boston, and we could not have been more disappointed. First, I will never book a room online again b/c I feel when properties see you've booked online, they treat you like a second class citizen. We had requested early check in of only 1 hour before (we had an event to get ready for), and we were denied this request each time we made it (I had called the hotel 1 month prior, was told to call back the morning of our rez, did so, was told they MAY be able to accommodate us when we got there, and no they could not check us in early once we arrived.) I suspect the hotel will not accommodate early check-in request b/c once you see the tiny, no view, dirty room, you'll want to move. Which brings me to the room itself. The bathroom was not clean. There were feces on the wall next to the toilet paper dispenser and on the underside of the toilet bowl. There is no reasonable explanation for this; it was disgusting. The shower walls were loaded with soap scum as well and the floor in the bathroom was not clean. Never again will we stay at the Eliot.

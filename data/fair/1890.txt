Some Springhill Suites are brand new, state of the art, and in a higher quality then the price you pay for them. This is not one of them. This one is old. The rooms feel ancient and outdated. The tv is old. The parking is expensive and only valet is offered. The office staff was pretty nice during my stay here and the location makes it the only real major chain hotel in the west end district. It is a great location literally next to the food/store offerings the west end has.

We will probably not ever stay here again...or at least, not unless we hear that the rooms have been updated and remodeled. The rooms need to have the popcorn removed from the ceiling. All furniture is super old and outdated. Nothing impressive in the rooms at all. There was not even a light over the shower or toilet, very dark! The lobby is nice. It is NOT a good representation of what you will see once you step foot inside your room. This was the grossest Marriott I have ever stayed in. It was difficult to communicate with some of the staff and they were not very helpful.

GOOD POINTS -Cheap (I stayed here for some nights for 20 pounds - this is fantastic for central London) - Family rooms are spacious for 2 people - Restaurants very close eg Nanos (portugese), Strada (Italian), Pasta, fast food at the station etc) - Staff are friendly -Early check in available (but at a cost). Some hotels I have been in do not even allow early check in so I put this as a good point. -Safe area. BAD POINTS -Mattress was uncomfortable - sinks in the middle. My wife had back problems every day (!) -Pillows are thin, hard and uncomfortable. I ended up buying a couple as I was staying for 2 weeks. - Road noise when windows are open is load but okay when windows are closed -Air -conditioning does not work in any room I have been in (I have tried 5 rooms). Windows open with a key that is available at reception though. -Towels aren't very good and often you have to ask for more. -Double rooms felt claustrophobic!

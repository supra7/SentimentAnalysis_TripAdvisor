Skip the Luau We attended the Royal Hawaiian luau the last Monday of November, 2005. I would strongly advise people considering attending the luau to skip it. The adverstisements talk of it being held on the ocean lawn...it's held in their ballroom with the doors propped open. The food is ok. The show is awful. Many people walked out it is so bad. The dancers show little ambition or emotion. As one review I read after the attending the show said they couldn't tell if the dancers were dancing or having seizures. The singers just don't have it....they are past their prime. This is not what we were expecting for an authentic Hawaiian Luau. The do have a flame juggler but you can't see him because he is actually outside and you stuck inside. To top things off the air conditioning dripped on us through out the evening and there we no spots they could reseat us.This event doesn't warrant the $89.00 per person charged and doesn't measure up to what we were epecting from the Royal Hawaiian. I'd consider the luau at the Cultural Center or Germaine's luau.

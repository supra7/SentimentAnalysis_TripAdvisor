I will start by saying I never write reviews because other people have done it, BUT, this hotel has been such an odd stay that I had to put it in writing. The hotel itself is fine...the room is surprisingly large (although I did get a wheelchair accesible room for some reason, and these are usually quite larger). The bed is fine, but the blankets are almost see-through. The elevator is slow, but with only 5 floors its not a huge deal. The staff...the staff is atrocious. The front desk has been manned by some rather snappy women with bad attitudes. Asking for where the parking is and asking for some clarification got me a very bad, unnecessary snappy answer. The cafe (Awake with Pearl) has a gigantic poster of "The Black Person in the Workplace" full of semi-activist pro-black remarks, and generally insinuating all black people are mistreated by white people in the workplace. I won't debate whether this is true or not here, but does it REALLY have to be in the wall of a hotel cafe? Is that the ambiance we're going for here? The lady at the register also has her attitude well up front, and generally made us feel extremely unwelcome. The latest and greatest was finding the convenience/gift shop still closed at 5pm and when I asked at what time it was meant to open I got "Whenever she feels like is...there's no set time" Un-freaking-believable. Now, I have absolutely no problems in hotels. I spend 95% of my year in hotels, I'm very polite and educated and I know how things work, especially with my brother being a major hotel manager. This attitude is inexcusable.

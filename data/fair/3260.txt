This hotel should be downgraded to a Holiday Inn. The lobby area is nice enough, but the rooms seem unchanged for at least a decade. What seemed upscale then now seems dowdy. The room is only average sized at best, and it was poorly furnished. My upgraded room has a single chair that was so worn I was almost sitting on the floor, with no footstool. The desk chair should be upgraded to an office style chair. The mattress was way too soft for my tastes. Everything from the lamps, to the desk to the ambiance was ugly and old. The bathroom was one of those split affairs, with the sink area open to the main room - at an IC?!?! My safe was operational, but not screwed into the wall - anyone could have walked away with the entire thing. The ammenities were tiny and not up to IC standard. My room included a balcony which was pretty useless since it was a windswept wasteland, facing other rooms and the building next door. It was also none too clean. The balconies all face the back of the hotel and from the constant noise I'm guessing the ventilation units from both the IC and the building next door face the courtyard - not relaxing in any way. Old fashioned CRT type TV - I repeat, in an IC!!! My room had not one but two connecting doors to the rooms alongside me, and neither were insulated - I could see light from the adjoining rooms underneath, and I could clearly hear conversations from next door. I stayed here for the points - next time I'll forgo them and stay someplace that justifies the price, or stay in the HI for half the price in a similar room.

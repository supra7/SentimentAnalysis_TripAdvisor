At this hotel right now. Other than the tiny rooms, tinier bathrooms, antiquated plumbing, cold showers, tissue paper walls and lack of room service, this would be a great hotel. What a disappointment. I have stayed in better Holiday Inns. I have also stayed in very nice older "boutique" hotels before; this surely isn't one of them. Website says "free" wireless internet. Well that is only for 30 mins then you pay. I can literally hear and understand every word of the people in the room next door talking at a normal decibal level. I know their shower doesn't work at all, by the way, and I have never seen nor spoken with them. You can't adjust temp in room at all. I am here for a convention and did not have a choice for hotel if I wanted to stay with my co-workers. Now everything is booked nearby so I have to stay. Now I know why I had to acknowledge the $50 early departure policy when I checked-in. They must be making big bucks off of that.

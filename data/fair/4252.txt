The Commander Ocean City Hotel sits directly on the famous boardwalk. I stayed in an Ocean Front room with two "queen" beds. The room was clean and the view was great. I requested an early checkin of 1pm, however I didn't get in until 3pm. It was slow season with many vacancies. There was no hand soap or an iron in the room. There were two very small 26" TVs in the room. The couch was awful. We paid $89 for slow season and I would suggest not paying over $100 at any time of the year. Not my first choice for a hotel.

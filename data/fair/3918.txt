On arrival at the Diva quickly checked in by a really friendly receptionist Charles but it must have been his last shift and a complete arrogant "diva" had taken over, he seemed to be a night receptionist although on our last day he was there in the morning as well maybe this was why he was so unfriendly and unhelpful. The room had an awful sewage-like smell which I reported to reception, when we returned in the evening the smell had gone but only because the window had been opened it soon returned when closed. Hotel was in a great location but we were glad to leave.

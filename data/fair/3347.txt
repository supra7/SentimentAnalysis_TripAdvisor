We had a mouse in our room (which is not unusual for New Orleans.) There was a lack of concern by the staff. Management placed a sticky trap on our floor, and when we returned at midnight to the mouse stuck to it, the employee would not remove it. After letting her know she had no option, she did get a worker from the restaurant nearby to remove it. The next day, the manager FINALLY apologized and took care of our room for that night. He also said he "took care" of the situation with the employee. It was a rather unpleasant experience sharing our room with an univited guest!

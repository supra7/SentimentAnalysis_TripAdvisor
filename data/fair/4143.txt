We stayed one night at the Alexis in December. Staff is very friendly. Hotel is nice, though starting to look a little tired around the edges. The room was comfortable, though a bit dark. Had some trouble getting the TV to work. We were reasonably happy until 3:30 am when a VERY loud trash truck pulled up right below our window and began emptying multiple dumpster bins. It was there for about 30 minutes. Soon after, other loud trucks began lumbering up the hill outside our window. The front desk staff in the morning asked how our night was. I started to tell her that we were awoken at 3:30 am -- before I even finished my sentence, she said, "the trash truck? Yeah, we've been having a problem with that." Then, why does the hotel continue to put people in the room RIGHT above their trash? We checked out and moved across the street to the Hotel 1000, where we enjoyed 4 blissful nights of quiet luxury.

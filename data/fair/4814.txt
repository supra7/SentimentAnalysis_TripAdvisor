Check staff were helpful with restaurant recommendations. The room was disappointing for the price. Two of the four lights didn't work. The bellman said he would get them fixed, but that didn't come to pass. The dim lighting did, however, somewhat hide the dirty carpet and peeling wallpaper. A travel companion had a remodeled room that was very nice. I would recommend requesting a remodeled room or bring a flashlight.

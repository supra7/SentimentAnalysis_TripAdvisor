Ok We went and stayed at the Omni with our 2 children in the Berkshire suit. The suit was very nice and clean but small and not really big enough to pull out the sofa . I felt for almost 1,000 a night with taxes it should of been bigger.Also we stayed in Room 819 and I could hear every night some people talking above my room. It was very annoying. I didn't report the problem because Im sure they couldn't of done anything about t. Its not like the guest were loud they were just talking. But you could hear them.The front desk was ok to us , and the women at the concierge was just ok also. The city was full and we couldn't find any cabs on saturday night . We ate in the resturant at the hotel which was very good, but Exteremely expensive. Especially breakfast like 23 for Eggs toast and homefries. NYC pricesOverall the Omni was good but we have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria and enjoyed that hotel more.

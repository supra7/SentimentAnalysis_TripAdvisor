The only reason I stayed at this hotel was because the meeting organizers had reserved rooms here. The property is old and rooms are badly in need of renovations. - The bed was not comfortable - The room reeked of cigarette smell, even though it was supposed to be non-smoking (when I told the front desk about it, they said may be air from smoking rooms was coming through the vents! They did noting to fix it or give me an alternate room.) - The front desk / concierges didn't even know where meeting rooms in their own hotel were! They had to consult with the bellhop to get that info. The only positives about the hotel were their meeting planners and catering. Both were of excellent quality and very prompt / helpful.

I recently stayed at the Fairfield PHL airport based upon the reviews I read on Tripadvisor. As far as Fairfield Inns go, they are all pretty standard, with clean rooms, comfortable beds and adequate breakfasts. This one was no exception. However, the service at this Fairfield was the worst compared to other Fairfield Inns I've stayed at, including the one at Newark Airport. I arrived on a redeye flight, early Friday morning, and called the hotel to have the shuttle pick me up. The hotel clerk who answered the phone rudely informed me that check in was not until 3 and seemed put out that I would actually want to store my luggage there until I could check in. Nonetheless, she reluctantly agreed to send the shuttle, which arrived about 40 minutes later as I waited at the airport. To be fair, when I got to the hotel, the clerk invited me to partake in the breakfast buffet; however, she didn't blink an eye or even acknowledge me as I sat in the lobby waiting for an empty room to open up. It was only at about 10:30am that she finally said a room wouldn't be available until noon, at which point I decided to check my luggage with them and head out into the city. I checked in later that evening when I returned. However, as I lay in bed the following night, around 11pm, two other guests entered my room! The clerk (different from the one who checked me in) had checked them into my room and given them the key! To top it off, the clerk then called me in my room and said she had a "dilemma" and then asked me what my last name was. When I told her, she simply said "thanks" and hung up w/o apologizing! Needless to say, I won't hold this against the Fairfield chain as a whole, but I definitely won't be going back to this one!

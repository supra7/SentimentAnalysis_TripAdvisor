The service at the hotel is great, but the hotel itself is not quite up to par. Maui itself is expensive, but paying $350/night for a hotel that's dingy and outdated, especially one that doesn't have enough covered walkways so that you don't get wet when it's raining (and it poured during our entire stay) was very disappointing. The elevators were old, the shower was tiny and covered in mold, and the beds were uncomfortable. We booked for our honeymoon and were told we had a great oceanfront room, but were given a room on the 2nd floor, right above where they held the luau which was very noisy, and you could barely see the water above the trees. We went to eat at 10:00pm after arriving and most of the restaurants were closed, and the food we ended up getting was sub-par. The grounds are beautiful and walking outside is great, and the beaches are very nice. It's very secluded also so you don't feel like you are on top of others. But when the earthquake happened and the power went out, the hotel was not prepared at all - no emergency generators, all of the restaurants shut down, and there was no backup plan for food. We had to leave and go to a different hotel to eat breakfast and lunch. There was also no communication about whether or not there was damage to the hotel or if we were in danger of a tsunami coming. All in all we were very disappointed with our stay in the Maui Prince.

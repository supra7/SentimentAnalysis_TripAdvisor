The hotel was a big disappointment to myself and my husband - two lifts and no lifts for the staff so of a morning to go and get breakfast the wait for the lift could be up to 20 minutes - just terrible - The rooms were so small and the noise from the construction sites around the area was so loud you could not leave your window open - even though the window only opened up a tiny bit you could not get any air in the room. The breakfast was good value for money, however I would never stay there again.

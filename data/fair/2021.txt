The location saves the review in this case. The hotel is way overpriced. The convention discount in our case was better than other I see but still, you pay much more than for better hotels in bigger cities. Room service was OK. They cleaned the room and so there was no complaint in that direction. Check in was slow but OK. The Concierge had no idea about anything in the area. She picked the restaurant that was first on the list and it was not a good one. The location is nice as it is in downtown with the mall, restaurants, train station and convention center within walking distance. Internet was free for us but parking was crazy. Valet and self parking was the same price which was funny. If we did not had to stay there due to the convention we would not have.

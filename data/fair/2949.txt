The service was nice and the hotel just good. It wasn't quite the Ritz experience that I expected and paid for. The beach is shallow with hard coral that scraped your hands and knees..don't try to surf here. The strong undertow of the water will tumble you more than once an hour, so expect more injuries. The pool was nice, but the hotel's alcove around it only allowed sun into the sun tanning areas between 10am-4pm before the walls blocked it. Above all, becareful of the hidden costs here. There is $20 resort tax/day, $13 exercise room tax (whether you use it or not), $18 valet service (that we were not aware of so we tipped $10 each time on top), and ~$20 transient accpoodation tax. It was a nice stay, but not the luxurious Ritz experience that I was expecting and paid for. I thought the Sheraton Maui was nicer and more price-appropriate.

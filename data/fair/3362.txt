This should have been a great hotel but so much went wrong. It is in a great location- one block from the Quarter and on a great funky street with great little clubs. First, we got a room right on the street (#302). It was so noisy. I would not get Room #101 either since it is right on the street too. The room has 2 large stained glass windows (without curtains) that let in the street lights, you could read by the light at night. The bathroom fan did not work and we reported the malfunction every day and the clerks acted surprised each time. Bathroom was grungy and mildewy everywhere. When we got there the bathroom had USED soap in it and i seriously doubt it had really been cleaned between guest visits. The maid made the bathroom dirtier every time she came. I had to 'mop up' the dirt, hair, etc. she tracked in each day with my used towel each day. The one blessing was not seeing cockroaches or getting bitten by bed bugs. The towels give 'battleship gray' a new meaning. The Continental breakfast is highly exaggerated on the website. The staff acted like I was insane when I asked for just ONE luggage stand (didn't have anything to put your suitcase on). Also acted like I was crazy when I asked for a chair (there was only one- room was a double queen). You have to be blind drunk to appreciate this room.

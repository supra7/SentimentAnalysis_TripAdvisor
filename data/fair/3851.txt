This is a very cool, interesting Hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. The only problem (and it was a big one) is that the Gaslamp Plaza Suites is located right smack in the middle of most of the clubs in the gaslamp district. We stayed here on a Saturday night and the noise from the street kept us up until about 2:30 AM. This was pounding music from the clubs and cars, as well as the sounds of people out on the street. It may be better on weeknights or on higher floors (we were on the 4th floor.) After this, I wouldn't stay here again.

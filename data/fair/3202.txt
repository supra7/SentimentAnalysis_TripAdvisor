We satyed there in early January and like the hotel. The only complaint was that the maid stole both my sleeping pills and my wifes anxiety medications, I would never thought that you would have to lock them in the safe. Lesson learned. Front desk was apologetic and offered to cover the cost if we send them a prescription. Big deal they were generic prescriptions bought at Wal Mart for $3.

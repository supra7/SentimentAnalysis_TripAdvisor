Quite a disappointing experience. I understand the hotel is at its full capacity during spring break, however I shouldn't have to or need to get up at 6am to fight a mob of people to get a poolside chair. Getting lunch was nearly impossible unless you are by the poolside. I really was looking forward to my stay at the Grand Wailea, but the happiest and most relaxed moments were far away from the hotel.

I stayed at the Grand Wailea for business for a week. I work in the travel industry and was not impressed with this hotel. While it does boast a fantastic pool and luscious tropical landscaping, it is desperately in need of a serious renovation and could use a little kick in the pants when it comes to servicing groups. The truly disappointing aspect of it all was that their occupancy was only at 60% and so was their service. The Cons: - Weathered and outdated furniture -Old 27" TV -Dirty bathrooms, the shower and tub were dingy and moldy, there were holes in our towels -We did not receive turn down service two nights in a row -Our room was generally not cleaned until the early evening -The minibar has a ziptie on it!!! -Our front door was located directly in front of one of their waterfall lagoons which smelled like a dirty fishbowl every morning -They close their cafe called "Cafe Kula" every day from 1:00-4:00pm, forcing you to either dine in one of their overpriced restaurants or venture off property in the middle of the day The Pros: -Great, large pool -Family friendly -Great beach front location -Staff is generally pleasant Final verdict: Not worth the price.

We took the kids because we thought they'd enjoy the water park and a nice getaway weekend in nice surroundings, with a great mall across the street. The water park is really the big draw for kids but other than that, this place is really nothing special. It is SO crowded. Parking is almost impossible. We parked on the street (which is still on the grounds) and our vehicle was saturated by the sprinklers. The congestion around the "resort" and mall, as well as on the grounds was a constant hassle. As for the restaurants, Rustler's Rooste is overcrowded, overpriced, and the service was lousy. Room is "OK". Since they cater to families, you'd think they'd have a microwave and fridge, but they don't. Bathroom is very small. Place is noisy, crowded, and a pain to get around. The maid stopped by to clean the room and we were getting ready to leave. She said she'd be back in 1/2 hour. We called housekeeping 8 hours later when we returned to see if we could get the room cleaned. Staff are overwhelmed. The $25 per day resort fee is a joke if you don't use the water park. This place is no resort-- trust me. It's just a massive Embassy Suites without the space, fridge or microwave. Recommended? Only if you get a smokin' deal and are specifically going for the water park. Also, if you don't mind crowds and lots of noise and traffic.

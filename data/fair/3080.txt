My husband and I booked our stay to celebrate our five year wedding anniversary. The hotel is beautiful. There are several pools, all with great ocean views. The staff at the poolside areas were fantastic. Food at poolside restaurants was very good, and bar service excellent. Probably the most helpful thing at the Westin for us was the use of the "hospitality suite." Our plane didn't leave until 10pm on our last day, so we took a snorkeling trip that day and then came back to the Westin to use the "hospitality suite" to shower and get ready for our flight. On the downside, our room, which was "upgraded" to ocean view, was really a view of the airconditioning unit(see included pictures). Also, everywhere you turn at the Westin, someone is trying to get you to buy a "Vacation Ownership" aka timeshare. This got old after awhile. The concierge was helpful, but also directed us to the timeshare presentations. The excursions she offered to book for us were more than double the price we paid elsewhere. The other thing we didn't like about the Westin is that you get nickled and dimed for everything. For example, to rent a cabana for the day $60, to use towels $25, to take a yoga class $10, etc. All of this is in addition to the $20 per day "resort fee." In addition the parking is terrible, with folks often double and triple parked in the small lot when we were there. This forces you to valet park, which is another $10. I would prefer to stay somewhere were all of these charges are included in the price of your room. I doubt we will return to this hotel.

This is an older property and it has not aged gracefully. Common areas are clean, but in need of maintenance. The rooms do not have safes! The furniture is old and tired, the closet doors are cheap and constantly fall off their tracks. No fridge, when you flush the toilet wear earplugs, maid service missed our room, and didn't come back even when I complained. Drinks are pricey and very thin. Pools are small, and decks are limited, I can imagine it is horrible around the pool when this hotel is busy. The location of the Pelican bar prep area makes the deck smell bad, you can fix this with a vent, and remove the garbage! A nice smile, and courteous demeanor does replace maintenance and needed upgrades. I hope that the management will spend more time planning and implementing improvements and less time answering(spinning) these opinions. We chose this hotel because it was a Hilton property, We will no longer be lulled by the Hilton brand.

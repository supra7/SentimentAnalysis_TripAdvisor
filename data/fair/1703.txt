You need to leave any pre-conceived notions of hotel standards firmly at the door of the Corner House before you stay here, There's no polite way to say it but this is a glorified youth hostel - a standard sadly typical of many budget London hotels. Front of House I was greetly on arrival with the words "who's gonna sort the bill out" - this was before I set foot in the room. As for the rooms, well they are very small, but in my experience the room was clean, hot water was plentiful, front screen tv in room (with only three working channels however) and a tiny but clean bathroom - so the very basics are just about covered. Breakfast consists of the same instant coffee sachets you have in your room, a milk jug, a berco boiler, some toast and some very basic cheese and ham. By basic I mean bargain basement slices. The location is good, there are two tube stations about 15 mins away, there is a 24 hour Tesco express about 5 mins away, and one of the best of the remaining Pie and Mash shops in London (Castles) is a 10 minute walk away if you want a late breakfast. The Corner House covers the bare essentials - but thats about all.

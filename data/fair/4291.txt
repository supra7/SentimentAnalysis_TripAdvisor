Big rooms,old green carpeting, yellow spots on the bathroom ceiling ,cheap and scarce bath amenities, old and small towels (no bath mat) , worn out sheets (maybe 50% polyester??) old and dirty telephone, kitchen appliances that look as if they bought in the late 70s? and on top of this drilling in the wall in the morning (building under remodeling) In few words avoid this place unless you need to be next door to the UN.

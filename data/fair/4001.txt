Staff's attitude overshadows beautifully designed hotel The hotel is typical Ian Shrager, very unique design with attention to detail. Morgan hotel is nyc has anice design as well but less attitude so I wasn expecting that form the san fran location. The rooms are a little small but that expected. The bar is gorgeous and asia de cuba is good and a nice touch to addition to the hotel for its convenience. .The hotel staff under whelms the design of the hotel. I wont characterize all of the doormen as euro-jerks as some (the guys in the morning) are very nice and helpful. The night crew are horrible. One particular individual (moron with the pony tail) is too cool (or at least he thinks he is) to do anything and he seems to go out of his way to be rude to guests and non guests. I don expect much out of doormen other than opening the door but this guy goes out of his way not to open it or not to answer any questions or get a cab. He has more of a bouncer attitude than he does a helpful doormen. I walked in with an older couple in front of me and he asked if they were staying at the hotel. He was embarrassed when they said es we have a suite here you idiot? I laughed. The bartenders aren much better (guy with the shaved head on Wednesdays needs to get a clue) Too cool to serve people drinks (other than girls with big boobs). Drinks are expensive ($8 beers/$16 martinis)) but you are paying for the bar which is very nicely designed. Front desk is hit or miss. Check in was good and check out was painful. Ian shrager should put as much work on the hotel staff attitude as he does in his design and he would have a 5 star hotel instead of a 2 star hotel because of the attitude of the select few.I wouldn go back to the clift as there are plenty of other hotels that are just as nice without the attitude.

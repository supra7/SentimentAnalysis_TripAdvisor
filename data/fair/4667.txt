This hotel was beautiful. Right off the beach, nice pool area and gorgeous grounds. I really wish the staff had been up to the same standards. Of the six days that we were there, our trash was never taken out, our sheets were not changed and our room was not vacuumed. The cleaning staff basically came in and pulled the sheets up. Every place to eat in the hotel had extremelly slow service. Even the staff at the front desk was unhelpful. They couldnt tell us where to find anything on the island. Overall, it was beautiful, but there were three resorts within walking distance which I would highly reccommend over the Sheraton.

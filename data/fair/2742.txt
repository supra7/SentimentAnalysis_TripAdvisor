We visit Las Vegas 4 to 5 times a year. We usually stay at the Golden Nugget in downtown Vegas, but had a one night between hotels, so we tried the Fremont. Just glad it was for one night. The rooms are very small and the ceilings are low in the bathroom, which makes you feel a little claustrophobic. Although the remodel has a nice contemporary feel and look, the beds were most uncomfortable and lumpy. Sorry, if there is a remodeled room why not do the mattresses too?! We'll stick to the GN as our first choice in the downtown area, and Main Street as our second choice. AND another biggie...no free internet!

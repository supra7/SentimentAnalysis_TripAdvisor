My husband and I went on our Honeymoon in July of 05. We stayed at this hotel for 4 days. The day we booked this trip with Apple vacation this hotels is alert that we are honeymooners. The day we checked in we were told that they are out of king sizes bed. So we room with 2 beds. The reception that checked us in was Not friendly at all. Maybe she had a bad day but that's no excuse. On our 2nd day we requested a king size bed and they were able to move us. They told us not to worry about the luggage and will have bellman move our luggage to new room. 10 hrs later after comming back from our long day we did not see our luggage in our new room when we were told that the lugguage will arrive before we come back. We had to called reception to track down our luggage. I find this very annoying. Our room was clean, The door to the patio was really hard to open. It made alot of noise when we tried to open it. The fridge does not work in the room. We called and asked reception and was informed that none of the fridge works in the room. I don't understand why they still have it in the room. Besides having problems with the room. we enjoyed the fact that our room is so close to the beach. The breakfast was average. It's buffet style with eggs,cereals,juice and fruits like most hotels. We did not have a chance to eat at the restaurant so sorry can't give feedback on that. The pool was very clean and nice. It wasn't to crowded. We were able to find chairs and lay out for couple of hours. Anyone looking for an average hotel to stay at I do recommend this hotel but if you are looking for luxury I suggest you shop elsewhere. Hope my experience help you decide.

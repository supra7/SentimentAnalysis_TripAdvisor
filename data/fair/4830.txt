I stayed with my wife in our europe trip. this was the worst 4 star hotel during our vacations. A nightmare trying to get to the hotel using public transportation. the brakfast was ok and the hotel is less than 2 years old. When we arrived, found a bug smashed in the wall next to the TV and hair in the bathtub.

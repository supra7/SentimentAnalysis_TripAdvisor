Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the beginning of the month. The major problem we had was the noise at night. 3 out of the 5 nights the smoke alarms went off and remained on for quite some time, they were incredibly loud and we nearly had a heart attack each time it went off. We were given no explanation for the reason as to why they repeatedly went off. There was a large group of guests on the floor we were on who decided to have a party from 11pm until 7am the next day, all night we heard girls screaming and people running down the hall, not something you want to hear when you are trying to sleep after walking all day long, due to our frustration we called the front desk several times to report this and they advised they would send somone up to check it out, nothing changed. We then pointlessly phoned again and were greeted by a woman who asked if we wanted to change rooms, not something we were willing to do at 4am, we just wanted the noise to stop. She said there was nothing more she could do so we just stayed up the rest of the night. On the plus side the restaurant was nice with good bar service. The location for a traveller is bad, we had to get the train down the road to get anywhere, there is nowhere good around the hotel to eat or shop.

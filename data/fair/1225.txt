I stayed at this hotel toward the end of July. I planned on staying for only one night, and the following night I was planned on staying in Allentown PA, near Dorney Park. Check in was smooth, I didn't have a problem with anything. The room smelled a little like burnt food, but it is expected with a full kitchen. I did notice the smoke alarms were not plugged up and immediately informed the staff. The trip seemed smooth, I had no problems up until the morning I planned on checking out. Around 8 am, someone called the room asking if we were checking out. We told them we were and they advised us that check out was 11am. We went back to sleep, a little bothered because we didn't ask for a wakeup call. Around 850am, someone knocked, then banged loudly on our door, saying "hello, are you checking out today, hello." I got up and went to the door and said yes, we told them that on the phone, the woman said "okay well check out is at 11am." My husband was furious but I calmed him down and ensured him that it was probably just a mix up. Not even an hour later, the same woman comes to our room and actually attempts to open the door, my husband was in the middle of getting dressed and if the safety lock was not on the door she would have walked in on him undressed! I was completely furious by then and when I went down to check out, I asked for the name of the woman that behaved so rudely. There was a nice young gentlemen, however, that was very apologetic and tried to put us as ease while checking out. He gave us a minor discount and apologized many times afterward. I am not the type to have anyone lose their job over this but she completely ruined my stay. I did not ask again for her name, instead I left, ensuring that I would never go to this particular hotel again.

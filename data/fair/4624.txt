No internet If promised high-speed internet is a part of why you consider this hotel, consider something else. The connection is on and off. When it is on, the speed is like coming from dialed modem. Contacting front desk is useless. They only apologize and send a guy to reload the router. Doesn't help. They also offer a dial modem for $100 which is useless too.

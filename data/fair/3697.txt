We stayed for 7 days over the Christmas period. The hotel was fully booked, but the staff were not prepared for their guests. The pool area was overcrowded, the restaurants were overwhelmed, and the maids were unable to clean all of the rooms. The facilities were not as advertised: for example, although the hotel boasts a spa, there is no facility for manicures or pedicures. The staff will give a mani on request - on a rickety table in the massage room. The staff were overworked, and the attitude was "be grateful for what you get". My margarita was not prepared properly - and the waitress said : Be glad that you got one. My room was dusty and dirty and the garbage was not emptied: and I was told by housekeeping: Be grateful -some rooms did not get cleaned till after 5pm. There was a 2 hour wait to get our car from the valet. This hotel charges a daily fee for amenities and services - too bad they don't provide access to the amenities or ensure that the service is delivered.

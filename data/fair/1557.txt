One of the attractions of staying at a Hilton is expecting a standard level of customer service and satisfaction. This hotel was beautiful, new and well kept, but the "service" provided by the staff and the management of this hotel fell well below Hilton standards. It's pretty basic to arrange wake up calls, but in this hotel, we only got one of the three arranged (not appreciated on the day of an early morning flight!). We reported minor maintenance issues in our rooms and they were not resolved until having to report them multiple times hours later. Basically, everything we spoke to the front desk and duty manager about went unresolved. Be very careful with your bill when you check out of this hotel. Do not charge anything from the bar/restaurant to your room or they will automatically add a 15% gratutity to your bill (although this practice is not posted anywhere and it comes as a surprise to the customer). They will also not be able to provide you with a breakdown/details of your restaurant/bar charges. According to the room key sleeve, they will deliver a newspaper to your room every morning, and if you refuse, they will credit your account the cost of the newspaper. Make sure you refuse this and get the credit, because even if you're a Hilton Honors member, they won't deliver any paper to your room. They don't deliver the paper to anyone. There are many good hotels in downtown Montreal. Too bad this one is such a major disappointment.

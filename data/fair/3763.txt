We stayed here for 4 days from Thurs. through Mon. on St. Patrick's day in March 2007. We were given a smoking room (which wasn't our first choice but it wasn't super horrible). Our second night there, someone knocked at the door at 3am (he was wearing a towel and nothing else) this didn't frighten me or my mom but I had a hard time trying to go back to sleep. Here is the skinny; the worst part about the hotel was going down to the check-in to get new towels everyday b/c there is no maid service until you stay past 4 nights (so no trash dump, no made beds, no new toilet paper, no tidying up), the halls were smokey (but it was a smoking floor), there were ciggy butts under the sofa that we moved a bit to set it apart from the air conditioning unit (which is in front of the window on the floor), when someone shuts their door, the whole side of that floor resonants and they allow pets (pro or con), the front door key doesn't work and you have to phone the front desk to let you in after 8pm. The best part of the hotel is that the rooms are relatively clean and newish, the bathrooms are large, to use the internet in your room, the charge is only $5 for the entire time you are there, parking is readily available for no charge, there is a partial kitchen in every room (2 burner stove, full size fridge and 2 pans w/utensils for 2, 3 glasses and coffee cups) , if you are used to a simple room with no amenities, this is much better and it was safe for me and mom. I can't comment on the pool b/c we did not use it and the free breakfast is only Mon.-Fri. 6:30am-9am and we missed it. It served our purposes and I've certainly stayed in much worse places, but the "no maid service" was a bit buggy.

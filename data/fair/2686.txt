We came to daytona just to get away from the chilly north. We checked in late and the front desk staff was very nice. We got up to the room and the hallway looked like it hadnt been kept up well, doors had chipped paint and had a funny odor. The room was very spacious and a large area for the bathroom so that we could all get ready. Which is very important when your traveling with four other girls. We are very concious about bed bugs so we checked the beds which they were clean but the mattress pad/cover had a large yellow stain that looked like pee. We called the desk and they sent up a whole new set of sheets right away. We had a nice view of the ocean and it had a balcony which was nice. However the only concern was that there was no door or curtain on the closet so all of our things were just out in the open. Our weekend weather was bad, very very windy and rainy all weekend so although the beach was right there we could not go in the ocean. Our last night there the winds were so bad that it was hard to walk to the car and the doors swung open or slammed getting in and out, and our parking pass had flown out when we returned around 1030pm. We asked the desk if we would be okay without one and she said no and made us a new one. However none of us wanted to venture back outside because it was raining and the winds were absolutely rediculous so we asked if we could skip putting it in since we were leaving in the morning anyways and the woman said no we absolutely had to put it in. I found it absurd that they would force someone to go outside in weather like that just to put a hangtag in for one night. Although the restaurant does not serve dinner there are plenty of places close by the eat.

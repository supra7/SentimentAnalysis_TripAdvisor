While the hotel was pretty with nice pools, I was unhappy with the front desk staff upon checkout. I had asked for a late checkout of 2:00. At first I was told I could have a late checkout of 1, but would have to pay a full days rate if I wanted 2. After further questioning I learned that the hotel was fully booked. I decided to speak to the manager when he came in. After explaining my questions and concerns and explaining how unhappy with the service, I explained that I heard of this hotel from trip advisor and would be posting a comment on your site. The manager then threatened to call the sheriff and have me publicly evicted if I was going to write me comments. Therefore I can no longer recommend this hotel!

OK for the money I paid Stay here 2/19/05 to 2/25/05 for $70 per nightWeek rental car $211This hotel's location can't be beat if you can get it at a right price ($70 or below per night) We arrived late at aorund 11pm and the hotel was fully booked, but our room was ready. The room was clean and neat. We were on the 8th floor and had a little view of the beach. The only problem I had with this hotel room was the bath room. It had a very bad urine smell that would not go away. We even had brought our own scented candles and that didn't do it.The only other problem I've encounter was a very rude man that works at the parking booth. I left the one week parking ticket voucher to him and he told me to pick it up when I return. When I return, I didn't know if I should push for another ticket from the machine or not, so I hong the horn, but he did not repsond. So, I did it again and this must of tick him off. He then with a very rude tone told me to take another ticket. I asked him wouldn't I be charged again and again with a rude tone he said NO DON'T WORYY, I TOLD YOU TO GO AHEAD.....Man, this guy was bad......Overall the hotel was OK if you're not in there a lot and just need a bed to sleep. But, if you are looking for better services and fancy setup, then this is not your choice.I would stay here again...........Frankie Lam

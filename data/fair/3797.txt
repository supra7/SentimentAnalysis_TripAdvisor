My wife, 13 yr old son and 11 yr old girl stayed at the Grand for 1 week during a relocation trip. The resort has some nice features. The waterpark was fun. The restaurants were good and the employees were nice. They would transport you on golf carts if you asked. However, there were some glaring deficiencies also. We stayed in a "Mountainside" 2 queen suite. - Our room's carpet was severely stained. - The sheets and blanket in the sleeper sofa was stained. - The bathroom had small, curly hairs on the floor when we arrived. - We found a dirty diaper under one of the beds. - The Rt10 highway is directly next to the building which provided plenty of road noise. - They don't have the service capacity to handle the amount of guests at the resort. We gave up trying to get in touch with the Concierge and on most occasions had to wait on hold for an extended length to get an operator. - Getting a seat at the restaurants without several day advanced reservations is nearly impossible. - They sent me an email for feedback, but the link does not work. If this was a $69 Motel 6, the rooms were ok. But we expected alot more for the money we paid.

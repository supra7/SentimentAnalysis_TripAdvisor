We won't be returning to this Westin. It's was not worth what we paid for. To our standards the hotel is below average. The rooms are very small, parking is super expensive and their is lots of construction in the area, so it wasn't a peaceful sleep at night (even though the beds are very comfortable. It's about a one mile + walk to Gaslamp Quarters.

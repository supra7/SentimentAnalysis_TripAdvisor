I thought I picked a hotel in a great location. And it was relative to nearness to Michigan Ave and good restaurants. However, within minutes of checking into our room we become very aware we next to a major medical center that has ambulances arriving all day and all night. I now know every type of different siren in Chicago. Perhaps there are rooms where the noise is not so obvious, but I made the mistake of booking an upgraded room (at an upgraded cost) with extra large king beds so my teenage sons could be comfortable. Apparently, those rooms are all on the side of the hotel facing the street. Hotel offered a smaller room with smaller beds not facing the street but not until our 2nd day when we were out of the hotel the whole day. So if you don't mind ambulence noise, whistles blowing to call cabs, noisy air conditioners, and rooms without room darkening curtains, this might be a good hotel for you.

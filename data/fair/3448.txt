Having stayed in the Larchmont many years ago and having a fantastic experience, this trip came as a huge disappointment. Bell staff lovely, unfortunately our room and shared facilities were a complete disgrace. Although smoking has been banned for some years our room smelt of stale smoke and damp. The blinds in both windows were broken, and the carpet was sticky! The bathroom was a complete disgrace though, the shower plug hole was so blocked by hair that the bath would fill with water, on one trip to the shower, there was blood over the floor and toilet, I complained immediately to reception who said they would have it cleaned, when returning to the shower half an hour later, someone had been up and wiped the floor and toilet with a towel that they then left behind the door! After numerous complaints the shower was finally cleaned on our final day. The location is great and although we had a great trip it was ruined by the thought of having to return to the hotel at the end of the day.

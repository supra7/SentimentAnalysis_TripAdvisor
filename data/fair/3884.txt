My family and I stayed at surfer beach hotel in a jr. suite march 2005. The staff was very nice, however would have expected a better view for being in a suite it was stuck in the corner. When I pulled out the sofa bed for my kids to sleep on I had to move a dresser with a tv on it all the way against the wall, move the sofa against the wall and then there was barely enough room to lay the bed out. Then if you wanted to use the bathroom or balcony you had to step on the bed to get over it and to the bathroom. Whom ever designed this room didnt think it through very well. Other than that it was good. The restaurant attached to the hotel is great.

We had stayed at this beautiful hotel on our honeymoon in 2003 and decided to return again on our latest visit to Maui. From the moment we checked in, I started having second thoughts about staying here. The front desk staff seemed mildly annoyed that we were bothering them to check in. The room we had requested was taken and we were led to a room that was not nearly as nice as the one we remembered, and we paid even more for it this time. The second day of our stay my husband and I were having a good time going down the slide. On my last run, I felt a thud on the side of my head, but didn't think too much of it until one of the other swimmers yelled at me that I was bleeding from my head. Apparently, as I popped out of the slide chute, I slammed my head on one of the boulders outlining the pool. The hotel security took me to a back room where they called medics to look at my wound. Thankfully, I didn't have a concussion, but I did need to have stitches. Once I was deemed healthy enough to walk, the security guard pointed my husband in the direction of the nearest medical facility and we drove ourselves there. Eight stitches later, we returned to the hotel. We never heard from anyone at the hotel to check in on how I was doing - no phone call, no note, no nothing. I didn't expect anything from them except common courtesy and compassion and perhaps a call from the manager on duty. Two days later we checked out and again, the front desk was less than friendly. We've told this tale to several people and have been told that the hotel does a great job of marketing to reel the people in, but their customer service is severely lacking once you check-in. Needless to say, we will never return to this property and tell people all the time to stay somewhere else.

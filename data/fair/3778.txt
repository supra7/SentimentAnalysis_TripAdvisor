I was with a friend for a short golf holiday to the Phoenix area and one of he courses I picked was the course at the Arizona Grand Resort. The only decent part of the course was the back nine, there were quite a few interesting desert type holes. The front nine however for the most part reminded me of a cheap municipal course that you might find anywhere. Also the practice range was terrible, it was a very small area and they had kind of sponge type balls which were really a waste of time hit. If you go to this place to play don't count on getting in any practice. Even the practice putting green was a joke, it was beside the first tee off area and the putting green was small and had but 3 holes on it. When I was there, there were about 12 people all trying to practice their putting with but the 3 holes! Besides the back nine which was decent, the only other plus for this place was their brunc h which was nice. The room was very pleasant with a nice view towards the golf course and the food selections were pretty good. Overall if you are mainly going for golf, my recommendation would be to find somewhere else.

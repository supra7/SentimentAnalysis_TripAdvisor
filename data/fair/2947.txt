The grounds of the Ritz Carlton Kapalua were lovely and pleasant to stroll around, which was a good thing considering the state of our hotel room. We had a reservation for an ocean view room and ended up on a ground floor room with a partial view. The first day we checked in, we found two very large mosquitoes on our walls. That evening, we found another insect in the bathroom that looked like a cross between a cockroach and a beetle that eventually escaped through a large crack in the wall just under the sink area. The following night, the same type of insect appeared again, this time about the size of a dragonfly. A very strong moldy smell permeated throughout the room every time the A/C was switched on. The bedding was very damp and also smelled of mold throughout our three night stay. The drinking glasses in the room were also very dirty with lipstick prints still visible on the rims. We could also hear the people in the room above us using their bathtub. The noise of the water running was so loud that it sounded like it was coming from our bathroom and consequently woke us up. While the Ritz maintained nice scenery and a friendly staff, the conditions of our room were unacceptable, especially considering the rate. Problems listed above should not exist in a three star hotel, let alone a five star hotel.

This was our experience. With the pictures on their website we thought we would pull up to something MUCH nicer. Check in was fine and the man was quite nice. We even received a bag of cookies. Upon walking to our room we noticed the landscaping and pool area not to be anything like the pictures. It was in dire need of attention. Upon entering our room we were SHOCKED. The rugs were dirty, the furniture is old and dirty and in poor condition. The baseboard molding had tons of dust on it. It grossed us out. The overall appearance of the inside of the room is poor. Clogged sinks, leaky toilet, dirty conditions in shower area. The maid service is terrible. They barely clean the rooms before you check in and while we stayed there for three days our beds weren't made until after 5:00 in the afternoon and towels, facecloths and bath mats were taken but not replenished. Why???? They only give you shampoo and a bar of soap. The water is hard so a conditioner is a must. We had to go to Walgreens across the street to purchase some. Also bring your own lotion and dirty laundry bag because you don't get those either. We also had a room where they stored their garbage bags throughout the day outside our door. It smelled great in the 90 degree heat. We never used the pool because it was always overcrowded and we were afraid of catching something. We have stayed at many hotels with our 3 children before. NEVER have we stayed at one so poorly taken care of or so neglected with such POOR room service. The best perk of this hotel is that it is within a 10 minute or so drive to most disney resorts and parks. We also enjoyed the all you can eat breakfast buffet. Many choices, delicious and it was nice and hot. The employees for the food area were nice and polite. So our review to you is....if you are looking for a great breakfast stay here. If you are looking for a nice room stay somewhere else.

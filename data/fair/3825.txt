We went for a convention and were sadly disappointed. When we walked into the room, a hugh stain greeted us on the carpet. Generally run down. There was no spa...had to go across the street to Merle Norman. Food was good, not great. Concierge not very helpful, but doormen always polite and friendly. Not worth the money! We left and went to Sedona!

I would never recommend this hotel. The beds are very uncomfortable. The bathroom had mildew. We were supposed to have a courtyard view but it was of a brick wall and we paid extra for the view. It is in a good location and the staff tried to be helpful. The breakfast is only coffee, fruit and sweet rolls.

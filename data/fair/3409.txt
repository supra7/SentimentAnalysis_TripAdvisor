We were booked into a suite with two queen beds. Upon arrival, they put us in a suite with one king bed. It took two days, and dealing with 7 unhelpful front desk employees and managers to remedy their mistake. We had to pay additional money to get a rollout bed, despite this being the hotel's mistake. The bellman and housekeeping staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel had one ice machine on the 8th floor, and no soda or vending machines. Breakfast ended promptly at 8:55 am (if not sooner). The rooms were clean, but very outdated. One of the tables fell to pieces when we moved it to make room for the rollout bed. It was nice having a mini fridge in the room, but a microwave would have been great. In the second room we got, the tub drained very slowly when you showered.

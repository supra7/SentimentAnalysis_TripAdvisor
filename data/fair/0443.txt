This hotel was just awful. First of all we booked the hotel for one night with two adults and two children. When we checked in we went up to our room and had one king size bed. So my husband went down to switch to two beds. He came back and neither one of the keys would work. So we waited another 15 minutes for a new key. The manager came up with two keys. No apology. So we get in our room and change and go out for dinner. We come back and niether key will work again. Again we wait for another manager and again no apology. The beds are really comfortable. So we get up in the morning and we did the race for the cure. We come back with just 30 minutes to change, shower and be on our way to the airport and again not one of our 4 keys work. So once again a new manager arrives 15 minutes later with two more keys and no apology. We are Hilton Diamond members and I think we will be staying with Hiltons.

We stayed in the Maui Lu with much trepidation this past summer. We were going to be staying five nights at the Westin Maui on points but needed to stay somewhere for two nights prior. Not wanting to spend a lot of money especially since we got in so late the first night we decided to check the Maui Lu out. Overall I have to say it was as bad as people say but also acceptable for the price as long as you can get it dirt cheap. There was definitely the bad. Like the first night I was biten by ants all night and was itchy all over. We asked to be moved to another room the next day and they were very accomodating. We ended up on the second floor and although I did see ants in the bathroom at least they did not journey into the bedroom. The rooms are definitely worn and tired but for budget accomodations and budget prices it was acceptable. The pool was so murky that you cannot see your feet and if you dropped something in it and tried to retrieve it good luck. My husband joked that there are bodies in there that have not been found. The pool did not seem dirty just very murky. I think the filtration system needs repair like the rest of the resort. They do offer nice towels for the pool at the activities centre. What I did like about the Maui Lu besides the location is its spacious well kept grounds. With two kids it gave them plenty of room to roam. I also liked the microwave, breakfast tables and free coffee that they gave in the mornings. Our family would go to the local supermarket and come back with breakfast items and eat them on the tables sipping good coffee and enjoying the ocean view. So would I stay here again? Only if they can gurantee that I will not get a ground floor room and I got a super cheap rate. I would however stay at the Westin Maui on points.

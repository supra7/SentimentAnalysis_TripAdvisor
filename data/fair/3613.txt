We recently stayed at the W Hotel (Lexington Ave) and were disappointed. I'm okay with the small rooms, even at the higher level we are in Starwood's membership level, since the only thing I do in a hotel room is sleep and shower. With that expectation the shower and bed need to be good. Unfortunately the shower had no water pressure. My wife refused to wash her hair for fear she'd never ger the soap out. It was a lousy shower! The bed was wobbly. Every time I or my wife turned over the whole bed would move. Get a screwdirver and wrench and tighten the thing up! Two lousy nights of sleep. The lobby scene is always fun at any W and this one is no exception. As long as you're not in the room it is a good hotel.

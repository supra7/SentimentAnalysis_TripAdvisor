The only nice thing at this resort is the water park, but you have to get in line at least an hour before it opens to get a chair. Our TV's in our room are so old that the picture has lines going through it. Service at the on site restaurants are awful. Were seated then waited 10 minutes and never got served or even noticed. The deli they are not friendly at all. The two off site restaurants that allow you to charge to your room are good but dont forget your card that is in your packet when you check in that they dont explain to you or you cant charge it to your room. Have little ants on our vanity which were all over our tooth brushes, even after they said they would take care of it. When we went to management we were given $50 to spend at the pool area on food (but it cost us over $100 to feed four people). You could here other guests stating that rooms at Marriott are way nicer than here. The workout area is also really nice and a ton of great equipment. But at $350 a night it isn't worth it.

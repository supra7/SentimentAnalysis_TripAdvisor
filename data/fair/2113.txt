We were there for a meeting. Our room was tired and grubby. We upped the reservation to have a larger room with a seating area but they simply added regular chairs and a small table. Certainly there was no crisp bed linen, which made me wonder... The air conditioner was extremely noisy. It is difficult to assess the hotel food since we don't know what was selected by the meeting organizers: The food that we were served was cafeteria level quality (e.g., pressed turkey, yuk), though they did have Starbucks coffee which was the high point of most meals. Strangely, the service was very good and everybody was friendly. Fortunately the meeting was cut short by Hurricane Irene and we only had to stay one night. We would never, ever organize a meeting at this hotel and we would never recommend it to others.

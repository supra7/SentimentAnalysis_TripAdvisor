THE BAD (scroll down for GOOD): Despite the fact staying here was essentially "free" to me (I was in Dallas for an employer-paid conference) I would not stay there again, free or otherwise. The hotel is old and they've upgraded it in an attempt to make it "boutique" but it falls far short. Lobby is dark and cramped. Rooms are small and smelly. Two elevators, both slow, one failed to run most of the 4 days I was there, so most guests used a cramped stairwell. Bathrooms are tiny and details are terrible (i.e. rust, missing screws, shoddy workmanship). The pillows were sponge and smelled of cigarette smoke. I could hear the alarm clock of my next-door neighbor, plus the sound of his shower curtain rings each morning as he opened the curtain to take a shower. The hotel was well staffed, but the staff are not properly trained in customer service (i.e. basics such as eye contact). Concierge service is lacking: desk staff do not know their own area. For example, the first night I asked for a quick place to eat and was directed to a McDonalds several blocks away and on the other side of a Greyhound bus station. I learned the next night that in another direction was the West End with a plethora of places to eat. THE GOOD: The hotel offers a free shuttle to anywhere w/in a 3 mile radius (which includes the Museum of Art and Nasher Sculpture Center). Internet is free in rooms, or there is a shared computer in the lobby. The hotel locks its doors late at night so you have to buzz to get in. Free continental breakfast, although it was not quality. Two bottles of water free per day, or $1 for additional. It's just a few blocks from the West End where there are some small restaurants. It's a few blocks from the JFK museum. It's walking distance to the Convention Center.

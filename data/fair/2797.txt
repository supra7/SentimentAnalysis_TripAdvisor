I was looking forward to the Grand Wailea after I had seen it on the travel channel. I was not able to stay there the entire time I was on Maui, because of price. I used Hilton pts for 2 nights. The first 2 nights on Maui were spent at the Marriott next to Grand Wailea....beautiful by the way...anyway. As we checked in, confirmation in hand, I was told there was a additional charge for having 4 people in the room. No where on my conf did it say that and I booked it for 4 people. Conf stated 4 people and 2 double beds. The woman checking us in had nothing to say except that is the rules. I asked to speak to the manager, but she just happened to step into a meeting at that exact moment. So, I asked for a phone call. Did I receive a call the 2 days we were there.....no!!!! The additional $200 they got from us, was the only money they got from us. We refused to eat or buy anything on that property. We walked to the shopping center and had the best breakfast on the island at Longhi's.......highly recommend! I agree with all the other comments regarding the chairs.....good luck! I basically stalked people and once they got up I would grab the chairs......so much for relaxing. I would not recommend this property to anyone even if you are staying for free.....because what I thought was going to be free.....ended up costing me and taking away from my excursions. Stay at the Marriott.....great property, pools, location and the food at the pool is great.

We liked the location as we had a car ($28 a night for parking) as it was only one block from the freeway so we didn't have to negotiate many streets. However, we found all the staff from the reception staff, bar staff to the exec lounge staff had a superior attitude to tourists especially. We booked an executive room & had to return to check in to make sure it was actualy an executive room as it was so small, also very noisy right beside the lifts. After one night we asked to be moved & got a much nicer room. The Executive lounge was really just the restaurant. After it closed at 2pm it then became the lounge.There was no complimentary breakfast for Exec room guests, so we considered the rate poor value for money. The website cleverly does not make it clear what the executive lounge provides.. I wouldn't go back - there were lots of hotels around the same area - will research better next time.

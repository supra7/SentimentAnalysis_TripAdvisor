This hotel is very old. Fist of all, when we arrived there, no one wanted to help us with our bags. When walking to our room, I was already getting bad vibes, doors to room looked ancient & old. When you arrived in the room . . . OH NO! It was very small in there. We had to order a small fridgerator that was supposed to come with the room. They finally came around about a hour later. When we had to go to the bathroom - oh no - it was of European style, about a 3 feel wide shower. It was very difficult to take a nice shower there. There was absolutely nothing nice about the room, it had the basics: beds, tv, phone - that's it, not even a picture frame. Rugs were stained & FREEZING COLD throughout our whole stay. I definately would NOT recommend this place for the price. I have been to much nicer places, for half the price.

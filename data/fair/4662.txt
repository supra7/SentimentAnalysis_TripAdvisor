OK it was a bit of a dump but not as bad as some things I read, at least I was prepared for the worse. We only stayed on night until we could get into our condo. It was a bit dirty, we ordered an extra blanket to cover the couch and sit on. I have never seen so much rain, the roof didn't leak. We were in the "Honymoon Suite" on the corner of the building next to the beach, room had an OK loft where the bed was located and the sheets seemed to be clean. People working there were very nice, if your on a budget and just need a place to put your head I guess it would be OK.

Beautiful hotel, and amenities. BUT! Booked 2 months in advance. When we got there with that LONG TIME RESERVATION. They said the 1st night was o.k.(3 days). But the next two were NOT?! They would TRY to help, but could NOT guarantee! Room was $100 than quoted, only when getting a mgr. involved the NEXT a.m., no one at the p.m. could make a decision,was a adjustment made. Left next day. Boston is nice ,and picturesque but a NIGHTMARE to navigate. Stayed at the new(7 mos. old) Renissance and was great. $120 per cheaper. Nicer amenities, incl.37" lcd/h.d. t.v. great new health facility, and outstanding customer service. Would HIGHLY recommend.

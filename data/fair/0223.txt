I usually go out of my way to stay at Hilton's. Boy was I dissapointed with the Hilton Seattle. Location is very good. The rest kinda sucks. The Lobby is an Alamo Car rental office. You take an elevator to the 12th floor where the lobby there is ok at best. The rooms are Very small, bathrooms smaller. And nothing recently upgraded. Breakfast free, but think Hampton Inn. Air conditioner loud and a window unit. This Hotel is very HamptonInnish at best. Badly needs an upgrade. I turned down the Fairmont to get my Hilton points. What a dissapointment. Was embarassed as I had a colleague traveling with me. Can't believe you put your name on this one Hilton. I expected better from you,

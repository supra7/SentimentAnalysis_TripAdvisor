Staff at check-in were apathetic and not well trained (taking 15 minutes to type in an already-reserved room to the system is not good, esp. for NY). Room was very small, even for NYC. Interior quality was dated and in need of a makeover -- furniture shopworn and walls needed painting/papering. A/C system was filthy and began squeaking loudly at 3:30am, waking me up. Bathroom large but had no ventilation execept for window which was difficult to open. Upon checkout, was told that late departure would cost $25, then charged $75 for a three-hour period!!!! Charge was refunded, but I was not told that charge was PER HOUR! What is this, a flop-house?

On our honeymoon we stayed at the Sheraton Maui in Lahaina. We had booked an ocean view room, but after checking in, our view of the ocean was not at all what we had envisioned. We were on the ground floor looking at a couple palm trees and 95% green grass and the concierge's hut. After reading through the Sheraton's satisfaction guarantee, we decided to ask for an upgraded room. We were met with a bit of opposition and told an upgrade might not be possible due to overbooking. After much debate, we got our way, and we moved the following day to the 6th floor, directly above our previous room. The hotel clerk assured us that it was a much, much nicer room. Well if losing about 25% of the previous room's size and 75% of the balcony meant nicer, than I guess that's what we got! I called the front desk again and they transferred me to the manager (which in all honesty, I don't believe I was speaking to the manager). I was told that our "upgrade" was the view and that the actual rooms got smaller the higher the level of the building. The view was much better, but it still wasn't what we wanted. So, I asked for a suite and I was told they were all sold out and there was nothing else they could do. Some satisfaction guarantee huh? lol Also of note. The rooms themselves were not very clean. Our bathroom in both rooms were filthy. The light fixtures literally had a coating of dust on them. The pillows on the beds are more or less worthless. They are like sleeping on pieces of paper with the way they disperse when you lay on them. Maybe we were being a bit to picky, but when you're on your honeymoon, you want it to be absoultely perfect. Oh well, you live and you learn. The beach and water is very nice though. Perfect for snorkeling and scuba diving. Tons of activities line the beach and shopping and dining is all within walking distance. Regardless, of the pros, the cons far out weigh them. This is one hotel we will not return to.

Let me preface this by saying I have been slacking for a couple years with writing reviews but felt compelled after a couple nights at the Hotel Max. Also, we planned this trip very last minute so I didnt get a chance to go through as many reviews as I would have liked before we booked. Well, this hotel does have some good things going for it, but none of them could outweigh the negatives enough to recommend this place to anyone. One, yeah the rooms are small. This was pretty much the joke of our trip. The bathroom size is reminiscent of those in an airplane or RV. I'm not a huge guy, 5'9", 155, and it was nearly impossible to stand in the shower without touching one of the walls. But a positive about the size, you can brush your teeth, use the toilet, and take a shower from standing in one spot. The room itself is nicely appointed but TINY  even by European standards. No real dresser to put clothes in and nowhere to sit except for the bed. There is a desk chair but really unusable due to the size of the room. Beds are very soft, which my girlfriend liked, but I woke up with a sore back both mornings we were there. The other off putting thing about the room aside from the size, was the main piece of artwork that appeared to be an abstract of a shirtless male with a ball gag in his mouth (see pic). Were not prudes but not really into that either. On that note we chose not to purchase the $30 Intimacy Kit w/ Intimacy ring from the mini bar. After we got there we wished we would have booked the Westin a couple blocks away or somewhere down on the waterfront. But the Max was tolerable for a couple nights and we had a great time in Seattle. Kells Irish Pub was a good time and the clam chowder was great everywhere.

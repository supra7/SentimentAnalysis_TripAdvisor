I spent one night at the Eighth Avenue Inn with my daughter. When we checked in, the hotel did not have the reservation and we had to wait about half an hour while they waited for Orbitz to fax the reservation details. We had made the reservation two weeks in advance. The person working at the front desk was not very friendly. We were told there were no non-smoking rooms available with two beds despite the fact that the people in front of us had been offered one (they chose smoking). I am very sensitive to cigarette smoke and asked the desk clerk if we could get a non-smoking room with a single bed and a roll-away cot. I was told the cot would be an extra $8. So, out of principle, I decided to take the smoking room instead of having to pay for the cot, which I thought was ridiculous. When we entered the room, it was like entering a very nasty smokey bar. To make things worse, we went downstairs later and overheard several guests being checked into non-smoking rooms with two beds. I don't know why we were told there were none of these rooms available. Perhaps it was because we booked the room at such a low rate. Even if I was a smoker I would have probably been disgusted. We open the windows as wide as we could and hoped for the best. Despite the occasional squealing tires and sound of bottles being broken in the parking lot behind the hotel, we kept the windows open all night. It helped a little. Other than the smoke drenched furniture and drapes, the room was relatively clean. The sheets smelled like bleach and the bathroom appeared to be clean. There was also a nice little fridge and microwave in the room. I would not have minded the room so much if it did not reek of smoke. It was also walking distance to the Space Needle, Experience Music Project, etc.

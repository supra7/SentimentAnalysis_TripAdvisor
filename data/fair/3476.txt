Stayed at the time for two nights and was unimpressed. The floors were dirty in the rooms and the hallways. The door to my room looked as if some had tried to kick it down or open it with a crow bar. In my second room the cloth covering for the closet had been torn down and no one had bothered to replace it. Caulking was cracking and pealing around the room. There were hairs around the room that wer not mine. The water in the shower dribbled out....I could go on, but you get the idea.

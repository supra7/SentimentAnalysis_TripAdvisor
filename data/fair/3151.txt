Don't expect 4 Star Service and you will be fine The Marseilles is in a great location, one of the best locations in South Beach, close to everything!We had a large group of people staying at this hotel and every room was completely different which adds to the charm. Although they were not without problems. The cleanliness left something to be desired. Many of the problems were purely cosmetic and the rooms were in need of some improvements but none of them were filthy.There were some rooms that smelled of urine and our room had trouble with the air conditioning - Thank goodness that during our stay it never got above 70.The staff was not motivated to offer any help and half the time unwilling to help when asked. BE CAUTIOUS when it comes to your bill - they messed up everyone's bill in some way - and make sure to check your credit card bill when you get it because one person in our group was charged twice for her stay!On a positive note, this hotel is on the beach, has a nice pool and lounging area, a bar, restaurant and a sidewalk cafe.

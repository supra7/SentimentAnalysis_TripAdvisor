I had recently lost my father so I wanted to book a special weekend for my mom and I to get away. I saw the "Girls on the Edge" package available at the Edgewater Hotel website. I even called the night before to confirm the package. Upon checking in we had to remind them of the package and they told us it would be sent up. After returning from Pikes Market, there was no package waiting for us. So we had to call again. The package consisted of magazines, manicure set, cocktails and a couple of movies and breakfast the following day. When they delivered the basket to our room, half was missing and an old subscription of magazines was delivered. Well we settled for going out to dinner and then return to our girls night in to relaxe with a couple of movies. When we tried to get transportation from the space needle restaurant, that we were told was available to guests to get around downtown, we were given the run around and told a taxi would be easier and not told the would pay for it. So we walked back and looked forward to relaxing to a good movie, but every single movie selection was "sold out". I called down to the desk and the lame excuse I recieved was everyone must be in there room with the same idea, I said this was part of our package, she said she would take it off the bill. The next morning they slipped our bill under the door. The movie was not taken off and it was 250.00 more than I booked it online. I had to negotiate to get it down to 60.00 more than I had booked it for with a terrible disappointment at a very sad time in our lives. I do not reccomend this hotel unless you want to get ripped off!!!!!

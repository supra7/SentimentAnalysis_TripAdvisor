The only thing of note about this hotel is it's location- by far the best location right on the beach, with plenty to do just outside of the hotel's doors. That's about where the positives end. Rooms are extremely outdated (decor and amenities), service is MISERABLE (I was not asked a single time if I was enjoying my stay, even when correcting a billing issue from valet), and eating on property is wildly expensive. This hotel is really in need of a major facelift, and probably some new management who actually have customer service principles. I would say avoid this hotel if possible, even a cheap rate didn't make it worth it to me...

We stayed at this hotel twice during our visit for a family wedding. After the first night, our son had three bites that turned out to be bedbugs (which we found out later). During the second stay (two nights later), and after sleeping in the room, we discovered bedbugs in the bed. We requested a second room which was also infested. Checked out, received a refund for the unused night. The employees "didn't know how this could happen", even when provided with evidence of the bugs. Other than this, hotel was pleasant enough, basic services, friendly staff. We did not see any adult bugs indicating that this was an early-stage infestation and could be dealt with relatively easily if they would act on it.

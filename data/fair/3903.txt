We have stayed at the Cow Hollow for several years. The past two years it has really gone down hill. The service at the front desk has always been horrible. They are just down right rude. If you ask for anything specific, backside room, king, etc., they say they will honor it. Most of the time that is ignored. Also, the street noise is increasingly horrible. I have always had a noise machine, but even that did not help this time. I am looking elsewhere for the next trip. Too bad, they used to do a better job. The rooms are very rundown now. Desks with no lamps, bathtubs with no stoppers. They are full because the price is good, but not worth being tired and exasperated for the whole trip.

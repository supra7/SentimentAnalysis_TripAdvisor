The hotel is conveniently placed for Euston and St Pancras which is why we chose it. The staff seemed helpful and our room was clean but the rooms are not like other Travelodges we've stayed in. They're much smaller and rather cramped. The major complaint we had was the noise. The sound proofing was non existent and the double glazed windows didn't keep any traffic noise out at all (it was almost as if the windows were open!).

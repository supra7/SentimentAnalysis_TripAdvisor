Big mistake for honeymoon. Room overpriced and small. View lousy. Kids in the hot tub and all over the place -- parents taking advantage of daily free brunch for children under 12, no doubt. Surfer bum slept in hallway outside hotel room on our final night. Parking lot always full. Long waits to talk to staff. Spa was terrific, but, on the whole, not appropriate for romantic retreat. More of a family spot, w/busy day at Disneyland as model. Couples w/o kids, stay away. Parents, this is your spot.

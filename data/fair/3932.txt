inexpensive, good location, okay room This hotel is located in a great spot and rooms are a bargain rate, but the atmosphere leaves much to be desired. Our room was clean but reading was nearly impossible because of the poor lighting. Bathroom was older, but clean. If you aren't into luxury, then this is a hotel for you...clean, older, no view, but a good rate.

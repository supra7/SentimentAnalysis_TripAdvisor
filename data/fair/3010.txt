For a Starwood property the room quality is very poor. As a Gold member, we were placed in room 970 adjacent to the elevator shaft. Our room wraps around the Beach Tower elevator shaft. Avoid this room. Due to a late checkin because of a delayed flight, and an at capacity hotel, there were no other rooms. Location was good, but sneezing at night with the air conditioner going, and hearing the elevator constantly going up and down gives our experience a 2 thumbs down.

While the room itself was ok (with the exception of the splatters of...something...on the wall next to the bed), it was exceptionally noisy, both with freeway traffic right outside the window (and I live in NYC, so I'm used to traffic...but this was excessive) and the walls/floors were paper thin. The person staying above me paced like crazy ALL night (from 10pm until 4:30am when I left) and it sounded like he/she was IN my room stomping. I didn't sleep at all because of it. I would start to drift off and "THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP." This was strange, too, because I didn't see another person in the hotel (with the exception of the man at the front desk) the entire time I was there. It's also in what seems to be a fairly sketchy part of town, with strip clubs next door. I feared for the state of my rental car in the parking lot, but luckily, no harm came to it (or me). Overall, it was not at all a pleasant experience, and I would not go back or recommend it to others.

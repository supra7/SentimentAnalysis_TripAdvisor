We were excited to check out the newly remodeled El Cortez while in town on business. We were told by some locals that the owner had done an amazing job restoring the place. Yikes! there are some things that shouldn't be restored then. This is one of those smoky entrances with slots in your face and the bellman was avidly biting his nails when I checked in at the front desk. Upon arrival to my room it appeared they'd forgotten to put a bedspread. Without it on, I was able to see the mattress was severely deformed. I requested to be transferred to another room. Same lack of bedspread but at least the mattress appeared flat. This place is poorly done and I would not advise staying here. Check out the Golden Nugget instead. Rates are about the same and MUCH nicer.

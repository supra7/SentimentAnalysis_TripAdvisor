I just stayed for 4 days...there are problems! Most importantly, I came back to my room after working all day and the door to my room was left OPEN by the maid (I guess). Don't know for how long, nothing appeared to be missing. When I first got to my room, I removed the bedspread, as I always do, and the blanket was so old it was crunchy with several holes worn through. Actual holes! It was changed the next day, upon my request. Apparently , it is a contract hotel for a truccking company. In the morning at breakfast there are truckers at breakfast speaking loudly & on their cell phones speaking loudly. Not a comfortable environment for a business woman. I dropped a used tissue in the toilet before I left in the morning and it was still there when I came back at the end of the day after my room was cleaned. The reason that I chose this hotel was beacuse of the shuttle service. It turned out to be unreliable & erratic. It was 32 minutes late for the promised time to pick us up at the end of the work day, with us waiting outside in the heat. I will not stay there again.

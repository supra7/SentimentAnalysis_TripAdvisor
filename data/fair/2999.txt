We had a bad experience here. We booked our trip through the management company Resortquest. We originally were booked into a oceanfront room on the 10th floor, it was a beautiful room, gorgeous, unfortunately the smell from the restaurants below were so horrendous that we were forced to stay inside for 3 nights, I then asked to be moved and was moved to a oceanfront room above the pool that was NOISEY and the room was in terrible shape except for the kitchen - which we didn't use. The bathrooms had old urine stains around the toilets. It was a very expensive mistake. The beach is beautiful This was just like Nags Head for 3K which is really sad. Black Rock is down by the Sheraton unfortunately this beach is so overbuilt that the water is starting to become cloudy from overuse (suntan lotion etc). In all my travels I have never seen so many people use a pool (that is falling apart) when there is a beautiful beach right outside their door. There were many many cigarette butts on the beach. The condo/hotel is falling apart - the garage is 50% closed due to falling concrete - the garage is under the facility. Our first unit - 1013 had a deck that sloped and from looking at it from the road it is certainly leaning. I would avoid this unit - unless you can tolerate the constant and never ending smell of 3 restaurants below your window, there is NO clear air smell. Amy at the front desk was nice. If I ever go to Maul again I would avoid this place and the whole kaanpoli beach area and look for something quieter, if you want Nags Head, then spend half the money and go there. It's very expensive - we spent 3K just on the condo. I was extremely disappointed in teh Whaler, it really needs to be torn down and redone, it really is falling apart. We drove around Maui and there are quieter places, in better shape to the south. We spent 4 days on the big Island a 7 in Maul and I would head to the big Island before going to this island and this hotel/condo.

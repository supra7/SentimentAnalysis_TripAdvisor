I stayed here alone for my 40th birthday to contemplate and be alone. When I went up to check in, they sent me to the wrong room. I had requested and PAID FOR a specific water view. After walking back with my luggage, they replaced my room. Upon leaving I left a tip and a thank you note for the maid, put a $20 in my pocket for the valet. When they pulled my car up, the guy got out with not so much as a nod and the other valets just stood there, doing nothing. My car is not fancy, a 1998 Toyota, but I was dressed decently, a female and had quite a large piece of luggage, plus a bag. They did NOTHING! I had to open the trunk and put everything in by myself as they stood there and ignored me. I couldn't beleive it. I had watched 5 Minutes prior a gentlman be helped with a nice car. Real shabby way to treat a female guest. Will never go there again. I felt poor, embarrassed and not good enought o be there. Never again.

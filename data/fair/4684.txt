My wife and I stayed in this hotel as it was part of the Starwood chain and expected it to be in the same line as the Westin. We were on Honeymoon but we were very disappointed overall. On arrival we didn't get any lei and the hotel seems to have a serious lack of Aloha spirit which really shows in some of the staff. We felt like we were a number and not a guest at their hotel. Our 'Deluxe Ocean Front' room came with a part view of the car park in building 6 - we were placed on the SPG level as we are members but our room was the furthest room away from reception. Believe the other posters who say it is FAR away - the hotel spreads quite a bit and it did take 3 lifts to get us to our building. After complaining about our room we were moved to a much better room (the next day) which was another 'Deluxe Ocean Front' which we had paid for. It had unspoiled views and partial views of the Black rock which was very nice. With regards to the Deluxe Ocean Front room which is larger than the other rooms - however the only difference inside is that you get a microwave!! Only problem is you don't get any cutlery, plates, cups, glasses etc. When we asked reception about this we were advised that we should go to the restaurant and ask a member of staff for them which we did. We then took the plates, cutlery and glasses to our room - we thought this was very odd that we had to get them ourselves and that they are not in the room already. Pretty awful service! In the rooms there is the basic shower gel, shampoo etc but no real extras - you have to ask for them and they "may" be charged. The bottles of water in the room are charged also. On the positive side - the beach at black rock and black rock itself are gorgeous and excellent for snorkelling!

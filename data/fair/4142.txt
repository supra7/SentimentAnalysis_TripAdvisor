My husband and I stayed here February 12, 2011 for his 40th birthday. It was our first night of full sleep as we had a baby in October. I have never reviewed a hotel before, but feel inclined as I didn't find any negative reviews on the hotel when checking it out on the web. I was not impressed. The room cost the same as other waterfront hotels, but with a view of a brick building. The cold water didn't work on the bathroom sink; the only thing we requested was a bucket of ice for drinks and after a friendly, "we will bring that right up", it never came; the bed cover had a dark mark looking like a makeup stain or mud stain that I wish had been considered dirty and replaced; the dark curtains didn't cover the windows by design so only the sheers and no ability to get darkness in the room; we were woken up about 9:00 a.m. by maids yelling at each other in Spanish while vacuuming either right out front our door or in a room where the door was open while they were cleaning. We will not waste our money at this location again.

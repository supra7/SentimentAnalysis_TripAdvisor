I stayed here on business because my client was also staying here. A beautiful hotel, but significantly lacking in many ways: 1. I arrived at 5pm and my room was not ready. I had to take a different type of room or wait up to an hour. 2. The hotel had gone through a recent renovation. However, the results of this were very disappointing. 3. For $280/night, my room had thin windows that did little to keep out noisy traffic sounds; no coffee maker; cold, slippery tile in the bathroom; no soap dish in the shower, so the only place to put soap and the shampoo bottle was on the floor. 4. The desk had a new, complex system where you could connect your laptop to the flat-screen TV for video, PowerPoint presentations, etc. In the desk was a packet with all kinds of connectors for that system, but no ethernet cable to plug into the connection. Yes, they have wi-fi, but it was a very weak, slow connection, so an ethernet would have been very helpful. 5. The fitness center was closed for inspection. 6. Only good thing: as a vegetarian, I seldom see anything exceptional on hotel dining room menus. However, the vegetarian pasta dish that I had in the St. James dining room was the best I have ever had.

Honestly we felt that the staff really let this hotel down. The concierge were dreadful all the time - no siles for anyone. Sonehting strange happenign with the taxis as they don't want to come to the hotel -some fall out with the concierges etc so always difficult to get anywhere. We booked a family room and arrived to find one bed -interesting for 4 people. The conference rooms at badly situated at the end of the corridors to rooms -so noisy at night with parties. Breakfast service was dreadful because the hotel had a conference in and staff were deployed elsewhere. Would not recommend this hotel at all....

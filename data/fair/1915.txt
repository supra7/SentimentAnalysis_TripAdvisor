Rooms - smelly, tired, grim. Bath blocked, lights broken & really shabby. Bar - closed as the barkeeper was tired so he threw us out Sunday at 6pm. Breakfast - small room, poor selection. Hotel amenities - Housekeeping may or may not bother to turn up. Only one lift which is about to expire of old age. The staff are a mix. Mark on the front desk is good, but the night lady was a rude unpleasant woman. Business- Old tired room with bad aircon and no idea of customer service. Avoid if you can at all help it. The pictures on the internet are misleading.

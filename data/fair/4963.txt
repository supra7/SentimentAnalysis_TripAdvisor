The hotel was in a nice location, pretty high end. The elevators did run a little slow and broke down once during our stay. That wasn't that big of a deal to our group. The rooms were nice, if on the small side, as well as comfortable and clean. What was a big deal was the very incorrect bill we got on our last morning. We were charged $200 for parking that we didn't use. The bill was eventually corrected but it took an hour and a half to locate the manager!! Beyond frustrating! There seemed to be a total breakdown of communication between the staff and management, I was beginning to wonder if a manager existed. He came running after us as we stood on the curb grumbling waiting for a cab. Great price on Hotwire, now I know why.

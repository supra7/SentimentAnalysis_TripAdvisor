I stayed at the Petite Auberge because it was on the Conde Nast Gold List. I am still wondering how it made it on the list. Our room was not big enough for two people. You bumped your elbows on the sides of the shower because it was so small. But the worst thing was the noise. We were there for two nights. Each morning at 6:00 a.m. it sounded like the garbage man was dragging the garbage down the alley. To make matters worse, a clock alarm went off in the room next to us at 6:30 a.m. Because the walls were very thin, we could hear it as if it was in our room. There was no one in the room to turn off the alarm, so we called the front desk. It took them 30 minutes to turn it off the first morning. The second morning the same alarm went off again. (It was never fixed from the first morning). We had to call the front desk again to come and turn it off. It may be cute with a good location and breakfast, but I go to a hotel to sleep and that's not what happened. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

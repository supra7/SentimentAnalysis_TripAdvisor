Had three nights lodging. The checkin was easy and staff was nice. The floor plan was twisting and confusing. The room faced another building with no view. We carted all our luggage out of the cab without help while the staff fell all over the people in the Mercedes and Lexuses. Room was very small. The dust behind the covering for the heater was at least 1/2 inch thick. The tub was 24in high and 9 in wide without any grab bars. Would be impossible for someone elderly or with orthopedic problems to get in to. You can stand up from the toilet and look in the mirror. Showerhead was loose and had water all over. Toilet paper holder fell off wall. Safe in closet about 7 feet up and not user friendly. The location is outstanding....that is the only positive thing about the hotel. When the farmers market on the side street was done, it was filthy and smelly with rotting veggies in the gutter. There are other hotels close by the are less expensive withi a couple of blocks of Fanueil Hall. No complimentary business center but can print out boarding passes. Avoid the Millenium!!!

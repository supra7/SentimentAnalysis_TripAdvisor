Great for Priceline. There are many pluses and minuses of this property. PLUSES: 1. Location: Behind the Wynn and across the street from the Las Vegas Hilton makes it an easy walk towards the north end of the strip. 2. All suites: These are all suites and very comfortable but also tiny in size. They each have two televisions (not flat screen, so out-dated) and french doors that separate the living room from bedroom. The doors only have lace curtains, so if you are booking this to have privacy, forget that idea! Minuses: 1. Location is difficult to get to airport after stay (they do not have a shuttle to strip either). Cab fare is about $18.00 one way. If you are bidding on Priceline, you may want to spend a little more and try to get a hotel on the strip if you are looking into this property.

Lobby and all is small. It feels more like a 3 star hotel, rather than 3.5 star. Overall, I had a couple of problems with the stay but the staff was decet about it. I would recommend this property if you get a deal, otherwise, stay at the strip. If you are debating this over the Hilton across the street, I would go with this one. It is nicer and smaller (less hectic). I paid $62 + tax on Priceline for a 3.5 star hotel by the way. It was selling online for $199 + tax (which is rather crazy high I think for this type of hotel). Overall, it was fun though and the hotel was decent.

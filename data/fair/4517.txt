As a priority club member for many years..My experience was quite opposite from some of the comments. The breakfast was great and we were able to find a table each morning. The room size was actually larger than other hotels i've stayed in and room size exceeded my expectation for NYC. The room was clean...so clean to the point the maid THREW away my new U.S. Today newspaper the first morning that was NOT in the trash. The next night as I am packing I am missing 3 shopping bags of newly purchased clothes, including a large RED American Girl Bag. I went downstairs and reported to your front desk who apologized and were going to review with housekeeping Mgmt first thing the next morning for next steps as was told the garbage was already to the curb. As I am heading back to the elevator I notice the huge laundry bins and walk back there and find a large trash bin and my daughter happened to recognize our pizza box. I go get your front desk staff ...Guess what? Inside that large clear garbage bag is My 3 bags of newly purchase clothes right there on top of the pile of garbage. Having to dig through the garbage was bad, but what is most disapppointing the management has not bothered to follow up with an explanation to me and I had to explain the situation again at check out.

Let me preface this by saying that I usually love Hampton Inns. They are consistently clean, bright, and comfortable. That's why I am so disappointed in this property. It is dark, dank and dirty. There are some positives: It's in a great location, within walking distance to tons of restaurants, shopping, and downtown city sites. The front desk staff was super-friendly and very helpful. But the negatives far outnumber the good things. The lobby is definitely not a place you'd want to hang out. Think old bad 80s tile and lots of stained and worn out laminate. This along with the elevators gives the whole public space area a sort of hospital or industrial vibe. The rooms are very sub-par for a Hampton Inn. The ventilation system was so loud I felt like I was in an airplane hangar and I actually had to turn it off to even hear the television. The bathrooms are in dire need of an update, again with 80s icky beige tile with gray grout that just looks old and dirty. And even though I was in a non-smoking room I swear I smelled smoke. Not fresh smoke, but maybe smoke from 20 previous years of smoking. Or mold in the vents. Ick. Dust on all of the switch and outlet plates. Thin, sorry towels. Just bad in general. Maybe I wouldn't be so harsh in my review if I weren't comparing this property to all of the other Hampton Inns I've stayed at in my life. But they have all been so nice! I am shocked that Hilton allows this hotel to be remain a Hampton Inn. If I hadn't been part of a group block I would have hightailed it out of there at first sight. It wasn't cheap either, which makes it all the more disappointing.

Stayed for 2 nights in June 2010 for USD 100 per night. The good: Not much really. Cheap, but Copthorne King's down the road at the same price and way better. The bad: rooms sure looks way glitzier on the website! That's what convinced us to give it a shop. Turn out they're tiny, aesthetically crass, and our bathroom door's broken. No curtains, only blinds, just like my college dorm! Place reminds me of Happy Hotel in Geyland. The Ugly: close to town, but this hotel is located on a hill - you have to call for a cab. For some place as connected as Singapore, this is a big negative. Shuttle service, but inconsistent. Conclusion: only thing going for it is price, but you can find much better in around the same range. Avoid.

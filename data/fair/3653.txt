I stayed here for two nights with my husband while he was on his mid-tour break from Iraq and we were both very dissapointed by our room. We booked a "Wow" room which should only be allowed to be called "Wow" unless it is followed by "what a terrible room." It was very cramped and some of the fixtures were broken in the bathroom. We had to request that the room be made up as it was not by 8 PM. The booking got very screwed up and I had to check out twice. The room was terribly expensive, which is to be expected of New York, but we would have had much better accomadations for the same price down the street. The elevator is tricky to use which is not fun when also carrying baggage. I wrote to the manager of the hotel with my polite complaints and never received a response. I will say however, that the Bliss spa products were quite lovely and the concierge was very helpful. The lobby (completely decked out in Jonathon Adler design) was nice and got quite crowed, even on a weeknight. I suppose no one wanted to go back to their cramped, messy rooms! It was a big let down after some very nice stays at other Ws in Chicago, New Orleans, and San Francisco.

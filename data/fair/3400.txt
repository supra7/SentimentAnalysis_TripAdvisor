We stayed for a week my wife, me and our two daughters and basically liked the hotel. Im in New York 2-3 times a year and am therefore familiar with the hotel prices. A day before we were leaving we discovered that several items were missing from our rooms, most of it removed from our suitcases a day before we left. (A small teddy bear, a silver like pen, used underwear? etc). It was reported to the hotel security and it was shown that the lock on my suitcase was broken. I failed to report it to the police because I did not want to spend time on that on our last day in New York. Back home we discovered that we are also missing a gold chain, a USB charger and other stuff. I seem that we are not the only guests that have lost items on that hotel. The hotel security promised to check who had been in my wife and mine room on our last day, but we have heard nothing from the hotel. I understand that money should be locked in a safe, but who expect that you should protect your dirty underwear?

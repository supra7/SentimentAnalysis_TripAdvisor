We arrived in NO on September 7th and went to the Vistor Centre looking for accomodation. A lovely lady there directed us to a touch screen booking system and advised us of the Place D'Armes hotel with free parking. On the screen the hotel was advertised as $ 59 per night with FREE PARKING. We contacted the booking office via the booking system and booked a room for $ 79 with free parking. (The $ 59 rooms have no window). When we arrived at the hotel we were told the parking was $ 28 + tax per night extra. When we queried this we were told parking was never free. With some haggling the desk person allowed us 1 night free parking. The next day we raised the issue with another staff member who told us the "free parking in the advert was subject to availability" - whatever that means. We found the staff very unfriendly and unhelpful.

My boyfriend and I were looking for a quiet getaway, and I insisted on Westin for their Heavenly Bed, my favorite. I was disappointed to find that my favorite fluffy bed was hard, lumpy, and not heavenly at all. The hotel was besieged with families with screaming children. Maybe it was the place to be, because the Westin has a lot of pools, and lots of animals in their courtyard lagoon (parrots, flamingoes, koi fish, all kinds of birds). The breakfast buffet was average in quality, selection, and flavor. Also, when we went to the beach, we waited 10 minutes for someone to set up chairs for us (since we weren't allowed to do it ourselves). Finally, we grabbed them ourselves, only to be chased after but the cabana boy. We explained how we waited, then he let us go with no charge for the chairs. Not sure I'd stay here again.

The rooms were big and clean. Service and location were horrible. I highly recommend staying downtown for the extra money. We tried to get some drinks from the bar, but we must have missed the sign that said, "We don't serve whites." We literally sat there trying to waive the bartender down, and she didn't even look at us. She did a really good job at acting like we were invisible. A couple weeks after the vacation, I got a call from a Chicago bank confirming that I had written a check to some woman for babysitting. Someone had gone through my purse in our hotel room and tore out the last two checks in my checkbook. I guess your personal belongings are never safe in a hotel room! By the look of recent posts, it looks like they did some firing and hiring of new people. I wouldn't worry about it too much, just be cautious.

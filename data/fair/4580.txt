Vintage room.....plus cockroaches! Loved the old lobby and had drinks on the beach nightly which was lovely but when I saw cockroaches on the nightstand I freaked out. The desk manager said this is a tropical island and they spray frequently. That's it. My husband and I have stay at the Ritz Carlton on Maui and never saw a fly.....This hotel has some problems. the furniture was so bizarre..I needed a stool to mount the old queen bed. The bathroom was cute, all pink...I would never stay at this hotel or any of this chain...Jacque Norris

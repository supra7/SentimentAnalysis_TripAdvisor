Stayed here for a friend's wedding. I had high expectations going into this hotel, and I was not impressed at all after I checked in. The rooms were very small and cramped. The bathrooms seemed small too. I stayed at the Sheraton in Seattle the previous two nights and paid about the same price...and was far more impressed with the accommodations at the Sheraton....they had better accommodations, bigger rooms, bigger bathrooms, and everything seemed cleaner & more upscale. During checkout I checked my bags with the hotel so I could get lunch. When I came back for my bags, nobody was able to find them. I ended up having to ask a bellboy to take me down into the basement myself so I could see if my bags were there or not.....I ended up finding them locked in some random room in the basement. So staff seemed pretty worthless that I had to find my bags that they lost themselves.

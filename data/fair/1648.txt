First of all the hotel is situated far away from the town center. But we thought that it would offer more than a hotel in the center with the same price. I felt disappointed as I discovered that the room did not reflect its price at all. I would not recommend this hotel as its quite expensive for its service. The single room has two beds on the opposite site which is really depressing!!!

Small doesn't even come close to a description of the rooms in this hotel. Asked to change to room with two beds and were told not possible. Over priced and management was not concerned about our over crowded conditions. Their solution and ours was move to a different hotel . Location though close enough to Times Square is not in an ideal neighborhood. We were glad to move after one night. Rooms were however clean and quiet. Ok for

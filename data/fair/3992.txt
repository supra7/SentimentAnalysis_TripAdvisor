Can't believe this is a 5-star hotel If I didn't pay $129 per night through expedia, I would have been pretty upset. Stayed 4 nights. The best thing was the Union Square location.As others have written, very trendy, wannabe hotel. The lobby and bar are cool, however, after 6:30 p.m., try getting a seat or a drink. My $11 margarita was made with sweet  sour. YukI thought the rooms were terrible. The scandavavian furniture reminded me of IKEA. Small rooms, even smaller bathrooms. Platform beds not comfortable. There was no real furniture in the room - except the unit that housed the 19 TV and minibar. I was there for mulitple nights and could have used the usual armoir - yes, I know, probably not trendy, but functional. Orange clear plastic end tables - yuk. Stayed in room 712 - facing into the rooms at the Monaco....wishing I stayed there. Lots of people stumbling into rooms at 3:00 a.m. and you could hear everything - the trouble with staying in hotel with younger crowd - I realize thats my problem and not the hotels.Valet parking is $51.30 per day(including parking tax) RIPOFF. Internet service in the room is $10.00 per day RIPOFF. There is a parking lot literally 30 yards away on Taylor for $24 per night - in and out privledges.I would stay at any of the other surrounding hotels in a NY minute - Prescott still is my favorite

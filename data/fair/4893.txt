We got a decent rate on the hotel, but we didnt realize that additional services were so expensive. $52/day for parking, 15/person for the pool (which is outrageous), and no free wireless internet. The food here is also horrible. They really should not charge extra for the pool. On principle alone, we are never staying here again, and neither should you. Do you really want to live in a world where every hotel starts nickel and diming anyone they can, just like what the airlines do?

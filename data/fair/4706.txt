The resort was beautiful, the rooms were clean, but rather small for the price. The pool was great and the beachfront area was gorgeous with great snorkeling. However, it was $40 to get a cabana on the beach and you also had to rent chairs and umbrellas...with a $21 a day resort fee, I would have thought they would have at least given chairs complimentary. In addition, the snorkeling gear was $20 for the day. At another resort we stayed at in Oahu, the snorkeling gear was free for up to 2 hours. The breakfast buffet was good, but that is where it ended. There were not a lot of choices for food and the food was mediocre at best. I would suggest planning to eat off of the resort for most of your stay. I would go back to the area for the views, but would probably choose another property in the Kaanapali area.

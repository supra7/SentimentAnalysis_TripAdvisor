What can I say, the hotel is very chic, and stylish. Tiny rooms and the bathrooms are just big enough to turn around in. The worst part of the stay was leaving a camera lens in the room after checking out and not finding that we forgot it until we got back home in Portland. After many calls to the front desk, they keep transferring me to housekeeping which has "not found" my lens. I've still not heard back from anyone, very disappointed in the lack of communication. Well, I guess I should check craigslist seattle or a seattle pawn shop to find my lens... not staying here again.

Yes, I gave it two stars but we keep staying here year after year and each time I ask myself "why"?. This is a courtyard boutique, small hotel made from one of the oldest school buildings in New Orleans. It has charm, patina and a beautiful courtyard. The Cafe du Mond is a three minute walk from your room in the morning and Jackson Square and the State Museum are even closer. The great shopping on Royal Street is a half block to your right and Bourbon Street is two blocks away (which makes it close but far enough away that you cannot hear it or smell it). The rooms are aging and need some repair but they are clean. This year the internet router, with it's weak, slow signal, hung from the ceiling from a wire poked through the plaster. The TV is 20 years old and the free continental breakfast is not worth the price. The desk staff are polite but not usually friendly or engaging. There is a Bellman... somewhere.So why do we return? We go to New Orleans to be alone together and it is quiet at this place. We want to be ignored. We want privacy and, well, we like shabby sheik.

Some background is necessary before this - I stayed with my fiancee, her 12-year-old, and my 14- and 16-year-olds. We stayed in two adjacent rooms and rigged the connecting door open by either jamming towels in or fiddling with the handle, because it would not open into the other room properly. The lobby and our rooms smelled of perfume with a dash of herbs, which was somewhat unpleasant but remedied when we asked for the rooms to be aired out. We also requested a cot, but were told that they were not available because the clientele of the hotel is more business-oriented. I asked, jokingly, if it would then be more advisable to bring my secretary than my children, and was told that it was. The decor and the amenities in the room all speak to this being a man's hotel, from the flat-screen television to the "fake closet" as my daughter called it, to the lack of a restaurant (only an overpriced grab-and-go section with lots of peppers in the food in the lobby) but an impressive bar. The beds were stiff and large, and the covers were difficult to maneuver. The decor in the room was, well, odd - for example, a purposefully plasticky retro alarm clock and colorblocked blinds; fake plush panels behind the bed of cork, and, in one room, cow fur; a prominent recycling bin but only a pithy, small garbage bin in the bathroom. Despite how unflattering the above may be, it's not a bad hotel. It's just not for families. It has a definite goal and a definite aesthetic (despite what the Disney flashcards for sale in the lobby might say) and this might not appeal to some. It wasn't my thing, but it could definitely be someone else's.

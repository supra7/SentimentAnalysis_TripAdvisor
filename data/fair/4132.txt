I thought maybe we made reservations at the wrong Inn after reading the reviews, but I verified the address and yes, we were staying at the same place Where to start, when we arrived the staff was very accommodating and helpful and this was true throughout our stay. But the Inn needs serious maintenance. Our first room's shower was filthy with mold everywhere. But we were tired and decided to ask for a different room the next morning. Big mistake, the bed had a broken spring on the left side and my husband could not sleep at all. The next morning we asked to change rooms, and they said no problem it would be about 20 minutes and we could move. We waited an hour and called back and said what if we upgrade can we get a room now. They said yes, only $20.00 to upgrade. Another hour passes, we call again, they have to go check on the room they will call back, finally after another half of an hour we call back and finally move ourselves. The Inn staff is nice but the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. The evening wine and snacks are great. The breakfasts, edible. After all we went through I was surprised they still charged us the additional $20.00. Needless to say not a place I would stay again,

We booked a partial ocean view room for the rate of $435.00 per night. The room we received was on the 2nd floor (room 278). The view was of the enclosed air conditioning unit for the hotel and a very partial view of the ocean if you looked beyond the air conditioning unit. The air conditioning unit was also loud when the sliding door was open. Very disappointing not to get a room with the value you pay for. Unfortunately the hotel was completely booked and there were no other rooms. Bryan the front desk person was not helpful and said it was the best he had. The Westin is a nice property but the partial ocean view room for $435.00 per night was disappointing and not worth the money. Advice do not pay more for a partial ocean view. I think our situation is rare, but it could happen to you. It happened to us. Having a mountain view or a garden view would be better and cheaper if you decide to stay at the Westin. From this experience we would not stay there again.

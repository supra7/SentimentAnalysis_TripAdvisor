I've pasted below the email I sent the guest services at Wynn. We recently stayed at the Encore for 5 nights (7/22 - 7/27), and although I could let it pass as a bad experience, I didnt think it would be fare to not let the concerned authorities know. We chose to stay at the Encore as we thought it would be the epitome of luxury, and the tagged high dollar price ($250/night) would be worth the experience. Although the King Suite we booked was nice and comfortable, the suite had no amenities whatsoever. The shocking thing was there isnt even a coffee/tea maker, which is a standard amenity even at cheap motels. While other good properties on the strip provide a refrigerator for use, the one in our room had strict instructions not to use it for storing personal items. If we had to get a fridge in the room, there was another $25/day charge. The wireless internet in the room is not free, and the absolute worst is that we had to pay a fee for using the hotel spa facility. All this did make me wonder what did I pay the $250 a night for. Why would a supposedly top notch facility not even provide basic services like tea/coffee, internet and spa services for free to high paying patrons. Anyway, after this sorry experience we are pretty much guaranteed not to stay at any Wynn property again. I thought I'll send my comments, hopefully they'll be reviewed and something will be done so more customers dont have such experiences. Thanks.

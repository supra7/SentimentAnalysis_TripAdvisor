We had a good size room with a king bed and a sea view. For the price we paid we expected a fantastic room but it was adequate with a tired looking bathroom. The hotel did not seem to have any atmosphere, even in the bar area. Breakfast was expensive compared to the local shopping area - a 10 mins walk away, and we filled up with food at the local Safeway. So we spent nothing at all at the hotel. We are still not sure what the resort fee covers and were not told what it was for. We used the hotel's bus to Lahaina every evening but the local bus would have only cost $1 each way or we could have driven. We did not find the staff overly polite (except for the poolside staff), in general they were quite disrespectful, the worse culprits being the welcome staff when we first arrived. On the plus side, the snorkelling was great outside the hotel and we saw turtles most days. The pool area was very nice and as the hotel was farily empty it was easy to get a sunbed. It also took us 2 days to find the gym, its miles away from the main lobby and gave up onthe first day!

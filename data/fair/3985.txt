You can dress up an old tart, but by midnight the make up wears off Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in may 2008 Hotel and lobby are beautiful, full of attractive staff who look lke they are auditioning for a role for some upcomming hip soap, Asking them to so something to assist doesnt seem to be in their script.Location is fairly central .Rooms have been spruced up but being an old hotel the refurb has been done cheaply.Room had a 15 year old small tv, which was faulty and kept turning off every 15 minslock mechanism on door was faulty which meant every time i returned to my room i had to go to front desk to get a new keycard, was offered a free drink for this inconvienance as a reformed alcoholic , was offended with trying to be bribed with a drink.Wireless internet dropped out every 30 mins bathroom was at least 30 years old with a few fluff designer pieces used to disguise this fact.raised this issues at checkout and was credited with internet fee and front desk clerked, seemed to be aware of the issues i had raised, as im sure its a regular occurence.Basically overpriced hotel with the attitute of an old tart who thinks putting on a bit of make up will hide this fact Michael Melbourne Australia

We have a suite for New Year's Eve. The bedroom is quite small but adequate. The "living room" large but the furniture needs to go. Not worn, but cheap looking. No minibar but it does have a refrig. Flat screen TVs in both rooms and a good view of the Space Needle for excellent fireworks viewing last night. When we got back from dinner at about 10 last night, we wanted to go for a couple of dances at their bar before popping the champagne in our room for the fireworks show. Well, hip hop isn't my favorite so that was a bust. Pretty much everything looks a little worn or kind of cheap, from the lobby to the elevators to terrible carpeting to an outdated bathroom. A little noisy as well, surprising on the 19th floor. Also, hall noise, that could be serious in a room other than a suite (we had a bedroom door to close). Oh, $10 internet and no late checkout. The elevators are woefully inadequate when the hotel is full. Took forever to catch one. Good price for downtown Seattle though. We cabbed but I believe parking is $30, be careful of that.

As an FYI to travelers, Penn Tower Hotel really is not functioning as a hotel. There are about 1.5 floors out of 21 that are still hotel rooms. The rest of the hotel is a medical center. The hotel does not have room service, has a small coffee bar that is only open until 2:30 in the afternoon and a gift shop that is pretty much like most medical center gift shops. The elevators are crowded and slow, housekeeping is minimal for hotel rooms and the building overall is VERY loud. PennStar medi-lift chopper hovers on the side of the building quite a few times every day, major construction is going on so there is a lot of noise and traffic, there is very little parking and if you can get it, be prepared to pay steep prices and there is at least one fire drill a week. This is the perfect location if you don't care about being pampered since it is close to CHOP and HUP. If you are expecting to experience a traditional hotel, this is not the place for you.

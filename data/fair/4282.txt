Well, the best things i can say about this hotel were that the suite was roomy and the location was good. Other than that, the room and furnishings were old and the mattress and mattress pad had a huge, suspicious yellow stain on it. They did replace the mattress, but it kind of gave us a queasy feeling about the room in general. There was a basic kitchenette, which should have had a microwave, but did not. Would I stay there again? Well, maybe if it was really a cheap deal. On a positive note, they have a restaurant/bar on the 26th floor that has really breathtaking 360 degree views of NYC & the East River. It has a beautiful Art Deco decor. I don't know how the food is because we only had drinks, but our server was very, very nice.

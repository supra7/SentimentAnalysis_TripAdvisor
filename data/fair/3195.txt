It was a strange combination of nicely done (what you see on the website photos) and hey we forgot some details here. The property is gorgeous, but our room was either the one that time forgot or not as nice as the one on the website. At that price point in the off season, you expect great bedding (not), lush towels (not even close) and newish furniture-whicker and dated ammenities was what we got. The shower had almost no water pressure. I will tell you what was gorgeous: Strangely, the bathroom was magnificently redone and spacious-loved the vanity. It was interesting that they hadn't put as much attention into the room. The grounds were immaculate and just as beautiful as the photos on the website. The complimentary breakfast was generous. And the staff was great. Overall, not worth the price we paid...

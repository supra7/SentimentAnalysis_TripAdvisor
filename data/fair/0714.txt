We flew into Seattle late so we decided to stay at a hotel near the airport for the first night of the trip. There was a shuttle that had shown up right when we got outside which was nice. The room was average but the bed and pillows were uncomfortable. No breakfast included. When we went downstairs to check out we had to wait about 10 minutes while the man at the front desk chatted with someone. He was not very friendly when he did finally wait on us.

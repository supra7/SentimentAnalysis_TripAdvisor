For the price in Manhattan, it was not too bad. Centrally located to the sites and subway system. All major subways are either across from the hotel or one block either direction. I doubt I would stay there again though. The room was not ready upon arrival, housekeeping services were late and slow (I left out for hours with sign to clean room but not done when I returned). The room was noisy from outside traffic but hey, it IS New York City. Also, the maintenance men doubled as bellman. Even though they offer a good continental breakfast, it is served in a very depressing closed bar attached to the hotel which seems to be used for storage as well. Not very conducive to enjoyment. Again, I would say that I enjoyed my trip and the hotel was adequate but would NOT stay again or recommend.

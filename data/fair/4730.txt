This hotel for the price is good value the other reviews are correct about the noise etc, but we did'nt find it to to disturbing' or the room size an issue. What I do object to is the manner of the only staff member that we have seen, a lady with short blonde hair. She is extermlely rude to the point of obnoxuois. So stay at the hotel if you do'nt mind being this spoken to by a grumpy staff me member. if the management fixed this problem it would be a four star for the value.

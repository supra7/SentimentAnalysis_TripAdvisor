Would NOT recommend Mandira A friend and I stayed at the Bali Mandira for a weeks holiday. The twin room needed refurbishing. The beds were very uncomfortable, you can not adequately block out the sunlight for a little sleep-in, we had to boil the kettle on the floor as this is where the powerpoint was, and to top it off when we asked for extra pillows we were told the hotel had ran out. Although I loved the rainshower they have in the bathroom.We had paid extra to have the club benefits, but I do not consider that this was worth it. The afternoon tea is not replenished, the cocktails are too sweet and poor quality alcohol - that is when a staff member is available to make them. Also none of the choices are rotated, so after a couple of days you would appreciate some variety.Only two internet terminals so a lot of waiting.Upper level pool had a nice view, but it was too hard to get any service up there. The ground level pool is small and you had to reserve a deck chair with a towel before you went to breakfast - which is ridiculous! The breakfast was very nice!!Nyepi Day (like a public holiday) was on when we were there - (take note - it is ILLEGAL to leave your hotel grounds on this day). The hotel served a buffet dinner and did not have enough seats so were turning guests away!!! Parents were begging for a plate to take back to their rooms for their families dinner as the were forbidden to leave the hotel!! Good location, but not worth the overall cost.

I stayed at the Renaissance for New Years Eve and would not recommend this hotel for the following reasons. 1. The noise: Even on the 22 floor, the noise was horrible. The windows are barely sealed and let in a lot of noise. 2. Value: I paid a premium to stay on New Years eve for a perceived Four Star hotel. About $166 with taxes from HotWire. Parking was $30 plus a $6 Parking tax. 3. Location: Other than being next to a highway, the location is fairly good. Close to Capital Hill and the downtown area. 4. Amenities: We had drink sand appies in the lounge and the beer was good and not too expensive. Food was average. The lounge was a nice touch and they had a great singer performing. Free wifi in this area. 5. Room: The room was a decent size. The pillows were not comfortable. The room did show some age. 6. The Staff: Very friendly and helpful including finding a cab during a busy rush. Conclusion: It is a four star wannabe hotel. Its rough around the edges and would have rather paid more to stay elsewhere.

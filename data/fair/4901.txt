A friend and I went on a last minute trip to Chicago and stayed at the Swissotel. Our room was average and clean, we did have a view of the lake. What was a little surprising was everything was an extra charge. To use the gym or pool was a $15 a day charge, to print our boarding passes was a $6 dollar charge and internet service was a $9 a day charge. We did borrow the umbrella that the hotel leaves in the room for guests to use, and returned it, yet I was charged $20 for the umbrella, which I am still disputing with the hotel. Our room never got cool, we called down to the front desk twice to have our room checked, no one ever came. The concierge was Swiss and had a very difficult time understanding that I wanted directions to a bakery that sold cupcakes, it was like a ridiculous game of charades. Our vacation was wonderful our accommodations where less than wonderful.

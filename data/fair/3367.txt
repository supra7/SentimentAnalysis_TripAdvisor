The TV remote control wouldn't work and, upon asking about it, I was told that "it's been like this for a while" and nothing was done. When I moved the TV closer to bed I could see that there was a lot of dust on the furniture. The french type door to my room was barely covered by a see through curtain and everything inside my room was visible if I truned on the lights at night, and during the day throhg the space between the drapes and the door itself. Cute breakfast idea, though, at a big antique table in an old dining area.

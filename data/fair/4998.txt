Based on the reviews in Tripadvisor, we booked a room at the Best Western because of the savings in free parking. However, we were really disappointed -- the old, dingy hallways had a nasty, strong smell of cleaning fluids, the bathroom in our room was tiny and old, the heating/cooling system was antique and roared on and off. The whole place seemed old and tired -- I hate to use the word "dump" but it was awful close to that status in my mind. Good points --the staff were friendly, the fitness center was OK, and the pool was nice. We thought the place was so dingy and unsatisfactory we checked out after our first night and moved to the Embassy Suites near the lakefront. More expensive after paying $42/night for parking, but the hotel and room were so, so much nicer than the Best Western that I thought it was a much better value.

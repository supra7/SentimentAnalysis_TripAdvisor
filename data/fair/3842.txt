The first room we were showed $133.00 inclusive of tax was so tiny there was barely 18 inches of space between the wall and the bed on both sides. There was no desk to write at. It was very very dark with a small frosted window (3 feet by 4.5 feet). The doors to the hall are all a wooden frame of about 9 inches around with a 5 foot by 1.5 foot frosted glass insert. When we indicated this wouldn't do we were given another room which was brighter and larger but still quite dark and also with a glass door. The paint is a dark beige with gold and wine coloured borders throughout. They told us it was a historical building and therefore everthing was governed by the time period. The staff was very nice and tried to accomodate us by giving us the better room but it was much more expensive--$160.00. I am more interested in a bright clean room than in being in a historical landmark that is very dark and has old smells so for me the choice was very disappointing. If you are into history maybe it would be for you. The staff was very helpful and friendly. also the street noise was very loud and you could hear everything in the hall.

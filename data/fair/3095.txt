Our ten year old son loved the Westin because of the pools. My husband and I did not particulary enjoy our stay mainly because of the congested layout of the pool area and the crowds and noise. The property is not very wide so the pool area is folded together on multiple levels with little or no views of the beach. The entire main level is noisy and the area near the restaurants and pool is crowded and has a Disney World feel to it. The Ka'anapali beach is a nice long strip of golden sand with high rise hotels and condos (approx. 12 story) along it with a sidewalk running down the strip connecting all the properties. We did not care for this Miami beach type of layout of the area. The area just outside the Westin has a few restaurants and an entrance to the shopping mall, so this area is also crowded most of the time. The hotel is decorated very well in a sleek updated beach design, however, our room (and hall & elevator) was too worn and not cleaned well (for the price) and the "heavenly bed" had a mound in the center. The lobby is very attractive and I like the pink flamengos and the big colorful tropical birds in a around a pool of water, but I'm afraid the waterfalls are too big and noisy and create a constant commotion. It would have been much nicer to have a background soothing sound of running water.

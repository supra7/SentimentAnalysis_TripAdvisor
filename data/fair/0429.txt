The Westin Seattle is so not worth it! There are many hotels in Seattle and for the money we spent there must be better ones! We were traveling with 6 people spread over 3 generations & we had 3 connecting bedrooms each with it's own bath. Looked perfect on paper BUT the rooms are small & the baths are tiny! The decor is old, tired & frankly dirty looking. The rooms are noisy, from elevator noise, loud banging doors, etc. However the view of the city was fantastic! My daughter-in-law & I had both reminded the hotel several times before our arrival that we needed a babybed & a refrigerator & we were told on each occasion that it was no problem. However hen we arrived with tired kids we then had to call repeatedly to get both. I did have a great experience the one time I used the concierge when looking for a restaurant for an evening meal. Breakfast was ridiculous! The hotel restaurant was never yet open when we were looking for breakfast around 7 am. So we had to eat in 'snack shop' where one waited in a long line to buy overpriced mediocre food. Good location. And of course Seattle is a beautiful & fun city to visit but next time we'll try a different hotel!!

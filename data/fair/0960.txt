My wife and I stayed here 10 years ago and based on the current reviews decided to give it another try. We found the rooms to be in serious need of upgrade. The grounds and beach are immaculate, but the rooms and the restaurant were disappointing. Our friends asked their room to be changed because of a musty odor that was obvious as soon as the door was opened. The food at the rstaurant was just average. We tried the breakfast buffet which we found to be Denny's type food at Ritz prices. We also had dinner only becuse we didn't want to go somewhere else. We only did this once. But there are plenty of other restaurants nearby. It isa great location. Service was wonderful. But I won't stay again until they spend some money to fi it up.

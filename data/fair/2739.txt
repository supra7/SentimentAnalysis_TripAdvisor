The location of the hotel is great! Right on Fremont Street Experience. However, rooms are smaller than average and the bathrooms are ridiculous! You could sit on the toilet and shave your legs in the tub, it's that small! The towel racks are actually IN the shower. The hotel has a buffet/cafe food is decent but service sucks big time. Staff is rude and unfriendly. They make you feel like they're doing you a favor by seating you, and bringing you drinks etc. If you are only looking for a place to lay your head, then this hotel would suffice. Beds were comfortable enough but that's about it.

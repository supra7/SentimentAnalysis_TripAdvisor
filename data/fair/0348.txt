The first thing we noticed (after the surly front desk staffer) was the smell of th eplace. Musty, moldy, yuck. Seriously in need of an update. Frayed carpet, nicked and scuffed mouldings. And, if you must stay there, the railroad side rooms are pretty noisy, but the upgrade t the water side is a little ridiculous at $75. And, for at least part of your stay you'll be looking at the side of a giant cruis shipp, rather than the water. The concierge was never at the desk, so the front desk staff did the job. They were hit and miss, with some being very nice and helpful, and some being not so great.

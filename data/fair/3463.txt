In order to help as much people as I can I'll make my review as a list of all the bad things we experienced during our short stay. I hope that by doing it so more people will read it and will find it helpful. - The staff was very snobby. I felt like I was talking to a bouncer at an elite night club and not to the staff at the hotel I Paid for! - 1st room - Small and with unbearable noise from the room AC and more amazing, from all the hotel AC engines outside the window. Even with the windows closed. - When we requested someone to come and take a look/listen they just did NOT. After 15 minutes we gave up and went ourselves to the reception. - 2nd room  smelled really bad. Smoke and dust - The bed was not comfortable - The TV quality was poor and the TV system crashes (I actually watched windows 2000 loading up several times on the screen) - They have a very expensive minibar but no bottle opener. And again when we asked that they'll send us one it took about 20 minutes. - If you even dare to pick up something from the minibar just to look  you will be charged (to be fair  they cancelled the charge after a little debate) - No more than 2 pillows per room - The shower head kept falling on us - The bathroom floor had rust (never seen that one before) - No shelf/rack in the bathroom. You have to put your stuff on the toilet cover or on the floor - The clock in the room wasn't set right - The lights above the bed are hard to turn off. You have to get up from the bed. - The lobby turns at nights to a night club with very bad and loud music - Room keys tend to stop working The good stuff: - Location - Nice design For conclusion  very low price/what you get ratio. It made me search Wikipedia about the hotels-stars system because if this hotel can announce it is 4-stars - it's pretty worthless. Happy vacation!

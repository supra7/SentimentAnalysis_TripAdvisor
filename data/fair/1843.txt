If you are looking for a place to sleep, this is a good place to stay. The bed was very comfortable. Also, the location is good, just be aware that Dallas Parkway is the frontage road to Dallas North Tollway, it makes it easier to understand directions to the hotel. The hotel looks like it was a great place to stay 5-10 years ago. However, it appears the hotel needs some repairs. Our shower curtain was not long enough to fit in the tub -- major flood. The peephole was missing from our door, leaving just a hole that anyone could look through. Cotton balls from the vanity set came in handy. The rubber door strip had come loose, so it just dangled in front of our door. We had to poke it back into the frame. Valet parking takes up the entire front of the hotel, so if you choose not to valet park, be ready for a long trek. We asked for a double bed and were given a king. Overall, not the service and quality I normally get at Intercontinental Hotels. You can get some cheap rates here, but there is a reason.

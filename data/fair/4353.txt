Definitely Not a 5 star Hotel... You know what they say, everyone has an opinion... In mine, this is no more than a 3 star hotel. I had high expectations that were not met. The good and bad: yes, the hotel is close to Time Square (not necessarily a good thing), yes it is cute and quaint, yes they have complimentary breakfast and snacks through the day (the Russian? woman who works in the lounge area was very nice)... but, the bed (King) was not very comfortable, the room was dark, the TV reception was aweful. We stayed for five nights, the second day I asked if the TV reception was bad in every room and I was told yes with no further explanation. The thing that I disliked the most was the front desk employees/doorman seemed to stare at us without saying hello (day and night staff) and when we checked out they didn't ask how our stay was... Definitely not worth $300 a night! I would not stay at this hotel again.

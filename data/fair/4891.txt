Ugh. The hotel is in serious need of updating, it's celebrating 30 years and cracks are showing all over the place from the dated lobby and elevators to old carpets, furniture, bathrooms. Expected a modern hotel, this definately was not it - although it came with a hefty rate. Probably most dissappointing was the level of customer service. We had requested high floor room prior to check in, requested this again at check in and very nicely explained we were on a special weekend celebrating anniversary. The guy at front desk must have had a bad week because we got a room next to the elevators and across from the service room on a lower floor. Thanks for your help buddy. We could have complained but chose not to -we didn't spend a lot of time in the room. The concierges need to attend mood modification classes they were all grumpy and seemed annoyed to be answering any questions, why is this not apparent to management? Spend 5 minutes observing their interaction with guests and you know you have problems. Not impressed, no way coming back here, would look for W, Hard Rock or Monacco at this price range and for a more modern vibe.

Immediately, you will notice the 145 million dollar renovation. Beautiful! However, there's no world class service there to back it up. Check-in was terrible; We had to wait until 6 oclock to get our room. I'm a Diamond Member. The restaurants are very good but expensive. We paid over $50 dollars for breakfast. The bell staff were okay. I've had better at less expensive hotels. We would have been better off at the Hilton or Hampton Inn. Save yourself some money

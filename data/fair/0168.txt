Stayed at this hotel for 1 night, booked for 2 but decided to leave a day early. Our room was a "cozy double" and it sure was cozy! VERY small room, some newish furniture but the building is aged. The headboards were quite worn out and the bathroom was something else. Had to shower leaning back as the shower head looked me right in the face, and I'm only 5'7". Let's just say the bathroom was so small that the shelf for the towels was inside the shower. The elevators were pretty scary, had to stop and wait after the doors had opened for it to adjust so it was level with the ground! The walls are paper thin, could hear every detail of the conversation the neighbors were having at 2am, and even with the windows shut, could hear men fighting out side around the same time. The room was clean though, no question about it, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Parking was crappy though, had to truck our luggage around the corner to the parkade, up some stairs, to get to the elevator to take us up to our car.

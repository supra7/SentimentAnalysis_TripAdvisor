This did not meet my expectations for a Hyatt. The biggest problem was that the walls were PAPER thin, and I could hear every throat clearing and interlude from my next door neighbor's room. The hallways reeked of cheap, toxic deodorizor. It was a rip-off that the internet cost $.50/minute in the business center, and from what I could see, there were even charges for in-room wi-fi if you had your own laptop (though I did not try it). The wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom and the sink clogged up when I brushed my teeth. Just was not up to par for a 4-star hotel.

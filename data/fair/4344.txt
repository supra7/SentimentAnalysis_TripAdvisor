Ups and downs of the Casablanca We booked the Casablanca after reading reviews on trip advisor. We arrived just after lunch so we did not expect our room to be ready and we checked in and left our bags to take a tour and arrived back after 9pm. We had booked a deluxe king room and had requested a room at the back of the hotel, when we were shown to our room it was a very small double, room 508, more in keeping with a single room, at the quiet rear end of the hotel. We contacted reception to be told there were no other rooms available in the hotel but they agreed it was not a king room but the hotel was full. The next day we had another full daytrip booked and found we had been moved to another room, this time a kingsize but at the front of the hotel and we were given a bottle of champagne. They also made a deduction to the cost of our nightly rate. The second room was a bit larger with a king bed but unfortunately at the front of the building which is very noisy, we decided not to ask to be moved again and bought some earplugs which did help. The staff in the hotel are very good, polite and helpful and will do whatever they can to make your stay a good one, but our stay was not ideal. As we were checking out we were met by the manager who apologised for the problems and we were given a complimentary stay if we would like to return in the future, this was a nice gesture, but we had asked to see the manager from the day we arrived and I feel his apology was a little late in the day. We had booked this hotel a long time ago, directly on their website and expected better than this from a hotel with such good reviews.

Booked a family room online arrived on Sunday the 22nd of January after an 18 hour journey. Checked into a room, settled, went down to reception to ask, was that a family room? No it wasn't! Can it be switched? No it can't! Wait for the manager the next day. Waited for the manager next day, manager didn't show. Reception suggests on line complaint. which I made only on departure. Response sorry, nothing we can do, we don;t make distinctions on room types, we give you any room that we deem suitable for you. Some certain numbers come to mind....4-1-9!!

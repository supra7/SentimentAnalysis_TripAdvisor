POSITIVES: Location and price were great. 3 blocks from subway. Quiet street. Towels and sheets appeared clean. A/C worked. Hotel provided robes and slippers for shared bathrooms. Bathroom was always available when we needed it. Two bathrooms on our floor: One had a shower, stall combo. The other a separate shower and stall. NEGATIVES: Room needed some serious cleaning. Dusty, dirty, sink had a slow drain, poor reception on television, low lighting. Had to purchase an air freshener for room. Shared bathrooms were dirty. A non-smoking facility that smelled of cigarette smoke. Breakfrest was not worth the trip down. Great breakfest place right at the corner of 11st and 6th Ave called French Roast. Over all needs some serious renovation, but you get what you pay for.

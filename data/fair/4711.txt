We went to Hawaii to see the wedding of a friend. The wedding took place at the Sheraton, so we booked a room there, expecting it to be central. It was, and the wedding was fine, but our room was not. On the second evening I discovered the first two of a series of roaches that invaded our room during our week long stay at the resort. Needless to say, I immediately phoned the front desk. They sent someone up to kill the roach I could not reach (the one on the ceiling), but seemed completely nonplussed by the event. As they explained, it is a tropical climate. Fine, I understand the tropics. Having lived in Florida, DC, the Carribean, and Africa, I have had more than my fair share of the tropics. But there are standards, and my homes do not have this many roaches. We found one or two every night of our stay and the hotel just didn't seem to care at all. At check out, the manager comped us two breakfasts -- this was definitely not worth the money!

I was in NY in an excellent trip. Except our stay in Beekman, everything was great. However, the hotel(is very well located), leaves much to develop. The first day, my son was locked in the bathroom, because it locks the door (a bad screw in doorknob). The second day, the bathroom was flooded and part of the room with WC water. The same thing happened on the third day. The hotel staff is very nice, but except to apologize, I did not receive any manifestation of the hotel soon felt the inconvenience caused.

I was anticipating the Helmsley reputation...the staff was helpful and the room generally clean, BUT....the drapery pin on the bed wasn't shocking, and the closed safety pin in the middle of the floor was OK, but the 1" nail in the middle of the floor was disconcerting.....toe molding away from the wall in the closet, a distinct musty odor when you came in the door; wallpaper coming apart at the seams, and the formica bathroom sink BADLY cracking.....the location is great, but this is an old building that needs to be gutted and re-done...Leona come back!!!!

Have stayed in a number of hotels recommended by Tripadvisor.com, but this just did not live up to the reviews. Given Room 25 on the ground floor, very dark as it overlooked walls, decoration very drab and tired, paint peeling, definitely did not look like the pictures on the website. Commented to the front desk the next evening and was immediately upgraded to Room 57. As I was leaving for dinner I packed my bags and was advised everything would be moved by the time I returned and a complimentary bottle of champagne would be provided. On my return around 22:00 nothing had been moved. Went to front desk and moved myself with assistance from front desk staff. No champagne but this was quickly rectified. Very disappointing experience. Room 57 was lovely, did look like the pictures on the website and was very comfortable. Breakfasts excellent. Breakfast room lovely.

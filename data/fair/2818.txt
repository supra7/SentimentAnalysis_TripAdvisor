We wanted to try The "Grand" this trip to Hawaii and upon arrival we were greeted by a snotty "twenty something" clerk who was rude, disrespectful and very matter of fact that they did not have the room I booked for the first night of our stay, a room that was NOT updated like clerk assured me it was. The second room we moved to was beautifully renovated and spacious with an outstanding view. The pool is huge just like a full blown water park but it just doesn't seem right to have to panic every morning to get one of the crowded DIRTY chairs on the garbage strewn pool deck. The stores and lobbies are like a ghost town. The hotel says it's at 90% occupancy but their own newsletter clearly states that half of the rooms and "Kincha" the sushi restaurant are closed so the don't have to lay off a lot of staff do to the slow down in bookings. They must have let go of the higher paid more experienced staff to save money which has left them with staff unqualified to deliver 5 star service. One would think a resort with a slowdown in bookings would make sure the service and surroundings were exceptional to encourage favorable word of mouth. Overall I felt let down by the CHEAP atmosphere at the Grand Wailea, my family will not stay here again.

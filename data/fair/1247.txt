I've this hotel off of my list when needing a hotel near the airport in Philadelphia. Though it's generally a decent run of the mill Courtyard, it has 2 things going against it IMO. There is no wireless Internet in the rooms and as I travel withan iPad, this creates a problem. This Courtyard also has The Bistro renovation which I dislike as well. As I talk to Courtyard employees across the brand, they all dislike this new lobby just as much as I and many other do, I really wonder why Marriott continues to push this.

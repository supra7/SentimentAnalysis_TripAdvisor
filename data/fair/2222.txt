let's begin by saying they have a great facade. we were pleasantly surprised to finally arrive the same hotel that we had heard such mixed reviews about. it's located just blocks from newbury st. and the lobby looked amazing. we arrived a little early but were able to get our room key right away. at first we couldn't open the door, then once we did, we wished we hadn't. exactly like you may have read-old carpet, cobwebs on the ceiling, tv placed on a night stand, no space to walk around,ridiculously small bathroom-my boyfriend could only fit hlf of his body in, etc. anyway, it was a cold, snowy day and we had just driven about 6 hours so we weren't about to put up a fight. we decided to try and take a quick nap but were quickly reminded that ours was the room right next to the elevaors. so loud and obnoxious. i hated to be a pain but we called downstairs to kindly ask to be switched to a room away from the elevator shaft. they were very understanding and switched us to a room at least twice the size! now this seemed a little more along the lines of what we had paid for but i was a little annoyed at the same time given the fact that i had made reservations a whole month prior. it's not tourist season in mid november, so i was unclear as to why we were placed in such a dump initially. in preparation for such a disater, i had emailed customer service as i had read on another review, which said that that party had done so and recieved phenomenal service. yeah, well i didnt recieve feedback until i got home. overall it was a pretty miserable experience. did i mention we got some crazy phone charge that i had to fight to the death to get knocked off? and also, on the night before our departure, we had gotten lost and called the hotel for 2 hours looking for directions-no luck!

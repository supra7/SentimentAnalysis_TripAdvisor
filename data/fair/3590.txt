Did some reviewers saw the rooms are small. They are exaggerating. They are actually smaller than that. There is about 5 inches between one side of the bed and the window. To get to that side you have to crawl under the TV. The bathroom is not just tiny but has a sliding glass door that neither locks or closes snugly. Am I being prudish? Did I mention that I has told that I was one of first to stay in the recently refurbished rooms. If so, the paint was already peeling off the wall. The staff did seem to be trying and cannot be responsible for the extra blanket we ordered unless they had some role in the stains on the blankets. The stains were kind of crusty -- so let's not think about it too much.

Upon entry I saw the bathroom garbage full & a dirty towel thrown over the shower curtain. Then I noted spider webs and dust every where, no coffee for the coffee pot &, later, a huge puddle of water under the heater/ac...... the husband went out and informed the desk clerk of the water problem, resulting in the clerk saying he would be right in-- I finally went out to find the clerk to see where he was, after waiting for over an hour for him. The lady clerk said "oh, he went home, that is always wet and we don't know why it's wet". Then the icing on the cake ...no sheets on the bed!! I saw in the am that the window was leaking FYI. It was the last room, so we stayed---I do not think it is the norm for Hampton--but it was an interesting stay, to say the least!!

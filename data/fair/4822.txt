Living in the region, I am quite familiar with many Boston hotels. I booked the Bostonian for a romantic weekend because it is close to the great Italian resturants of the North End and across the street from the unique shopping of Quincy Market. Wanting the weekend to be special I selected the Superior room w/balcony overlooking the market. This was a $40 upcharge from the standard room. What we got was a smallish room, the furniture laid out so the person on the far side of the bed had to crawl over the other person to get out. A balcony that was approximately 2'X 5" did have a good view of the market (nicely lit for the holiday season). Stepping out of our room to go to dinner we were surprised to walk right into a Christmas cockatil party set up on the internal veranda just outside our door. It can get quite noisy on the street below the balcony rooms when the clubs let out and no one was yelling Merry Christmas. Maybe I am just being a Grinch but overall the hotel was a disapointment for the money. Next time I will pick one in Back Bay. The great food of the North End is just a T ride away.

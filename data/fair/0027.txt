The front desk was just so so and didn't really seem to care. At 5 p.m. they had people waiting for their rooms and couldn't check in. The rooms seemed dirty and dingy and the pool area was dingy. It was in a great area - close to all attractions and the harbor which was nice but don't expect any help from the staff. There was a hefty parking fee in addition to a large room fee.

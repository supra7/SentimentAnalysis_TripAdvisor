While there was nothing actually wrong with our stay at the Park Plaza, its certainly not a hotel I could recommend. The room was large and clean, but in desperate need of a refurb. Also most of the channels on the TV were unwatchable due to poor reception. The majority of the hotel's staff were friendly and helpful. However, the concierge seemed dismissive and while he answered our queries, his answers were often so vage as to be useless. The hotel is in a great location, but so are most hotels in Boston and I expect more from a hotel which markets itself as one of the city's premier places to stay.

went to vegas for the third time this april and once again had a blast! I just never get bored with that town. We stayed at the El Cortez for a few nights and was extremely impressed. the staff couldn't have been nicer and we weren't quite sure what to expect with the hotel itself. but I would go back there in a heartbeat. the rooms were very nice. and we even saw about 4 different ones. they were wonderful. I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone. We also had a wedding at the stained glass chapel and found the staff there very nice. The wedding package wasn't quite what we had expected but it all worked out ok. I would definitly ask more specific questions next time about how their services work but all in all they were ok. but I would never go through the las vegas wedding authority again. They were misleading from the start. I have been calling since my return for a rebate that was promised for the package and they won"t even answer my phone calls they got back within minutes to me when I was setting everything up and they wanted my money. but now they are totally ignoring me. so don't deal with the las vegas wedding authority. all in all had a wonderful time and plan to go back for our aniversary this fall.

I was not pleased with the Westin at all. I have traveled to Maui many a time and thought that the Westin deserved a try. The service needs serious improvement from the front desk to the pool waitresses, it seemed as if everyone was too busy or my concerns/requests were not important to them. The rooms are very tiny and the bathrooms are even smaller. Barely any counter space and only room for one person at a time. The bed is comfortable but takes up the majority of the room. The food is mediocre. The breakfast buffet food was usually overcooked and sits there for hours without being changed. The pool is very nice and great for families. If you can afford to spend more on a hotel and the pool is a large priority, the Grand Wailea has the most amazing pools and waterslides (plus their Spa is fabulous). The Fairmont Kea Lani and Four Seasons are wonderful too.

Just got back from a 6 night stay. Were disappointed. On the plus side was the location, the front desk staff around midnght when we checked in, and others in the lobby bar and the bellmen. This hotel is tired! We had a lovely view, but the first night we noticed a fishy odor and the carpet was wet and stained at the bathroom door. We coverd it with towels - it was late and all we wanted to do was sleep. We reported this the next morning and they would switch our room, but no view. We decided to stay having unpacked and just wanted it cleaned.. We left for the day and they never got to the room until late afternoon. The housekeeper had never been told. Went to desk again. We think maybe that day or the next they did try to clean it, but we kept a bath mat over the wet area. The staff just never took the time to just let us know if an attempt had been made to fix the problem. This was our first stay at a Westin and the bed was great and so was the shower. But housekeeping is overwhelmed. After day one we only ever got 1 heavenly towel a day if that. Our expectations we for so much more.They need to listen to customers.

I have previously reviewed this hotel in June 2006. This review, which I'm just getting around to, is based on my fourth stay in late September 2006 with my 22 year-old daughter and my 18 year-old son. We booked a one-bedroom suite for about $325 per night directly with the hotel. When we checked in, we found that the mini-kitchen that we had been promised was a wet bar and small refrigerator only. The hotel misinformed me on that one. We also learned that the love seat in the living room was not a pull-out sleeper. (When I reconsulted the website, I believe I was the one in error on that one.) When I went down to the desk to register my displeasure, the desk clerk told me I could have a rollaway bed for $20 per night. I asked him to make it complimentary, and he had the on-duty manager speak to me. The manager was adamant about charging me the $60 for 3 nights, even after I told him that I was a loyal, repeat visitor on my fourth stay. It was pretty funny, then, when the desk clerk said to the manager, sotto voce, "I think you should give it to him at no charge." The manager relented. The suite was dingy. The bathroom was tiny. The shower had little water pressure and the most annoying habit, every time, of switching about every 30 seconds from scalding hot to very cold. I had to constantly readjust the temperature control, which itself had a "hair-trigger" and required micro adjustment to cause reasonable changes in temperature. The living room had tables with lamps at either end. One tiny problem: they weren't plugged in, and there was no electrical outlet close enough to either of them in order for us to plug them in. What's up with that? The location is fabulous and the price is good, but I've decided I want just a little more luxury when I venture to NY next. I'm over my attraction to the Helmsley Middletowne, even at these prices.

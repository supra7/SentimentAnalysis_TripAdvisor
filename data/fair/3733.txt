The property is located within easy driving distance from all the Disney Parks and is only one exit from Sea World and Discovery Cove. There are plenty of restaurants nearby. The staff was friendly and very helpful and this is why I rated the hotel as poor instead of terrible. Rating it average would be too generous as I have been in many average hotels that were much better. The rooms were worn down a little and could use a remodel. The property is a little old and I always felt like the room was dirty. The tile in the bathrooms were in need of serious cleaning or replacement. The pillows were the worst I've had in a hotel. They looked like a throw pillow for a couch with a cover on it. They barely measured 14 inches wide and were very lumpy. Internet... what internet? It was so slow they might as well say it's not available. It reminded me of a 56k modem and during peak times, a 28k modem. The free breakfast should be free as it was one of the worst! The eggs were horrible (foamy and lacked taste), the sausage floated in grease, and had no bacon. They did have fresh fruit and bread. It was so bad we opted to pay for breakfast elsewhere. The "Customer Service" desk is basically a desk where you get a sales pitch on all the Disney parks and other junk you may or may not want. The front desk makes you go to that desk to pick up your parking pass so you are forced to talk to them. I saw what was coming and made it known to only give me a pass and not say anymore. I hate being forced to talk to sales people. I am a Priority Club member at their Platinum level and I can say that of all the Staybridge hotels I have been to, this one ranks the worst.

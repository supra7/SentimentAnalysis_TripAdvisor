Just to say, I am not a complainer, however, what a disappointment after staying at the Wynn last year. The staff are not very friendly to begin with. You have a 20.00 U.S. fee per night to begin with, (not worth it, and a hold of 100.00 U.S. per night on you credit card). The washroom was definitely not clean, hair all over the floor, even after we complained and it was recleaned, dust everywhere, I really think that the occupancy rate must be very low. Close to the strip, however, the courtesy shuttle only goes to the corner of the Fashion Show Mall, and on the hour to the Ceasar Palace. If you are looking for te Las Vegas excitement, don't stay at the Trump. Overall, what a disappointment!!!!

Sheraton said they overbooked and gave us a so called upgrade. It was NOT. We cannot understand how they could take our payment in full 2 months ahead of time and then say they don't have a room for us in the catagory that we had reservations for. A very dishonest practice by a big hotel chain. I guess this is standard practice????!!!!

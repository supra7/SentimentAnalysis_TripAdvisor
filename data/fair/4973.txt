On a recent visit to Chicago I chose the Whitehall. It was advertised as a "luxury"hotel. After calling to let the staff know we would be a late arrival due to travel delay we checked in to be told that the room we reserved was not available and we were given the choice of a smoking room or a much smaller room There was no price adjustment. We chose the smaller. The room was indeed small. The arm chair was dirty and worn with stuffing spilling out the bottom. Bedside tables chipped and cracked. Carpet dirty and the overall paint in the room as well as the hallways was worn and chipped. The bathroom was small but nice. Room price was $372 and an additional $48 for parking. Location is good. There are better hotels for the same money in Chicago.

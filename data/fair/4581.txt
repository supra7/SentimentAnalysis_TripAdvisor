Pink Palace Party ??? After traveling 5 1/2 hours first class, taking a limo to the hotel, we were ready to ho ke lau and party. 13 of us arrived to a hotel that had lost it's glory many years ago. The accomodations were unacceptable. No one in our party received the rooms they were satisfied with. We were moved 3 times, Our first room, in the historic section was adequately sized, but the sofa was so dirty, that you couldn't sit down. The bathroom had burn marks on the counters and tub, straight out of aBmovie!, and the carpeting was smelly and worn. Then the hotel upgraded us to their junior suite! Complete with no air conditioning, the same dirty sofa( must have been a matched set!), and a dorm room refrigerator (stuck in the middle of the floor ) as furniture!! The 3rd room was in the newer tower. Although much smaller, it did have an ocean view, so we stayed put. Our compadres fared no better in their search for rooms! Each ended up moving multiple times. The hotel , although majestic to look at, with huge potential!, appears to have no on-site management present. Operated under the Sheraton Starwood program, we were told that a Mr. Randy Ha was the General Manager, and worked out of the neighboring Sheraton hotel. If that is true, we never were able to make contact with him/her. Funny story, we were all invited to a cocktail party hosted by the manager, but no manager(s) were present. Additionally, there is only 1 restaurant in service at the hotel. It is buffet styled, poorly serviced, and dirty. We ended up spending our food dollars at the Halekulani hotel nearby. Although the day to day staff was courteous and helpful, this hotel needs a management overhaul. Someone who really loves this old beauty, and is willing to bring her back to the world class hotel she deserves to be!!

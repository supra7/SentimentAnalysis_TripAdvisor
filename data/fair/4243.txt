Stayed at the Holiday Inn on 66th street in September, 2006. Was very disappointed. The lobby is old and needs an update. My room smelled musty and felt wet and humid the entire time. The room is old and needs a make over, especially the carpet. The hallways are disgusting and smelled very bad. I could not wait until my vacation was over. The view was nice, but that was the only thing that was worthwhile. Alot of teenagers around the pool drinking. Not one was carded and most looked under age. Would never stay there again. One night a teenager was on the beach screaming for about a hour.

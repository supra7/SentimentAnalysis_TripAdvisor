I chose this hotel because we arrived at SeaTac at 10 pm and didn't want to drive very far at that time of night. The primary reason most people go to a hotel is to sleep, and that was difficult to do at this hotel. Our room faced the atrium, a covered swimming pool area, where sound echoes. There were people out at the pool until at least 2:00 a.m. -- I finally used ear plugs so I could get some sleep. Unfortunately, the early birds were out at the pool at 6:00 a.m., so it was a very short night for me! Very serious design flaw in this hotel! The parking area is also annoying. It was difficult to find my way in to the hotel registration area at night because the signage was inadequate. Then, a key is needed to exit the lot; I had left my key in the room for recycling, so I had to go back and wait for a housekeeping manager to let me in the room so I could get away from this place. Next time I arrive on the 10 p.m. flight I will drive at that time of night to find a place to actually get some sleep.

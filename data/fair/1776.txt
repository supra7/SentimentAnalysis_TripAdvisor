We have stayed at this resort many times in the past, but this time we were told there would be a $39.00 room fee added! After checking into the room, we found ants covering the kitchen counters and microwave. Needless to say, I demanded the room cleaning fee be removed from my bill as the room was not even clean upon check in. We will not be staying here again.

Modern, conveniently located close to the airport and well priced hotel. Spacious and modern rooms, poorly appointed with 2 double beds (unfortunately one of them not clean). My biggest problem with this hotel was the cleaning (dirty bathroom tiles and floor) and towels located next to the toilet! The staff was not particularly helpful and I did not feel welcome there. By the way... hotel shuttle bus driver drove us through 3 parking lots before we got to the hotel! There are other hotels in the vicinity that I would like to try next time.

W Hotel Seattle - This is the 5th time I've stayed with you, and this is the 5th time you've tried to bill me for something never used in-room after checkout. I understand the occasional snafu in being charged for something every now and then, but this hotel has done it every single stay. It is clear to me now that the hotel is scrounging for money and will try to pass off false bills to your customers hoping they don't catch it on their credit card statements. Shame on you, and shame on me for staying with the W Seattle for a 5th time. Get your accounting up to shape with the rest of the world... until then, you will not see me or anyone else I speak with as a guest.

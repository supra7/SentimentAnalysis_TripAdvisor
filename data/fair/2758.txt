Used to be the classiest, serene oasis in Los Angeles. Now you cannot turn on a light without using an iPad. And then it's all the lights or none. The bellmen and front office staff are busy running to all the rooms to turn the lights, heat, a/c, etc. on and off for the guests. I asked the the bellman to tell the management that the technology was impossible. He then told me that if he complained for the guests one more time, he would be fired. The person who eliminated every light switch should be fined for ruining the Bel-Air.

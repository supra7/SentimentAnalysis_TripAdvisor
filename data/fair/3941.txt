The Rex was a massive disappointment, I feel as though those who stayed here were at a different hotel. it was like a bad version of Fawlty Towers. One, our room was the size of a large closet - and apparently it's the largest queen room they have. On top of that, it was dirty and run down. Two, the staff was rude. They forgot a sheet on our bed, and when we complained said it's supposed to be that way.

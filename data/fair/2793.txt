Stayed at the Grand Wailea for 4 nights last week. Last time I was in Wailea a few yrs ago I stayed at the FS, so I am somewhat jaded. This hotel is enormous....almost 800 rooms! Everything seemed like a hike. Was a 5-10 min walk from my room just to get to the pool. Felt I was nickel and dimed at check in. $25 resort fee. $10 luggage transfer fee. $3 maid gratuity fee. All this on top of my nightly rate. Didn't find staff to be too polite or accomodating. They need some lessons from their neighbors down the beach (FS & Fairmount). Anytime I asked a question, they made me feel like I was harassing them. Would not stay here again and would not recommend to anyone...even families....there are plenty of other resorts in HI that'll cater to children. You don't need to spend your money at this place. The biggest joke was the line of people (40 deep) waiting to get towels prior to the pool opening at 7 AM. It stressed me out just looking at them from my beachside yoga class. This is not a 5 star property, or anything close to luxurious. Conrad Hilton would be rolling over in his grave if he knew the GW was associated with his chain.

My boyfriend had previously stayed at the Hotel Diva and had rave reviews about the hotel. Unfortunately, we will not be coming back. We waited in a line for at least thirty minutes to check into the hotel. We took advantage of the valet parking, however, what was slightly troubling was the car being left in front of the hotel for a couple hours before being taken it to valet parking area. Before checking out, we requested the car to be brought out and ready for our departure. After standing in line for at least another 30 minutes to check out (mind you waiting for everyone else to state their personal complaints of the hotel to the concierge), the hotel realized that they had forgotten to get our car out of the valet garage and we had to wait for another 20 minutes for our car's arrival. Although the hotel has potential, it is extremely overpriced for the service you receive.

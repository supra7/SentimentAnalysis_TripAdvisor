i stayed here for a night last week. this week i'm here for six. Because of the longer stay,i asked for a room on the outside of the building rather than the internal ones which overlook the noisy, polluted, filthy concrete jungle of airconditioning units and a multi-storey carpark. I was lead to believe that I was given one, but no, I had the same outlook as before. When I arrived, both rooms smelt and had the air conditioners going full bore, despite the cool weather - I assume it was in a failed attempt to rid the room of smell. There are no fridges in the room either. The lifts are decrepit (take ages to get to you) and tatty. For what you get, it is expensive.

We had a room with a 90 degree angle view of the beach. The furniture was outdated, there were hairs on our bathroom floor, and the room was in desperate need of a renovation. The front desk staff were young students, not very helpful, and usually too busy to give you the time of day. When I checked out, I didn't receive a receipt for my stay, and when I went to ask for one, the front desk person was onto something else. They denied someone late checkout, saying they needed all the rooms by 11 am as they were sold out, when someone else walked up and was told they had plenty of rooms. Not real impressed with this Holiday Inn. The outfdoor pool was nice but much smaller than the pictures, and the indoor pool was a dump.

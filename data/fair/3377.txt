Stayed at the hotel with my girlfriend, brother and his wife. Really liked hotel location and found room size to be all right. Was incredibly insulted by the front desk lady, who called me on the room and woke me up saying that I was lying to her about my brother having called a cab. I've never seen anyone so unprepared for dealing with public! Among the 3 other guys in the front desk I spoke to, 2 were also very unfriendly. It seemed that I was disturbing their peace every time I needed to ask a question. If you have to stay there, ask for a room that doesn't face the street, or you'll wake up with the noise. Stayed in the 3rd floor and it was impossible to sleep. Room safe was tiny. Don't recommend staying there if you expect to see smiles from any of the hotel workers.

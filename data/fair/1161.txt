The web site is very misleading. The beach is just sand that was brought in to cover a lawn. There is a water view but you cannot access the water. There is no mention on the web site that smoking is not allowed anywhere on the property and there is a $500/day penality if you smoke. The condo we stayed in had a kitchen so we bought beer and wine; however, the rules prevent guests from taking wine and beer to the pool area --- you must buy drinks from the resorts bar. The property was located a great distance from the downtown activities which requires you to take cabs or you need to rent a car. The condo was furnished nicely and clean, and the bedrooms comfortable. However, we would not stay at the property again because it was very pricey for no more than a nice, comfortable and clean condo. Additionally, we were very disappointed that the web site was so misleading and did not include all the information you need to make a decision on where to stay.

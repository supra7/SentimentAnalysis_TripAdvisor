Unpleasantly surprised I planned this romantic getaway because my husband had been in Iraq and we needed some time together, so I had seen all of the wonderful reviews and thought this would be great! The moment we got to the hotel my husband and I just looked at each other and we know immediately what we were thinking. The place smelled like old mold. We could not stand it. The staff was pleasant but I would have to say that the manager was very condisending as noted in one of the other reviews. It reminded us of a spokey mansion, we decided to leave for another hotel after we went out for lunch just 3 blocks down the road the neighborhood did not seem safe. We may have been paranoid but decided quickly to get out of there. We ended up going to Hilton, it was cheaper and smelled much nicer. Sorry, but this was not my idea of romance. Don't get fooled, I was and ended up paying for two nights at 200.00 a night and didn't even stay there once. Beware!

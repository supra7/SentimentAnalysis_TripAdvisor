The Red Lion is a decent hotel with complimentary shuttles to the SeaTac airport, but their staff is incompetent beyond belief. Our room had been booked with 7 nights of free parking, so when they told me that was no longer an option and that I had to pay (in which case I would have just parked in the economy lot at the airport), I left a message with the manager to ask why it had been posted as free parking. When I hadn't heard back from the manager after not 1, not 2 but 4 messages on her answering machine over the course of 3 days, I became appalled at their lack of not only customer service, but lack of listening to a customer complaint. If you do decide to stay at the Red Lion, be aware that if you have a problem, it will fall on deaf ears.

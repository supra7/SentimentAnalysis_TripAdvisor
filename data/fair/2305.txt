I was excited at first then after spending a few hours here the whole thing changed. First of all the walls are super thin. You can hear everything,from ice machine to your neighbor. Also there is no free internet. I needed to do my work so had to pay for it. After paying realized signal is to weak and making work impossible. Front desk was of no help and did not offer any solution. I asked for a different room, but no luck. I spent all night in the lobby working. This is a very bad experience.

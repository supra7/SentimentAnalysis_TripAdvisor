The last reviewer nailed it on the head - this is not "Ritz" quality. We just arrived back from a trip with a group, and had come after staying for the first 4 days at a Mariott on Oahu (the Illihani - it was beautiful) we all thought it would only get better at the Ritz - and we have stayed at plenty. Our room stated "Run of the Ocean View" - we literally had to stand on a chair to see around a post to see the ocean - and then it was only about 5 to 8 degrees of view - we could see all the coconut trees you would want. Very disappointing to say the least. No lei greeting - just lei's hanging on a post to "take one". Rooms: Drab, need a refurb badly. Service: Well, I pulled up with 7 people in the van and had to unload my own luggage from the van - not a bellman in sight - I have never had to do this at a Ritz - 7 bags unloaded by me personally - they did show up with a cart to put them on and bring to the room. Grounds: Beautiful when you walk around. Final thoughts: I would not return here - in fact, I sincerely believe some of the "exceptional" reviews listed here are false. This hotel is absolutely not Ritz quality - save yourself the aggravation of high expectations and low realizations.

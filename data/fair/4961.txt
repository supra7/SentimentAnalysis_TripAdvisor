We stayed in room 308. I booked the room thru Hotwire. They listed it as a 4 star hotel. We found the room to be small and shabby. Paint was peeling off the ceiling and some of the trim. Wall paper was peeling off in some spots. Tile was chipped and broken around the toilet.The thermostat did not work in our room and when I reported it to the front desk they said that was a common problem in their rooms. The overall appearance of the common areas was very worn. I would find it very difficult to rate this a 3 star hotel and certainly not a 4 star.

I am a big fan of W hotels generally. I have happily stayed in San Francisco, San Diego, LA, New Orleans, Seattle etc etc. My experiences in NYC have been mixed: worst have been terrible and best have been marginal. I've probably spend 20 nights at this hotel over past 18 months on about 10 separate occassions. Rooms are small, a bunch of the rooms have single beds (most people over age of 15 won't fit into it) and they have a super loud air conditioning/heating system which really needs to be left off if you want a quiet room. I am SPG gold which hasn't really helped at all get decent room on a consistent basis. I have also had two experiences where i have on my printed itinerary a confirm from the hotel of a queen bed and when i arrived they said all sold out and only single bed avail. AFter each stay you receive an email asking for feedback. I provided feedback on poor experiences I have had and never received a response back.

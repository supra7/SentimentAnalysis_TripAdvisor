This is a clean, friendly hotel with nice dcor and a great location, however it is not exactly a luxury hotel. The concierge doesn't work Sundays or after 6 on weeknights. Our room, one up from the standard room, was smaller than what you would find at the Hilton or Westin for the same price and the furnishings weren't quite as nice. While the hotel does have an incredible glass sculpture on display in the lobby, there wasn't much more art than you would find at a similarly priced hotel. The Aveda Spa, et cetera are all accessed from the street as well as the hotel. The bathroom was nothing special - tub/shower combo are smallish. And, the windows, while beautiful, are far from sound proof. If you stay here, be sure to ask for a room facing away from 1st, unless you like the sounds of traffic and the construction project across the street. All in all, a nice hotel, but what you are really paying for is the location, not luxury.

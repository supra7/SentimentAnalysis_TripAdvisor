When we went to check in they couldn't find my reservation that I made 3 weeks in advance.So make sure you have a confirmation number with you. I had to pay 40.00 more and could only get a king bed instead of 2 doubles and that took 40 minutes to check in.We were in the corner room on the third floor and the traffic was so loud I would recommend earplugs. No microwave. The elevators are extremely slow and the hotel layout awful. Not worth what we paid .I will not stay again.

A work in progress; bring earplugs Although we had no glaring problems that made us rush down to the desk to complain, this was a classic not what we expected stay. The staff is exceedingly helpful and the lobby is well appointed and clean, but our individual room did not seem to meet these same standards. As posted elsewhere, this hotel (and just about everything in this VERY urban beach neighborhood) is undergoing extensive construction and renovations, and our overall impression was that a lot of the general room upkeep has been sacrificed in the spirit of we're re-doing everything anyway, so why waste money bringing things up to standard? The bathroom tile floor and fixtures were clean, but the grout hasn't been scrubbed in ages, and everything has a dull, gritty look to it. The rugs, bedding, etc...are of an acceptable level, but again, only probably on par with a mid-level chain motel. Our 19th floor partial view room did, in fact, have a great view--of the parking lot and hotel-in-progress next door, and construction machinery revved up each morning well before dawn (weekends included). I'd be willing to bet this will be a nice joint when all is finished, but until then, I'd have to recommend a quiter, cleaner location if you're looking to relax in peace.

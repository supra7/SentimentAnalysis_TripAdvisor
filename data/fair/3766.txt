Our family of 5 visited during spring break for 5 days. Each meal the service was horrific especially during breakfast. The buffet was in constant need of replenishment and you had to beg for coffee. Tried to order off the menu, but food came wrong and slow. To use the water park you had to wait in a 30+ minute line so you could scramble for a lounge chair. Instead tried to use the pool by the room and they had only 13 lounge chairs. The housekeepers were pleasant, but room each day was not cleaned until after 3:00PM. One day the water was turned off for the afternoon and still off when we left for dinner at 7:00 meaning no toilet flushing, no shower after a hot day in the sun and on the same day they lost electricity and could not supply towels at the water park. The positive's: room size was great and weather was awesome. We would not go back and would highly recommend looking for an alternate property to visit.

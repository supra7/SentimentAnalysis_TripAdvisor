Nice hotel with great rooms and a convenient location for our college visits. Our only problem was with the shuttle service which failed to pick us up as planned every time we used it. First night the van skipped our scheduled pickup forcing us to wait at the stop another hour. The second night they did not come at all requiring us to take a taxi back to the hotel, but only after several phone calls and another hour plus wait based on their assurances that they would be there in 15 minutes. However, the worst part was that we were blamed for the problems. On the first night the driver said he stopped and no one was there  the eight of us at the stop before the scheduled pickup time would disagree. On the second night they told us we specified another stop that was different than where we dined and across town. Bottom line, if you are thinking of this hotel because of the shuttle dont - or just build in taxi fare. We will not got back to a hotel that does not solve their problems but rather lies about them.

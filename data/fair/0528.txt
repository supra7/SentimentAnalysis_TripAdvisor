We booked this room as our company party was in the same building. The staff at the front desk was friendly, and the lobby is quite impressive. Unfortunately, those were pretty much the high points. The hallways are very, very dark. Dark colors, low light, but easy to navigate. Our room was a corner room, and showed its age with many areas of chipped paint, luggage scuffs against the wall, and so on. The room layout was pretty good, with many amenities for the business traveler (phone/high-speed hookup, big desk, and so on). They seem to think very highly of themselves, with a big 'W' magazine, and a CD of music suggested by the 'W' (to listen to while reading the magazine, I assume). There were various other magazines filled with pretty people wearing $500 shoes and doing fabulous things as well. We found it odd that they could spend the money on four different periodicals and supply every room with a small handheld silver kaleidoscope in its own holder, but didn't give guests Q-tips. We wanted to get a snack before the party, and were directed to the bar. The prices scared us off...most appetizers were in the $20 range and sounded very exotic, which we took to mean tiny portions and lots of garnish. We ended up wandering over to the local Rock Bottom brewery and took advantage of their $3 happy hour offers, which were great! In closing, when one rents a room, their primary reason is for sleeping. That leads us to the biggest disappointment. The bed at the W was comparable to sleeping on a mound of large potatoes. My wife's back was so sore in the morning that she had trouble getting dressed. I personally felt like I had been beaten with a bag of oranges. I would only recommend this hotel to trendy young people who are expensing their room on their company charge card or those who really were trying to impress very urban people.

We decided to go for this hotel based on its location and pictures, and the price was reasonable (but for New Year's Eve everything is expensive...) Pro: good beds, great shower (yet very small cabin), very clean, reasonable location, good breakfast, TV with MTV, free Internet (via cable) Con: only seperate beds (with seperate bedcovers!), very small rooms and tiny bathroom, not very helpfull staff at reception (too young and uninterested), no minibar The room has been photographed in a smart way, cause on the pictures it seems spacious whereas it's very small. The beds were very comfortable, but when you want to have a romantic weekend it's no fun having 2 seperate beds with also seperate bedcovers. Reception stated they had only 1 type of room..... so it's a great business hotel :-) The breakfast is extensive and if you don't book it ahead you can use it anyway as they don't check roomnumbers... Most annoying to us was the reception staff who gave only half information, forgot to book a taxi when asked to do so, etc. Conclusion: uncomplicated hotel for business: yes; but don't spend your city-weekend break here!

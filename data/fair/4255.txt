My first stay was in 2010 and this was my second time staying here. They're still supposedly going through a renovation process although I haven't noticed any changes. Rooms are old, outdated and drab although my bed was comfortable. Breakfast buffet area is my favorite part about the hotel. They cater to both American and Chinese tastebuds and serve a large variety with a station serving fresh waffles, pancakes, omelettes, eggs. Also the servers are friendly and quick. And that's about all that is good with the hotel. The location sucks, not that I'm too fond of DT LA to begin with. My biggest gripe is the lack of security. They have ONE security personnel that oversees the entire property! This is downtown L.A. where the homeless are everywhere, and apparently including the inside of the hotel lobby. You would think people at the hotel would notice them walking in and say something. When I asked about the homeless woman walking around in her socks, they said they would not approach her because she might have been a guest. Well that woman ended up attacking me, and guess what, she was homeless. I guess one security officer would have been fine if they had cameras monitoring the property 24/7. But again, nope. They have cameras that only rotate around. Useless. Needless to say, I will not be staying here again.

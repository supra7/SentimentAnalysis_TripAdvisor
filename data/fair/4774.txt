Although we enjoyed our stay to start with, we found that the hotel was unwilling to provide fair compensation for a major safety issue that occurred to us. While staying in the room we had a fireplace and enjoyed it our first night. Two nights later we had the staff start another fire for us. This time I came into the room to find my wife in a room filled with smoke. The flue on the fireplace was not working properly. We called up a mechanic who informed us this was an ongoing issues. Thus the Lennox had the opportunity to have us stay in another room or suggest we do not use the fireplace if it could not be fixed. There was no such suggestion until after hours of having the fire backing smoke into the room in my absence. Although we were moved they made no adjustment to our bill. After complaining a number of times we finally got only one night stay removed. It is unfortunate that this happened but even more unfortunate and telling for future visitors that the management was unwilling to provide a fair compensation for damages. Be very wary of this establishment until management changes are made.

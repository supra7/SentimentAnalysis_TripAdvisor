I have been staying at this hotel for many occasions over many years and have to say it has doubled the price but did not make any improvements to the place. It now is just a big rip-off for 130 SGD per night. I wouldnt stay there anymore. Much party and drink noise from the street prevented me from getting any sleep. Madras hotel is not worth the money as it used to be.

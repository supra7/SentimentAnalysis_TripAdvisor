Just spent a week at the Magnolia Hotel and would never return. The hotel is very old, but they have done a good job in restoring the common areas and to some extent the rooms. However, as everyone in my group complained, the heating system in the rooms is very old and very loud. To the point that when I was making a call from the room someone asked me if I was outside because it sounded like a truck was driving by. Needless to say, if you are staying at the Magnolia during cool weather get a set of ear plugs. There are some positives about the hotel. The breakfast buffet is very good and the hotel staff from the front desk to the valets are all very friendly and helpful (although charging me $50 to check out at 12 instead of 11 is really nickle and diming me). But for me, if I cant get a good night sleep, Id rather stay somewhere else.

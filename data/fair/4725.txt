Just returned from our honeymoon where we stayed at the Sheraton. The beach and water was so crowded we walked away from the hotel in order to find a place to sit and swim. Also, though the room was a nice oceanfront, it was a 15 minute walk to get to the front desk and the people at the desk were unhelpful. We had many problems, like the person assigned to call us and welcome us, left messages before she met us, and then after she met us, she kept calling and saying she would like to meet us. She wasn't able to book activities nor restaurant reservations so she was useless to us. The room came with a coupon for champagne. Yet we couldn't get it before 6pm, when we wanted it at 5pm. They told us we could come and get it ourselves from room service but when we went to get it, they didn't have it ready, even though we had just called. And why couldn't we have it delivered until 6pm???? It was just really poorly organized and nothing seemed to work well from a service standpoint. This is not a top resort and it was very disappointing as we had just come from the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel on Hawaii, where there is real service and at a lower price.

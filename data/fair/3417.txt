Location was fine, but the rooms are shabby and the decor hasn't not been freshened up since the 1980's. The rugs were grey and stained. Linens were old and tatty. It's a reasonable price but there are better accommodations in the city. Perhaps this was a lovely hotel 20 years ago, but renovations are long overdue!

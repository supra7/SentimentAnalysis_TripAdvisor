It was an anticipating trip to the hotel. I was thrilled to be able to stay in of the top-notch hotels in hongkong however there were 2 factors that put me off First, guest service was ridiculously below expectations. Second, breakfast was way too expensive and there wasn't a great variety for selection. The location is alright and there's a big mall. The views from the rooms are good and the interiors are modern and sleek. However, the hotel is still far from being top notch and they need lots of improvement in terms of customer service.

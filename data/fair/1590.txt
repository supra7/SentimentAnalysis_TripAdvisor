Stayed here for a week with my husband. Have travelled extensively and stayed in many 5 star hotels, this is not 5 star. We arrived very early in morning after travelling through the night and had requested an early check in. It was my birthday and we were also celebrating our anniversary, tough, we were made to wait until check in despite rooms being available. The staff need a lesson or two in how to treat guests. The reception staff never smile and are unhelpful. Concierge is a joke, what is that, it was only the young doorman that tried to help with directions ect. Food is absolutely awful as is room service and expensive, rooms small, TV package 40 euro a night, a movie 15 euro and they are old, left with the news channel. Spa is very good, pool,sauna ect. charge guests 3TL for a swimming cap to use the pool, come on Elite World. Too far from the sites if on a short break.

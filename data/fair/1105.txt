bid on Priceline 5 star hotels in Las Vegas and ended up at the Trump and hated it. The room is nice but there's no casino, the pool is tiny and the location is off strip with no sidewalks so you need a taxi for most places you want to go, the tv channels are very basic and disappointing, the shower head was disgusting, the sink was dirty and they charged us double for internet service because my girl and I both have our own computers, $24.00 per day for internet. If you're going to use Priceline and your looking for a 5 star, don't include the north strip in your search because you'll likely end up here and it's definitely not worth the difference..

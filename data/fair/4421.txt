The hotel is well maintained on the main lobby level although, the rooms (even though somewhat renovated and modern), were done so cheaply that the carpets were too small for the room, the paint was chipping and the laminate floors were buckling. The first room we had, the tub was rusted and the shower head did not work. The second room was large; albeit dirty - very dirty with someone's underwear being left by the cleaning staff in the corner of our room upon arrival. The bed was so close to the bathroom door that we had to move it in order to get in and out. To top it off, there was toothpaste splatter on the mirror and walls of the bathroom. Disgusting. I have been to this hotel before but, will never return to stay that is for certain. Beds were comfortable but, after reading about bed bugs from other TA reviewers... somehow loses the grandeur of a good night's sleep and makes you wonder. Front staff member was sympathetic and a pleasure to deal with although, room fees were not comped but discounted. Swimming pool was great for the kids - the best part of our 1 night stay. Sadly, would not recommend.

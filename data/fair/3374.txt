Well, we haven't even gotten there yet and already I am hating the place! I made our reservations back in February - 3 rooms for 3 couples. On April 1, I had to cancel one of the rooms since one of my friends had something come up. It is now May 27, and still I have not received my refund (I paid in full back in February via money order) I have called at least twice a week for over a month, and each time "they will check on it and call me back" but they don't call me back. I am filing a report with the BBB and if I do not have a definate answer by 3:00 this afternoon,I am canceling my reservation. Beware when making reservations at this hotel!

We stayed in New York for a week for a international security conference in October and through the convention booked at what we thought would be a memorable stay at the W Hotel on Lexington. It also coincided with my partner's birthday and thought that this would be memorable hip place to celebrate. Well the bar area is definetly happening but we were most disappointed about the size and quality of the rooms. There was not even a set of drawers to put your sweaters, socks or underwear away. We had only a cloth shoe organizer inside the dinky closet to store our personal belongings. The carpet had stains and rug pulls in it and our two pieces of luggage had to be stacked on top of each other due to lack of space. This facility needs an upgrade of its rooms.....we stayed the year before at the Ameritania on 230 West 54 Street which was a quarter of the price and twice the space...go there and hop over to the W Hotel for drinks and you will have the best of both worlds. The salt on the wound is that their sales department offered us a credit of points but this amounts to less than one night after spending close to $400 per night. Not good enuff!!!!!

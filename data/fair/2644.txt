Outside is nice, lobby and general areas are pretty nice, but it goes downhill after that. Noticed there was a bucket in the lobby one afternoon catching water dripping from either the A/C or from just a general leak. The rooms are pretty outdated. Checked in just in time to watch a football game up in the room but the TV was pretty small and outdated. Should have just found a local sports bar with nice TV's to watch the game at. The room itself did not feel clean. Would have asked to switch rooms but I checked in late and was only staying 2 nights and working all day the next day, so I did not want to go through the hassle. The carpet outside of the bathroom was wet the entire time I was there. Not sure if there was a leak or if something had happened from the guest that stayed in the room prior to me. My entire stay consisted of me stepping over the wet area of the carpet. I ended up not using the coffee maker in my room as it had a lot of buildup on the inside of it and just looked dirty. The hotel also did not have wireless internet in the guest rooms at all which was extremely surprising for a Hilton. I was definitely not impressed with the quality of the rooms in this hotel and glad to check-out and head home!

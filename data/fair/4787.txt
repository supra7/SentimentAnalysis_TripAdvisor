Yes, it's nice...but not $400 min.+/night for a dinky room nice. The room was small, and I was unimpressed. Lobby was pretty, but again, not worth the much higher rate than a 3 or 4 star that pretty much has all the same feautures. The pics we were shown online were not represenative of the room we got. I think they set some dinky rooms aside for hotels.com users...I'm all for paying more for room service and such but the Continental Breakfast (two eggs, toast, coffee, juice, 2 slices of bacon/sausage) was $27 before a room fee, taxes and surcharges. My husband and I had to laugh. After tipping the waiter, one would pay about $70 for for two people for that! Seriously? That's not luxury, that's completely idiotic. You'd think you'd get a big TV or soemthing too, but you get a little 24-ish old school model. Yipee! I'm living the good life now! I can eat my $70 crap breakfast in front of my 10 year old TV and then go to town on a $9 bottle of water (no lie) It would be one thing to pay this for a great experience, but it just wasn't. I didn't get the idea they gave a hoot either...Is "meh" a good descriptive word?

Benefits: central location, close to central station, price cheaper than other hotels in area, room was clean, slightly modern, 7/11 supermarket a few metres away, Chinatown and Haymarket is a couple of streets away, darling harbour is walking distance Disadvantages: 1) Although room was slightly cheaper than other hotels $110-$120 AU, it was extremely NOISY. Our room was right next to the lift and we heard people go in and out of the lift but we also heard people go to the bathroom in the room above us and we heard the couple in the room next to us talking and so on..all night and all morning long!! It was horrible and we would never stay here again because the walls were so thin it was really noisy. We expected at least a good night's sleep for this price or else we mind as well have stayed at a backpackers. 2) Badroom service - cleaners came in twice while we were getting changed even though we had do not disturb sign on the door. 3) Reception had bad attitudes and there was man who wasn't interested in serving/helping guests who needed to store their items away in day lockers - problem was the day lockers didn't seem to work so guests had to ask man at reception twice to assist them. Guests eventually worked it out themselves as man said it was 'easy to use' and refused to assist.

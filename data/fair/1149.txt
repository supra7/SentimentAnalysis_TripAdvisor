The pictures on their website are misleading and give you the impression that this is a beach resort. It is NOT! We booked a 2 bedroom 2 bath suite for the long Thanksgiving Holiday. I called and I was told that we would be able to check in anytime after 1pm. we arrived at 2:30pm and were not able to check in until about 4pm. When we finally got our suite the sofa and sofa chair cushions were soaking wet. The people that just checked out obviously came in from the pool and sat on these in their very wet swimsuits. The staff said they were going to put the covers in the dryer but then I saw that the cushions were soaked through. We eventually got new cushions. My parents stayed in the Master Bedroom. When my mother opened a drawer in their room a big black cockroach ran out (YuK!). Our bed made loud creaking noises every time one of us move so we did not get much rest. I told the front desk staff all this and all I got was a, "thanks for letting us know". They charge an extra $28.13 a night resort fee for this place but I don't know what about this could be considered a resort. There are 3 swimming pools, 2 of which are very small and all are unremarkable. The location is extremely far away from any of the action in Key West and they offer NO TRANSPORTATION to anything. If you have a car you can drive, but it is extremely difficult to find parking near the main attractions. I definitely would not recommend staying at the Parrot Key Hotel in Key West.

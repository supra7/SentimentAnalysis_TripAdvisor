very shady. your reservation means nothing. Booked online. We get there and they don't have the reservation. (i.e. they are overbooked). We had paid a deposit and showed our documentation. Some guy comes from his office out back and we get a decent room on the oceanside. Fair for what we paid, (the a/c is very old school and funky but it was spring and still cool so not a problem.) They swiped our card twice, and we had to call them on it. Not a bad hotel really for the money ($220 a night), and great location, but we came close to not having a room/getting overbilled. Very very creepy. Miami is getting hit very hard by the real estate bust. We were there by accident during spring break in the middle of the tourist season and there was hardly anyone there. Everyone is a little too hungry and frustrated, and they go hard after your money. Use cash whenever you can and check your bills. After a night there we checked out and traded up to the Anglers. The best (french) food in Miami.

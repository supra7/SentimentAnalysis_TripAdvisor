No elevators in the hotel. Our room was on the 3rd floor and we had some difficulty wrestling all our luggage up and down the narrow staircases and corridors. Very poor lighting in the room and tired, worn decor throughout the hotel. Not very clean, tiny shower room with cracked tiles and stained grouting. Air conditioning unit ancient and really noisy - impossible to have on and get some sleep. There are much better value hotels around in nicer areas of Manhattan.

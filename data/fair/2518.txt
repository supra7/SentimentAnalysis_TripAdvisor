The Palmer House is without question a beautiful hotel. But the staff acted as though they were doing us the favor by letting us stay there. While staying there (we were there five nights), the cleaning staff left our hotel room door open once all day, and when we contacted the front desk about it, they acted as though we were a nuisance for bothering them. They were likewise disaffected and rude during a discussion of charges over the room. Also, though Internet is increasingly offered for free to hotel guests at even the cheapest hotels, be prepared at the Palmer House to pay at least $12.95 a day for broadband Internet (that's their slowest speed -- for faster ones you will pay up to $15.95). Also be prepared to spend up to $45 a night for parking (that's a flat rate, no matter how long within a 24-hour period your car is there). In short, if you don't mind paying a lot for normally complementary things and don't mind being treated poorly by the staff, the Palmer House does provide a clean place to stay in a prime location.

So many things wrong with the hotel, so I'll try to be brief: the room key cards were very temperamental and rarely worked. They never worked for the gym. The TV remote didn't work, the safe was locked, the fridge didn't work, the room was the tiniest king room I have ever stayed in. Despite this it had 2 phones, but neither of them worked. The floor was soaking by the aircon unit, which was leaking. I complained about all of this in person (the phones didn't work) after a 2 night stay, the safe was still locked, the phones didn't work still, floor was soaked still. But the TV remote worked! Also, the lifts are very slow and usually full, and despite being part of Preferred Hotels, they refused to take airmiles cards

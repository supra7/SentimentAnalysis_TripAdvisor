Stayed here for a short-notice business trip, when rooms at better hotels were running above $500/nt. The Time is very close to Times Square, and has a nice nightclub next to the small lobby. The rooms, sadly, are tiny, and various parts of my room (dimmer switch, shades) were broken on arrival. The bedding was nice and clean, and the carpets weren't particularly bad, but overall the rooms look very very tired. Room was quiet enough, given the location, but I wouldn't stay here again unless I had no other reasonable options. Not appropriate for families, couples, or anyone who needs some space to work. (Room service breakfast was decent, but who doesn't give you ketchup when you order potatoes and eggs?)

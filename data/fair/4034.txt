Extreme budget!! The Halcyon has its pros and cons.The biggest plus is the great location. It's a 5 minute walk to Union Square and you can catch public transportation (MUNI, cable car etc. within walking distance).As far as the Hotel itself, it's more like a run-down hostel. The first night, we stayed in a tiny room that had a window facing the street so it was very noisy. The room was just a little bigger than the size of the bed and the kitchenette consisted of a microwave, toaster and coffee maker placed on a shelf next to the bathroom. The bathroom was terrible. It was super small and you had to walk in sideways to get to the toilet. The bed was awful. We could feel the springs in the mattress. The appliances (namely the coffee maker were filthy- when I ran my finger inside the water reservoir it came out black- EWWW).Needless to say, we asked to be moved to a different room the next day and luckily the management was very nice and accommodating and we were promptly moved to a MUCH better room down the hall. It was facing the back so much quieter. The room had a bunk bed with a fairly comfortable mattress. We actually had a kitchenette counter in this room, with clean appliances. The room was also a lot bigger- at least twice the size of the first room we had. Overall, for the room we stayed in the second night onwards, you get a little more than what you paid for. Great bargain for the location. However, had we stayed in the original room that was assigned to us, our stay would have been miserable with sleep deprivation on a horrible mattress, no coffee in the morning due to the filthy coffee maker and claustrophobia because of the small size of the room.Overall, if you're looking for a place to stay within this price range that's close to Union Square and transportation and you don't have really high expectations, then we recommend this hotel. Just don't expect too much.

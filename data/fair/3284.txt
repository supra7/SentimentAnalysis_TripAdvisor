My partner and I celebrated our anniversary with four nights in NOLA. We selected Villa Convento because the building's unique old history and the great location, close to lower Decatur and the Marigny. While this original "House of the Rising Son" seems charming on the outside, it is in terrible disrepair, showing years of lack of maintenance and poor standards of cleanliness. We liked room 103 initially, tucked away in the back off the courtyard. It's said to be one of the most haunted rooms but we saw no evidence of anything unusual. Upon closer inspection, the scariness lay in the dust bunnies hanging off the brick walls and broken mirror, the stench of urine in the bathroom, stained towels, and flithy corners. The control knob was broken off the A/C, the smoke alarm was missing, and the shower head had no pressure, plus spurted water on the bathroom floor constantly and the tub drain was clogged. What else? Roaches, broken towel rods, mismatched light bulbs in the ceiling fans, musty smell in general, worn mattresses. The courtyard consisted of algae-stained, moldy tiles, broken planters, creaking filmsy staircases, crumbling brick, etc. I love the faded charm of NOLA in general and don't mind old hotels or a little dust - but this place has been shamefully neglected. The Ursuline nuns would turn over in their graves knowing the Convento has become so decrepit. You'll get cleaner rooms at better prices at the Hotel Provincial around the corner on Charters, at Le Richeleui down Chartres, or at the Hotel Chateau on Chartres at St. Philip. Provincial also has a rich old, haunted history and has always provided clean, maintained rooms and grounds.

My significant other and I stayed at the Marrakech a year ago for a short weekend vacation in the city. Our experience wasn't spectacular, but the price was right, so we booked again for a similar trip this year. It honestly reminded me of living in the dorms what with the constant racket in the hallways and cramped quarters. Every time someone walked past our room the floor shook. We could hear the music in the hotel lobby playing until at least midnight every night. After the first night I bought a pair of earplugs, which helped with the noise a bit. I expected city noise from the streets, not from inside the building. The doorman was mysteriously absent every time we had bags to carry up or down the stairs and the temperature in the shower never stayed constant for more than 2 minutes at a time. The good: the subway stop just feet from the door is always a help, the lobby and corridors are nicely decorated, the rooms were clean, and it's cheap.

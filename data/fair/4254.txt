Below average liquor choices, food that is below average even for a Hampton Suites, in the consigers lounge. The bathroom had corrosion around the shower stall. The shower head placement forced me to hug the wall. Rooms also need a facelift, old smelly carpets everywhere. If the client was not paying for this room I would NOT stay there. Compared to other Marriotts in the area this facility is a loser.

We have stayed at this hotel close to a week each summer for 7 years in a row. The hotel has a beautiful location and grounds with a great pools for the kids. We are resort members as well as Hilton Honors Diamond level. However, it seems over the years as the resort has changed management (now owned by Hilton) it is not holding steady, or getting better but it is going slowly down hill. This trip they put us in the worst room that we have ever stayed in at this hotel. We asked to have our room changed but they would not/could not do it. The room looked dirty- dirty grout around the tile, moldy picture frame in the bathroom, peeling wallpaper and a musty smell to the room. The room overlooked the parking lot and was not a garden view as described when we booked it. The hotel is also buiding residences across the street and this room received all the construction noise. It woke the kids up every morning. Even though the pool is great, it is hard to find a chair at the pool unless you are at the pool when it opens. Although this is a small thing, we do not like the stress of circling the pool waiting for someone to give up their chair so we can sit. This problem will likely get worst when the folks from residences across the street begin to use the property. It also seems that over the last several years the staff at the hotel have become less friendly and less trained. This resort was a great place- it fact the best we have ever been too. But now it seems the resort needs spruce up the rooms and better train the staff especially since this is a very expensive resort and its customer's expectations are high because of the price they are paying.

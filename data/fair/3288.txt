I went here near Christmas. Before I discuss the hotel I would like to tell a little but about me. I go to the quarter often. I have stayed at half of the hotels in the quarter. They have a charm all their own. Most of them are not in the best condition but are beautiful because of the history and architecture they contain. I will stay at any one these before I would stay at a big soulless chain. The Villa Convento has a wonderful location. It is next to the best pastry shop I have ever eaten at. The chocolate croissant is unbelievable. I make sure I eat at the Croissant Dor every morning while I am in New Orleans. The French Market can be seen from the hotel. The location is also very quiet. The parking makes you feel like you car is very safe. The staff is sweet and blithely delightful. Now the hotel itself leaves some to be desired. The room was dirty. Not a little dirty, filthy. The bathroom had a dirty hand towel on the floor, toothpaste and spit on the mirror. The hotel was short-handed due to the hurricane but should still be cleaned between guests. A mold was growing on the ceiling line of the room. The brick walls always stayed damp causing this problem. Every time you touch the wall you would get a brick power on your clothing. When you have a wall of this age one should seal it. This would get rid of the mold and the brick dust. The bed was against the wall. So, when you would sleep brick dust would get into your eyes and face. Again, if the walls were sealed this would not be a problem. If this hotel does some renovations I would go back.

I just returned from a three night stay at the paramount. The location was pretty good, we could walk to almost all the downtown sites we wanted to see. The bed was very comfortable and the lobby staff friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, room service wasn't as good. One morning, it took us 45 minutes to get silverware to go with our breakfast. By the time someone came back up with it, the food was cold. We were told that the restaurant manager would call us but no one ever did. Upon checkout, we had to ask, for the third time, to have the breakfast charges removed. One tip: if you want english breakfast or earl grey tea, don't order it from room service. It'll cost you $3.50, they don't bring sugar or cream, and you can get the same bag of tea in the little coffee maker kit in the bathroom for free.

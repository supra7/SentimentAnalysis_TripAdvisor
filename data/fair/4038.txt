Whilst a beautiful hotel - I booked a high floor to have a quiet time when I was ready to go to bed! Well - we had the room next to us in major partying so I ended up calling the front desk at 4am and they called security to quiten them down. Then the next night we were kept up the entire night with the party going on around the pool  now we were won the 56 th floor so that was loud music! Since staying there I have read a similar review so the hotel are well aware that the party by the pool is very disruptive but still allow it to go on! They sell themselves as a high end sophisticated hotel but there are huge flaws in the Encore experience!

After a week on Kauai, we went to Maui for a week. The Sheraton Maui is VERY over priced for what you get. We had a very small ocean front room. The room was so small we didn't have a place to put our 3 suitcases. I'm an Gold SPG guest so we asked to be moved. For it being a Sheraton hotel, they did not know what an SPG was. After 2 days, we were moved to a larger room, but the ocean view was through the palm trees. Enjoyed the pool even though it was cold. Don't bother with the breakfast buffet, its very expensive & not much of a selection of food. Whaler's Village is a nice walk down the beach, but don't expect to find "bargain" food - you're in Hawaii. But at least its better than the hotel. Good location in an area of up scale hotels, if that's what you're looking for. We've stayed on Maui before & if there is a next time, we'll head to Wailea!

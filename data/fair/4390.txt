Well me and my mother stayed for 3 nights and we arrived and luckily a room was ready, As soon as we opened the front door my mom was laready disappointed with the stairs. I liked the lobby, small, cute, and cozy, but the room was extremely small. Bathroom even smaller. Luyckily we had no bedbugs or rats, i was extremely concerned! I really liked the subway being so close and easy to acces many great locations. All i have to say is, if u use to 3 star hotels this aint for u, but if u just using this to sleep then its a good place and a good deal. I also have to give those eccosential soaps a +!!! me and mother loved em!

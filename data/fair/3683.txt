well, the rooms are the smallest I have ever stayed in, there was only room for me, thats it, peeling wall paper, blinds that were also peeling, no tub! Don't even get me statred with the tiny bathrooms the only good thing was the location and the bar and lounge downstairs, it is filled with people there for business a lot of networking and the drinks are great! room service is a rip off $40us for breakfast, I will never stay here again.

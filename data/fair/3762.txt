I guess you get what you pay for, we initially reserved trying to save a few dollars. I was going to be in town for at least 2 weeks and my coworker for a month. The neighborhood is not bad several places to eat with in walking distance. But walk through the hallways and you notice dirty carpets and the smell of urine. Could not tell if it was the toilets or pets. I walk into my room...the bathroom walls are dirty. The floor had little hairs and evidence of previous guests. The headboard and walls near the bed were icky. The linen and blankets on my bed had cigarrette burns. The kitchenette drawers and dishes were old and dirty. Even if had cleaned them myself I still wouldn't have used them, ick. The refrigerator sounded like somone was throwing a rock at your door between cycles. One night you could hear a domestic dispute in the rear parking lot. Followed by the activation of several car alarms. If I was really desperate to save that much money I would have stayed but my Icky button had been pushed enough. Needless to say I checked out after 3 nights.

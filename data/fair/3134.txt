To begin when we got to the hotel, we were checked in promptly, we were given a room on the first floor which was wonderful. When my 7 year old daughter and myself opened the door to the room we were hit in the face with the smell of stale fried fish. The room reaked of the fish odor. I immediately went back to the front desk and asked if they had air freshener or another room. I was told that there were no other rooms and that they would bring some air freshener. They brought the air freshener and sprayed and then offered to bring a machine to pull the smell out of the room if I was going to go out for dinner. I was told the machine would pull the smell out and that it would only take 30 minutes to do this. We left and were gone over 2 hours and when we returned the smell was worse because the air had been turned off in the room. I returned to the front desk and the second manager said she would see if they could find the machine to pull the smell out. This was supposed to be done while I was gone. The second manager came to the room and smelled the fish and said that she would move us to another room. Keep in mind I was told in the beginning that they didn't have any other rooms. We were moved to a second room on the other side of the building and the very end of the hall. This room didn't smell, it did have a few gnats flying around in the room , there was hair from a previous tenant visable in the tub and the bathtub in this room as well as he first room, had some kind of rust looking stains in the tub, there was mold and mildew around the wall of the tub in both rooms and the water took about twenty minutes to drain from the tub. Last but certainly not least, the price of the room was different and I was not offered a refund or a discount.

Here for 2 months. Friendly staff. Some cleaning staff issues, only cleaned every othet week, when payed for weekly. Biggest issue, be sure to watch your clothes wash and dry. I left to grab something out of my room, 2 doors down to 2 weeks worth of clothing stolen. Not impressed with how staff handled it, nothing came of it. Therefore, out $300+. Had to buy other kitchen things, as it was not provided will not recommend this at all!

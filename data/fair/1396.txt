Good things: The location wasn't too bad - easy access to walk Downtown and 5 mins walk to East Broadway subway with good links Mid and Uptown. Great for eating out in Chinatown and Little Italy. The area seemed safe at all hours, but the hotel was a bit out of the way if you want to return before going out again in the evening. The air con was quiet and efficient. Bad things: Our main gripe was the noise from the traffic on Manhattan Bridge - the proximity of the trains/vehicles to the bedrooms meant that every train passing was audible in the room, and they pass 24 hours a day! Although towels were changed, the bathroom cleaned and the beds made every day, the room was not hoovered or dusted, nor was the bedding changed over a 9 night stay. There were only 4 coathangers for 2 people in a wardrobe that appeared close to collapse, and no other storage facilities. My friend lived out of his suitcase for the whole stay. The iron was unusable as the plate was filthy (not that there was any space to iron). No safe in the room, or provision for safekeeping valuables at reception. Only one extremely slow elevator serving all staff/customers. Reception forgot to order our taxi to the airport (and still charged $3.00 to make the delayed call - thanks for that). On check-in, we were advised of the 24 hour tea/coffee making facilities on floor 2 - powdered milk and coffee? no thanks. Deli 2 doors away did decent coffee and pastries for breakfast.

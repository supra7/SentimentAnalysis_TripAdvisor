I have had several stays at the Grand Wailea over the past 15 years. just visited there a few weeks ago for 8 nights. Was a real disappointment. Most venues closed due to low occupancy levels. even staff acknowledges. Some are calling it the "Grand Hampton Inn" versus a Waldorf Astoria experience. Our suite was very nice - still had the old "Hyatt Regency" sign on the back door. Yes i did say Hyatt as it was part of their group over 10 years ago. Forget trying to get a good reservation at HumuHumu. i tried for a good table any night we were there - they could not get it done. Yet when we walked in it was open. So i inquired and they said it was closed for that night. then 20 minutes later they seat another group of 3 there. i had offered a very respectable minimum check if they could get it done. very dissappointing experience. Hint - i have done both the Grand and the Four Seasons next door. Right now, Four Seasons has the edge except for the spa. So stay at the Four Seasons but do the spa at Grand Wailea.

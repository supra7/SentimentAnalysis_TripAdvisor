What on earth is going on with this hotel? I have stayed in many Swissotels and have never been disappointed. This place is really tired. My room didn't smell great (perhaps a smoker previously?) and struck me as more 3 star quality. Three main issues: 1) The curtains don't close as they are designed as window dressings and not actual curtains. This would be OK but the hotel is surrounded by skyscrapers therefore, when the light is on, the offices and apartments opposite are probably able to see everything that's going on, even behind the thin net curtains. This is just weird. Anyone with a sense of personal modesty may want to stay somewhere else. 2) The room had a toilet that constantly filled up during the night on a loud drip by drip basis thus providing pretty effective water torture for a traveller with jet lag. 3) The lifts/elevators are malfunctioning. They are the new type where you type in your floor and it tells you which lift to get into. Unfortunately they are mis-programmed. I selected floor 6 and was deposited at floor 37 with another lady trying to get to 4th Floor. We eventually got into another lift which deposited us at floor 21 and we then waited 10 minutes for another lift that took us to the correct floor. These issues are pretty fundamental and demonstrate a loss of client understanding on the part of the general management. Avoid.

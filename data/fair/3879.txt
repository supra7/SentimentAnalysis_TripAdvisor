When I stayed here 4 yrs ago (with friends), this place was named "Surfer Motor Lodge" and it was a total dump. At the time, we just wanted to stay close to the beach, so in that we got what we wanted. The location is def. prime, which is why these guys get to charge a premium. Don't remember how much it cost, but it was basically a motel (at best). The bathrooms were disgusting and small, the bathroom sink is basically in the bed room and there is no air conditioning in the rooms. There was a pool, but it didn't look remotely decent. My girlfriend and I just went to San Diego and were looking for a hotel close to the beach that was normal. We decided on this place b/c we got a "decent rate" of $265/night - must have been a pricey week to travel b/c most other hotels were $300/night. Remembering how dirty and worn down this place was during my last stay, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it had been renovated and renamed. Don't be fooled - with the exception of a paint job, some new Ikea furniture and paintings from Target, this is the same place as before. My girlfriend dreaded taking a shower at this hotel. The biggest complaint -- we left for the beach between the hrs of 10am - 3pm both days we were there, and when we returned, the room was still not cleaned. Nothing worse than coming back to a dirty room. I would also echo the comments made by the post titled - Surfer Beach Hotel: "Disappointed by Surfer Beach Hotel" on Jun 29, 2006. Just saw the comments now (unfortunately) and agree 100%.

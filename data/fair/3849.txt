Could not believe that we were given a room for 5 day visit with NO WINDOW! Had made reservations in advance and were told that the room would be small, but had not been told that there would be no window! Noisy with band playing on Saturday night but quiet enough on remaining nights of stay. Clean room, courteous staff.

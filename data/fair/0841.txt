My wife and I arrived here after a seven hour flight from another country. Despite having made the reservations six months in advance, our room was not ready. This, in spite of the fact that we arrived at normal check-in time. All we wanted was to unpack and freshen up after the long flights. It took over two hours for our room to be ready, The front desk staff apologized saying that they gave us a free upgrade to a room with a better view. When I told them their "upgrade" was what I had originally ordered they didn't know what to say. They also lied to us. When our room wasn't ready, the desk staff gave us the room keys anyway but kept the room number from us. They would give us the room number once it was ready. Well, after an hour of waiting, I went back to the front desk to get an update and the desk staff called for a room status and I overheard the room number. I was told it still wasn't ready. Another hour and a half of waiting and I again went back to the from desk. This is where they told me about a free upgrade to another room as our original room still wasn't ready. The room they gave us was the same one that I had overheard earlier. I told the check-in person that this was not an upgrade and was the same room as earlier. She didn't say anything. The second disappointment was the advertising over the outside of the building. The advertisment obstructed the view outside. It was bad enough during the day but at night, the view of the city was a blurry, mess of buildings and lights. This is not a cheap hotel and they should not have put up advertising on the outside of guest windows. I probably won't stay here again. We changed hotels after a week and moved to the Westin Gaslamp. That was a much better location and experience.

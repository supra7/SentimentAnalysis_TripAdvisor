I stayed here about ten years ago and thought it was amazing. I decided to take my girlfriend here for lunch. After giving my keys to the valet he informed me that it would be $25 for parking, however we could get validation with lunch. What he didn't tell me was that there was nothing open and no food being served. We walked around the property for 15 minutes and some areas required a hard hat to enter. The beach was also much smaller than I remember. After returning to the car and not finding a place to eat we were charged $27 for parking. I would not stay here again. There are better places to stay for the price. The location here also seemed very isolating. Not the 'Aloha' spirit like the rest of the island.

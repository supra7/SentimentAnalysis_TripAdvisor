This hotel is in a great center City location in the "gayborhood". The room was a value for the price, with a refrigerator and microwave. My room only had a small shower, and there was no tempurature control for the heat. The room I had was in the back, so I had a mostly non-existant internet connection. The biggest drawback was the inattentive staff. For three nights, I would have been lucky to have had someone look up from their paper as I entered. The most unfriendly hotel staff that I have ever encountered.

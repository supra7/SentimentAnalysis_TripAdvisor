We paid a little more to stay in a "better" hotel and pamper ourselves for 4 nights. The lobby is impressive and initial service was friendly. However, when I got into the room, it was clear it was a smoking room and, to a non-smoker, was pretty unpleasant. I phoned down to advise of the mistake, only to be told there were no more rooms and they would move us the next day - no apology. I asked them to bring up some air freshener as the room stank - response was "you could open a window" That room, and the room we got moved to, still without any apology, had a strange layout - the door to the bathroom was right opposite the bed, meaning you couldn't fail to wake up your partner when trying to put on the bathroom light, as the switch was outside the room. there was supposed to be some sort of night light, but it didn't work in either room. The rest of the room was quite ordinary and unimpressive - not what I expected of such a hotel. The place felt faceless, soulless and miserable. One bar was so up-market, it felt freaky, the other was a plastic Irish bar with the character of a paper bag. The restaurant did a decent, but incredibly over-priced breakfast. After checking in, nobody seemed genuinely friendly or helpful. The whole experience left a sour taste in the mouth - felt like a waste of money and we'd have been better off for friendliness and value in a smaller three star hotel

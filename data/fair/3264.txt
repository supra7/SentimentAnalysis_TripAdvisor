Upon arrival we were not greeted or asked if we needed assistance. They bell staff watched as we fumbled with our belongings waiting for assistance. When we realized we weren't getting any help we all grabbed what we could and headed up the escalator. The concierge who greeted us when we got off the escalator asked do we need any more help and we said jokingly not now, she said oh I don't like to help either. After getting up to the room we noticed that the TV didn't work, there was no cold water and the AC didn't work. When I called down to ask for the manager on duty they didn't want to transfer me. After doing so reluctantly, the mod Gregory was much help and acted like he didn't care. Just very poor and unaccomodating people.

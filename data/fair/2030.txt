This hotel is not up to Marriott's standards and I have stayed in Marriott properties over 30 nights this year. The rooms seem worn and ours was very noisy. More importantly their complimentary wifi is worthless. I never could log on with my iPad. My wife got on once with her iPad. That's over a four day period. Even the Lobby Starbucks lacked viable wifi. There is none in the rooms. There are far better options elsewhere in Boston for the same price.

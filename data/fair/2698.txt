We did a family getaway, and chose Embassy Suites due to a previous fantastic experience in another city. This one did not compare! The room was small and a bit shabby (stains on sofa cushions, etc.) The design of the hotel makes for a very noisy experience in the room (large open atrium and all rooms glass fronted.) There was NO hot water in the morning due to a boiler breakdown. The hotel calls in extra security on the weekends to deal with the crowds of families, which seems like a bad omen. Too many people taking advantage of the free cocktails makes for encounters with drunks in the elevator. Breakfast was mediocre at best. Desk staff were friendly, however other staff were non-committal (my previous experience included very friendly staff at all points in the hotel.)

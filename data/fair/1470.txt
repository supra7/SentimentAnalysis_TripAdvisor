It looks nice but its not as it appears. The front desk is rude...we were greeted by Jigia who stated we dont like people from California...they are loud... The beds are really cots with thin mattresses. The breakfast was awful...eggs with processed cheese slices in cellophane, and yes...hot dogs masquerading as sausages?? Just flakes and spoiled yogurt. Not worth it. On the upside, it was clean and the floors were nice. We left after one night. Oh, we are from California!

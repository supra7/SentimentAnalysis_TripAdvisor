Was here for business and stayed Friday and Saturday nights (November 4 and 5, 2011). Was in Room 708, I think. Had a king bed. Room was very warm. Kept the heater turned off. I am usually a very sound sleeper, but the noise from the hallway and the street were unbearable. The windows have absolutely no soundproofing from the outside noise. Every car, horn and person was heard at all hours of the night (and I live in NYC!!). On Saturday night, there was some party in the club on the ground floor. It was packed, and the loud rap music was blaring. I could hear the THUMP THUMP THUMP of the music. I called downstairs about 1 am and was practically laughed at when I requested if they could do something about the noise. The room itself was mediocre, at best. Small, outdated bathroom, with sporadic hot water. There were two phones in the room. Neither worked. Twice I stopped at the front desk asking them to be fixed. Good thing my iPhone has a built in alarm, as I could not request a wake up call. Skip this place. Not worth it.

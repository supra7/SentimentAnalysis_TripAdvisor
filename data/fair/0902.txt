We stayed in this hotel for over a week with our 3 young children and although the kids' pool was great, the hotel rooms were awful and not what you would expect for a Hyatt. Grant it, I was expecting it to be a step down from where we usually stay (The Grand Wailea) but I didn't anticipate it to be so far below in quality and service. Our bathroom smelled like a sewer - it was so awful we had to keep the door closed at all times. The tub/toilet area was very cramped, which made it very difficult to bathe the kids. And the sink area was very dark. The carpet was gross (I hated to let my baby crawl around on it) and the pull-out couch was disgusting. The rooms were old and felt dirty and tired. The grounds were okay; it was fun to have wildlife there (penguins, flamingoes, and cranes). But the beach there is basically non-existant. It is difficult to access (esp. with kids) b/c the property is elevated above the beach and so you have to jump down/off a small cliff. And once down on the very small beach, the water is murky and full of seaweed and lava rocks. No fun. We had to walk down several hotels in order to get in the water. The pools were fun - the adult water slide is very fun and the kids' pool is designed in such a way that the kids can play independently. That was good. But overall, I find Kaanapali to be way inferior to the Wailea area. It is so much more commercial and crowded. I was surprised with all the noise - from the airtraffic to the boat traffic to all the tourists walking the beach path (who, by the way, fail to move aside for joggers, etc...). I will never stay on this side of the island again. The only reason we left Grand Wailea was b/c the closed the pools for construction.

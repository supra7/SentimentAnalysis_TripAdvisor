at some point before 5 am I awoke with a massive respiratory episode, and discovered that within 15 minutes of shutting off the AC, it began to subside. I ended up suffering the consequences though for 2 days. they transferred me to another room --- teeny-tiny, that, by my re-entry into the room at 5pm (they told me they needed the day to prepare it) looked like it was smackdab in the middle of being cleaned. a wonderful front desk woman, Lamika, assigned a room with a terrace and offered to accompany me there personally to troubleshoot any issues. once there, she decided to send in maintenance to check on the AC. when the guy took out the filters, he had a shocked look on his face (as i did when I saw them in his hands). They were filthy beyond description. He took them out to clean them. I ended up having to spend 48 hours confined to my room for the respiratory symptoms from the first night to subside (I have allergies and asthma). I would have to say that this property is way behind the eight-ball on their technical upkeep. I fought to credit for this experience and ultimately prevailed. it was a waste of a trip. it took me nearly an hour to check out because everything that had been previously cleared by one of the managerial staff and by Starwood, was not showing up on my final bill. these people are not brusque or nasty -- they are clueless...they are offering me 2 nights by way of compensation and I am nervous about returning...

Not worth the $$ My boyfriend and I (and his parents and niece) just spent four nights at the Kahala (after a wonderful 8 days at Kona Village on the Big Island -- but that's for another review...) and were very disappointed with the quality level of the rooms. While our room (9th floor, corner) had beautiful views, the room and the furnishings had clearly seen better days: water damage on the ceiling, stained love seat, mildewy bath and shower curtain, and an odd odor which seemed to emanate from our bed; I thought it smelled like urine; my boyfriend thought it was gasoline. Either way, it was no good. I should have complained, but we'd already been moved once (from a dark, depressing room on the ground floor) and I was afraid we would end up with something even worse. Additionally, a housekeeping cart was parked in the hallway across from our room the entire time we were there, and I don't see that it did much good, as I noticed a wadded-up napkin on the elevator lobby table (on our floor) that was also there the entire four days. We also saw candy wrappers in the elevator. I'm not a super clean freak, and if I'm staying at Motel 6, I adjust my expectations accordingly. But, when one is paying more than $400 per night for a room, I don't think clean, deodorized premises are too much to ask. Next time I stay on Oahu I'll do what I've done several times before: rent a house in Lanikai!

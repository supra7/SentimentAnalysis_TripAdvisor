We just got back tonight from 10 days in Hawaii. While in Kauai we were VERY happy at the Grand Hyatt,for 5 days when we got to Maui and to the Westin Resort and Spa, we were extremely disappointed. We spent 5 somewhat unpleasant days at the Westin. The hotel is extremely crowded and noisy, the beach and pool areas too congested. There is nothing relaxing about the hotel. There is a morning battle for chairs at the pool, or a line to wait in at 8 am to get chairs on the beach- which they usually run out of by 8:15. Or you can sign up to try to get a cabana for a ridiculous amount of additional money. We were unable to get one until our last day which rained non-stop. The lobby is loud beyond belief with the faux waterfalls and birds which get even louder around sunset. There is no where to sit to get some peace and quiet especially if it is raining. There are no comfy cozy lounge chairs indoors. The only place to go is the tiny, musty bedroom. I couldn't even open my porch door because the next door neighbor was always out on his porch smoking cigarettes and the smell would waft right in. On the positive side, the staff was very friendly, concierge services were good and the food surprisingly decent for this kind of hotel. We were traveling with extended family totalling 10 and no one was happy with the choice of hotel and room accomodations. Even the Westin "heavenly bed" was uncomfortable! THe room ac did not work during the night. I can not in good conscience, recommend this hotel to anyone unless they are looking for a loud, Disney-like Hawaii experience and have very young children.

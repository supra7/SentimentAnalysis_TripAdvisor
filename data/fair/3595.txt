First of all, this was the smallest hotel room I have ever booked in NYC. There were two twins beds and a writing table. Basically you could just walk around the beds and that was it. The writing table was filled up with all my stuff plus the phone, hotel books, and ice bucket because there was no other place to put anything. Maybe because W had a deal where if you bought two nights, the third was free. Anyway, I was with my teen daughter so I took it. But it was small. It feels like W is out to impress customers with their edgy style but it's not very practical. The entire hotel feels very moody and dim. That's ok, I guess, in the hallways but once I'm i the room I would like enough lighting to read a book or a magazine. There was no table lamp next to one of the beds. I had to open the window shades to get enough ambient light plus all the lights on to see well and then of course, I cannot walk around in my underclothes because all the shades are up. One day they tried to clean the room at 4pm (that seems late to me!) Well I was back resting before dinner after a day of sightseeing. The maid said to call when I was ready. I called the front desk when I was leaving for dinner and said I was ready for them to clean but they never came. The only positive point I can give this hotel is the concierge service which I found above average and I went everyday and asked questions and directions of the staff. However, I will find another hotel next time I visit NYC.

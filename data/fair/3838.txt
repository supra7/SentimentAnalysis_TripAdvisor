made reservation several months in advance, was told over phone and at desk could check in at 2:30, left our bags and came back at 2:30, was told rooms were not cleaned and check in time was 4o'clock, lady at desk was rude, and was more concerned in showing us She was in charge! also check out time was 11:00 O'clock next day! Have stayed here b4 this was worst experience, plus the place is starting to look dated. will not stay here again!

Having visited many resorts solo, with family and with friends, I was very disappointed with the Arizona Grand Resort. The resort doesn't live up to it's hype. Room service food was very poor quality. Rooms were merely average. Waterpark/pool area was small for the large number of guests. Despite waiting hours for a chair, I had to sit near the pool bar while my daughter played, as there were no chairs availalble. The bulk of them were being "held" by guests via pool towels, with guests no where to be found. As my family enjoys being outside near the water and visited Arizona specifically for the sunshine, not being able to enjoy the pool area was a deal breaker for me. We will not return.

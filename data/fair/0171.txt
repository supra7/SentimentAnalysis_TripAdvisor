We stayed here because it was part of a block booking for a conference. Our experiences were similar to those of other reviewers, i.e. small rooms with dreary decor, mostly indifferent front-desk service, and noisy (very noisy if, like us, you get an inward-facing room overlooking the kitchen air con units!). On the positive side, the tiny bathroom was spotlessly clean and the shower was excellent. Plus the bed was really comfortable. Yes, the hotel is in a reasonably convenient downtown location, but that barely makes up for the downsides. If like us you simply need a place to put your head down for the night, and are likely to spend the rest of your time out and about in Seattle, then this modestly-priced hotel should suffice for a few nights. But there aren't enough creature comforts to make you want to stick around and relax in it during the day or evening. After 5 nights we were certainly glad to be moving on.

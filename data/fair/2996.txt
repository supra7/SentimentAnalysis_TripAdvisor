We stayed at the Whaler in March, but I have only now found the time to write a review. We have been to Maui seven times, and this was our first and last stay at the Whaler. Yes, the location is fabulous, but the hotel itself is in dire need of repair. The hallways need new carpet and paint. The grounds are just okay, with very stiff grass. The pool is old old old. AND you park your car on the tennis court.

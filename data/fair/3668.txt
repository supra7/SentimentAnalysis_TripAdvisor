Having stayed at Ws in other locations (Los Angeles, San Fran) I was expecting a great hotel- upon arrival the lobby did not disappoint (trendy nice atmosphere with fruit and lemonade for guests) but from the elevator up, boy what a shocker- the elevators barely fit two couples with luggage and at one point in the visit, two of the four elevators were not working so waiting on a ride down to the lobby from the 11th floor took a while. As many others have said in in their reviews, the room was shockingly small with the comfortable queen bed taking up most of the space. While we weren't in the room very much, several of the television stations (even though it was one cable) had static/snow. I enjoyed the bliss products but was disappointed to only have a shower stall and no bathtub- The concierge was very nice making reservations for dinner and pointing out nearby spots. Location wise it was nice being away from the total hustle and bustle of the Times Square area but not too far away that we couldn't walk to some of the tourist spots- I'd stay again as long as it was a Hotwire deal only but can't imagine the disppointment I would have had if I had paid $200+ a night for the room!!

Hi, my girlfriend & i stayed in The Time hotel NYC on july 2011. it's in a grate place, just a block of times square and broadway. however after checking in we got to our room, it was so small we could only open 1 of our suit cases so that was a bad strat. we went down to change room for a biger 1, but was extra. so we desided to pay and up we went to a room a bit biger an wit a view of a 10 story building 10 feet away. e.g NO VIEW!!!! but we were not bothered cos we would only be sleeping there. room was nice otherwise. We tryed the resterunt the next morning for breckfast and it was very poor. price to high not enough food on the plate, had to wait wee bit to long and you would not here the waiter behind a news papper. lol. i'd go else were again.

We read the mixed reviews; and decided to chance it. Bad idea. We, too, found pubic hairs in our bed when we checked in. When we informed the guy at the Front Desk, he called maid service; but when we came back at the end of the day, no bed changes. We checked out the next day, again informing the Front Desk for the reason why. They apologized, but made no other efforts. Spend the extra money and upgrade.

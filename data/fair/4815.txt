The selling point for this hotel is that the location is great accessing many Boston landmarks (Quincy Market, Waterfront, North End). The rooms are spacious, but in need of major renovation. The carpets were dingy and stained and the bedding looked severely out of date. The bathroom has a sliding pocket door, which was weird. The furniture in general looked worn and dated. Hallways were depressing and dark. I won't stay here again.

I chose the Hotel Rex because Tripadvisor rated it #1 in San Francisco, it has a great location and the price was quite reasonable. We checked in around 8 p.m.. The room had not been heated. It was FREEZING cold. We turned up the thermostat but at midnight it was still freezing. I slept in long underwear, nightgown, bathrobe and extra covers. By morning it had warmed up at last. The bathroom was dirty. The carpet was globbed with dirt and ???? We must have been next to a bar as the music thumped on until 3 a.m. One night a couple in the next room swore and screamed all night. When I mentioned it to the desk, they said noone was in the room. Strange, cold noisy hotel!

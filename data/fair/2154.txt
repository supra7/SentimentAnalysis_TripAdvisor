I've stayed at a number of Boston Back Bay hotels, and was booked into this one because of a business meeting. My first impression was not good, as we drove up to what looked like the official entrance, and were told that valet parking was on the other side of the building, and we had to get back in our car and keep moving. We observed that several other arriving guests were met with the same off-putting reception, and they were steamed. After the hair-raising drive through Boston traffic, it's not the sort of welcome you want to get. As for the room -- it was really small. The furnishings looked tired, and the bed was awful -- a queen-sized bed was about all they could fit into that teeny room, and the mattress transmits your spouse's every little movement. Neither of us got much sleep -- during either of our two nights there. We both woke up tired and cranky. The bathroom was also incredibly tiny, with barely enough room to swing the door open. No countertop space, just a narrow glass ledge. So toilet cases had to be left in the bedroom. All in all, I would not come back to this place. If you want to stay in the Back Bay neighborhood, go to the Colonnade instead.

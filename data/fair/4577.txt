Needs updating quickly I have read all of the reviews and I can't tell you how disappoiinting the hotel is. They have not updated this place in at least 20 years. Okay, most of Waikiki has not been updated in 20+ years, but this hotel charges $400-$500 per night. Come on and at least put some money into the place. We checked into on the suites in the historic building. It was quoted at $1100 per night. As a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I received a better rate, but to my amazement, the room was something I could find at a comfort in. Cheap furniture than was chipped, peeling and falling apart. Stained furniture that is so outdated. The bathroom was also very tacky and old. The hotel reluctantly moved us to the tower suite. The suite had an amazing view and was a 360 degree turn from the first suite, but the furniture in the tower suite was awful too. Old, cheap and outdated. The location of the hotel is the best and the beach access is wonderful, but other than that, I would recommend anyone seeking a first-class hotel to look for another location or rent a condo.

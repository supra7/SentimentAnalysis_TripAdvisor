Disappointing-- too many little things went wrong for it to be a 4 star. We actually entertained ourselves on the way home by listing them. Most were small nothing in the fridge was actually cold. The phone at the concierges desk mostly just rang. (I waited 10 minutes once, determined, but eventually gave up. Thank goodness for smart phones.) They we supposed to have tickets for an aquarium, they didnt. The published and actual hours for the pool didnt seem to match up very well. I had to walk back to the desk to get a new wrist band right after checking in because the clasp was depressed on the first one and they are designed to not be undone, no matter what. I think we had about a dozen things like this. The maid cart was next to our room when we came back from an excursion, so we went back out for a couple more hours. When we got back it was still there, and Yes, she did knock on our door as soon as we went in. Others were pretty big. The A/C quit in the early afternoon one day and they just couldnt handle it. Instead of going to bed that night I ended up in the lobby at 11:00, still looking for help. Im still not sure they fully grasp the idea that my AC wasnt broken, their AC was. I was just a guest who wanted to go to sleep

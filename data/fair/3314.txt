Here is my bottom line up front review. The hotel is in a great location, the courtyard is incredible, and the staff is courteous. BUT, the room is exactly what I would expect from a 20-30 year old interstate Econolodge in the middle of nowhere. It was nothing special, neither decorated nor bare, not incredibly clean nor horribly dirtyjust blah. What really soured me about this place is when you pay for parking it isnt for 24 hours. For $28 in addition to your room rate (of course) you receive a parking spot from 3pm-noon the following day. In my case I arrived at 7pm and wanted to leave NOLA around the same time the next day. For this I had to pay $56 just for 24 hours of parking (owners policy). I understand this area is built up and parking is at a premium but $56 for 24 hours of parking is ridiculous. Not even the Ritz Carlton charges that. Due to this policy and their unwillingness to accommodate my special request for parking I cannot recommend this hotel and will not give them my business in the future.

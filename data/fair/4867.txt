I was in Chicago for business and they missed my wake-up call on the first day causing me to skip breakfast and take a cab to my meeting. In my room, the TV remote's battery cover was missing so the batteries kept falling off so I had to hold them with my hands to use it. The privacy tag was also missing so had no way to keep the cleaning lady from waking me up. Being in Chicago and the price they are charging, you would think that a simple service like loaning umbrellas to their customer is a no brainer, but NO. They asked me to buy one from 7-11. Finally the room's sound proof was almost non-existence with the constant humming noice from other rooms' AC and plumbing.

I stayed here with two other business colleagues. New York was booked solid due to conventions, so we could either stay at the Beekman for $395 or someplace else for $800. We did the responsible thing and stayed at the Beekman for a night. The staff was very friendly on our initial arrival, but there was some confusion about our rooms. Clearly not as good of a reservation system as you'll find at the larger chains. They gave us one room, and promised the other 2 later. When we returned, they tried to get 2 of us to share a room. Needless to say, I let them know that was not acceptable, and they backed off and gave us two rooms. Not very smart on their part to try and put 2 business people in the same room. The rooms are clean, and decent sized by NY standards. The bed was not the most comfortable, but passable for a night. The big flaw with the rooms was the air conditioning units. They either didn't work well or were very noisy in all of our rooms. None of us got a good night of sleep. At checkout, there was again confusion about payment for the rooms but it got sorted out properly. Overall, it was probably still worth saving our company about $1,500, but this is not a place I would seek out again.

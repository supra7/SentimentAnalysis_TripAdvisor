What happens fashion designersma When we checked into the Clift, the clerk said we were lucky to be staying with them at all for this rate.

All this before he gave us the key.The hotel is poorly lit to conceal its age, blemishes and cleanliness. Where the Clift gets off calling itself a jet set hotel I'll never know. I've stayed in Dubai, London and Gstaad and I know where the jet set resides - and it ain't places like this. I'd recommend thee Clift for people who spend a lot of time watching MTV and haven't the faintest clue what class is.

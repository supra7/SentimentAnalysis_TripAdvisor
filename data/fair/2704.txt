The rooms are cleaner, but furniture is old and need to be freshen. The breakfast is ok, but poorly organized. The staff is wonderful, but the desk staff can be very surly and rude. Ventilation of the rooms, is limited by opening the windows, and bedding is old and tired looking. Walls tend to be thin and the atrium does get noisy. If you are on a budget, and need to cut corners this place is fair. I stayed here because of convention, but next time I will stay at the other hotel and not be disappointed.

I concurr with other disappointed reviewers. The Good- great location - convenient to all tourist sites etc. but there is a good cluster of hotels in this location so I'd try something else next time. The pool is decent size with a lot of nice natural light. The Bad- Rooms... are very small- we felt claustraphobic with our family of four in one of these rooms for 3 days. We needed a roll-away bed and could barely fit it in. The beds were really bad too- it seemed like they took old, mushy mattresses and added some kind of "pillow top" to them. But they're still using standard size sheets which did not stay on the bed- had to redo the bedding twice during the night. The hot tub was cool- same temperature as the swimming pool. The hotel was very busy and the pool could have used some tidying up late in the day but the pool attendents never left the check in desk- absorbed in lively conversation among themselves. The concierge- seemed truly annoyed that we "bothered" her. She waved her hand in a general direction to tell us where to buy tickets for the duck boat tours- as if we should already know this information. On other occassions during our stay concierge service was generally apathetic. We paid top dollar for this hotel during the summer season. It was a disappointing experience.

We traveled to Boston the see the Sox and were looking for a place to stay and considered Priceline as we have many times as most rooms in Boston are expensive. We won the Hyatt Regency Boston (4 star) for $77.00. The hotel is quite confusing as others have said as the lobby is not on the main level it is on the 3rd floor. Upon entering our room it was not cleaned very well, there was a Snapple bottle on the floor and a piece of paper with a woman's lipstick on it, the shower head did not work and the air conditioner did not work in the room as the room temperature skyrocketed, no one ever came to look at anything they just left us hanging. The pool is another story, it was very dirty you could not even see the bottom of the pool (very cloudy) with hair floating everywhere, the tile floor was falling apart and rust everywhere. Bottom line is for $77.00 it was not bad however the room temperature and the maintenance issues and the room being dirty I hope were just an oversight and not all are this way. Overall hotel is not too bad but not worthy of 4 stars and not in a very nice part of town. If you get a good rate and are just looking for a bed, not bad but not 4 stars! On a side not do be careful, they charge you for everything

There is nothing about this hotel that would bring me back! For the price I paid for a "spectacular" room, I expect much more than I got. The photos online are misleading at best! My room was small, bathroom unimpressive, and furniture lacking in quality. There are no drapes on the window, just faux wooden slat blinds that just don't do the trick when you're trying to sleep in on a vacation. The staff was curt and unfriendly. The parking is ridiculous at $37/night, mind you it's $44 after tax!! Noise insulation was also a problem. My "stunning city view" left a whole lot to be desired. Water pressure in the shower was weak. Oh yeah, If that's not enough, I've been charged double - once on my holding card and once on another card I checked in with! Seriously people! I've stayed in Holiday Inns WAY nicer than this at half the cost. For this price, there are lots of other hotels in the city that offer REAL luxury. Buh-Bye W!!

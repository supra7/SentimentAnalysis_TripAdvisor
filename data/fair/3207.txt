My boyfriend and I stayed here because just like you we were looking for a hotel in the French Quarter that was close to Bourbon Street and got good reviews. However, now that I stayed here I don't believe the reviews went into enough detail about this hotel. The hotel is old enough that the pipes do not work. This translates into the toilet NOT flushing, tub not draining properly and the sink filling up even when the drain was open. Although the staff was great and quickly moved us into a different room when the toilet practically overflowed - after I had gone no less :( I would have much rather stayed at a place where the staff was snotty but the toilets flushed properly! We are not a high maintenance couple and I never have anything bad to say about anything, but toilets not flushing is not acceptable.

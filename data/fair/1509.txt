We booked a room on the 9'th of May for one night at the Avenue Crowne Plaza in downtown Chicago. The reason we chose this hotel was that it was a special occasion for us and we wanted to stay in an excellent hotel and the reviews for your hotel were good. But once we checked in, we were VERY disappointed with the level of service provided to us. The receptionist who checked us in, a woman named Arta, was very impolite and did not even have the courtesy to give us a smile. We had booked the room using a friend and family quote and she made us feel as if we had done something wrong by using a coupon provided by your hotel itself. After booking the rooms on the internet we had placed a request the the rooms be close to each other and preferable on a higher floor as it was our first time in Chicago and we would have liked a nice view. When we checked in, Arta said she did not receive any request and gave us what was available. When we went to see the rooms, we were very disappointed. One of the rooms (3220) were still ok, but the other one (3219) was much smaller, dirtier and had a broken fridge. We went down to the receptionist and when we told her we did not like the room, she gave us attitude and said "Whats wrong with the room? Its a nice room." She offered us another room but it turned out that it was a similar room on a floor that was much lower than our friends' rooms. So we decided to stay in the original room, even though we were not comfortable there. We were highly disappointed with the overall experience, from check in to check out. We spent extra money because we wanted to stay in the Crowne Plaza and experience a different level of comfort but after this experience, I feel we would be better off staying in a Days Inn or a Motel 6 that would have the same level of service but at least a lower price.

We booked an "ocean view" room over ten months ago and were immediately charged over $3000. For our timeliness and the use of our money here is how the hotel treated us: We went to our "ocean view" room, looked out the window and saw an ugly high rise building on the opposite side of the Whaler's Village. Contacted the front desk and was told with a straight face to walk out on the balcony and look to the left. There is the ocean view. We recently stayed at the Moana Surfrider (also a Westin) and one of our rooms had roughly the same situation. We could see a sliver of ocean from the balcony. This was appropriately called a "partial view." We are paying over $700/night for our room. If you are willing to spend this kind of money do yourself a favor and go to a real luxury hotel and not a luxury "wannabe" with a fraudulent "ocean view" policy. I would also like to add that we are Starwood Platinum members. I believe this is the highest loyalty level for Starwood. If we have been treated this shabbily by the hotel (and remember this is not a last minute reservation) then consider how they will treat you. You have better options.

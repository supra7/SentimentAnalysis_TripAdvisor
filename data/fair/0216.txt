We only stayed here for one night - which was a good thing..... The room was dark, the staff unavailable or somewhat dim. No-one bothered to pick up the phone in the restaurant or call us back after we left a message. I guess if it looks like a Marriott, and smells like a Marriott it is a Marriott even if it's called Renaissance.... The good thing was the location. It's close to the market and lots of fun restaurants.

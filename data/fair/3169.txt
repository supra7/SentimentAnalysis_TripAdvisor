cheap hotel, but San Francisco...? The hotel was basic, but that's what we expected for the price. Rooms clean, but dated. Double room had a little kitchenette with Fridge. Air-con, but ours must have been turned off. Shower great if your 5ft tall!No breakfast was included, but there are loads of restaurants  cafes down Geary Street, e.g. Lefty O'Douls, which is one of the most reasonably priced.Next door is a Chinese restaurant (hotel is run by Chinese staff, so there may be a connection). A couple of blocks away (on Geary St) is a Pizza hut take away, so when we were tired we ate here.The area was a bit of a shock to us however. We're from London so have experienced our fair share homeless people, but this did not prepare us for San Francisco. e.g. You walk out of a large shop on Market Street (main street), walk down one block, you suddenly meet about 20 homeless people. Not threatening, but I'm sure they are opportunists  I wouldn't want to walk past them when it's dark or alone.The hotel was only 4 blocks from Civic Centre, but to get there you have to pass at least 2 groups of homeless people.The hotel even suggests keeping cash, passport in an inside pocket of your clothing  getting a a taxi if your away from the hotel past 10pmThe free internet was good, but had to get the hub rebooted a couple of times (on the 3rd floor) when the service went down. I met the guy who was supporting the network  they are installing extra wireless routers on 2 of the floors to improve the signal strength.Hotel desk staff not too helpful, better to do things yourself (on internet) than ask. Night staff particularly awkward (e.g. remote control for TV not working, I'll look into it, but never did, we had to complain twice.)

This hotel was probably 3.5 stars 25 years ago. It has not been updated and the hotel was mostly empty while we were there. We wound up at this dump from Priceline, which claims it to be 3.5 stars. The small pool was not heated and cannot be used in the winter. The floral pattern on the floor screams 1981 cleanliness was an issue. Internet is not free. Parking is $30/night!! This is not disclosed when you get the room on priceline and added a full 60% to the cost for the room, which is unreasonable. My wife was working out in the fitness center and the leg of the elliptical machine came loose and she fell off. I called the front desk, which coldly told me, "someone will be there soon." We waited 20 minutes and no one came. This hotel is located in downtown LA, far from everything except LA Live/Staples Center. If you are coming to LA for anything other than 1-2 nights for business/sports, go somewhere else.

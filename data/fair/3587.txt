This hotel is grossly overrated. The room was dark, dysfunctional [look in the minibar and you get charged!] and to get to the window we had to climb over the bed. The view from the window: a brick wall and and the aircon system. Ask to change? Forget it. Miss smartypants at the front desk looked down her nose and told us we'd have to wait - at those prices! Well we didn't. We checked out and went to a small inn where we had a better room, friendly service and more NY experience than the W will ever provide The bar was good, though. Mind you, you needed it

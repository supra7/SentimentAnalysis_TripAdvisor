I was banking on all the good reviews that other's gave on tripadvisor. I cannot agree with these 4 and 5 star reviews. Here goes... Even though we asked - twice - for a room that didn't face Geary Street , that's exactly where we ended up. It's noisy and very loud all through the night - sirens, loud noises, etc. The room itself had a definite 2 star feel to it. I don't see how filing cabinets (to be used as a drawer) with cheezy butcher block top is "modern" or "fancy". It strikes me as cheap. Conceirege was friendly. Location was good if you don't mind Union Square. There is a terrible homeless problem in San Francisco - and plan on getting panhandled dozens of times while at the Diva. All in all, the room was ok for $90 a night. Queen size bed was reasonably comfortable, and the free wireless internet access was nice. Would not stay there again, unless the price was attractive to the competition.

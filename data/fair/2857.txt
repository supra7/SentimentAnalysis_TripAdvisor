We stayed at the Grand Wailea for a family wedding. We had several rooms in the hotel and you can tell that at one time this was a four star hotel, but it is not at the moment. The grounds and the lobby are beautiful but there are problems with the rooms and the service. Our room had a smell of mildew and it wasn't until the third call to housekeeping that they really addressed the issue. There was never an offer of moving us and we had to indure cleaning the carpet and a carpet dryer and it still did not fix the problem. My sister had a plumbing problem in her room and they were slow to fix it and another person in our party had their room robbed. The staff in the spa and the bell staff were very nice. The staff in the food areas were slow and not always friendly. It seems that they are not spending the money for enough staff and for basic maintenance of the hotel. My sister's wedding in their chapel was beautiful, but that did not makeup for all of the other problems. I would never stay at this hotel again there are too many other nice ones to stay in in Maui.

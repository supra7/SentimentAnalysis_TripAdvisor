The front desk staff of this hotel is excellent and it definitely made a difference in our decision to stay there. We called, lost, and the front desk person very patiently gave us directions TWICE. When we arrived, she continued to be pleasant and welcoming. We really liked the manager's reception and breakfast and would stay again for that reason alone. The pool, while chilly and a bit noisy, was fun and relaxing. Our room was large and updated although the balcony screen door was broken which was too bad considering the fabulous weather (80-90 degrees with no humidity). The upscale shopping area across the street is also a plus. Overall, we had a nice stay.

My husband and I stayed at the W in July 2007. Checked in went to our room and laughed. The bed is in the middle of the room with a big circle headboard cut out so you can see through it on both sides. The first thing I noticed is no dresser or anywhere to put our folded clothes and etc. Went to the closet and there was a hanging container but it did not work for either one of us. There were four hangers, one was broken. The inroom safe was not useable as it was locked so after we put our bags away we went down to the front desk and told them our problem. She said that someone would come to our room in ten mins. We had to be there for maintaince in order to reopen the safe. We waited over 45 mins. and left. The first night sleep turned out to be an adventure as the bed sloped to the middle, on our way down the next morning to report our unhappiness another couple was on there way back down and they had been moved twice with no difference in beds. No need for us to report and move we thought. The ice had melted in our glasses and we noticed black hard objects in the bottom of the glasses. Thought maybe it was a one time thing,but no it happened everytime we had ice. So we drank at the bar. The food and the bar were good as was the nice bliss products in the bathroom..that room was small. All in all for the money go somewhere else.

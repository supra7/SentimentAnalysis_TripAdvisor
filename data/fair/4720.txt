My wife and I just returned from four nights at the Sheraton. The hotel is nice, in a good location. It is also great that you can use the pool at the Westin. The level of service is downright horrible. The first time I heard a "thank you" was at checkout. At one point we had to go to the front desk, while in mid conversation, the lady at the front desk answered a ringing phone...the only problem was she did not say anything to us, just answered the phone. Then she proceeded to talk on the phone for a few minutes while we waited for her to hang up, and then there was no sorry or excuse me...At the pool, they try to sell you on the cabana's or chairs on the beach, when we told the pool attendant we weren't interested, we practically had to beg for towels. They try to nickel and dime you for everthing at the resort. We did not eat at the hotel as the menu's were very overpriced. Also, upon checkin, they upgraded us to an "ocean view" room, which sounded nice, but every room at the resort is ocean view so making a big deal about the upgrade was not necessary. For about the same price, just over $300 a night, check out the two resorts in Lanai, they treat you like royalty.

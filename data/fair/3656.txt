We spent four days at The W when in New York and were disappointed in the standard of cleanliness and maintenance for a hotel of this rating. Our room was less than cosy - scarcely room to move around if we were both standing - and furnishings and bathroom were really rather shabby. The downstairs bar attracted a huge crowd each evening, but as we did not join the noisy throng, we cannot comment on it. The location was good, however, but we could not recommend this hotel to other travellers seeking a comfortable and quiet room in New York City.

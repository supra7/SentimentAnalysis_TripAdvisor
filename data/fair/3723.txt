I travel 4 or 5 times a month for business, and am not too hard to please. All in all, this hotel was very nice. The rooms were clean and the bed was comfy. Other than that -- nothing spectacular. The pool is very big, but it is just that...a pool. The restaurants are extremely overpriced. The big draw is the ducks in the fountain in the lobby, but to be honest, we were kind of grossed out by them. The ducks poop all over the fountain and then lie in it all day.....you are supposed to relax and enjoy food and beverage service around this gross display of animals lying in their poop all day. The other HUGE disapointment is the $8 a day "service charge" that they automatically add on to your bill. Doesn't matter how much you paid for the room or where you booked it, they still mandate that you pay this charge of $8 per day at checkout. It is a total rip-off. The $8 is supposed to include 2 bottles of water a day, free internet access ONLY if you brought your own laptop, and a ticket for a free ride on the trolley. Well, we had a rental car and never used the trolley. We didn't bring a laptop and so we had to pay $.69 a minute for internet access, and we didn't drink their water. I asked repeatedly to have the charge waived, and they said no. We spent close to $50 on internet access, but still had to pay this ridiculous fee. It is like they were desperate to grab every last dime from us that they could. I will never stay here again. It's a shame, too, because I plan conferences for my company and was there "checking the place out", with the intention of hosting a conference for 575 people in November. Nope -- won't do it. Little things mean a lot and that $8 fee left such a bad taste in my mouth!

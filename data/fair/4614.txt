Clean Rooms  I had two rooms at this hotel during the Pro Bowl (2/10-2/14). The rooms were very clean and the hotel staff was great...but that's about it. Parking is limited and the spaces are very small, so you may want to avoid anything larger than a SUV (Trailblazer, Explorer, Jeep etc..). Parking is $18 per day .The noise is a huge problem. My rooms were located on the 6th  7th floor (facing West). There are emergency stairwell doors next to rooms I had. People went in and out these doors 24 hours a day and the doors SLAM closed each and everytime. Also, the street noise is really bad on these floors as well...you hear people yelling, laughing, talking all hours of the day. There is a bar somehwere close by and every night between 2:30 and 3:30 am, they dump glass bottles into a metal trash bin. This goes on for 30 minutes or more. The trash truck comes by around 5:00 am daily and dumps 5-7 trash cans. The cafe in the hotel is average, but the employees are very friendly. The best part of the hotel is LOCATION. It's right in the middle of Waikiki and close walking distance to shopping, food, beach.

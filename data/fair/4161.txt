I just returned from an overnight trip in Seattle. The hotel was sufficient for what we paid - $59 after taxes. I will admit that it was a little sketchy looking. It was a small room with a double bed, the bathroom was kind of gross looking with a rusting mirror and the shower was a single stall with no tub. I think you get what you pay for at the 8th Avenue Inn. The hotel is in a great location close to shopping, the space needle, etc. We didn't have any problems during our stay. It was just the furniture/rusting/chipped tiles that made our stay unappealing.

We had confirmed reservations at a nearby hotel ( Malabadi beyezit) for 55 eruos. hey stiffed us but hustled us down the hill to this place. ( for the same price; RIPOFF) We had to leave early so I can't comment on the breakfast. The room was small and dirty. Pillows like bags of sand and cheap matterus. The free wifi didn't work on the 4th floor. This place is part of a scam. Take your chances here. I'm not a picky person but this is a shady operation!!

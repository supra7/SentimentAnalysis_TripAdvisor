The pro of this hotel is that it is close to the french quarter. On the down site, they charge extra for parking (common in the area) and wifi (less common). The room was clean enough but looked worn. The main issue with the stay was that the key to our room did not work and the staff refused to move us to a different room be cause apparently none were available. We could only get a different room if we paid extra for an upgrade. The were asking more than double the original rate just so we could get a working key. Rather poor form on the part of the staff when they obviously had empty rooms to keep us stranded in the room we couldn't open.

The room was dirty. There was trash left behind from prior visitors.....including a tampon box with trash stuffed down inside of it. Didn't really want to dig down inside to find out what was in the box. Scary. There was food on the floor under the furniture. There was no plastic bag to put inside the ice bucket and after seeing all the trash and how dirty the room was, we were a little hesitant to get ice. Went to the water park Saturday night and Sunday. Didn't really encounter any rude employees Saturday night. Sunday, however, I was in line to go down the slide and the girl working there barked at me to take my necklace off. With all the commotion going on around me, I didn't hear what she said. She lit right in the middle of me. She did it in front of a long line of people including my grandchildren. I told her I rode the slide the night before and no one ever asked me to take it off. She said she worked the night before and "IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, DON'T SLIDE." Nobody ever taught Amanda how to talk to people respectfully. Interestingly when I was talking to my family about it at the bottom of the slide, another lifeguard who overheard my story said all of the lifeguards agree that she is extremely rude. The place was definitely NOT worth $180 for one night. With a heatwave of 114 degrees, the water containers at the water park were empty and employees were sitting in their little stations reading magazines. A soda was almost $5......everything was outrageously overpriced. You are not allowed to take outside food and beverages in so you are at their mercy. If you don't mind filthy dirty floors, trash from prior visitors, rude employees, tampon boxes filled with who-knows-what, and paying $180 for one night of filth......this may be the place for you.

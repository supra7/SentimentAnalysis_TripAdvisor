We just spent 2 nights at the Swissotel in Chicago for a daughter's graduation. I've stayed in other Swissotels and assumed that this one would be of the same level. I was wrong. The normal and expected amenities such as robes, magnifying mirrors, a morning newspaper and decent toiletries were all missing. Instead we were offered a rude and incompetant staff, amateur and slow valet, over-priced internet, garage and fitness room access charges and an inept business office. Don't think we'll be staying at a Swissotel ever again! The "nickel and diming" business is bad enough in a top tier hotel but this Swissotel feels more like a $350/night Motel 6.

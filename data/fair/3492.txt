When we checked in we were given a room that hadn't been cleaned -- The shower had open bottles of shampoo, the trash cans were full, and the linens were questionable. We asked to be moved to another room, but were told they were booked for the evening. When pressed, they finally said they had a larger room available -- Not sure why they didn't offer that option immediately. The shower curtain didn't reach all the way to the floor, so the bathroom floor was flooded after I took a shower. The closet structure didn't allow for hanging anything longer than a shirt. The front desk staff seemed distracted and disinterested. The location was good -- quick walk to theaters, and I liked the lounge, however I would not stay here again due to the apathetic service and bathroom flooding tendency.

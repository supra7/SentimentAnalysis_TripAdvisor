Excellent location opposite Euston Station, but this does cause traffic noise. The first room I was given was ground floor on the main road and very very noisy, but after a quick visit to reception I was moved to an upper floor which soon resolved the issue. Public areas were not the cleanest, the carpets didn't seem to have been vacumed for a few days, however the room was spotlessly clean with the exception that the towels hadn't been changed. however another visit to reception quickly rectified the issue. Suprisingly for London the staff were very friendly and nothing appeared to be too much trouble.

This place is seriously run into the ground. If you are organizing a meeting, this is NOT the place to do it. I was at a conference of over 1000 people. We were stuffed into the Empire Ball Room, which was probably the fault of the conference coordinators, however, the hotel tried to be "unique" and instead of passing hors doevres like lamb chops, they decided to cook them right there in front of everyone. I have never seen so much smoke in a conference room from food. It stunk and got on everyone's clothes AND it took literally 40 minutes to get ONE lamb chop. What a miserable failure their food service was throughout the conference. The seating in meeting rooms is terrible as well as in the lobby. People are constantly trying to find ways in the main lobby to walk by people and always bumping into one another. There are very few pathways through the lobby to walk and they get clogged with people. The setup is very poor. This is a great location but a disastrous place to have a meeting.

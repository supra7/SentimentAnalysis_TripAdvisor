Location is fun. Elevators are VERY slow. Rooms are VERY small. That was easy to overlook. The parking is AWFUL. It took over 30 minutes to just bring our car around when it was asked for. Apparently the parking is done several blocks away and if you are attempting to get your car when others are as well............. good luck........ The parking situation alone will have us looking elsewhere to stay for our next trip to Dallas.

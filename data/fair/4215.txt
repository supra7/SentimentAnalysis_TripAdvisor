I stayed at the Dunes Manor a few years ago and had a very nice experience so I returned this year. I paid over $300 for my room in July and I truly believe the rate was too high. It should have been closer to $175. Negative comments: What I remember most is that the ice machine on my floor was out-of- order for my entire stay. I lost at least two hours of my stay going to get ice because the elevators were so slow. The microwave in the room looked twenty years old and the refrigerator was off when we arrived. This did not make me happy since I was traveling with milk for my toddler. The headboard rails were dusty and the comforter had snags. The sink took forever to drain. The hotel looks very dated inside. Dont let the outside fool you. A renovation would help. Positive comments: The hotel is in a good location, its near the boardwalk and has a great ocean view. The on-site restaurant still serves a nice breakfast. The front desk staff was friendly. It is not the most horrible hotel I have visited but I will not stay here again for $300. I just cant justify the price.

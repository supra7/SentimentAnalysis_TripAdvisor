I was booked in here for a two night business trip. Overall a nice, older hotel which had gone through a relatively new refurbishment. This seems a theme for me with Fairmonts (just stayed in the Santa Monica one two weeks ago and had the same initial impression). Most of the staff were good (maid, check-in) others were completely underwhelming - eg. disinterested / rude "In Room Dining" operator. Also, tried to go to The Oak Room for lunch - stood at the maitre de station (1.30pm on a Wednesday) for 5 minutes and no service. All fine for a 3 start but not for a 5 star. Also, was paying for the "Gold" level at around $430 per night, Can't see any value in that. The only thing "Gold" about it was the price. A pretty hotel, with a lovely ornate lobby, but not worth the money. I'm sure there must be better value in Boston

Title summarizes it well. The room we had was tired and in need of a facelift, down to the carpet that was heavily stained and ragged. Staff, though functional in their roles, were by no means going out of their way to please. Restaurant food was average. Finally, the size and location of the hotel guarantees that you can't get away from it all, unless "all" is defined as vacationing with 30,000 of your best friends. Our room was free (we used points), but I wouldn't go there again, even if free.

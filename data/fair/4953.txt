This property was formerly the Fitzpatrick. I've been staying at this hotel for years. It has always been my favorite Chicago hotel through its various name changes. The only reason I would stay at other hotels would have been because this hotel was booked. Now, in fairness, the hotel is undergoing construction/upgrading. But all that work is being done in areas other than the lobby and guestrooms. I stayed one night, April 11. The reception staff was pleasant, but the doormen were apathetic and uninterested. In fact, I was not even sure they were hotel employees by their attitude or attire. I did not see them greet anyone. I did not see them rushing to help with luggage or cabs. Of course, I didn't see many other guests when I was there. I would not say anyone went out of their way to make me feel welcome. There was NO food service in the hotel. Even the pub/lounge was closed. I saw very few other guests and almost felt like I had the hotel to myself. My room, though large, and with the same decor as the last time I was there at the Fitzpatrick, was a little worse for the wear. It is as if the guestrooms have been let slide a little while attention is elsewhere in the project. On the positive side, Gino's East Pizza has returned to their former location next to the hotel. Yay! The hotel is steps away from the best part of Michigan Avenue. I'm hopeful that once the "dust has settled" this will once again be just a fabulous place to stay. UNTIL then, be advised your experience may be a little unusual.

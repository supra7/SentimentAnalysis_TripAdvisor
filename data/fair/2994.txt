We checked in today to our unit and were quite shocked to find the property in the midst of a massive rennovation. We were informed by the front desk that the pool will be closed for the next 90 days and you can go to another resort if you want to use a swimming pool. There are signs on all the doors advising guests that it can get quite noisy during the weekdays with jackhammering, concrete sawing, etc. I was wondering if we need a hard hat to get around the resort! They advise guests to plan their excursions during the weekdays when the construction is going on. We have been coming to Maui for over 14 years (and have stayed at The Whaler condos 4 or 5 times) and we come here to relax and enjoy the pool and beach. We really don't venture too far from Kaanapali. If we would have known that all this was going on, we would have probably either planned our vacation at a later date or stayed elsewhere. Not much we can do about it now except make the best of it although we are very disappointed. Just wanted you to know that the grounds are in complete disarray and it's like we're vacationing at a construction site. You should be advised that yif you are staying at the Whaler in the coming months, that this construction is going on.

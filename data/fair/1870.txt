Bedspread and carpet in room looked dirty. Called housekeeping to come, and was told "the carpet is new, it just looks like that". Housekeeping did at least change bedspread. Breakfast buffet was overcrowded and there were dirty tables all around that guests had to clean themselves in order to sit down. However, the dining room staff was very help and friendly. The valet service was excellent.

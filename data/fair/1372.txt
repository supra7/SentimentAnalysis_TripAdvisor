I stay at the Hilton for a conference meeting and found the hotel in need of repair and rethinking. The hotel rooms were ok but there were small things that were annoying. For instance, one of the mattresses had a major sag on one side - impossible to sleep in. The shower curtain rod was broken and made a mess when you showered. The toilet paper holder was so far away from the toilet that even my 6'2" husband couldn't reach it. The television was pretty old & crappy as well - we had issue with sound quality. The hotel restaurant should be avoided if possible. The service was terrible but the food is edible. We had lunch there twice - the first day it took them 30 minutes to greet us and the 2nd time, it took 30 minutes to get our check. This might be ok if the restaurant was busy but there were never more than 6-7 other tables. The food does come out fast once you can snag a waiter. There were still dirty tables left from the breakfast and service trays were pile high with dirty plates. Maybe just a competent bus boy would solve their issues. The conference facilities were acceptable. However, they keep the rooms like a meat locker - I would estimate that the temperature was set at 58 in some of the rooms. I wore long pants, a sweater and scarf and was still quite cold. The location of the hotel was ok. It is fairly central - close to the airport, south beach, coral gables, etc but the downtown is completely desolate. Unless you want to eat fast food or at the hotel lobby - you have to take a $15 cab to get anywhere. Downtown is unsafe to walk around at night so walking is really out of the question.

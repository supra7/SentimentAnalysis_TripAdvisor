Historic Hotel in the centre of Lahaina with very attractive external appearance. The rooms were designed for a very different and older era and are dark and appear small and fairly cramped. The historic design of the balconies incorporated no privacy screening and so were effectively shared in common. Better, of course, than nothing at all. The common areas were not kept clean. Dirt (e.g. old corn plasters, refuse, etc.) was left on the stairs throughout the stay and there was no evidence that any cleaning of the common areas took place at all, which detracted from the expectation of a memorable stay due to the prime location. Similarly the pool area in the courtyard needed a good brush out although the water appeared clear, but the overall ambience was not inviting and it was notable that no other guests were seen to use it either.

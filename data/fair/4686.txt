Don't waste your time or money booking the "Ho'o Malie O Ke Kai (soothing massage by the sea)!" The description makes it sound like a relaxing, decadent pleasure to get a massage in a private cabana by the pool next to the beach. The reality is the cabana is NOT private so you're just advertising for the spa. Since the cabana is not private, the masseuse had to work around my bathing suit. Even worse--the cabana was next to the kid's end of the pool. Screaming children is NOT my idea of a relaxing environment and there was a crowd of drunken college students right outside my not-so-private cabana having a high volume inappropriate conversation. When I complained to the masseuse about not being able to relax because of the lack of privacy and noise, he just replied that it was cheaper than a massage inside the spa. When I booked my room, I got late checkout (2 pm) as part of my package and booked my activities with that check out time in mind. I called the night before to reconfirm my 2 pm checkout and the clerk confirmed it at first. Then another clerk called me back and said I couldn't have my room past 1 pm because they had someone else checking in at 3 pm and needed time to get the room ready. I explained that I had a zipline tour booked from 9 am to 1 pm and wanted to check out after the tour so I'd have the opportunity to take a shower and pack my luggage. He INSISTED I check out in the morning before my tour and offered to store my luggage and let me use the shower at the fitness center. So I had to wake up earlier so I could pack and get out between breakfast and the tour. The one bright spot in all of this was the front desk clerk the next morning. When I explained to her what had happened with the man insisting I check out in the morning, she gave me another room which I could use until later in the afternoon so it worked out in the end, but the way it was handled left a bad taste in my mouth.

This hotel is now smoke free, but our room was on a floor previously assigned as smoking. The room and the exterior hallway both had a strong stale smoke smell. During the middle of the night, we awoke to the sound of condensed water dripping from the overhead AC vent. We weren't expecting much from the pull out couch where our children slept, but it was one of the most uncomfortable mattresses of this type that I've seen. On the positive side, the location was very convenient and the room rate was good.

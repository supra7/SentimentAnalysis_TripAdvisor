My family wanted a two day weekend getaway in Chicago with four adjacent rooms on the same floorbut this was almost impossible because of the reservation system. When I requested four rooms together with the online reservation system I never received any e-mail confirmationsafter I called in I finally received four e-mail confirmations on different floors with different views either including or not including breakfast. After about six telephone calls and numerous e-mail confirmations I decided to cancel all of the reservations and move to Hyatt Regency next door but by chance Jackie, In House Reservation Manager, answered my call and corrected these continuing problems. However, when we arrived at the hotel we all had the same rate with breakfast but again on different floor with different viewsthe rooms had not been blocked before our arrival so another thirty minute correction at the front desk with a twenty dollar tip to the Desk Manageron the same floor but we still did not have four adjacent rooms in a half-full hotel and the mini refrigerator was deliver to the wrong room. Basically, the problem is that there is a central reservation and an in house reservation and neither have automatic e-mail confirmationand if you have a reservation with breakfast this has to be manually updated in the system by either calling after making the online reservation or at the front desk at check-in. Also the rumor about charging for the included breakfast is trueMy parents and my aunt went down to breakfast early and told the server that they had breakfast included with the room and were handed an menu to order and a complimentary bill at the end of breakfast which was instead charged to my roomso after we ate breakfast I was a little surprise later that day with $80 breakfast bill was added to my room charge for my parents and auntthis continuing problem could easily be corrected by providing guests with a buffet breakfast voucher like other hotels but this is an obvious "bait and switch" to get guests to twice pay for breakfast. Regardless, I was another thirty minutes at the front desk correcting this problem and the only reason I think this charge was removed was because it was added to my room and not my parents and aunt roomsalso this breakfast charge was submitted to my credit card within hours and had to be removed before check-out. In summary, if you believe that a group reservation for four rooms at a $200/night hotel should include 30-minutes online making a reservation, 2-3 hours on the telephone correcting the reservations, another 30-minutes at the front desk correcting the reservations again, then another 30-minutes correcting additional charges before check-out, and like this much chaos...then I highly recommend the Swissotel for your next family weekend getaway.

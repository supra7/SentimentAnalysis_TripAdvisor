I've stayed at this resort quite a lot through out the years. I am an AZ resident and my family uses it as our "Staycation" place. It was much better when it was owned by the Hilton. The waterpark is fun, but forget any type of service out by the pool or even walking up to the bar. It took forever. Check in was at 4, our room wasn't ready till nearly 6 and when we did get it there was a big spot on the floor of vomit or something. Granted, it wasn't the resort's fault what the last guest did, but to let a room go that way was a shock. We stayed there with four other couples. My friend was about a half hour late getting his room, and they gave him a $50 resort credit for the wait. We got nothing. Also the resort was under some sort of renovation with the front check in so we had to wait in a small makeshift area with limited air circulation prior to getting our room. When you are hot and have antsy kids, not an ideal situation. Usually I love this place but it used to come at about $100 a nite, and this time I paid nearly triple that. Next time I think I will go with the Westin Kierland for the price. The value isn't there for such a resort.

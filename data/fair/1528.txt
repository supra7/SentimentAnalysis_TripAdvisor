This was my daughter's first trip to Europe and we selected this hotel both from the reviews on trip advisor and the thought that a Holiday Inn would be less culture shock than a smaller privately owned hotel. Big mistake. The room was warm the entire 5 night stay and even after speaking with the front desk there was nothing that could be done since the heat had already been turned on for the season. Evidently once that happens there is no fan or cooling option. Most evenings my husband, daughter, and I woke up sweating because it was too warm, even after having left windows open. In addition, the windows did not have any screens and there were mosquitos that would come in if we left the window open. The bed was worn and not comfortable at all - if it hadn't been for the time difference and being tired after sightseeing, I'm not sure we would have been able to sleep. The bathroom was the largest I've seen in a European hotel (that was good) however it smelled of mildew and every time we returned to the room it took a good 10-15 minutes before the smell subsided. In addition, the configuration of the shower and shower wall was awkward and resulted almost every time in water all over the floor. The cleaning service was wonderful and the included breakfast was more than adequate, which were the only 2 good things about this hotel. The location was just as described here - a little far from the main areas, but close enough by public transportation. A little industrial looking but we felt safe in the 3 block walk to the metro station. We all enjoyed Barcelona and hope to return but will not stay in this hotel.

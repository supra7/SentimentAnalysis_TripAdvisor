We spend the week with our teenage kids. Ka'anapali beach is beautiful, about a mile long from Sheraton going south. Westin is right in the middle. i say any hotel you pick is close to everything and the beach. that beeing said, I dont think Wewill stay here again. Customer service- NONE! Nice pools layout, but super overcrowded. Food super average. now the deal breaker for me was when I wanted to rent beach umbrella that comes with two chairs for 35 dollars a day, they said they were out. what bothered me a little was the fact that Westin charges for things that should be included . What made me mad was the fact that they had about 20 umbrellas for over 750 rooms! Are you Westin for real? !!!

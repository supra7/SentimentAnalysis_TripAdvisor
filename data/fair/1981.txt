I booked in advance for one night through bookings.com, but when I arrived (after 24 hours travelling) I was told that "there was a problem with the toilet in my room" - this is hotel-speak for having overbooked. So - first off, they lied to me about already renting my booked room. They had booked me in to another hotel, of course - but they failed to apologise for the situation, and they also failed to offer me a taxi ride to the other place. All they offered me was a glass of water!! So I had to walk for 15 minutes, with all my luggage, through an unfamiliar city, at 10:30pm, to get to the other hotel. I've never been treated as badly, even by $3 hotels in Asia.

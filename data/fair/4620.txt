Smoke and noise Stayed 11/14-21 with advance reservations for non-smoking, two beds, ocean view. Upon arrival, told non-smoking was not available, is special request, and not guaranteed. Hotel changed bedding to reduce smoke smell in the available ocean view room (facing ocean and glorious view from room), and called next morning, offering non-smoking ocean view. Upon visiting other room, discovered view was of another hotel's windows and that lanai overlooked vents of adjacent buildings, with view of sliver of ocean only if you stepped out of room. Decided to stay in first room, in spite of heavy smoke in hallways and stale smell in room. That night, loud banging in sink pipes at 11 pm and awakening us at 1:30 and 4:30 am. Desk said maybe due to old pipes and maintenance would come at 5 am. Lost full night's sleep. Spoke to asst mgr, who transferred us to non-smoking ocean view at 5:30 am. Upon return to room at 6:30 pm that night, it hadn't been cleaned. After much discussion with asst mgr by travel agent, got free late check-out for last day at 5 pm, in compensation for problems. Returned to room on last day at 3 pm, but locked out. Another mistake by front desk, which did not inform us about their changing looks on check out day at noon (I'd verified early check out the night before, but nothing mentioned at that time). Spent minimal time in room, but these situations and the time necessary to discuss and correct them took away from an otherwise wonderful stay on Oahu. Location is great, but will find another lodging next time. Caution: only four of 24 floors have non-smoking rooms and these cannot be guaranteed.

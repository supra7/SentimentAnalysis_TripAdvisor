The infrastructure is a little past its sell-by-date at best. This could be rescued by great service, but sadly it isn't. Two minor faults in the room -- a non-functioning light and a closet door which wouldn't stay closed -- became jaw-clenching frustrations when they weren't fixed even on the third time of asking. The third time, by the way, was to the duty manager, who has also not delivered on her promise to let me know the cause of the non-responsiveness. All hotels have little glitches from time to time -- the good ones fix the problems first time round and apologise. In bad ones, they don't and they look you in the eye and lie to you. This is a bad hotel.

We stayed for one night only on the way to the airport. In all honesty, I am very bemused by the positive ratings for this hotel. The location is not at all useful, being neither in the city centre, nor on the ring road for easy access to Fiumicino. The immediate surroundings of the hotel are not at all attractive (down at heel suburban area) with little in the way of interesting bars or restaurants. One of the reasons that we chose the hotel was the pool, but please don't be fooled. It is an extremely small rooftop plunge pool and was crowded during our visit. We had booked the suite and it was nice enough. However, there were no glasses in the room and although there was a Nespresso machine, there were no capsules and no cups. My family and I travel extensively and we usually find tripadvisor to be a very useful resource when booking accommodation. On this occasion, however, I really urge you to look beyond the other reviews. Rome is one of Europe's greatest cities and you really cannot experience the best that it has to offer if you stay here. My major gripe with the hotel was the service. Check-in was both inefficient and rude as was the check out procedure.

Yikes - this place is so expensive for what you get! We just started a 1 week stay here and I have massive sticker shock. There are no reasonable restaurant options - $13 for a very average small kids pizza. So far the food hasn't been bad, but certainly nowhere near justifying the price. And there's nothing else reasonable within walking distance - you always have to hop in the car, which is a hassle, and double that when you have kids. Sure the pools are great but I really wish I got more for the money. Maybe it's too much to expect for Hawaii. Next time for sure we're renting a little condo with a kitchenette. Also, we'll go someplace smaller - this hotel is enormous and it's hard to find your way around. Also - the charge is $95 for 3 hours at the kids club - wow! We were told that the kids club had an area where you could just go hang out with your kids and do fun stuff, but we didn't see anything like that.

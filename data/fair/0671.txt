Have gone to this hotel many, many times, but this time the hot tub smelled like crap, and I mean litterally crap. The price was shockingly high for a king room. used to pay 129.00 for a fri to sat stay and now it was close to 200.00. Definetly won't be going back unless every hotel in Seattle is full, and I had to.

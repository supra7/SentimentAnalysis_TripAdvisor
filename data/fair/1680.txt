We were really disappointed by this hotel. although it's located on George Street - it's way down at the bottom of the street, so a good 30 minute walk to the Docks. The hotel staff were unfriendly and the room was very average. Our air-conditioning unit was not working and we couldn't open the windows. The hotel charged you to use the gymj, which I found was a cheek. Generally, we were not at all impressed and would not stay there again.

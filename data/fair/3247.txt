Checked in today, have to agree with others. Very, very rude front desk staff, nothing like the great Intercontinental properties I have stayed at before. Very dirty, worn and stained carpeting in the halls and rooms, old TV, very small room. Asked for a high floor, checked in at 12pm and no rooms were available. So we checked our bags with the hotel (had to go hunt down someone to do this from me, as the front desk couldn't be bothered) and returned at 7:30 and found we have been assigned a very small room on the 6th floor. I was at the Hyatt Regency last night and it was spectacular. I'm so sorry I went looking for a "special" place for my weekend here with my girlfriend. Should have paid more attention to Trip Advisor, but was just sure this place would live up to the Intercontinental standards. Sadly, it's much closer to a Holiday Inn this group also owns.

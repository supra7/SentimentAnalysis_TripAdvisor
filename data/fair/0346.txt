the good: excellent location 2 blocks north of PPmkt. Nice bathrooms and nice views of the Sound IF you have a waterside room. The bad; tired rooms that are dirty. Carpet was gross and please look under the TV station to see what I mean. Old TV not high-def and a 4.95 PER HOUR charge for wireless service. Ice machine hard to find and not maintained well. Poor lighting in rooms and no CFL bulbs at all. The hall way carpets worn and dirty. Elevator beat-up on the inside. Shows a complete lack of management caring about this property.

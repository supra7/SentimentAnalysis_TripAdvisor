Unless you get some sort of deal from Priceline or similar you should stay away from this hotel. The hotel just needs a good renovation throughout, and there are much better hotels downtown at this or lower price (I paid $229). I was in a corner room on the 14th floor facing the Sound, but the freeeway noise was very noticeable and the room was very cold because of all the glazing. The room was large, and I guess was probably very nice in the early 90's when it appears to have last been renovated. There are strange built-in drawers below the windows, the furniture is in bad shape, the lighting poor, and the desk is small. The heating was very noisy, and constantly woke me every time it came on. The front desk service was fair, but the lobby too needs an update. Overall stay here only if you get a deal or this is the last place with beds in the city.

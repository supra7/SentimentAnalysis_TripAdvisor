At check-in no one told me which floor I was on or how to use the elevator system. The room service menu was overpriced ($30 for a sandwhich + 20% gratuity) but the food was delicious and delivered quickly. The faucet in the bathroom dripped all night and it sounded like my neighbor was showering all night too. I hear the Swiss has a great river veiw but mine looked into an office building. In the morning I asked for directions to my meeting and the nearest starbucks and was told the location was right through the glass doors on the concourse level and that there was no Starbucks near by. After 2 blocks of walking I found a Starbucks and the building where my meeting was held. I will try the Hard Rock Hotel next time I visit Chicago.

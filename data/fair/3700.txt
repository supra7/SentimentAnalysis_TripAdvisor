Recently stayed 4 nights during a convention. Our reservations were made months ago, yet 2 of the rooms were not according to the reservations. Instead of 2 rooms with two double beds, we were given a king and a roll-away (not what you want to sleep on in a 4 star hotel). Rooms were not ready at check in time - had to wait several hours for all of our rooms to be available. Jack-hammer drilling started early each morning. Had to wait at the front desk 25 minutes once to get an additional key. Rooms were not cleaned until very late in the day. It was as if this hotel across from the convention center had never had this many people at one time before. VERY disappointing. Additional charges for amenities that are usually provided free of charge at other hotels was also disappointing. While there was fitness center, there was an additional charge to use it.

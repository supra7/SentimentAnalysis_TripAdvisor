We had the opportunity to stay at the Magnolia Hotel September 30 - October 3. I have mixed feelings about our stay: The Good:  Beautiful boutique Hotel with good central downtown location.  Outstanding staff (sans GM) that seems to really care and are very helpful.  One hour free cocktails each evening from 5-6pm. Local, free shuttle service. The Bad:  Internet access is $9.95 daily  Mixers not on the "gun" are $3-4 dollars  Continental breakfast is very lame  General Manager is non-existent Details: We were in town for a convention and had originally planned to stay at the Hyatt. We read the Magnolia website and decided for the latter. We were led to believe (website) that internet access was provided, wrong! When I called the GM (voicemail) upon check-in to express my disappointment, I never heard back. In my opinion, internet access is as basic as shampoo and a hair dryer, particularly at this price point. HI Express and Fairfield offer this service gratis for Petes sake, not to mention a much better continental breakfast (read below). Secondly, we went to the cocktail hour one evening. I ordered vodka and cranberry and my wife order a vodka and tomato juice. We were charged $3.50 for the tomato juice, since it was not available on the "gun". Also, if you are not available between the narrow time period of 5-6pm; forget it, a mixed bar well drink is $6 and up. The continental breakfast was the biggest disappointment; very poor food quality and selection. Choices (and I am being kind) consist of small, recently thawed scones or muffins. However, if you arrive very early, you may be rewarded with a small container of yogurt. Oh, coffee and hot water are also provided. No fruit, juice, cereal, etc. Again, totally unacceptable for a hotel at this price point. Bottom Line: I would not stay at the Magnolia Hotel again. There are simply too many choices, to tolerate these basic lack of amenities.

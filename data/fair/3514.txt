stayed for 5 nights, location of the hotel great but the hotel was not what we expected. no doormen to greet us on arrival, hotel bar was closed to hotel guests 3 out of the 5 nights we were there due to private parties, room was very small for the price we paid, reception staff not very helpful when asked questions on nyc. very enjoyable holiday would recomened visiting new york just not the time hotel.

Sadly, this hotel is somewhat overrated. I was expecting a nice, smaller, elegant boutique hotel. Unfortunately, this property smells of cigarette smoke and was somewhat shabby. We checked in on a Thursday evening. We were given a room on the 12th floor that can only be described as one step above flea-bag. The paint was peeling off the walls, the furniture was battered, the carpet was dirty, the bathroom was out of the 60's or 70's and dirty with burned out light bulbs. The entire room reeked of must, mildew, and cigarette smoke. The windows were frozen shut. When we pointed that out to the bellman and asked if he could open them, he shrugged and did nothing. The next morning the smell was so bad that we asked to be moved to a new room. We were then informed that the entire 12th floor was smoking. We had never been asked (either when booking the room or at check-in) if we preferred smoking or non (we are both non-smokers). We were told that our luggage would be moved to a new room while we were out that day. We returned to the hotel that evening and nothing had been moved. We were then given a new room which seemed out of a different hotel - clean and nice with a remodeled bathroom. It was 1000 times better. The linens and beds are very nice. I do agree with previous guests that the hallway carpeting is beyond shabby and stained. Also, the cigarette smoke smell tends to creep up and down the elevator shafts and you can still smell the smoke on non-smoking floors pretty strongly, even in the rooms. Avoid this hotel if you can't stand cigarette smoke. Unfortunately, none of the staff were very helpful. This hotel has a great location and could be a real gem with some effort.

We stayed here two weeks ago for a week during the high school speech and debate tournament. Throughout the week there were lots of issues--the first issue was that we were not able to check in until 8 p.m. From 3 pm on they kept telling us our room ws being worked on and would be ready in 30 min. At six I finally asked why they kept saying 30 more minutes and they told me that was all their computer would let them say--two options--30 more min or not ready at all. In addition, the woman on the phone was crazy rude about it "You people have been calling me all day!" is what she said. I did not raise my voice, was not short with her, but was blown away by the rudeness. Finally, we did get our room and credit for $70 for the inconvenience. The next issue we had was trying to make phone calls using the business center. The woman working there was taking a personal call and loudly announced, "people here so I'm probably going to be here awhile!" There were three of us trying to make some emergency phone calls and use internet on our phones and the woman walked over and turned the television on to so you think you can dance so loud that I could not hear the person on the phone. Clearly, she did not want us in the business center. Sheets on the bed were musty smelling and housekeeping was marginal. Let me also say very clearly that last week I did email and spoke with mgmt and they apologized and said it had been a rough week for them. They sent me a voucher for a free room. I feel like they were trying hard and being more than fair, I'm just not sure I would ever stay here again.

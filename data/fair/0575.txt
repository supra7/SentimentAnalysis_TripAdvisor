We booked lured by TZOO top 20 deal The location is great - close to everything. The staff is young and hip but is not very experienced. The decor is memorable and stylish. The rooms are very small. Their restaurant (Red Fin) is quite yummy. The biggest issue: the room we got was dark, I mean really dark - the window (!!!FROSTED!!!) 'opened' into a narrow grey space (not an alley or inner yard) with an adjucent building wall at 10ft. But wait, there is more: the other building had commercial (!!!) airconditioning units NEXT to our room windows. Every 30-45min we got to enjoy noise as loud as on the airplane. After we complained, they moved us to a different room. Still frosted window, still 10ft to the next wall, but at least further away from the airconditioning units. We could still hear them, though the noise was muted - like sleepping next to a household airconditioner. Probably 1/4 of their rooms open to the same narrow space. I'd not recomend the hotel, unless you can somehow garantee that they will give you one of those rooms.

We were looking forward to our trip to the Ritz (we were there for a week for a family wedding upcountry), but left with less than warm and fuzzy feelings about the Ritz. We had called ahead months in advance to insure that we had adjoining non smoking rooms, one with double beds and one with a king. We were checked in to different rooms with no double beds that reeked of smoke. We were finally moved into other rooms after complaining. The hotel is run down and in need of a remodel. I was shocked by the condition of the rooms, the furniture and the wallpaper that was starting to peel in the hallways. Also, the tvs are archaic, there is limited TV options and no dvd players (we had a day of rain, it would have been nice to have some options). Service was spotty. We had great experiences in the Terrace restaurant, but pool service required waving your arms in the air frantically and we had our pool cabana reservation lost on more than one occasion (a bigger deal that one would expect since they only have a limited number, charge $75 per day and have no umbrellas at the pool). What hotel with 365 days of sunshine and heat does not have pool umbrellas? There were upcharges for everything ($18 resort fee should have included the valet or at least the umbrellas). The spa is lovely, the massage was great. Also, this is a bit more removed than other resorts on Maui, so be prepared to either make a trek for dinner or become inventive with the limited food choices at the resort. Though, if you love Japanese food, Sansei sushi is a mile a way and phenomenal. By comparison, I stayed at the Ritz in Shanghai for 10 days in July and found it to be a much more pleasant experience.

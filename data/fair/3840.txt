Great place to stay if you like noisy drunken sailors This is a difficult place to review. It is best to list the pros and cons. Pros 1) Nice rooms 2) For the most part friendly staff 3) The roof patio is quite nice. Cons 1) The street below was so noisy that sleep was impossible on Friday and Saturday night (Slightly better on Thursday and Sunday). The police came through clear out the streets at 3 and 3:30AM with their sirens on. (I'm from louisanna - and Bourbon St. isn't this bad.) 2) Breakfast is a joke  They should not even bother 3) Valet parking is $28 a night and some time you have to wait ~ 15minutes for your car even if you called first. 4) Every time I waited for my car I was hit up by panhandlers 5) We had to checkout at 4AM to catch a flight and the night person charged me for my room even thought it was pre-paid. Then started yelling at the computer  double charged me for parking. He then to canceled the 1 charge and told me he needed another credit card because they  would clear the 1st card. He was very unpleasant and we nearly missed our flight. 6) Funny smells (unpleasant) Overall  I would stay somewhere else.

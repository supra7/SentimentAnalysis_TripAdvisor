Most of the reviews on this hotel are obviously written by staff. Efficient and soul-less, the hotel rooms feature basic furniture that you would link it to a two star ibis rather than a four star that it purports to be. The swimming pool that is on the front of the hotel ad - and even at the reception - is a big joke. For a hotel with some 800 rooms, a 10 meter sq pond with a 20 sq m terrace (no exaggeration here) should never have been mentioned in the ad. Location of the hotel - off the center of town where you have attractions - cannot be satisactory to anyone other than those heading off to the beach. All said, you can find MUCH better value elsewhere in recession struck barcelona. Avoid at all cost.

I stayed here with my partner for a week. I tried to look for something moderately priced, which in London is not an easy task. I can't say we were totally surprised to find the hotel rather disappointing, but it's never fun to be right about such a thing. For the price we paid (92/night) it was not worth it. The room was seriously tiny, even for London standards. We had 3 large suitcases, which we needed to stack on top of each other just to be able to go to the toilet or open the door. Bathroom was big enough though, nothing to say there. What was the most disturbing aspect was the noise-level. We were on the street side, so this might not apply to the rooms on the other side of the building. I could not sleep without earplugs on. And that is a lot to say coming from me. We needed to have the TV on about top volume if we wanted to watch something as the noise from the street was constant. Other complaints: the pillows were a joke, our room got cleaned only about 4 times during our stay (shouldn't this be every day, it is called a hotel after all?) and the breakfast was nasty. Location -wise I don't know why anyone would stay there, as it is not central, nor even in Camden. We stayed because we were moving a just a couple of streets away after our week's stay. All in all, not recommended unless you get a better price and a room not facing the street!

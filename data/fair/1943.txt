Stayed on Nov. 22nd and 23rd of 2008. Firstly, the front desk is not friendly and not helpful. Make sure to get your stay rate either faxed to you or printed out from your email confirmation..because they will try to play dumb and up the rate upon arrival. Also, if you book the Cowboy Package, as we did, make sure you have that in writing because they will try to charge you for the shuttle to the Stadium(which should be free). KEEP your Confrmation print out!!! Very important! Secondly, The water pressure was terrible..I had read it in the reviews before I booked and asked them about it over the phone. They assured me there was no problem with the water. NOT TRUE!! Not only did the water pressure suck..the pipes were very loud...and at 2:00 am...just imagine! Oh, The smoke alarm also woke us up twice in the early a.m. ...apparently for no reason. If you like to sleep, don't stay here!

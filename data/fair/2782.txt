If you want to experience a slice of Vegas while on Hawaii this is the place for you. Crowds, enormous property, so-so service and over priced food. We paid top dollar for an "exclusive" tower suite and were disappointed. For the price we paid the service and ammenities were substandard. The service was a real disappointment. 1 out of every 5 employees we encountered was helpful. Our check-in was a nightmare and set the tone for our stay. Most employees we encountered just didn't seem interested in being nice or helpful. For our dollar we will be back at The Four Seasons for all future stays in Hawaii. Trying the alleged 5 star resort was a mistake we will not repeat.

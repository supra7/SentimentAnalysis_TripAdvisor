My husband and recently went to Maui for our honeymoon, figured we wont be able to a trip like this in a long while. We decide to splurge on a couples message, since neither one of us have had one together, and was transferred from our hotel to Grand Waileas spa to book there, which we did. A week before our appointment, we went into the hotel and explained that we booked a spa package ($400+) and asked if we are able to use the pool facilities when we are done. The man at the front desk of reception said, of course. Perfect I thought and we went a head with it. When the day came for our spa day, we had lunch afterspent more money at the gift store.spent more than ($600+) in total. We than made our way to the pool! This is where we were than told we are PROHIBITED to use the pools! I was furious after spending all this money at this hotel, especially after I asked the week before if we could!! Than I spoke to the front desk about it, of course the guy I spoke to wasnt there and everyone else I spoke to, including management, that everyone in staff has knowledge that pools are for guests onlyClearly not all guest are!!! ..if this is such an important rule, than the person I spoke to at reception, should have made that clear before we spent all this money. As honeymooners, this was a lot for us, and wanted to treat ourselves, but if we knew that we would have been dismissed and treated unfairly there with no resolution, I would have chose to spend my time and money at another hotel!! I would think twice if interested in staying here.they certainly know how to take your money and make sure you spend it, but when it comes to service, dont expect much!! I rented a place in Haiku for half the price and 100% better than this place.

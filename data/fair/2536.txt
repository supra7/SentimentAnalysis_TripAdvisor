I was in Chicago for a conference and stayed at the Palmer House for four nights. Not one night did I get a restful sleep. The hotel has not been soundproofed, so you can hear everything around you from loud televisions to slamming doors. This lack of soundproofing is very evident when the L Train passes by every five minutes. During the time I stayed at the Palmer House, construction was taking place on the floor above mine. The work started around 6AM with a loud jackhammer device shaking the walls. There was also some construction taking place in the lower level of the hotel where one enters from the street. The smell of garbage was strong. I would not recommend this hotel for someone looking for a restful sleep.

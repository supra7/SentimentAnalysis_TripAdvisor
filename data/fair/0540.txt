We stayed at the "W" August 22-34, 2007. Overpriced and way over rated. Save your money and time. Good location is all it has going for it. Snobby staff and watch out for the valet and parking charges. Ask before you drop your car off what the charges are. Stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels and have NEVER been charged more than $20 per night as a guest of the hotel. "W" is $35.

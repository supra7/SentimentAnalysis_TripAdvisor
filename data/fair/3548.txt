The hotel is very classy and chic. No doubt, but unfortunately, when you pay so much for a room, you expect it to be perfect. We were supposed to stay for 2 nights only. The first night was terrible. We were in a room with an incredibly loud fan. Even with my ear plugs I could hear it. My husband who can sleep in almost any condition and who had who was completely jetlagged could not fall asleep. This is absolutely unacceptable. Also, the line at the reception was so long. At any time we went to the reception, we had to wait for 15minutes. The previous occupant obvisouly helped himself in the minibar. The pack of Vitamin C was left on the minibar as untouched, but it was empty. I had to ask not be charged for this. The room was very styled and clean. Yet, the bathroom was not optimal. Very poor light, making it impossible to put make up on. The shower has no door, so that the floor is completely wet. We asked to be changed room for the second night to avoid the loud fan. They did it. That's cool, thx!. Hoping to get some sleep, there was still a fan on this side of the hotel, but less loud. I could get some sleep. Overall, I would not recommand this hotel if you are looking for some sleep.

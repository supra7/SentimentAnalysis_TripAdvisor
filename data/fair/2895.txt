We booked this hotel after staying in a sister hotel on Hawaii's Big Island. We were very disappointed with what we found. The hotel is very tired and the decor is now in a poor condition - some of the furniture was worthy of a working class bar rather than a high class hotel. The staff were not overly friendly, especially the pool bar staff. The pool itself is small with a cramped terrace and a low quality bar offering microwave snacks. The main hotel bar and restaraunt were tried once and then avoided, they were pretty dismal. There was limited internet facilities and these were charged at ridiculous rates. If you get invited to the luau, avoid it. The only saving grace is Makena Beach, it was fantastic.

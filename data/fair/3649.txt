This is the hotel with the worst reviews I have ever seen on Tripadvisor. To my relief they weren't totally realised, yes the rooms are minute (or cosy as the W staff say) and room furnishings are tired but the common areas and lobby are fine, the concierge sevice first class and we found our room quiet and comfortable. We stayed 2 nights, it would definitely be claustrophobic to stay more. I do not regret staying here but would not do so again. It's just not up to the mark.

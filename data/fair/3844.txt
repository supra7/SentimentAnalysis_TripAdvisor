stayed one night (although booked for four), and left due to noise from street. Although had requested higher floor at time of booking in August 2007 to avoid noise, was given room on 2nd floor. At check-in asked again for higher floor, but none available. After one noisy night (music from local club from 8 pm to 12:30 am on Thursday night, and flags whipping against building) again asked for higher floor but again none available, so went to other nearby hotel and slept fine for rest of stay. Other than noise, room was fine, well-appointed with mini-fridge, microwave, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, cutlery. Staff were friendly. The free continental breakfast was basic, but quantity good. (Wished we could have stayed on a higher floor; it might have been quieter?)

My wife and I stayed here in a king room with a "view of the lake". We had requested a crib for our son which we ended up requesting 3 times prior to getting it. Our rooms thermastat was broke and had to be replaced after we arrived. After shopping we came back and found our keys didn't work and had to get them replaced. During the night we were awakened 3-4 times by a fire alarm going off. The carpeting was stained and worn out, and the room was quite small for the $309 rate. Our view of the lake turned out to be through several high rises. On the upside when I complained about getting awakened 3 times during the night by a fire alarm they refunded me $100 off my room rate.

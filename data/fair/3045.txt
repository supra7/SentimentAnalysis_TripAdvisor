This was our favorite place to stay on Maui. Unfortunately, they have deferred the proper maintenance of this property and the rooms show it. Everyday of our stay something needed to be fixed. One afternoon we retuned to shower and found that they had removed our showerhead and not replaced it. Another afternoon we returned and they had fixed one thing and broken another. It was incredibly frustrating and we got tired of hearing how sorry they were. And, we got tired of waiting for the engineer to fix the broken items when we would have rather been relaxing. The room had a horrible smell to it and it never felt clean. The bed linens were dirty, the mattress pad had hair on it, and the mattress had stains on it. Room Service leftovers would stay in the hallway all day long until I would finally get disgusted and call to ask for removal (it was not from our room). The Internet never worked properly in our room and we were handed a router to use that barely received a signal after 4 hours and 2 calls for assistance. We really hope that the Westin addresses the deferred maintenance in the rooms, as we would like to return in the future. Its a great location with fantastic pools (but COLD) and good employees that are trying to please guests when they encounter numerous problems.

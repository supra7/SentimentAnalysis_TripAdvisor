I was in San Diego for a one night stay as we were doing a bike race the following Sunday morning. When we arrived for check-in, at 2:50pm, we were told there were no rooms available. After expressing a bit of frustration and demanding the employee call the manager, our room all of a sudden became ready and available. That wasn't the end of the world; however, things would only get worse into the night. The entire night all you could hear, every 30 minutes or so, was the sound of the water running through the pipes - imagine a little drum playing all night. This was not a result of our water use but instead was caused by everyone else using their water/bathrooms! We had to be up by 5:30 am and kept hoping it would stop - I don't know about you but I don't want bunch of men in my room in the middle of the night fixing the pipes...how could I ever go back to sleep. When we were checking out, we brought up the problem; however, the employees behind the desk looked at us like we were crazy and hardly offered a word in an attempt to acknowledge our dissatisfaction with their hotel. I couldn't believe how unintersted the staff acted.. The hotel room came out to more than $250.00 (including random fees they charge) and believe me , it was not worth it! I could have stayed at the Holiday Day Inn and had a better nights sleep and service.

The Fairmont was remodeling when we were there, and except for apologies, it was SO inconvenient to stay there during that time. The room was not worth the price; even with the gorgeous view of the Lake. Plus they were making way for the new chocolate/wine bar thing that to me, isn't worth it. This is a very expensive place to stay, folks, and we're used to paying for the luxury hotels (i.e., Ritz). Fairmont needs to provide better signage here because it's confusing, and do better in customer service for guests staying, especially for business. Parking is horrendous, and the best thing to do is suck it up and pay for valet, realizing that it's going to cost you. Aria's breakfast buffet had hot turned cold food every day, and there were problems in the kitchen with staffing on 1 day where the restaurant apologized and breakfast ala carte items were free. We're used to staying at the Renaissance, which has a better location, but without a view of the Lake. For the over $100 price difference, it wasn't worth the room. The accommodations at the website are not what you get unless you pay for THOSE exact rooms. However, if you want the best for spa treatments, go to their MySpa. Holy cow - it's wonderful. It's not just new; the whole atmosphere is relaxing and I enjoyed 2 treatments on 2 separate occasions. If traveling to Chicago again, I'd stay at the Renaissance and go to MySpa for massages. It's THAT great, and the staff at the Spa are very pleasant and accommodating.

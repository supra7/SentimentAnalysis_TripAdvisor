Unfortunately the Wi-Fi was down during our entire stay. There was no effort to remedy the situation, only empty apologies. The front desk had wired Internet access, all the manager needed to do was ask an employee to go to a local electronics store, purchase a wireless hub (less than $75), plug in the wired connection from the front desk and at least the lobby would have had Wi-Fi for guests to access. The pool is unheated and cold. Note that the hotel shuttle to the center of the city takes a siesta in the afternoon. The hotel itself is fine, rooms are nice and the staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was delicious.

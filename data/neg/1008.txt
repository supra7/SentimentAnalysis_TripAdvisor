This hotel was a big disappointment, even given we paid only $179/night. In the past year I have stayed in hotels in Europe, Africa, the Carribean, and the US at all different levels [e.g., Days Inn to the San Francisco Fairmont] and this is the only hotel that truly annoyed me. When we checked in it was nighttime - outside and inside. The lobby was lit only with tea lights scattered about. We simply could not see where we were stepping or what we were signing. I couldn't believe it! There was also extremely loud music, with a booming bass line, blasting in the lobby each night. The younger people crowded about apparently enjoyed it but my party of four found it absolutely obnoxious. The lobby also had an unusual scent - sort of a combination of mothballs and incense; I never got used to it and could not understand why anyone would deliberately pollute the air of a hotel lobby with that noxious odor. Perhaps if I were a New Age type, as opposed to a middle aged type, I would have enjoyed it. The room was clean but rather spartan. Bed was OK, not fabulous. Towels were a little chintzy. The biggest problem: the room did not have enough light for comfortable reading. The absolute limit was that the "complimentary" coffee service in the lobby was taken away at 9AM. Good points: location, concierge was helpful, sufficient elevators.

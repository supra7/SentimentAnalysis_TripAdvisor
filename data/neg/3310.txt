My husband and I stayed at the Worldquest Resort in Orlando Mar 1-4 2008...We had a beautiful 3 bedroom condo.The place was large, very clean and modern.We may have been the first to stay in this unit.Now..here's the bad stuff.He had brought his lap top so he could stay in touch with family and his office.First they don't have wireless so we went to the front desk to get a cord to use it.(Im not computer smart ,not sure what the terms are)We were on line then left it on the table to go for the day.Now we know were should have shut it down.When were returned the lap top had 800 searches going.Someone had hacked into the unit throught their server and was searching all his files...he shut everything down, contact the IT rep at our office started changed passwords and codes.He contacted the front desk and they said "Well we have been having server problems and have shut everything down." But for 3 days we couldnt get anyone from the resort to explain what happen...WeTHINK things are ok but who knows........NOW the rest of the story...yesterday we get a call from Visa....we had a charge for 1.00 got through our acct from the Worldquest Resort in Orlando..They said this is a test to see if the number is in use...then they charge huge amounts on the card...This was caught on time by the Visa people and all cards are now cancelled... Don't let the security guard at the gate fool you...THIS PLACE IS NOT SAFE!!!!!!

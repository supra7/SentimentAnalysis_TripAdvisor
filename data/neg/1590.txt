The worst part about this hotel is the ONGOING CONSTRUCTION. This could have been better if they actually notified customers prior to booking. When we asked the staff they said "this was unscheduled construction and we are very sorry". Let me tell you that remodeling on this scale of the atrium, lobby and pool access areas had to of been scheduled far in advance. Constant jack hammering, cutting, and pounding from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. daily was simply unacceptable. We actually left the resort 6 out of 7 days because of the noise. No refunds, discounts or adjustments were offered. I honestly expect more from Hyatt but they obviously do not care about their customers. We will simply do our talking with our dollars next time we book a hotel elsewhere. Room maid service was poor at best with the minimum care being the norm. Breakfast was included with our package and even though it was good it lacked change and imagination on a daily basis. Get them in and get them out was clearly their mission in the Swan Court restaurant. The rest of the restaurants on the property were overpriced for their offerings. Although the property is waterfront there is no beach to swim or lay out to speak of. Parking is limited with extremely small spaces; had to get in on the passenger side once to get our car out. The positive aspects of this property were the beautiful waterfront room and the walking distance proximity of Whaler's Village with several restaurants and shops. My advice is to STAY AWAY DURING CONSTRUCTION. At last check it's scheduled through December 2011.

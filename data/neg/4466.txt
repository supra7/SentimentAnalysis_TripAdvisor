I have never had to write a bad review based on service for any establishment, so this review should really come across as strong regarding service at the Burnham Hotel in Chicago. My issue revolves around making reservations for international guests and I was to book 6 rooms for two days (being a good customer). I never received any confirmations as promised and after the second day, I called and was transferred 4 times, cut off, and received a recorded prompt to leave a voice message. In a professional and courteous manner, I did just that. Four hours later, no call back from the hotel. I then called back on three occasions and it seems like everyone is a manager when you ask for one. Another important aspect of this is was the fact that I was booking direct through the hotel and not via a third party which can cause conflicts. I am shocked frankly. A four star hotel messes up reservations placed on a credit card twice. Then to top everything, when I went to book the rooms, the special group rate of $118.50 per room jumps to $190 and the arrogant representative on the line states, that is the best I can do. Luckily, I went to another hotel a block away, received rates for $90 for a better upscale hotel, and received an email confirmation within minutes. I am not sure why this happened and who is inept at the Burnham Chicago (A Kimpton Hotel), but never again will I stay at this chain. Brian

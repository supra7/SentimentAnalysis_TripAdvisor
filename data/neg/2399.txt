As I walked up the wood stairs from the ground floor entrance to the lobby I noticed the wood floors were dusty and dirty. For example, one thing was a small smushed tomato that was dried and stuck to a step, and it was still there the next afternoon when I left. While I waited to check in, I looked around at the wood floors in the lobby and they looked like they had not been cleaned in a long time. The area rug appeared to be faded, stained and not vacuumed - and it was only 10:15 in the morning. Late that night, when I pulled back the covers of the bed to go to sleep, there were three quarter sized holes in the cover sheet. Right below the pillows and very visible. How could any housekeeping staff make this bed and not see the holes? I was tired and it was late so I just went to sleep. The next day when I checked out I mentioned the holes to the staff person. She apologized but was chilly in her demeanor. No offer of any type of compensation. Maybe she isn't authorized to do so, but then I expect management of a hotel to follow-up in a timely manner with a guest after something as bad as holes in bed sheets. 4 days later and I have not been contacted. The shower door did not close properly, I tried a few times to line it up. As a result, there was a flood on the floor of the bathroom after my shower. Even after putting the bathroom rug and towels down. It did not just leak a little. The rest of my room was average at best. The light on the desk did not work and the volume control to the television was wacky - I would turn it down and then if I pressed mute and then turned back on it would go up really loud and blast out sound. The experience inside my room was annoying in too many ways for me. The only positive impression during my staty was the doormen - were super friendly and helpful. I travel to Chicago on business fairly often and wanted to try the Dana after reading positive comments here on tripadvisor. I will not return.

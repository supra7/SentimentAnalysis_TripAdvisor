I can not recommend this property. The halls are very dingy, the carpets need to be replaced. The room just ok, no elevators, have to lug suitcase up a dirty stairway. We traveled 15 hrs., and were exhausted. Got to the hotel at midnight. We were awoken by the night desk clerk at 3:00 a.m., asking if the people who stayed in our room the night before, could come up and get some things they left in a dresser drawer. No, was the answer, but will put the drawer outside the room. At 3:15 a.m. phone rang again. Desk clerk said the people wanted to come up and search the room because some items were missing. Absolutely not, come back in the a.m. It was a poor decision of the night desk to wake us up and ask such a question. Also, housekeeping should have been more thorough in cleaning the room from the night before. We should not have paid for the room. Contacted the hotel mgm. after we got home, and after 6 wks, no response. Contacted Corporate and they sent us a gift certificate for a stay in another property. Would not stay here!!

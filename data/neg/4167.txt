We stayed at the Park Plaza and were very disappointed in the service at the hotel. *The concierge was unable to find the full itinerary for the group we were with, and we missed a scheduled breakfast because they were unable to tell us where it was located. *Our bathtub backed-up, and did not drain itself for hours, which made it extremely difficult for more than 1 person to shower. *The valet service "lost" my car for almost a 1/2 hour because the head valet had given my keys to someone, but didn't recall who. Overall, it was very disappointing. I have stayed at the Radisson in the past (located across the street) and it was cheaper, the plumbing worked, and the service was 100% better. I will stay there in the future.

4,3,2,1 -- I rate the Sheraton a 2. Worn carpets, hairs in the shower, poor service -- thought I was staying at a Sheraton NOT a motel 6. I travel often and my admin booked this room for me -- let's just say she apologized after I told her about my experience. There were 2 positives -- the fitness center and the lobby. If you are staying in Seattle -- try the Pan Pacific. You are warned.

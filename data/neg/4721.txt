My wife and I stayed at the Palmer House this past weekend (Friday through Sunday nights, $79 a night on Priceline). The good news: the lobby is very impressive. The location is excellent; walking distance to all sorts of stuff, and just around the corner from the L station. The room was small, but we've had much smaller rooms (such as the Hudson in NYC). The walls were a little thin but noise really was not a problem. The bad news: the bed, one double bed for the two of us. This was really bad news as I'm 6'4" 220 and my wife is 5'9". We were shocked when we walked in the room and saw the bed size, and pretty miserable when it came time to sleep. While we've encountered rooms with only a double bed in Europe before, we had never experienced this in the US. We called the front desk and asked for other options (a king, a queen, or two doubles?) but were told because this was a Priceline room, there was nothing they could (or at least, would, do). After two nights of horrible sleep in the double, they finally offered us a bigger bed on Sunday night. A single doublebed for two people just is not acceptable, at least not in my book. Perhaps this was a consequence of our using Priceline, but I thought, mistakenly, the worst case scenario for a Priceline room was a single queen or two doubles.

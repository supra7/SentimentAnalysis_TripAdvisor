September 19th-23rd Arrived from England found the Hotel looked nice apart from a building site at the front blocking the view of the Harbour. The first thing we noticed after a long journey was the lack of a porter to help take our bags up stairs to our room, and the staff were not very friendly. We liked the room which was clean, but overlooked the building site, and on our first morning we were woken by loud noise at seven oclock. But breakfast was good and the staff serving in the restaurant were friendly and helpful. However whenever we needed to approach the front desk we found them unhelpful, we reported the lift wasent working, they didnt seem interested, they always seemed to be talking to each other. Then when we complained about the noise from the building site, which was much worse for the last two days as they started at six in the morning pumping concrete up to make a new floor. The lady Manager turned her back on us after saying its just a building site. We loved Baltimore and always stay at Hilton hotels, but would not return to this one

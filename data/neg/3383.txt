We tried to stay here when my niece was getting ready for a long hospital stay and had a lot of appointments at Children's Hospital in Dallas, which is only three miles away. However, every night we tried to swim there were either inconsiderate people smoking by the indoor pool or TOPLESS in the hot tub! Management could do little about it. It was also very loud with all the drunk truckers coming in from the strip club next door at 4-5am! Breakfast in the mornings was also x-rated with all the truckers talking and showing off their phone videos from the club the night before! DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU HAVE KIDS!!

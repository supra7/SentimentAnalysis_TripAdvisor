First the good. The room was clean and the bed was VERY comfortable. I also had an ocean view, which was nice. The hotel is right on the beach, another plus. The pool was clean and refreshing. High speed internet is available in the room for a fee, but they do have computers in the business center which are free. I would recommend taking your own computer into the business center and connect via WIFI as their computers are really slow. Now for the bad. When i started to check in, the rep left me to get my keycards for the room. She was gone at least 15 minutes (no joke). When she returned, she said their coding machine was not working, so she gave me a master key and said to check back in about an hour to get my regular keys. To make a long story short, it took 4 sets of keycards before I got some ones that worked, which is ridiculous. Security had to end up re-programming the lock on the door. The remote wasn't working the TV so it had to be replaced. But even after that, the menu button wouldn't work, so I couldn't access any programming, just the regular cable TV. The lamp on desk didn't work either, but by this time, I was done. So I lived with the troublesome remote and lamp. Self parking is a block away and costs $10/day. They do have valet parking, but it's $17 a day. The room I was in had 2 queen beds, and the room was very small. Can't imagine 2 people staying there for any length of time. No microwave or fridge. I would not recommend this hotel. If you're wanting to stay on the beach in Daytona, I would highly recommend Wyndham Ocean Walk. I've been there multiple times and have always been pleased. Parking is on site and is also free.

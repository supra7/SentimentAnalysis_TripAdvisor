We have stayed here a few times. If you are unlucky -- you are put in a room about the size of a large closet. Stuffy, and windows that don't open. I hated it. That is not what I am complaining about here - but that is true above. They also took my reservation - which somehow got mixed in with priceline.com/starwood hotels (which it didn't say) -- COMPLETELY screwed up the reservation I made -- wrong # people, wrong #beds, and wrong TYPE of room -- they (in)conveniently put me at the concierge level which cost almost TWICE what I had ordered. And refused to change it! So I canceled this erroneous reservation within 10 minutes after receiving this screwed up reservation , but... THEY REFUSED TO CREDIT MY CREDIT CARD!!!! I am still out $610.38 on my credit card from these highway robbers!!! BUYER BEWARE: THESE HOTELS AND ONLINE RESERVATION COMPANIES WILL STEAL YOU BLIND -- AND APPARENTLY IT'S LEGAL!!!???? How is that possible???? You CANNOT JUST KEEP MY MONEY FOR YOUR MISTAKE!!!! THAT IS ILLEGAL. PARK PLAZA/PRICELINE.COM/STARWOOD HOTELS: I will pursue you and this til my dying day. YOU THIEVES - I told you I will post my experience about you over the internet and file complaints w/ the BBB and Atty Generals office and you snottily responded that I could do what I want.

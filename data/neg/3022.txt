I stayed at this hotel on business. I'm not sure who they're clientle is supposed to be. They claim they're close to McCormick Place, so you would think it's geared towards the business traveler. However, they fail to tell you that no shuttle will take you to McCormick Place because this hotel is located in a very unsafe neighborhood on the south side of Chicago. The people who worked at the hotel were all very nice. And my hotel room was very clean. However, the first morning I woke up before having to work a tradeshow all day and I had to (a) iron my shirt on a towel on the floor -- no ironing board and (b) ended up buying instant coffee and using warm water out of the bathroom sink for my morning coffee ... and (c) no hairdryer in my room. So, I called the front desk to ask if they have ironing boards and hairdryers in this hotel. They replied, "Yes we do. They must have taken everything from your room." (Meaning, someone stole the hairdryer and ironing board). Needless to say, both items didn't make it to my room in time for the show. On 2 different occasions, both cab drivers asked me how I found this hotel and told me to stay inside and don't walk out on the streets because it wasn't safe. So, no coffeemaker in room, no ironing board, no hairdryer, can't take a shuttle to McCormick Place -- oh yeah, no restaurant associated with hotel - so no room service, and I can't walk around outside of the hotel for fear I might get taken out. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this hotel at all.

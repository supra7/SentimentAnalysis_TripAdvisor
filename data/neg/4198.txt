This is an old, historical hotel and the rooms reflect that. Old and small. We arrived late and the staff had no idea where we could get something to eat because, despite the many bars and restraunts housed in the hotel, none of them had food service! It was only like 10pm. The bars were noisy and there were lots of partyers overflowing from the bar into the hotel, which is cool if that's your thing. I was just hungry and tired. Also, our heat didn't work so we froze and ate some bar peanuts for dinner until eventually a very kind serviceman showed up and fixed it. I wouldn't stay there again. It wasn't awful but there are much nice hotels with better service to be had for the same money.

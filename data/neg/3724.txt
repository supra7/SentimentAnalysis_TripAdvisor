WARNING: This is a badly run hotel, in the process of being converted to condos. Ownership obviously doesn't care about the quality of the guests' experience. Our room was barren and cold -- no coverings on the linoleum floor, no decor on the raw concrete walls. The air conditioning controls didn't work -- it was too cold all the time. No hot water for the shower some of the time. This place made a state-college dorm room look attractive. Think of a low-grade pension in an Eastern-bloc country. And we had one of the "best" rooms in the place -- top floor, largest size. We asked if we could swap for a more comfortable room, even if smaller, and were told that all rooms are the same except for size. Also, it is no bargain. We payed $200 for a weeknight and $300 for a Friday night. Perhaps some gouging going on due to high demand that weekend, but shop around before you agree to pay that much for a room that would be fair value at $75 or less. On the bright side, the location is great, and the staff friendly and helpful.

My husband and I went for a long weekend and were extremely disappointed in everything about our experience. The hot water was tempermental at best. We were both forced to take cold showers twice during the stay. House keeping was once a day which is not the norm for a five star hotel. The pool was not the level of other hotels in Vegas that are listed as 4 stars or even 3. When we called and complained to a Manager about the water, lack of cleaning and no towels, we were met with disinterest and apathy. The elevator bank for our section had only one elevator out of 4 working and when we rode down with 5 other couples we found out that none of their rooms had hot water either and that no one really cared when they called the front desk as well. We will NEVER stay there again and I will advise anyone and everyone not to as well.

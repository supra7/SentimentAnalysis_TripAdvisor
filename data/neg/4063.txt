We had stayed at the Park Plaza previously and thought it was a good location and a good experience overall especially given the deal we got on the rooms (under $100). This time, a year later, we paid full price and received TERRIBLE service. The managers we spoke with were expressly rude and unhelpful. Rooms are small and smelly. TV was not working. Walls are THIN -- you can hear every word next door. Don't stay here during a busy travel time. If it is not a peak period, you can hope to get upgraded to better conditions. The only good this is the location in terms of being in downtown Boston, near the T and restaurants, etc. And the beds are admittedly comfortable. But it's really not worth the price that they are charging. Internet is an extra charge, even in the lobby. The hotel desperately needs new management!! We never got an apology or a kind word. I won't stay here again.

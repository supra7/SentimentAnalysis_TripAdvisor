I had asked for a high floor, but the best I could achieve was 9. From here I could here the noise of the trains, not sure if it was overground or the underground, but it was regular. It wasn't loud, not so bad as too disturb sleep but it was there. For some reason it seemed noisier in the bathroom. If you placed your hand on the window sill you could actually feel the vibration. My wife couldn't as it was very faint, so it wasn't a problem, just interesting. The beds were not as comfotable as most Hiltons we have stayed in. They were getting quite dated. There was a single dressing-gown in the wardrobe. How odd. The same happened here as it did in Montrea - See that review - when I asked to borrow two plates I was sent to ask in the restaurant. Not very impressed. We stayed here for the location. Most hotels in Boston seem very expensive compared with other US cities and towns, and the quality is lacking as well. In fact accommodation is so expensive, we had a week in Cape Cod and just 3 days in Boston. Not our original plan.

Be very careful...they will charge you for EVERYTHING!!!! We wanted to get a luggage cart to carry our bags. Nope, only the staff can use them. We shut the outer door to our two rooms and couldn't open it with our key. When we asked about it at the front desk, the snotty desk clerk said that we weren't supposed to close the door. Really? Where was that sign??? It takes FOREVER to get service. When we finally got our bags out of holding, the bell hop HAD to take them to our car. He did not help put them in the car and yet he was ticked off when I didn't tip him. Sorry pal, where I come from...you ONLY get a tip when you provide good service. AWFUL RUDE STAFF!!!!! Get it together Seattle Sheraton! Only redeeming qualities...location and pretty clean rooms. OH AND BY THE WAY...Internet costs $11 per day! Can you say ridiculous????

We've stayed at this Hilton for a couple of nights en route to the Key West for the past 3 years. Prior to this year, we had very good experiences, and we are Hilton Platinum members. This year's visit will be our last. EVERYTHING has gone downhill, from the guest service at check-in, to housekeeping, to restaurant/bar. The concierge lounge was not stocked and closed early. Last year, there were manager's receptions in the lounge with the old General Manager, (who we are sad to hear is no longer at this property, he was quite a nice gentleman), there was energy at the pool and in the bar, the staff smiling and friendly. A complete change this year. Sad to see from a once upgraded Hilton that has a spectacular view of the seaport, and Miami Beach.

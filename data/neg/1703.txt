We arrived at the Hyatt Maui Resort thinking it was elegant and luxurious. We were wrong. When we arrived at this Miami styled hotel at 4:00 they said our room was not ready. A child had barfed in our room and it got all over the floor and walls they said. They said the hotel was booked and no other rooms were available. We were very angry. We sat in the lobby for an hour. The lobby is no resort like and relaxing. It feels more like a shopping mall with stores and palm trees. We got to our room and the first thing we noticed was a barf trail to the bathroom. The stain wasn't totaly gone. I immediatly felt sick. I could feel our three night stay turning into a disaster. The room looked like it was straight from a Hong Kong hotel. The dark wood around the sliding balcony door said ZF. I couldn't belief how vandalized the room was. This did not look like a $500 room. The pool is the worst area of all. It is more like Wild Rivers Water Park than a resort. There were bodies everywhere. We came out to the pool at 5:00 and there were no chairs people were sitting on the ground. The pool has no moving room because it is so crowded. Seems like the Hyatt overbooked. The slide was fun though. Restraunts were good. Oh yah, their is no beach at the Hyatt. The water comes right up to a walkway and there is three feet of sand. We steped in the water and there was coral right away. You have to walk 10 minutes to notrth Kaanapali beach at the Sheraton to acually swim. We left the horrible Hyatt and got a room at the Sheraton Resort were it is clean, hawaiian, luxurious, and has a beach. The Hyatt is a disaster hotel.

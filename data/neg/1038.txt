The service was OK, but for the price I expect a view. There was no view, the room was freezing (couldn't turn the heat up!) and it smelled of cigarettes very strongly even though they said it was a non-smoking room, and they refused to move me. Plus it's way out by the university and not close to anything! better to stay at a hotel down by the market. And the booking agent said taxes were included but they wanted another $150 when I got there for some new city taxes! Whatever...

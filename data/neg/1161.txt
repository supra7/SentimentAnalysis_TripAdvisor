Used Econolodge for Park 'n Fly services over the weekend to attend a funeral out of state. The rate charged me more than the guaranteed online rate for one. Were very rude to other costumers during my check in process. When I returned I found it very apparent that my car had been used by one of the employees for personal use and that items had been stolen from my locked glove box. Don't use these people......they are crooks!

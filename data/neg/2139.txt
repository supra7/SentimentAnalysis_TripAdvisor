I wishj I would have listened to the reviews that I read because they are ALL true!! When we got there it is off season and slow but no rooms were ready? There is no beach it is NASTY and why in the world they would have beds to look at that mess is beyond me. Not to mention they had no sheets on them. There are 2 pools but one is adult only and the only kids pool was under construction and my little boy was still not allowed to use the other pool. The sales presentation was by far the worst I have been on and I have been on a few and even own a timeshare. Don't go on the off season even if it is free. I went on all inclusive and was still hungry. We only had 1 option for breakfast and 2 resturants at dinner which your options were limited. Room service food was horrible but the delivery boy was nice. Jose was a great waiter at whatever place he was working. None of the drinks are cold even the milk. It didnt make it any better that it rained the whole time and the rainy day activities were boring. I would have to agree with one of the other reviews. This has probably put such a bad taste in my mouth I may never return any part of mexico

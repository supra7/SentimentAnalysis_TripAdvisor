My partner and I stayed for one night. We booked it at the last minute. It looked lovely from the outside and it was in a good location. The room was not brilliant the carpet was dirty. We had a shared bathroom and it was a nightmare to get a chance to use it! when we finally managed to use it there was no toilet paper and no one at the so called 24 hour reception to ask for toilet paper. We recon they are so tight that they only leave one roll in the toilet at a time! Then we went for breakfast oh i wish we hadn't! YUK!! It was THE WORST BREAKFAST EVER!! when it arrived on our table it looked pathetic it was a spoonful of beans one bacon one egg (which you needed a steak knife to cut it with) and the tiniest sausage Ive ever seen. But then i actually tried it and i was nearly sick! it looked like it had all been reheated a 100 times! A breakfast well worth missing!!

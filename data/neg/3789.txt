I stayed in this monstrous hotel for 1 night in July 2011. The hotel is located in the red light district area. The hotel leases rooms in the hotel to local street prostitutes and clients (for 3 hrs) therefore making the place a revolving brothel. Whilst standing in the front reception area I personally witnessed the negotians between client , prostitute and management. The Rooms are very small and dingy, nil safe etc . The only highlight was the Sri Lankin cleaner who provided me with all the details or where to go into the City in order to vacate my presence from the Hotel. Do not stay here the room price is good but the whole experience is not worth it at all.

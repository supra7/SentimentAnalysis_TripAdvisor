The hotel is in a great location , but the service is the worst I 'vs encountered. Nicole and Alex are the front desk reception were rude, unprofessional, and unaccomodating, Nicole picked up the phone while I was trying to speak to her and Alex wouldN't let me finish my sentence. This hotel definitely lacks in customer service an etiquette.

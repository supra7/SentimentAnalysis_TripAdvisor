Staff were nice enough, rooms were normal, but nothing special. European feel to the hotel. Very strange hotel. Seemed that no other guests were there until 2:30am when were were awoken by our neighbors "bedroom" activities. Common areas were empty. Had a hard time finding the check-in desk, the pool, the door to the outside, the door to get back into the hotel. i guess the hotel needs more signs. There are these long weird corridors that you need to walk down to go anywhere. Hallways seem to go on forever and then have stairs every now and then with no ramps. Not recommended for people who have strollers, people who cannot walk far or climb stairs or who are in wheelchairs. Also was a very powerful aroma in the lobby areas (not in the rooms though) so not advised for people who are sentitive to perfumes. Rooms were acceptable but definitely not what the hotel website describes. Beds are nothing special, just a feather mattress pad over a plain old mattress. They look comfy but feel mediocre. Our 6th floor city view room was an up-close view of another building's roof "junk". Kept the drapes closed. Rust around tub drain and rust stains in the grout. Just rust, but still made me queasy when I had to bathe my toddler. Hair was stuck to the paint on the ceiling in the bathroom. Nice to have robes in the room though and the soaps were nice. Pool liner also seemed to be rust-stained. No hot tub. Overall, I was mostly horrified by the X-rated noises from the next-door room. I was with my mother and toddler for a Mother's Day weekend! This hotel is not as close to the attractions as others. We found one closer and quieter and left after one night.

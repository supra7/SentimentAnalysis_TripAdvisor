I picked this Hotel for our two day stay in Venice because we have a two year old and we did not want a Hotel that had water right next to it and we heard of the park like atmosphere of this Hotel. This is a very nice Hotel but the Best Western website does not show potential guests the extensive grafiti and almost slum like condition of the entire surounding area. On the walk back to the Hotel along the water is a burned out boat with a tv on top of it and other garbage that just sat there. I feel like I have been had. The breakfast was very good but I did not like the coffee so I asked for a expresso which was terrible. Also be advised that the earliest they serve dinner in Venice is 6:30 pm and there are very limited stores near by this Hotel to get foood, drinks or supplies.

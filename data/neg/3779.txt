If you are planning a trip to Istanbul it would be better to sleep in a park but not golden park. it's a creepy one, they will charge you for everything. they would steal from your minibar as long as the can. Except one of the receptions -i wish i knew his name-, others are horrible, they are everything but not friendly,specially the bigger one with eye glasses, the pool is about 3*4.5 m^2 but when it's as cold as the north pole ,the size is not a matter. each day we experienced several electricity problems. i was taking a shower and the electricity went off . i was asleep and it happened again, so then the air conditioner turned off, and now i have a cold. it's really dirty. it's located in a good place, near taksim square. the breakfast is delicious. but the orange juice tastes like hell. i never recommend this hotel to anyone. it was full of arabs .

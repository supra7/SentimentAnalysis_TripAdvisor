Dont even think of booking this crappy hotel, very rude staff including the whole management. Unexperienced reception, they could never help us no matter the situation. The hotel is extremely tiny and the rooms are incredibly small, you would think that for the amount of money you pay you would at least get free internet, NO its 15 Euros!. I stayed in 9 hotels during my 35 day vacation in europe and by far this was the worst. Breakfast is a total scam their was never space to sit and they would tell us to come back later, like if im going to be waiting around for an hour when im in rome for a short vacation. On top of that the few times we had a breakfast the food sucked, very bad bread, filthy eggs, artificial juice and the coffea was only good to spit out! Good location if you want to be in the center of the historical sites but very noisy, crowds of people at all times and to many street vendors hassasing you at all times. This hotel is extremely bad for the huge amount of money you have to pay, I have stayed in two star hotels where you get more out of your money. Dont you ever consider staying in this hotel or else your vacations will be a nightmare. Tripadvisor rules!

Trump stole my money !!!!!! I prepaid for the room before I arrived. They froze out 300 dollars for the typical Hotel room insurance. When I checked out, the room was left in perfect condition. They billed me for 93 dollars and anounced that the remaining dollars previously held were credited back to my account. I waited for 30 days and it was never credited back to my travel Card. Daniel, the front desk manger, said that he did but he lied to us. This is awful in these tight economic times.

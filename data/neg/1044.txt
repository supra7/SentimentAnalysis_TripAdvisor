I stayed for 5 days with a party of 3 others. On day 3 we received 2 towels but no other time during our stay did we get fresh linen. Stayed there because of the great location but on the second day upon returning to the hotel with my group, my pajama shirt was laid out on my bed with obvious semon on it!!!! upon returning home i noticed i only had 2 of the 6 pairs of underwear i had brought with me! As for the service we didn't have any. The beds were comfy but there is a bloody tampon under the bed on the east side of the room that remained there everyday we stayed. The elevators are TINY (3 normal sized people per elevator) and they are also used by cleaning staff so in the morning it's a wait game to get into one of the two elevators. Great place to stay if you like strangers bodily fluids in your room.

The Westin may be nice if nothing goes wrong with your billing. In our case, they overcharged us by about 600 dollars and I'm spending 3 months trying to get it reimbursed. Its next to impossible to reach someone to discuss the item and once when I thought it was settled, it really wasnt. The saga continues.

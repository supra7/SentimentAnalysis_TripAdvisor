Room burglarized while out of room for 3 hours during the day. Computer, wife's jewelry, Passport, Checkbook and other personal items stolen from locked room. Notified Seattle Police and Manager/Travelodge. Travelodge insurance would accept no liability for even a portion of loss. Rooms adequate, obviously security is a large concern.

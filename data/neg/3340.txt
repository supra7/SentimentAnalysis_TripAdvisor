My family and I planned a few days in the Dallas area a week before our stay. I have a friend who works for the company who gave me the friends and family rate before she left to go out of the country. I made reservations online with that rate, received a confirmation with the special rate. when my family arrived at night, the manager proceeded to tell us we had to have a form to fill out to get this rate. Long story short, he didn't budge. Total jerk! I couldn't get a hold of my friend, because she was out of the country. No where was it written on line that I'd have to have a form to get that rate. I would not have stayed at this hotel if I wasn't getting a good rate. Here's why- when you pull into the hotel, there are signs everywhere telling you to take in your personal belongings. Barbed wire cover the top of the fencing around the hotel, and to make matters worse, most rooms are not located inside the hotel. (outside entrance). It must be a very dangerous area, because the gas station across the street has bulletproof glass around the workers! If you are considering this hotel- reconsider!!! Go down the street a few blocks, and there are more hotels in better locations!! Lots of places to eat too. What happened to the customer always bring right?! This manager hasn't heard the end of me!

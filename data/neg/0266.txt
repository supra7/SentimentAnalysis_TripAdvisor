I recently stayed at this Mayflower Park hotel and it was a very uncomfortable experience from the get go. We were forced to valet park since that was our only option. All the bellman were too busy talking to each - other to notice us. The door was very heavy and older people would have a large struggle to get in. At the front the desk everything was very dis-organized. The man at the front desk who seemed to young to be the manager was talking to the other agents while they were trying to check in people. The way he talked to people was quite rude. There was another young man who left the front desk to help with luggage and answer questions. The "business center" is a joke where you have to stand since there are no chairs and wait for your documents to be printed at the front desk . The rooms are dusty and old . I dont understand how this place got such great reviews since this is why I stayed here but obviously these people are used to an econo lodge or something. Out dated decorations , no gift shop or drinks to be bought on site. The olivers bar is nice .

We were in Seattle for our wedding anniversary. When We booked our room I called prior to arrival to make sure that we had a water view. When we arrived to Edgewater we were a little worried with the decore. VERY rustic, strange fake trees every where in the lobby. Kind of dark? We received our room key and proceeded down a long creepy dingy, smelly,narrow hallway to our room. We were shocked to find out that we didn't have a water view! The room was so small there was barely room for a bed! Immediately I called the front desk I was told that they were out of waterview rooms. We were given an option of a room with 2 beds. The new room was normal in size. Nothing exciting. Needless to say totally disappointing. Will not be back and we are not recommending to family and friends. We had stayed 2 days prior at The Hyatt Place near the space needle. Now that's Awesome hotel! Book a room at the Hyatt and you wont be disappointed!!

So there's a fitness club and pool and a hot tub but no place other than your room to shower and change in between unless you want to travel 26 flights back up to your tiny overpriced room, where the two bottles of water cost $4.25 each and are warm because there's no fridge. They do allow you to shower in their "spa," but that costs you $10, on top of the $260 you're spending for the room. At least showering before entering the hot tub and pool aren't required, as there's no place to do it for what they call the "general public," which is how they refer to us who only pay top dollar for their services but who aren't "Gold Club Members." Probably makes for suboptimal hygiene but makes top dollar for Hilton, a company I will forever very happily boycott.

Normally the Park Plaza is relatively consistent and you can't beat its historic charm, but today they committed a foul. Their gym is closed due to water damage and they offered ZERO discounted alternatives with over half a dozen local gyms nearby? In this day and age, many of us live for our workout on the road. Paying $20 drop in fee because my hotel's gym is out of service didn't sit well.

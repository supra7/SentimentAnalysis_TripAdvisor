I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend at the time for 2 nights on Valentines Day, it was okay, but INCREDIBLY overpriced for what you get. You can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the room next door, all night we could hear the couple next door having sex, it was horrible. I accidently left a dress still with tag on in the closet and when I called the next day to have them hold it for me, they said it was no longer there and housekeeping checked the closet and never found it...liars and thieves!!! Also, I needed to get my cell phone which I left in my car, the valet service offered to go get it, which was VERY nice, HOWEVER, the guy left my light on and caused my battery to die, which in turn took the valet 30 minutes to get my car once we needed it in the morning. I would DEFINETLY stay somewhere else and not waste my money here....ps bathrooms crappy!

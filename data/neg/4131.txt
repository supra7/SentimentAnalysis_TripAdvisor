the only good thing about this place is location. The room I stayed in was terrible... not very nice and paint chipping, etc. I also had a mouse running around in my room and the hotel employees did not respond to my problems well at all. They did not apologize for what happened and I had a rude receptionist yelling at me for requesting a room change and for requesting a non-smoking room on another floor. The new room they gave me had headboards missing as well as broken blinds and dresser. I wanted to leave but that process was painful and I have yet to get my money back.

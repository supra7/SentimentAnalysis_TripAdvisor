Asked for a quiet room and was given room at very front on main road which was noisy as hell! As I arrived at midnight and was dead tired didn't have the energy to go and ask for a room change. Room smelled foul and air conditioner was noisy. Also, took at least 20 minutes of running the hot water tap in the shower before it was even luke warm! Sheets on bed were stained, didn't match and smelled horrible. Pillows were lumpy. Definitely dodgy!

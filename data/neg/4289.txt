My spouse and I stayed one night so we could see the Boston Pops Christmas concert. We arrived early and a room was ready, but not the one we specially asked for. We had asked for a corner room with floor to ceiling windows of the city. We got a room with a view of the rooftop of the neighboring Sheraton. No nice windows, no nice view. We decided not to talk to the desk about it and move on, now I wish we had. This Hilton has no members lounge for carded members, so there is no complimentary breakfast or cocktails. The two business stations in the lobby are free to use, but Internet in the rooms, and any additional channels (even music) are charged. When we checked out the next day, the bill for room charges was 20 extra than what we had on our reservation. I brought down the original reservation and it took some time for the front desk to straighten it out. They kept correcting the bill but adding charges, so it was frustrating. They werent very apologetic about it, I felt like I was bothering them. That is why I wish now I had complained about the room because it was out wedding anniversary and had made special requests. I would try the Sheraton or Colonnade next time and compare services. They are all in the same place. Other Hiltons in the area have so much to offer and I think this one is just older and doesnt have the same. So in comparison, you may be disappointed. I was.

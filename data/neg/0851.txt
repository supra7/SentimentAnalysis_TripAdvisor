First of all, the Seattle Westin is abjectly mediocre. And completely bland. And not as clean as it should be for a pre-paid 170 bucks a night. At least my room wasn't. I really was not digging the hair in the bathroom and unidentified objects under the sofa at all, among other things. The interior designer (and I use that term loosely) seemed to be going for cheesy '80's Roman-Greco, complete with plastic (yes, plastic) urn. The furniture was pretty cheap-looking, as well. Okay, now the gross part: There was a coffeemaker in the room. There were packets of Starbucks coffee and those tiny containers of half & half next to the coffeemaker. One might assume the half & half would be fresh, right? Uh, wrong. I made some coffee and added three containers of half & half which I proceeded to drink before I noticed the fourth container was actually open and full of mold. So apparently those containers had been sitting there for several days. Which made me wonder about the towels and the bedding. And the carpet and the toilet and the bathtub. To say that this hotel is not up to Westin standards is a huge understatement.

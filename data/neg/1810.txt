Worst stay at a hotel I've had. Or can I say that since I never got to stay there. When we tried to check in they told us that there were no more rooms avaliable, strange since we booked it 4 months in advance and no one ever mention anything to us. Instead they put us up at the Royal Kahana and told us that we would be upgraded to a one bedroom from a studio and that they would credit us one nights stay. Bate and switch. We accecpted but were not thrilled since we had booked the Eldorado so we could walk to the beach and restaurants in Kanapali. We also now had to keep are car rental the whole week and pay for parking in Kanapali. But to make matters worse, when we got to the other hotel the check in card said studio on it, not one bedroom. I asked the girl checking us in what type of room it was and she strait out lied to me saying it was a one bedroom, it was not. The final kicker, this was last year and to this day we have not been credited back any nights stay. We hated the Royal Kahana, checked out 2 nights early and stayed at a lovely B&B almost at the base of Haliakula. I will never again book through hotels.com or an Outrigger Hotel.

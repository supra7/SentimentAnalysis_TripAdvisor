My friend and myself stayed at this Hotel October 15-19th. I was very disappointed in the hotel. You had to use 2 separate elevators to get to the ground floor. The information packet said the hotel had a jacuzzi and public internet acces, neither which was true. The pool was on the 6th floor and you had to take 3 flights of stairs to get to it. The walls and doors where very thin. Early in the morning you could hear the breakfast carts rolling down the hall and it would wake us up. The drinks at the bar were way too expensive. There wasn't anything close by to do except for Centerfolds. If you wanted to watch a movie it was $12. The TV was small. We checked our bags on the first day with the doorman and we didn't get our bags until and hour later. The only highlight of the hotel was the consiere service. They gave out great directions and free passes to Centerfolds.

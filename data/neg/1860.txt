It was a free stay as i was on transit...but i must say it was the most horrible nite of my whole vacation...we couldnt sleep at all!!! the room was stinking like sewage, garbage, i dunno wat but the smell was really strong! and the constant noise from the airport nearby...we couldnt sleep at all! since we were put there free of costs by emirates we didnt bother to make any complaint etc. the tv channels were all arabic channels...wat about us poor people who dont understand any arabic!!! o_O ... the bathroom was strictly OK..thank gid it was clean but again that foul smell was there!!! Also the decor of the room is sooo ollllddd...not at all like wat we saw on the hotel's websites...the most shocking part is that they dont provide with shower gels but simply soap bars!!!! thats absolutely ridiculous!!! the next day we had breakfast...i didnt eat much coz choice was limited and there was a strong smell of food...as for the staff they were OK...i cant say i hold them to my heart... I must say i was praying wen i will get out of there!! wen i was told that i will be put at a hotel for the lenghthy transit, i thought that maybe on my next visit i mite stay there n that the free stay will be like a 'trailer' ...but trust me i'll NEVER stay there and i would not recommend any1 to stay there either! Adios!!!!

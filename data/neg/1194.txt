terrible place to stay This hotel does not deserve to be called a Red Lion Hotel. I have stayed at Red Lion Hotels throughout the West and never have I had such a miserable experience. The hotel should not be open until it is completely renovated. It doesn't deserve even a one star rating because it is so run down. Unsuspecting guests book rooms on line and credit cards are billed immediately for the duration of the visit. Terrible place to stay!! The service is lousy and the rooms are dismal and dirty! Our shower had mold in it. It seems that many of the customers are placed there for one night stays as part of package deals before they leave on one of the alaskan cruises. All the guests we met were complaining. Even their $50 printer in the lobby was broken in the small communication center. They advertise that breakfast goes with the hotel booking and when you get there you find out that you won't receive one. There is no restaurant associated with the place as it is shut down. The hotel should be shut down as well.

This is one hotel I will not stay in even for free. Rooms are small, beds are small single beds (makes you wonder why they even bother furnishing the room with 2 beds..) And neon pink, green... everywhere!! The room gave me headache from day 1 itself. Company had conference there due cheap rates and that is all there is to this hotel. Wifi line kept dropping at the conference hall. On 2nd day, they served the same dessert from day 1, and it was stale!! When we confronted the hotel staffs, we were told it was made fresh but they themselves refused to taste it. Even though it is near outran and tiong bahru, walking to the nearest let is not a smart decision as the hotel is on a hill side. A simple fish and chips at the hotel restaurant took more than 1/2 hour to be served and when they serve it, the fish was over fried.

We selected this hotel based on Trip Advisor. Never again will we make the same mistake. Trip advisor did not show that there was a Hampton Inn right in the same block, which is likely a much better choice. There was little "quality" about this "inn," which was filled to the rafters with tour bus groups and the cleanliness left much to be desired. Breakfast was like a manic feeding frenzy of folks who were acting like it was thier last meal before a famine.

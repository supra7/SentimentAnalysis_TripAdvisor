This place was beyond horrible! My boyfriend and I are thrifty shoppers and look for bargains, but also completely expect to get what we pay for. However, the Royalton is an exception to that rule! To start, we booked our room thru Booking.com and brought our reservation confirmation to check in. They charged us an extra $10 stating, "That's what the price is, those website's mess up all the time." No "sorry" or even an ill fated attempt to honor the printed price. Onto the room... I don't know how they can get away with charging for a "hotel room" that is essentially a room in an attic! We had dormers and sloped ceilings with exposed rafters. The lack of insulation proved to be the reason why the tiny, cheap air condition that was turned to its coldest setting for the entire 4 day weekend did nothing to cool the room! We were in the room for a couple of hours, sweating, when we realized that it wasn't going to get any cooler. We walked the 3 stories down to the desk (because there are no in-room phones to call from) to complain, and they graciously lent us a box fan. Great. Thanks. They said they could move us the next nite because that nite was booked. However, first thing in the morning the next day when we inquired, they said the rooms had been sold out. It seemed there were plenty of rooms that featured balconys as you could clearly see from the outside, but we were obviously mislead and taken advantage of based on the room they stuck us in. There was 1 dirty, grimy chair in the room and a puny dresser to serve as our only surface area in the entire room. The bathroom sink was not even large enough to rest a tube of toothpaste on. There was a fairly large closet stuffed under the low end of the sloped ceiling, however no bar to hang anything on it... useless. We would never consider staying at this place again! Spend the couple extra bucks to avoid it!

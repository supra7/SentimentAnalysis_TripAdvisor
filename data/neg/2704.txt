This hotel is great if you are used to warmer climates and tiny single rooms, single room was so small i thought i was in a cupboard, but it was great as I needed to lose aq few pounds and it had no air condictioning thus was about 100.F at all times, you could open the small window and listen to the street noise or workman below, very handy if you are deaf. may also be good for sailors as bed was on a slope and rolled about, thus like being on a ship. Come to think of it, best way to describe a single room is sleeping in hot engine room to an old steam ship in a storm. wifi works if wind in the correct direction for periods of 5 seconds in every hour. sorry almost forgot about breakfast, you need to go down the steepest stairs (like a ladder) to the basement where you will wished you had not.

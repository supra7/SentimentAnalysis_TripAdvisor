As far as service, like most hotels, some employees are better than others and you are a bit disappointed when those that exceed your expectations are not working the next shift. The room resembled a cheap Ikea room, harsh minimalist, linear, without softness or curves, reminiscent of modern dorm room. The carpet was of dorm room quality complete with stains. Shower was pretty decent. This bed was adequate, not the best, but this hotel is a step down from the others in Starwood chain. It is noisy because of the airport, it is an airport hotel. Rooms do include a safe, internet/docking station, and mini-fridge. They give a complimentary bottle of water, which was not replenished during my stay. Computer printer available to print boarding passes. There is very limited food selection near front desk and at the bar at night, very limited options. Bartender was very nice, but there was an obvious fruit fly problem. Did not try pool/fitness area. Location is very far away from downtown/attractions. Take the 747 bus, a cab is around $50! It is one thing to advocate a "relaxed" culture but dressing sloppy and eating your meals at the front desk is just unprofessional. There are other hotels in the same price point and lower that offer more services. I would pass on this one.

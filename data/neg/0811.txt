My husband and I stayed at the Westin for an anniversary weekend in May. The view from our room on the 42nd floor was amazing. For the price of the room we were very disappointed with the cleanliness (there was dust on everything when we arrived), and the quality. There were no local TV channels on the television, there was only one bedside table in the room also. We had to move furniture to get full benefit of the view of the Seattle skyline. At the time we were there the swimming pool wasn't available to use, they were providing taxi's to another Sheraton for those who wanted to use a pool. The lobby was blocked off the whole weekend and was difficult to navigate around things while they were laying down carpet. We were within walking distance to many activities which was nice. When we come back again we will definitely chose a different hotel.

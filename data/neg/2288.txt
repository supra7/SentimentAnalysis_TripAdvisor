I have used priceline to book hotels almost exclusively, and I have never had a problem. This was the first hotel that I can say I would NEVER stay in again. The hotel staff was nice enough, though they wouldn't let us check in even a little bit early and I had a business meeting to go to. They WERE nice enough to let me use their bathroom though. The floors of this hotel (hallways especially) are filthy! I felt dirty the entire time I was there. I brought my own sheets and pillow cases based on some reviews I read after the hotel was booked, and I'm so glad I did. The chair had a very disgusting stain on it, the kitchen and bathroom were ok. The room itself wasn't awful, but it had a really strange smell, and it was a nonsmoking room. The worst part was that someone had put trash in the stairwell (which had trash cans in it, so it wasn't a big deal) and the trash wasn't taken away for THREE days! It smelled awful. Although I love Philly and didn't want my vacation to end, I was more than happy to leave that hotel, and I will not be going back.

Think of a modern prison cell: stark. Window you cannot open, no curtains (roller blind only, which only rolls half way up) blank walls except a tv bolted 5 feet up, the angle of which cannot be altered. And tiny, 2 inch thick pillows. No bedside tables. Lights behind bedstead don't work. Bathroom so small that if you breathe in while sitting on toilet, your chest simultaneously digs into roll holder and sink. No bath. Positives: air con; clean. I won't be visiting a travel lodge again; I am certain that for a few pounds more, you can do much much better.

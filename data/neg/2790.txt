Arrived in the evening, but had no worry of losing room as this dump was literally empty. Right near the bridge that goes over to Arkansas. Since we arrived late we assumed we'd be stuck in a room facing the screeching non-stop traffic. Fortunately we were placed in the back of the motel. This alone did not help our experience. First impression of this dank and dark room was the overwhelming toxic smell of bleach. Although this would give the impression of cleanliness, too much of such smell is also nauseating. Bathroom ceiling was so low I thought I'd have to amputate my legs in order to stand in the shower and I'm not that tall. The clorox stench gave no comfort as the pulling back of the comforter proved to be very UN-CLEAN. Stains, bloody galore or whatever it was. Carpets seemed gritty. Just afraid for all personal hygiene. Even though we had driven all day we wanted to get out for any reason not to stay in the room. Went to downtown Beale St, nice area. Passed Sun Studio and Graceland but came back reluctantly as fatigue wore us down. At least we'd get some rest. WRONG! In the middle of the night, the power to the hotel seemed to have been turned off and our heater as well. Woke up in shivers! Woke up early, checked out and discovered we were charged slightly higher rate than from internet. Felt it wasn't worth complaining about even though it was sub-standard comfort. Drive away from this place FAST!!

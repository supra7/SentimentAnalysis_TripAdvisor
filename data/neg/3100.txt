If you are not claustrophobic This is a popular business hotel with the Japanese and tourists from SE Asia. The hotel is north of the red light district (Kabuki Cho) in a semi-residential setting. Which poses some problems:You always have to go through the red light district. It is by no means unsafe or too intimidating, however. There is no shop within 5-10 minutes walking distance, and you might have to wait for a while if you want to hail a cab.The main concern though is the size of the rooms. They are extremely small. For the double room we were in, the bed is right against 2 walls, with about 1 foot of empty space on the foot end, and about 2 feet on the open side, which also accommodates a desk and chair :) If you have some full-size suitcases, I am not sure where you can put them. The bathroom is not too small by Japanese standard, as it is modular.Finally, the in-room temperature was not adjustible and we were being cooked, because it's winter time.If you get a good rate and don't spend anytime in the room except to sleep, it's OK.P.S. I hope you are an earlier bird because the tourists got rowdy getting up in the morning.

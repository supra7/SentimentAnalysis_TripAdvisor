We have stayed here several times in the past with good results. This time was different. I booked a room on the concierge floor for my wife's birthday. We were out late the night before going to a show. The maids began banging on our door at 8:30 asking if they could make up our room, and continued doing so even after being told we were still in the room. We went for the concierge breakfast at 9:40 There were no eggs, no granola, and no yogurt. When my wife asked for more, she was told there wasn't going to be any more, since "we're closing in five minutes." (breakfast was until 10am). At 9:55, the woman running the breakfast removed the little remaining food, in spite of the fact a number of people were just coming in.

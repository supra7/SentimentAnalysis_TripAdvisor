If you are going to Las Vegas to gamble I would stay FAR AWAY from the El Cortez. I have been going to Las Vegas for years and have NEVER experienced machines tighter then in this place. There are signs hanging all over the casino telling you how "loose" their machines are, but as I experienced first hand this could not be further from the truth. Do you like cops? If not then don't stay at the El Cortez. Why? Because they are everywhere. However not for your security, but to keep the riffraff out of the place. When we stayed there last week we watched the police kicking in the door at the Motel 6 across the street along with several other arrests we saw in just a short 3 day stay. If you plan on visiting Las Vegas to gamble BEWARE of the El Cortez!!

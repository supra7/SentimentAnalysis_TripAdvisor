I received a serious, poisonous spider bite, most likely from a black widow, as it had neurotoxic effects. When I wrote the hotel about it, they denied it could have happened there. Yet, I was sleeping on a roll-away bed in the room that may have been stored somewhere where the spider could have hidden. Also, the housekeeping staff left the window open every day, and there are no screens on the window. The hotel did not take my complaint seriously at all. DO NOT STAY HERE.

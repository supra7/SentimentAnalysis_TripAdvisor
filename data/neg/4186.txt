As I looked at the cobwebs hanging in the corners of my room and the gray corners of my carpeting in need of a vacuum, I decided to see if the nearby Radison had any space left. When they didn't, I sat on my bed and cried. I even asked the management if I could borrow a few cleaning supplies but none appeared. There is no climate control for each room (that is run centrally), as I pushed the mattress back on my box springs each night, I sighed and reminded myself that my business conference would only last a week.

We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with a wedding party and was sorely disappointed. They upgraded us to a junior suite. The room was clean, but a little run down. The AC system wasn't working well - after 3 hours of closing the drapes and running it at 60 degrees, it was still hot. Even the bridal suite was hot. We requested items from the front desk like a menu and toothpaste/mouthwash that never came. We had no hot water, but someone did come up to fix it, which took an hour. There was a wrong charge on our bill, and the desk fixed that, but they offered no concessions for any of the other problems we encountered. All in all, we were very disappointed - we expected a lot better from a Hilton.

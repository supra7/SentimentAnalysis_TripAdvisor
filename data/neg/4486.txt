Hotel was nice and most of the staff was great. Billing was terrible, they charged the wrong rate for the room, I had to get it corrected and when I got home and received a credit card statement they charged for a day they said my reservation started. They never said anything about this charge while I was there nor was it on my bill when I checked out. Bad business practice, I've never stayed at a hotel that tried this trick.

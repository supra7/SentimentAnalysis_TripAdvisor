We stayed at the above property on 7 November for 2 nights to attend an exhibition in London. There is no one on site and keys are collected via a safe with a code provided. One of the keys did not fit and was for the wrong apartment. The rooms are a reasonable size, but the sofa was dirty, the walls are scuffed, the bed linen and towels are very old and thin. The matress was also old and lumpy. There is also construction work going on next door woith workman starting around 6.30 onwards For 150 per night the apartments do not affer good value for money and need serious upgrading.

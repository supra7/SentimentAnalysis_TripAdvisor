Great boutique hotel - we've stayed here before several times and loved it. HOWEVER, they're building across the street, which isn't the big problem, although a bit noisy. The big problem is the city of Chicago is doing street repair in the middle of the night. We were there the weekend of April 20, 2007 and at midnight the jack-hammers were still pounding. When I managed to fall asleep, at 1:30 am, I was woken by the noise again. It went on all night. Since we were staying the weekend - management moved us to another Kimpton hotel, but what a hassle. Again - great hotel, but wait before you go. We heard from one hotel employee this has been going on for a while and is going to continue...for a year! Go only if you can sleep through anything.

Waiting for 45 minutes for an elevator to get off the 21st floor with two young children is pure misery. We called down to the front desk and they said they would send someone up for us in the service elevator - no one every did show up. We finally squeezed into an elevator going up and stopped at every floor where others were waiting for the elevator (too bad for them, there was no room in the elevator). When we reached the top floor, we then went back down to the lobby stopping at every floor and saying 'sorry' to everyone else waiting. This was the story every time we went up and down in the elevator - ridiculous. I also found the concierge and the front desk staff to be quite rude. Instead of offering my kids the welcome package, I had to ask. And when I asked, I got a roll of the eyes and an 'I'll check if there are any' answer. Westin should not promote such amenities if they don't do it willingly and voluntarily. Parking was also a whopping $43 for valet and $41 for self-park. Good thing the parking just across the street is $22. We will never be staying at this hotel again.

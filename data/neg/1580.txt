This place was a real disappointment. We'd booked for 5 nights but checked out after our first. It's basically a mass market resort located in a section of beach which is totally unswimmable (shallow water, jagged rock and coral). They have a huge pool area which is pretty nice, but the atmosphere was ruined by a weird and rowdy crowd (bizarre mix of families and spring-break types), and terrible live music (think bad eric clapton covers followed by awkward, forced clapping). They also require you to present a 'towel card' to at the cabana and wear wrist bands like children to identify yourself as a member of the hotel which really cheapens the experience. The overall vibe is more club-med New Jersey than maui paradise. As far as the room is concerned - we had a 'partial ocean view' which turned out to be totally dark and depressing. The only reason why we didn't rate our experience as terrible is because the service here was really fantastic - from the valets right through the front desk and management who let us out of the balance of our stay when we said we were unhappy with the property. They were very professional and understanding and deserve kudos.

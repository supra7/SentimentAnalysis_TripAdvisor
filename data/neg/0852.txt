This hotel is pretty low priced but be prepared for a couple of things. Firstly the staff are kind of strange. The first was so desperate for conversation she wouldn't let me go to my room, the second tried to convert me to their own political ideology and would direct me to the nearest Starbucks as they were too corporate. The third wouldn't even raise their head to even acknowledge my existence. That coupled with the ancient decor and general dark feel of a prison with brown flaky walls made for a very interesting stay. Not horrible but I wont be going back.

After the hotel was fully booked and confirmed, we arrived and they forced us to pay an additional MANDATORY $15 (plus tax) a day charge for nonsense like using the pool, newspaper in the room, and useless stuff that are automatically included with every other hotel. You have no option to decline this fee, and I think It's absolutely ridiculous. Then, they claim to be "steps away from the strip", but they're more like a 20 minute walk away from the strip. Also, ALL of their rooms have only ONE bed and an uncomfortable pullout bed. Lastly, we had a very loud and constant whistling noise in our room, as if the windows were leaking wind noise. Overall, considering that it was supposed to be 5 star resort, I think it sucked REAL REAL REAL bad.

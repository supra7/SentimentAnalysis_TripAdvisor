We stayed in the North tower, on the side facing away from the ocean. Online, it looked like it would be a great place to stay while on vacation. However, the room we stayed in was otherwise; it was narrow and cramped, the bathtub wouldn't properly fill and empty water, and the toilet took some effort to flush-- overall, the main utilities of the room were in very poor-functioning condition. I'll also ad that the hallways were dirty; there were dark stains dotted on the carpet and the place looked dusty and dirty. We also had people in the next room who were extremely loud and disruptive during the nighttime, and it took us a few hours before hotel staff would finally do anything about them.

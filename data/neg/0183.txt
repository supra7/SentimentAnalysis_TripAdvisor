Upon check-in at 12:30 am I was issued a 'parlor' portion of a suite with a single roll away cot as my bed. I was traveling on business with 5 other and had invited my husband to come along. They 'kindly' wheeled in another cot 45 minutes later. When I argued at the desk the Priceline guarantees a BED that is double or 2 twins they stated they can do whatever they like since I used Priceline. The customer service was horrendous and I don't care not to relive the experience here but I travel using Priceline hotels 2 times a week on average throughout the entire US and this was by far the worst I've ever seen. I truly loved Priceline and embrace the risk of bidding because often the reward of a luxury 5 star hotel for $70 a night is well worth it. I'm now a bit sour based on this hotel. Needless to say the 2nd day our toilet exploded (yes, not just an overflow) and the 3rd the elevators broke with no ETA on a fix we were instructed to walk the 26 flights of stairs to our room.

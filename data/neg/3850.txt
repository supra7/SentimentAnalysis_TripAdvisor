I am an Elite Marriott member and have stayed in Marriott properties in major cities around the world. The Boston Marriott Copley Place is the dirtiest Marriott property I've ever stayed in. There was hair in the bathrooms (stuck to the ceiling, light fixtures, shower curtain and floor), dust on the hair dryer and wood moldings... the bathroom door was splattered with many unidentifiable sprays and gunk... I was afraid to touch it and used a washcloth to wipe it down. The King size sleeping room on the 15th floor didn't have wireless Internet access and there was no breakfast room service menu to hang on the door at night nor was there an in-room dining menu for other times of the day. Being that I was in the city on business, these things aren't necessary luxuries but necessities while I am working and attending meetings. At $12.95/day the internet was just slow and the cable was broken. In other areas -- the main hallways were frigid -- so cold that our guests from warmer climates were shivering in the elevators. And, might I say that the only other Marriott with slower elevator service is the Marriott Marquis in Times Square, NY. I certainly hope this hotel gets its act together soon, the location cannot be beat but there are so many other options in the area that I won't be returning anytime soon.

I have stayed at several cheap and low budget motels and hotels in Ocean City before, and this has to be the worst of the worst out of all of them. The only good thing I can say about this place is that it is located right on the board walk and they have HBO. Other than that you are best staying anywhere else in OC. I got physically ill staying the night at this place. There are no refunds for this place; they dont clean the rooms before you enter them. They pretty much just kinda organize it before you get in. I found a screw driver and a bowl under the bed and an old noodle soup inside the microwave. The Microwave doesnt work there is no remote for the TV but you have a choice of over 300 channels and it resets to channel 3 every time it turns off. The room is supposed to accommodate up to 6, but its best for no more than 2 or 3 at most. The pull out couch is in the way of the bathroom door so people who want to use the bathroom will have to climb over you to enter and the couch is the most awful filthy thing. The entire room is tiny and somehow the walls and roof are all uneven. There are stains everywhere and the rooms are very dusty and dirty. The AC unit is very low to the wall so whoever sleeps by it will get cold air blown on them all night. The AC unit is very dirty and isnt installed correctly; you can see through cracks in the wall by the AC unit outside so bugs can it in from outside. The ceiling and walls have water stains. During my stay the toilet over flowed and it took them forever to fix it and we had to clean up the flooded bathroom. Overall the pictures speak for themselves.

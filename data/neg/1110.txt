Expecting the Doubletree name to be better quality. The room was okay, but not as clean as one would expect. And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge! Our room was reserved well in advance, with no mention of a parking fee for their guests! Shame on you Doubletree for charging your own guests to pay to park on your site during their stay. I will not stay in a Doubletree again.

Awful - could not wait to leave This was by far the worst vacation experience i have ever had. We warned by our travel agent that this was a new hotel and everything might not be open for our trip but I never imagined it could be so bad. Upon 1st arrival they did not have our reservation in their system and it took an hour to straighten that out and the manager was very rude. The when we finally get to our room it just had a foul odor, which I thought maybe I could just get used to. The room is beautiful but had exposed wires, broken tiles, back door didn't lock, A/C worked intermittently, and mosquitoes bit us all night as we slept. And then when you take a shower it floods the room. We called to have someone look at the door and AC but no one ever came and were told the slding doors all had the wrong locks. As for the food it was horrible - buffet was cold and the french place was horrendous. The positives were the wait and bar staff, all were very friendly but the bar had only one beer available - Presidente. The beach and pool were nice. Stay away from this place until it matures - it has potential but right now it is a mess.

We stayed for two nights in late May 2011. We requested a quiet room as the hotel is located above a bar that is open well into the early hours of the morning. We recieved one that was well away from the bar. However, when we got to our room, we found that we could hear the conversation of those in the room next to us. Not just muffled noises, actual conversations, and we could easily work out what channel they were watching on their TV. Only stay here if you are comfortable hearing ring tones of phones in the room next to yours. The hotel ticked a few other the boxes - cheap price, clean hotel, nice size for Sydney hotels, and a reasonable location. But, be prepared to also pay for lots of add-ons - such as a $50 deposit on arrival, charges for holding bags, and a $10/hour late checkout fee. We will not stay here again.

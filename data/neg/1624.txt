Well we just got back to Honolulu and was grateful that we didn't stay longer than the three days we decided on in Maui. First the rooms are old, you can here everything from neighbouring rooms, kids screaming in the passage ways with just as obnoxious parents. Buffett breakfast (what) saw the lines to get down there was lunch time by the time we would of got to the bottom of the stairs. They now have a mini bar that is like a set of scales you take something off it and it is billed to your room straightaway, so anyone with kids, be careful, you move it you pay for it, no bottled water, only the ones you move off the mini bar, my point here is that for a basic room with super basic amenities adding the cost of the room, plus the 12% room tax and then on top of that there is a stupid resort fee, hang on I thought we paid that when you actually decided to stay there in the first place, but wait there is more, food overpriced and cold, the worst margarita ever, tasted like water with a dash of lemon juice, we got up at 6am to have breakfast at the buffet to at least get one in, even then the lines are getting big, in this day and age most huge places have more than one restwaurant to pick from, Outrigger on the Beach, Waikiki, is excellent your vouchers entilte you to three different restaurants, wake up Hyatt, will never use Hyatt again.......oh and the bathroom is so small that you step in and have to turn right around to shut the door

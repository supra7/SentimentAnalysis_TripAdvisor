Having arrived after a long flight were disgusted to be given a room in which someone had slept in the bed! and kindly urinated in the toilet without flushing it.After complaining and some considerable time we were eventually allocated another tiny room which had body fluid stains on the duvet-dont ask use your imagination uck but we could no longer be bothered to move again.A real shame because in general the staff wanted you to have a good time but cleanliness is everything to me I am afraid and I dont want to get into someone elses bed!

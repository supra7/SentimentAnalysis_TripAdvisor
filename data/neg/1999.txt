TRUMP is extremely poor in guest service, and irresponsible. I would never refer anyone to this hotel, unless you want to go through my experience. I booked the hotel from Expedia. Two night's fee is charged by Expedia (TOTAL $207.22). When we checked in on 12/27/2009, Trump charged an additional "RESORT FEE" for $15.00 + TAX per night. "RESORT FEE" includes "VALET PARKING" (TOTAL $33.60). NOTE: TRUMP has no SELF PARKING. they charge $15.00 plus tax per day as resort fee, it includes valet parking. That night we went out for dinner and got back to hotel around 8:30 PM. By 10:15 PM, TRUMPS security manager Doug Deal called our room and requested to come to our room to explain something. He mentioned valet parking boy made a dent on our brand new car, (which was just bought a month ago) when parking our car. We asked to go to the parking lot to see the car immediately. Mr. Deal took us to P3 level where our car was parked (as TRUMP has no self parking), through an employee only elevator to see our car. We took pictures of our car. Mr. Deal gave a claim report with following information: ==================== REPORT# 122709 - 1287 security officer: DOUG DEAL TRUMP HOTEL 2000 FASHION SHOW DR. LAS VEGAS, NV 89109 PHONE: 702-982-0000 FAX: 702-476-7975 ==================== and mentioned the procedure of the claim should be: (1) contact insurance company (2) get the car repaired (3) claim to their office through the above info Mr. Deal mentioned several times that they felt sorry for what happened and ensured us they will be responsible for the accident. Finally, he said he can ask their hotel manager to talk to us if we are still upset. As Mr. Deal is very polite and makes sure TRUMP will pay for the car repair, and we think since it is Christmas holidays, we do not want to spend more time dealing with this unpleasant event. After we came back from the trip, we took our car to our insurance company, ALLSTATE, to report the accident and got an estimate for $998. We had our car fixed in January. Then ALLSTATE sent out the claim to TRUMP on 1/20. On 2/17, my insurance company ALLSTATE informed me that TRUMP refused to pay for the repair, since we gave our key to them, which means we are willing to let them operate our car, WE have to be obligated to pay for the repair. This is totally different from what their security manager, DOUG DEAL, told us!!! TRUMP is the hotel I will never stay again, also will never refer to anyone I know!

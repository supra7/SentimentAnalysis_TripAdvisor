Not the Renaissance I expected. First, the concierge was worthless. one morning I simply asked for a pack of matches.... simply hotel request, right? I was "educated" by this guy that the hotel was a smoke free property and that the hotel did not provide any matches. Keep in mind the hotel gift shop sells cigarettes and there are two smoking areas on the property. Good thing I didn't ask for anything important like a taxi or dinner reservations! I mentioned it to the front desk and ..... guess what...... more grief! More explanation, more defensiveness. So much for customer service from the renaissance. Second, the property is directly located on I-5, sixteens lanes of bustling traffic right in front of the hotel. How much relaxation do you think you're gonna get on your vacation or during your business trip? Third, the Renaissance is an old structure. Recent renovations are obvious.... a little too obvious. They really cut corners to save a dime, where hinged doors once were, cheap sliding doors now cover the bathrooms-problem is there are large gaps.... you really want a bathroom door to close, completely.... right? There are still signs of the old building: smelly old carpet, formica counter-tops. There are many wonderful hotels in Seattle, this is not one of them.

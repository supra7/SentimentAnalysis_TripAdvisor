I travel about every week for business and stay in the Hilton/Hilton chain for the points and usually my stays are fine there. This was my first and last time at the Hilton downtown Miami. Where do I start? Checking was fine and the room view was outstanding...that's the good. Valet service is god awful. There Is a dedicated attendant in a booth working but she doesn't pick up her phone...what's the point. Then when I got my car 10 minutes later the attendent just handed me my keys and walked away...a total joke. The room,...bathroom had hair on the sink and tub. The ventilation system (not the ac) was loud and could not be turned off...I am not the type that needs total silence to sleep but I was counting the days to get the he'll outta here. I was 5 rooms away from the elevator and the noise in the hall of just the elevator was annoying. I asked to change rooms and was met with attitude and a "check back later, we have no rooms left". I just smiled and went to work. You need to take an elevator to get to the registration. Then after registration you need to walk to a different set of elevators across the hotel to get to your room. A design genius put this hotel together clearly. My lesson! All Hiltons are not the same. I will be back on business in Miami soon and am damn sure I'm not staying here. Don't make the same mistake I did.

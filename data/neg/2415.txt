Wanted to get away from the 107 degree heat in Phoenix and looked forward to a cool, tranquil weekend - HA! At 6 am Saturday we were shocked out of our sleep by a Band's drums. A triathlon was set up right next to the hotel. We could not walk on the sidewalks around the hotel because they were full of marathon runners - and this went on for HOURS because participants finished each part of the triathlon at varied times. upon contacting Stephanie at the front desk, she only pointed out how it was located there so they could advertise the hotel as a place to stay. Indeed this is true because I saw an ad from Courtyard on the SDTrClassic website offering them $115 a night rate. The lobby coffeeshop was also hoped to get more business. In other words, us regular customers paying full price were considered not as important as these rude runners. There was not even a place to park in the lot if you left and came back and entrances to the hotel were blocked so guests had to wait in a long line to come and go. All they would have had to do was have the event a little further down - many acres available as this is the former navy training and housing facility. ABSOLUTELY POOR MANAGEMENT!!!

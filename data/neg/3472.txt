There was a large event in the lounge area taking place when my husband I were staying here for a wedding we went to in downtown Dallas. The event was so loud and disruptive, with security attending to some sort of situation. I've stayed at this hotel before over the course of 5 years and it was always peaceful and upscale. Not the case this time. Along with the fact the hotel keys weren't working and they had to have maintenance meet us at our room to let us in everytime. Not a pleasant experience.

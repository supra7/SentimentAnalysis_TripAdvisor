Have just returned from Chicago where I stayed at the Palmer Hilton for business. Whilst situated in down town chicago, with a five min access to to Lake Michagin and near shops etc, I wouldn't recommend staying here. The entrance is fabulous and the internal lobby spectacular but that is where it stops. The rooms whilst kept clean are small, pokey and very dated in terms of decor. The desk staff surly and unhelpful. We were a group of about 30 and there were numerous -- with the rooms, some of us ended up sleeping on couches in the lounge as they had rebooked our rooms out on our first night. Billing was a problem and most had numerous issues with internet access. No real view from the rooms. At the latter part of our stay some of us moved and you can get get far better hotels with a lake view rooms and modern clean decor at a far cheaper price. In addition at what 4-5 star hotel do you have you pay for the gym or pool. Wouldn't stay here again and the other 29 would also agree.

I decided to stay at this hotel after hearing from a work colleague that it was a great place to stay, on the waterfront in Seattle. Before booking my stay, I checked out the website. Talk about misleading pictures, etc. When I got to the hotel on a Sunday afternoon and checked it, I was immediately disappointed when I got to the hotel hallway where my room was. Very dirty.... reminded me of an old college dormitory. My hotel room, which did not overlook the water, but rather the train tracks, was small, but clean... no drawers for clothing, no desk to do some work. Additionally, the hotel was loaded with folks who spent all weekend at Hemp Fest. Would NOT recommend that you get fooled by the website. I heard from a lady that I met in town at dinner that she highly recommends the Inn at Black Market or The Alexis..... I only wish I had met her earlier as i think I would have had a different Seattle experience. There's always next time. Don't waste your money at The Edgewater.

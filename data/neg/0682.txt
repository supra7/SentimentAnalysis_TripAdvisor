Decent stay overall. But we don't require much. We booked through Priceline which got us a great deal...What we paid was actually what the room was worth. It's a four star but no hot tub, spa or pool. Rooms are decent, facility is nice. Concierge staff are nice. Front desk staff, completely stupid. We received our bill for our parking charges. Which were $33USD per 24hrs. On $33/night bill, we were being taxed $6.44. Okay, we're from Canada and know our provincial tax. This is our first time in Seattle, and we know the state tax is roughly 10%. But when we asked the front desk what the state tax was she had NO idea what it was. We said, that this seemed to be a lot for parking taxes. We said, how could you not know what the state tax is? As far as we're concerned, if you own a business, you should know what taxes you're charging! She responded with sarcasm and proceeded to call a concierge for the answer...not a manager, a concierge who also didn't know. Then when he came and said it was 15%, we were like...uh, that still doesn't match up with this number...this is like 20%. The front desks' response, "Geeze, if I was better with a calculator, I'd figure it out for you." To which we replied, we don't need a calculator to know that this is almost 20%. At the end of it, we were charged what we were charged, and there was no explanation for it at all. Front staff was useless and rude. Thank GOD we didn't pay full price for this place!!! No complimentary internet. No free parking. No continental breakfast. No pool. No hot tub. No help at the front desk.

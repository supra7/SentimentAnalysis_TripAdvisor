Room looked very nice when we first walked in and then the ants starting showing up shortly thereafter. There were ants on the tables, sheets, pillowcases, etc. I also saw ants by the ice machine in the vending area. One time we saw more than 20 ants on the table and there wasn't any food on it. They also have the worst breakfast. No muffins, danishes, oatmeal or english muffins. Biscuits were hard as a rock and gravy was cold. Waffle batter was very runny and wasn't edible. When we came back to the room in the afternoon both of our keys didn't work. We left a note for housekeeping not to clean the room or make the bed just leave toiletries, towels, etc. They moved our note to the table and disregarded it. The room was made up as if we had already checked out. We only stayed 2 days and had to get out of there. They also tried to charge us for a safe and warranty. Watch your receipt carefully as they charge for this daily and it shows up separately on the receipt. The swimming pool looked very dirty so it wasn't an option to use it. We also never saw any other guests using the swimming pool. We complained to Choice Hotels and we received a credit for one nights hotel stay.

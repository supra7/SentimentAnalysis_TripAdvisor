Hotel itself is ok. Easy location if you have to stay at the airport overnight. You can hear the planes come in and out but considering you are in between two runways it's really quite quiet. For the price they charge it's over the top. This is the only hotel really close to the airport so the price is hiked as no airport competition for prices. Charging for the internet is a joke. $S35 for 24 hours connection is also daylight robbery, especially when you have paid so much for your stay already. Staff were really unhelpful when we complained about this. They suggested my heavily pregnant wife should walk into the terminal to find free wifi. The rooms are only hard wired too even if you do have to pay the over the top charge. I believe the lobby area is wifi connected but didn't cave in to paying. Would not look at this hotel again when we have an overnight stop in Singapore. Would probably stay in one of the hotels out of the airport and travel in given the price they charge and what you get for your money. We got a night at a better hotel on Orchard Road, all meals included, free stocked mini bar, limousine collection etc for less than this place charges for a room for one night at the start of our trip, plus the hotel on Orchard had helpful staff. Not to mention the free and very fast wifi in all of the hotel! Crowne Plaza at the airport needs some nearby competition from another hotel. Overcharging big time for what they offer.

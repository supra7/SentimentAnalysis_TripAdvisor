I have never seen such a disorganized hostal. Ruth attendents and staff. Food sucked and took a long time almost 30 min for starters and maincourse even longer. I expected a higher standard and customerservice but was highly disappointed. I certainly will not come back with my colleages. I had the impression that roomservice was better but even a simple clubsandwich they screwed up. For compensation i made a complaint.

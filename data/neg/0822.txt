Stayed only 1 night for a work related trip. Nice view of downtown Seattle from my room, but I found that it was a bit expensive (225$ per night) for a room that will definitely need a decoration refreshment. For that price you are travelling back in time right to the 1990's especially in the bathroom who really needs some refit. I could understand paying that kind of money in a really big city like New-York or San Francisco, but not in Seattle in March.

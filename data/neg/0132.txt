This hotel is horrible! we've got an old room unlike rooms in the hotel site's pictures. The room was old, and cigarette stinking. The mattress was so old it was better sleeping on the floor. The room was right on the street (1st floor) plus a can vending machines was right outside our door. The walls and window were so thin we felt like lying in the middle of the street! Could not sleep at all and regret the moment we chose this hotel. We payed 140$ include taxes and it was way to much!

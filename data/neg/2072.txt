location near the airport. There was no internet access in the rooms; only at the reception where there are no place to set. the bedrooms without Air condition which makes it difficult to sleep during the summer; we end up sleeping on the living room which have the only Air condition in the flat. The guy serving breakfast was not friendly and rude; we set 10 min after the breakfast time (10am) because of my kids they eat slowly; they turned off the lights while we are setting and took the dishes that was on our table in front of us; as they are forcing us to leave. this was very rude and i was unsatisfied.

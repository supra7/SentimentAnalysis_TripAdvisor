Take your money elsewhere! The hotel rooms are outdated and dirty! When we checked in we were ignored by the front desk attendants for more than 10 minutes while they talked among themselves. Once we got into our room, we opened the door and immediately saw that the room had not been cleaned (unmade bed, dirty room). We returned to the lobby and the attendants merely changed our room without apologizing. We got to our second room and were still not confident that the room was clean. My husband and I were too tired to fight a battle and got into bed after a LONG trip west. When we checked out, my husband told the front desk attendant that the rooms were not satisfactory and again... NO apology. Bizzare. When you pay an arm and a leg to travel these days, there is no reason to stay at this hotel... take your money elsewhere and enjoy Seattle!

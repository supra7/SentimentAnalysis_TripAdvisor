EXpensive - pretentious and COLD. Hotel charge 15 Euro to park the car and 15 Euro for WiFi Access. Didnt bother to ask how much breakfast was - Im guessing 15 Euro! Room and bed was cold. TV only had Spanish channels. Carpet was disgusting, wallpaper ripped and the receptionists answer - complain to the manager, I only work here. What a wanker.Dont bother - I found a better hotel the next day.

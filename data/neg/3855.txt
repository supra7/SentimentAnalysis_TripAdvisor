Hands down this was the worst major city Marriott we have ever stayed at. The photos of the standard room on Expedia and Marriotts Web site are very deceptive and do no reflect the tiny sized rooms and closet-sized bathrooms. The location is great, but there are many more choices. When asked to be moved to another room, the first three visits to the front desk were met with rudeness and an overall attitude of "I could care less." The decor in the rooms was also tired, worn and smelled like a retirement home. This property needs to be gutted and redone from top to bottom. To make matters worse, a high school group was allowed to take over the hotel, ruining the elevators, escalators and restaurants--all and all this is a bad hotel and should not be branded Marriott Hotel

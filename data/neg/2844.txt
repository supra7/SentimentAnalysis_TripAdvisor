Our stay at the Shoreham Hotel was HORRIBLE! This hotel may be cheap, yes. And it is on the boardwalk, yes. However, the rooms are dirty, the employees (including the manager) are rude and unhelpful, and their business practices are unfair. I would rather pay the extra money and get a nicer hotel, also on the boardwalk or close by, so that I may enjoy a clean, friendly hotel. There was food and sand on our carpet flooring in the room when we first checked in and our fire alarm was hanging out of the wall by its wires. The hotel "didn't remember" that we put down a deposit on our room (required) and the manager refused to help us. The employees surf Facebook all day and give you attitude if you ask for directions, help, have questions, etc. Again, I WOULD NOT recommend this hotel to even my greatest enemy. I will never stay here again.

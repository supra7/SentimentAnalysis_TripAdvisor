The Warwick Hotel has a great location in Seattle. Close to shopping, PIke Place and the Seattle Centre. However what really lets this hotel down is it cleanliness. The bed linen was torn, bottom of curtains were torn and the floor had a few stains. The hotel advertises itself as having a balcony ,which in reality is a disappointment. We stayed in a hotel in San Diego which did have a balcony - table, chairs etc. The Warwick balcony is about 10 inches.The view from rooms with a view of the Space Needle is terrific, but doesn't make up for the poor cleanliness. The check in staff were neither pleasant nor unpleasant and we decided not to sample the restaurant. Ralph's deli across the street is great for snacks and also has a cafe.There are plenty other better hotels in Seattle for the same or slightly more money than the Warwick - choose one of them e.g The Hotel Andra.

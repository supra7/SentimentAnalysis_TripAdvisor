I got a great deal on Priceline ($75) and my initial impression was very positive. I was treated well by staff at the front desk and given a king size room on 15th floor. Very elegant with great view of city. However on the very large desk in my room was a card warning about wind noise with an offer of ear plugs from room service. I watched TV for a while and went to bed. Around 11 pm the room started vibrating, the windows rattled and the bed frame was actually hitting the back wall of the room. I got the earplugs which didn't help at all and hardly slept a wink. In the morning i was offered free breakfast at checkout, but had already paid for it so not much use by then. Warning, there was a reason it was so cheap, those who have stayed there when the wind is buffeting this poorly designed building won't be coming back anytime soon nether should you unless it is a calm night!

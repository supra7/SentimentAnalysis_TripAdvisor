I so wanted to write a good review on this hotel as on the surface it is a great place. I wouldn't agree with another reviewer who said the restaurants were not up to scratch as I thought they were excellent and so was the service. The rooms are good too but that would be because it's a relatively newly refurbished hotel. And I was very pleased with myself I had picked this place. That was until I really had a problem and suddenley, the service was non-exisitent. They damaged my shirt and lost a belt off a very expensive jacket. After speaking to five so called managers and several hours, I still hadn't got any response so eventually asked to speak to the General Manager. Suddenly after a whole day wasted making phone calls and waiting and waiting and waiting, just to find out what's going on, my shirt turned up mended and they 'found' the belt. After this I was eyed suspiciously by the staff and had a 2 hour nightmare getting the order I asked for from room service. I don't normally write a tome like this but I do hope the General Manager reads this. Had he bothered to call and apologise, I would of probably just mentioned what a great hotel this was but as he didn't seem in any way concerned about my issues...I shall leave it to you to decide. On the whole this is a good hotel ..but only on the surface. The warm welcome and happy smiles don't always mean a good experience.

30 minutes check-in time? Extremely slow service during dinner? Arrogant, untrained staff? Novotel Amsterdam standards. If you experience the same problems do not be stupid to report it to the duty manager or GM. They are even worse. Nobody will listen to you. They simply do not care. They will start blaming you for everything that had happened to you. And to be honest they are right. I have made a huge mistake when I chose this hotel. Stay away from the kingdom of arrogance!

I booked a room at the Boston Park Plaza on a Wednesday night because I had a late event and an early train, and the Park Plaza is very close to Back Bay Station. The staff checked me in quickly, despite the late hour, but I was NOT expecting to find a mouse running around the 12th floor when I got up to my room! I reported the mouse to the front desk and they appeared concerned, although I have no way of knowing how they handled the issue. I barricaded myself in my room and was thrilled to be checking out very early the next day.

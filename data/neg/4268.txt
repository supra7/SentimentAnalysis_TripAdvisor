My wife and I stayed with another couple at the Eliot for 3 nights over the 4th of July. We knew that staying in downtown Boston would be expensive, especially over the 4th. Luckily, through a discount program I was able to book a suite with 2 double beds for $267 a night, more than a hundred dollars cheaper than the going rate. However, even with the cheaper rate, we feel we didn't get our money's worth out of the hotel. First....the good. The staff was very friendly all around. The doorman, bellman, and front desk staff were always very pleasant (with or without receiving a tip). It is a great location for shopping and to go to Fenway. However, the building and accomodations had problems. I realize the building is very old, but to bill this as a 5-star hotel, some improvements should be made. Some problems were understandable (weak shower pressure, musty smell in the hallway, etc.) But some problems were plain unacceptable, even for a $80 a night room at Super 8. After looking closely at the comforters on both beds, the white fabric was stained in many places with who-knows-what. It really grossed me out so we didn't even use those blankets. I am about 6ft 2in tall and unfortunately the beds didn't accomodate my heighth and they are very hard. The windows allow a lot of nighttime noise in from the street below, so we shoved pillows around the frame to muffle the noise. They have 2 restaurants in the hotel, but both were closed during our entire stay because of the holiday. That didn't make sense to me, but it would have probably been too expensive for us anyway. But the worst part is that after our 2nd night, my friend's wife woke up with itchy little bites all over her legs. All in all, the Eliot seems to be pre-occupied with appearance and creating the "image" of luxury hotel. But to me, luxury is defined as ultimate comfort, and we were not comfortable during our stay.

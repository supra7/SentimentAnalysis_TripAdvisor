My husband & I made the decision to stay here based on reviews we read on Trip Advisor but have to say that our experience at this hotel was one of the worst we have had. We have never had a problem with any of the hotels we have stayed at in Orlando before. This one disappointed us on every single level - only thing in its favour is the location as it is very convenient for Universal Studios and the International Drive area. However, there are much better hotels to choose from in this area and for much better, lower rates as well!! We figured we would pay more as we wanted to treat ourselves before we went on our cruise but it was such a bad mistake. The hotel was not very clean - in fact the carpets were positively filthy!! Also the bed was the most uncomfortable bed we have ever slept on and the result was that neither one of us got much sleep due to the sagging mattress and poor quality of the bed. They really need to invest in some decent beds in this establishment!!! After all, when you book to stay at a hotel it is in the hope of being able to get some rest before continuing with your onward travel - we were both exhausted after our stay at this hotel and found the staff to be very unhelpful and disinterested when we told them of the problems. There are much much better hotels to choose from in Orlando than this one and the biggest mystery to me is how this hotel is so high in the ratings on Trip Advisor as our experience there bears no relation whatsoever to how some of the reviewers have described it. It is as though they are describing a completely different hotel to the place we stayed at!!! I have to agree with the people who have left poor reviews and the best advice I can give to anyone looking for a place to stay whilst in Orlando is to do yourself a favour and give this one a miss.

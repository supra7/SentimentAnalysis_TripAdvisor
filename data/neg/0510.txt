Even though this hotel is less expensive than many hotels in Seattle, I don't feel like I got my money's worth. The location is not good if you are not travelling by car. It's a 25 minute walk to downtown (Pike Street) over busy streets and areas that I was not comfortable walking in alone. The hotel is right off the freeway. My room was very small and in dire need of an upgrade. Also, the hotel staff tried to convince me that a limo service was the cheapest mode of transportation to the airport when a cab is actually cheaper. I would recommend paying a bit more to stay downtown or, if you have a car, staying outside the city to get a bit more for your money.

Hotel Monoco has very little going for it except location. Reviews in here that mention that hotel staff is lacking in service are right on the mark. In fact, I would hazard to say they go out of their way to stay away from guest. We had 4 in the room including our children and staff kept leaving only 3 sets of towels. Not a big deal but for $320/night I expect better. This hotel has some mangement problems that need to be addressed. Employees are not as friendly as you find at other Kimpton hotels (Argonaught in San Fran was first class and worth the additional dollars). Not once was I addressed by my name or even acknowledged by employees. The restaurant was nothing but ordinary and way overpriced. I don't mind the overpriced part of it if I get special attention and service. You don't at this hotel. The rooms are dull but spacious. The evening wine reception is a nice touch but the way the lobby is arranged makes for a poor place to try and meet other guest. Really not worth the time. At the end of the day I was sorely disappointed and would not go back.

We own at Fisherman's Village, part of the Sunset group, and everytime we go for our week, when they can fit us in, we have to go to a presentation at Tres Rios where they force you to listen to a bunch of bull about the property for five hours. I don't understand why they can't just except the fact that we are proud to own at Fisherman's and that's where we wan't to stay for the rest of our 100 year contract. I'm sure Tres Rios is great for some folks but, not us. The property is beautiful but we are happy with what we have. We were informed that they decided the week before we wen't that they were closing Fisherman's the week after we left which is this week so they changed the meal plan and we were not told when we bought the plan. They have a great beffet that we love but, not this time, it was all ala cart. We would not have bought the plan if we would have know. n this. We saved two of the meals for the last day and all they had was cheese bugers and nachos, not rite.

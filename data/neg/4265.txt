I stayed there on business. They offer valet parking at $36 per day. While we were taking our bags out of the car (we hadn't even had a chance to check in) one of the valets brought another guest's car around to the entrance and backed directly into our car while parking. TWICE. Management was very confrontational about it, and had the attitude that we were making a big deal out of nothing. The next morning there was no electricity in my room. I had to put my contact lenses in at the window sill using a compact mirror. Couldn't shave because the bathroom is an interior room with no natural light, consequently went through the business day unshaven. I walked past a stack of dirty dishes on the floor in the hall near the elevator at 6pm, they were still there when I checked out the next day. I've had better stays at budget motels.

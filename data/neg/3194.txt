Our room was tiny,it reminded of a college dormitory with two twin beds and a tiny window. The other rooms might be nicer, I don't know. The bathroom was sub-standard. There is no hot water at the basin, the bathroom was not cleaned properly and it left a bad impression. There is no hair-dryer, I had to request one from reception and phoned twice before it arrived. For elderly people: there is no elevator, so you have to carry your bags to the room,which are all upstairs. The room is being promoted as colonial style with stunning views??? I can not agree. It might have the potential, but the current management is not doing enough to enhance that. It is in the middle of nowhere and there is really nothing to it. It is badly signposted and the taxi driver had difficulty finding it. There is wi-fi internet available. I did not have a laptop, but the manager kindly agreed that I may use the computer in his office, . The hotel has a surcharge of $2.50 to book a taxi for

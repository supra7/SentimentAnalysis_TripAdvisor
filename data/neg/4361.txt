After reading other reviews, I thought that this hotel would be great for my four day stay in Boston however I was wrong. My husband and I have traveled extensively and have never stayed in a dirtier hotel. When my husband pulled down the comforter on the bed, there was hair in between the sheets and stuck in the pillows. We called the front desk to complain and they sent new sheets promptly however they handed us the sheets and walked away. In addition, the sheets were the wrong size. In addition, there was a piece of someones toenail on the carpet (they dont vacuum) and a large clump (about half an in thick) of wet hair on the ledge in the shower (or clean the shower). Also the bathroom sink and toilet had not look like they were cleaned in weeks. We returned to our room one afternoon while our room was being made up and to my surprise other guests were allowed to enter our room to complain to the cleaning staff about similar issues in their room. I was appalled at this since no one was watching these visitors as they were in our room. While watching this, I figured out why the room was so dirty. The cleaning staff only carries a spray bottle and a dirty rag to clean everything with. They use that same rag to clean the bathroom and the dressers. They place the clean sheets and towels on the floor in the hall. After complaining to the manager, I only received an, Im sorry about the inconvenience.

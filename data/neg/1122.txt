The hotel is just too big and impersonal. The rooms were clean and nice enough, but for what one pays there should be more. The front desk staff was professional but unfriendly. Parking is outrageously expensive  why can't hotels' business models stop trying to squeeze every last penny out of a guest?  so much so that I wound up parking across the street for half the price. The hotel charges for WiFi outside of the lobby, unless you figure out how to get around it, which I did, but I didn't like having to jump through hoops to do it. There were food trays and a cart on my floor for the entire day that we stayed there, and the floor's only ice machine was out of order the whole time as well. The only real plus to staying here is the hotel's proximity to the airport and the shuttle, but you can say that for other hotels along the same street. I'll be trying another one the next time I'm needing a room near the airport.

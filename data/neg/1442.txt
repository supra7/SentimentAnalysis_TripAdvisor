DO NOT stay here if you would like to use the pool. It is a pool at an adjoining fitness center whose hours are variable. My small children and I were there 3 days and were never allowed to use the pool--due to closure for crowding, swim lessons (every Sat. morning), and closed for a holiday (all holidays closed). It is not worth the extra cost if you are not actually allowed to use the pool! Staff did not compensate us for this either.

I am surprised by all the positive and glowing reviews that this hotel has received. It fell way way below our expectations. We spent quite a substantial sum on a room that promised to be an "Ocean View" room, but were given a room that could at best be called a partial view room. The so called display of Hawaiian culture appeared to me to be a put up show. And the last straw was a wedding party that went on late into the night right under our window. With a lot to do in a small number of days, it is a pity if one cannot sleep in ones hotel room because of a party going on right next to it. I would not recommend this hotel to any one.

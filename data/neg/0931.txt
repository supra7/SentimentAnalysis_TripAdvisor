We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights. We chose this hotel because it is close to the Convention Center. We landed there around midnight and there was nothing to eat- no snacks or food. Rooms were OK but the house keeping was poor. The daily cleaning of the rooms was not done properly. For replenishment of every item we had to make a request. The breakfast though free was ultra-simple and monotonous- there was no change whatsoever in the breakfast during our 6 days stay there.Internet won't work in the rooms-so we had to come down to the lobby to get connected to internet. Staff was quite friendly. The rates were definitely reasonable but there are number of other choices even within that price range. Our advise- avoid if you can!

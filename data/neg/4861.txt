I booked our spring break getaway on priceline and got an amazing deal. I spent $60 a night for three weeknights. Our view was terrible, however they did give this option to upgrade for $40 a night... no thanks! The hotel itself was great, everythign was beautiful. The parking was WAY overpriced, but you have no other choice. This was our first visit to Daytona Beach, so we really didn't know what to expect. The area around the hotel is SCARY! We tried to venture out but were harrassed by panhandlers and street thugs. My daughter left her cell phone on the night stand when we left, and someone had purchased a charger and begun using it by 5pm that afternoon. My only guess is that it had to be hotel staff. Overall, the hotel is great, but the area and people are worth looking elsewhere for your vacation, even at the low price.

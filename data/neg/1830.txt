Firstly I wish I had known about Trip Advisor before I booked this hotel as I would have read reviews about it. The room was very small, cobwebs on the ceiling, shower was filthy, the air con just about worked. The hotel was in Little India - Singapore. If you didn't know about this part of Singapore you would be extremely shocked at all of the surrounding smells and noise. My husband was rather taken aback but I wasn't as I had been to Little India before many years ago. We would give this hotel a 1/2 star.

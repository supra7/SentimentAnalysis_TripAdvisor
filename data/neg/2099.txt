We booked Parrot with the understanding that it was not a full service resort with a beach. Just don't get that on Key West really - we are not fussy. We just wanted a nice hotel with a location a little removed from the night life of Duval Street. We booked a three bedroom condo for myself hubby and our 13 yr old and a friend. It looked nice based on the pictures and friendly when we called. The condo was pretty but housekeeping has been terrible. Had to clean our bathtub and dishes ourselves. Breakfast crumbs still on counters when we get back. Sand everywhere. We remove pots from shelves and find them filthy and the cleaning supplies are lightweight at best - despite the granite counters, you have plastic cups wrapped in plastic for drinking. We have had a bachlorette party in the adjoining condo that has gone on for 4 days - wall are thin and we hear everything. No help from staff. Pools are very small and little more than a place to wet down - very warm with lots people. There is limited food service, a small cafe that closes so you have to leave the hotel. There is a Home Depot and Walgreens next door - Dominos across the street. Helpful as parking at night involves going to an overflow parking lot on their properties. Considered changing hotels, looked at a lot and there seems to be a lot better accommodation with more dining options for the same price around.

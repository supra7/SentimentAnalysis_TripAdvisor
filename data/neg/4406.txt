I travel to Boston fairly often for business and love the city. Normally I stay in the Financial District as its close to my office and the airport. For this trip, I decided to stay in the Back Bay for a change in venue and The Copley Plaza offered a decent rate ($325 for a Fairmont room) through our corporate travel department and had rave reviews on tripadvisor. Heres what I took away from my stay: Positive points: - Good location near shops and restaurants - Bonus FF miles w/stay - Free internet (if youre a Presidents Club card holder) - although the connection was painfully slow Less-than-positive points: - Tiny room with virtually no soundproofing - could hear people in next room/hallway and doors slamming at all hours - No view, fresh air or natural light! Window faced other rooms across a dingy courtyard. Window opened but the restaurant exhaust fans were loud and spewed foul odors from below. - Sticky mouse trap under the nightstand - need I say more?? Granted historic hotels have their idiosyncrasies but this hotel has more than its fair share. Would I stay at this hotel again? Probably not. The generic Westin across the street would be a better choice or in the Financial District the Boston Harbor or Langam are nice too. All in all left under whelmed by the lackluster Copley.

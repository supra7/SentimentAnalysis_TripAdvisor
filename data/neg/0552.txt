We arrived in Seattle after a long flight from London and our first impression of the Sheraton was very good. The external facade was impressive, the reception bright , spacious and airy and we received a warm welcome. Unfortunately, once we got to our Club Level Room, things began to go downhill. The room, whilst spacious and clean, looked tired and outdated, the colour scheme being shades of beige. The bathroom was small and the bathtub was about a foot deep and practically useless. However the worst was yet to come. After having a meal in the Daily Grill, which was fairly good, we went to bed. That is when the doors started slamming............all night! The door mechanisms failed to work so when everybody entered or exited their rooms the door slammed. You could hear doors slamming 10 rooms away and it coninued into the early hours of the morning. Hence, we did not have a proper nights sleep for 3 nights. When I raised the issue with the front desk, they knew immediately what I was coplaining about, so why has this not been resolved? This just shows contempt for the customer. This is unacceptable for any standard of hotel, never mind a four star establishment. I received a fifty dollar per night credit but frankly would have preferred to sleep. In conclusion, I would not recommend this hotel until they take the comfort of their guests more seriously and sort out the doors. In truth, it was an average hotel with a significant problem.

This hostel was the first of my trip and because of this has a worse review. The place itself was decent enough, fairly expensive considering there is no breakfast included. It is a University hall of residence which means you have to go to the corridor or downstairs for the toilets or breakfast and because I was alone in my room it meant locking up every time. My main issue with this hostel was that there was hardly anyone else around which made it a very unsociable place to stay! Had I not had a room to myself (which to many people is a good thing) I am sure I would have had a better experience but because of this I had a fairly lonely time here. Security and location were fine but no lockers and you have to leave your key with reception everytime you go out! Not bad but I would look around for others before returning.

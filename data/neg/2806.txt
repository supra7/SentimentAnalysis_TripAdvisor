Stayed in this hotel in summer 2009. I had to visit the city and wondered why not to visit the new towers in North Madrid. Ups: -Nice architecture and design, brand new, very clean. -Good price for a 5-star hotel in an European capital. Downs, everything else: - The staff is ABSOLUTELY unhelpful. People in check-in/reception area didn't help me with my luggage even if the lobby was completely empty and they just were chatting!! I couldn't believe I was in a 5-star hotel. Also, nobody came with me to show me the room and ask if everything was correct. - The woman in the check-in was totally unfriendly, the only question she made was "can I have your credit card!". Her English was terrible. For my experience, this is common in Spain. I can accept it in a family hotel in a rural area but this is a 5-star business hotel in Madrid. - Location way far from the city center. Totally avoidable for tourism.

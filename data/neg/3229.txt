I booked through Asiatravel.com two weeks before our 1 night stay for celebrating new year eve. i have book two superior rooms for me & my friends for our stay. First problem, we encounter is the servicing male staff isn't very friendly enough. And the check-in is very slow. Secondly, our room didn't have double bed that we requested. And the staff didn't apologised or given us other alternatives as we can always upgrade or choose better rooms. Thirdly, there isn't personalized checked in. It is not a very good experience there as being a local to visit a local boutique hotel in singapore. Maybe i should not expecting much as it not classified as 4 or 5 stars hotel. Firstly it caught my attention cos it is being aired on channel U program promo on this hotel by mediacrop artists. After experiencing it for this hotel, I don't think i will ever book this hotel again.

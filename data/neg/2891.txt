The rooms are tiny, there is no space for two people at all. There is not even space for clothes to hang. All our clothes were laying in the suitcase for that reason. The walls in rooms need to be renovated as they are all scratched does not correspond to a 4 star rating. In addition, it was impossible to rest in the hotel room as there is renovation going on in the next door hotel, the noise is impossible. The breakfast is plain, and same food is served everyday. On the other hand, must say that the location is perfect. The hotel is two minutes walk from all the sightseeng and there are a lot of good restaurants and bars around. The food is safe and good there. The views are amazing from the hotel room either to Bosphorus or Mosque. The staff are friendly enough however need to be more attentive to details.

Hello...Let me first say that my wife and I are very open minded and hardly ever complain about anything, even if things aren't to are liking. However, we were very disappointed in some of the things during our stay at Henderson's Wharf on April 1st, mainly with service. We arrived on April 1st, the day before our cruise vacation. We paid over $250 for an Inner Harbor room with a harbor view. I booked this room several months in advance and were promised a room on the highest floor possible, facing the water/harbor after requesting this. We were also supposed to get a bottle of wine with our reservation upon arrival. We we arrived we were checked in very hastily by a young man, then given the keys to our room. We never did receive the bottle of wine or anything else. However, we did notice other people receiving wine. We went to our room, but instead of being on the upper floor as requested and promised, it was Room 123 on the first floor. Well, in this room you could hardly see anything of the harbor, or any water. What I did see was iron fence and railings and a lot of joggers running past my window all the time. The room itself was nice, but the carpet in this room had that musty, terrible smell and was worn. Not sure how the other rooms were. The breakfast was good. So, I guess for what we paid, we were expecting some things promised that we never received. I know, you will say, why didn't you ask for your bottle of wine and ask to be switched to another room. Can't answer that. Just figured roll with the flow. I would still suggest this hotel, but would hope this lack of concern for us would just be an isolated incident. Everyone else seems to be happy. i guess we had to be the first to get some employees who forgot some things.

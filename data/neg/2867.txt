After I made our reservation, I sent the hotel an email telling them that it was important that we have a shower-their website suggests they be contacted via email with questions or requests. They wrote back saying our (de luxe) room would have a shower. The room did not have a shower. They said we could have a room with a shower if we paid $100 extra for a junior suite. I showed them our email exchange and they were unimpressed saying it was the architect's design. At our next hotel we inquired about the shower and they were astonished that we would ask. They said it was a "normal shower" This is the 21st century and this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel. There is no confusion between a bath and a shower. This is not part of my complaint about this hotel, but I did let them know in my email that this was a special trip for us-a big birthday for my husband and a big anniversary for both of us. Our Rome hotel greeted us with chilled prosecco and a lovely card. The Ruzzini Palace gave us a hard time. Because of the deception and the way they handling the situation, I would not recommend this hotel.

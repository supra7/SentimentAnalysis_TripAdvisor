I travel several times monthly and I regularly stay at a Starwood Hotel. This hotel left a lot to be desired. The front desk staff was very friendly, but the hotel was not in the condition I expected. My first room smelled terribly and my second wasn't much better. Neither room was clean enough and could have used a serious deep cleaning. There was no attention to detail inside or outside of the hotel. Disappointing experience overall.

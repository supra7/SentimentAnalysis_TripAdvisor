This hotel is now charging parking fees. My husband and I couldn't believe it. Why do you need to charge your customers parking fees? The mall is just around the corner and Courtyard and Best Western doesn't even charge even a single dime. I think they really don't want old clients like us to stay. We've been staying here for over a decade and suddenly they decided to charge parking fees. Too many mediocre breakfast choices and lousy coffee. Have you tried the manager's reception offerings? Please don't even try it. We were there and couldn't believe what they have, FROZEN carrots and celery and cheap popcorn. Gone are the days that they used to offer us chips, nachos, salsa, popcorn, veggie platter , pretzels, drinks etc. I think Embassy Suites should stop giving breakfast to their customers and cut the hotel rate and get rid of their parking fees. By the way, they don't have Disney and Nickelodeon channels anymore , our kids were disappointed because for them when they go on vacation they get to watch Disney channel. We don't have cable channel and staying in a big hotel is such a treat for them because of Disney channel. No , we are not coming back to this hotel. Sorry, they failed us in many ways.

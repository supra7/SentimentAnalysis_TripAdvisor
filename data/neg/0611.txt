I stayed for a whole week at that hotel for a conference. The room was not very pleasant. but worst was that during my absence things got stolen from my room. the room maid let someone in while she was cleaning the room. The hotel personal was very impolite and unfriendly when handling the situation and finally did not compensate me. definitely not recommendable.

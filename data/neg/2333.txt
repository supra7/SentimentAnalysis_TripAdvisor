I made reservations in January for two nights/two rooms for an extended family vacation to PA and NJ so that we could stay our first and last nights near the airport. I used a credit card and had confirmation numbers for both rooms, both nights. The DAY BEFORE WE LEFT for our flight from Denver to Philadelphia, I got an email from the Fairfield saying that a "situation beyond their control" bumped us from their hotel and they were placing us in another one. I called them immediately and was told that a convention came to town taking more rooms than they had available and that they had to bump us so that they could give rooms to their "platinum customers". I was further told that this situation could happen at any time, regardless of having confirmation numbers for reservations. I will not go into the details of the problems with the hotel where they placed us, but suffice to say that we were lied to regarding the amenities, the distance and we nearly missed our flight as the "new" hotel did not own their own shuttle service and had no control over the shuttle to the airport. I would NEVER stay in a Fairfield (Marriott) owned hotel again, nor can I recommend it.

i arrived with 16 yr old daughter and her friend on Friday of Lollapalooza around 12:30. They went to concert, hotel was a zoo and rooms were not ready till 3. I had been up all night. I sat in the lobby for 2 hours where it was horribly loud, crowded and the muzak was screaming. Finally I went to a small room off the lobby, put down my 3 pieces of luggage and put my head down for 30 min. I was awakened by a security guard who told me I could not 'sleep on the floor" I explained that I was exhausted, waiting for a room, but he made me move. Next, i checked in with my HHonors number. The clerk replied" you haven't used this in six months". That's all he said. not welcome, nada. I checked into the small dark room on 13th floor room 244 where I had a view of a brick wall. The room had no coffee maker, nor did it have a refrigerator. The next day, the room attendants did not replace the dirty glasses, nor did they dust the furniture or vacuum beneath the bed., I went to the workout room where I was charged $10 to use a treadmill and bike. The pool was too short to do laps. The hotel also has no free internet, just free boarding pass. The final straw was when I checked in my luggage the last day. The tall fellow said in a rude way "THANKS SO MUCH" when I didn't have a tip. i was out of cash and came back with money to tip on picking up the luggage. However, he was quite rude. I stay in Chicago every year, sometimes twice. This hotel is no different than a Motel 6 for what it offers. The food and drinks are overpriced. The employees are rude. I will never ever recommend this property to anyone.

Avoid this hotel unless it is your last choice. Prices in the $200 and up range are outrageous for this Budget Motel type place. Six months after opening the items I encountered should not have happened. -The room was cold (literally) and uninviting and I had to turn on the motel-type heater at the window to heat it up--a process which took a good 24 hours. --It looks like the owners tried to renovate an old building but ran out of money at the end--and so they scrimped on the finishes and fit-up. --There is no hotel restaurant and no restaurants in the nearby (bad) neighbourhood. The "breakfast deli"--the only source of food in the place opened at 7:30 am (the posted hour) with one employee--resulting in a line of 20 people trying to get something to eat--there is no other option.--I instead went to the Convention center and ate there since I was going there anyway. --Don't allow them to give you a room on the side of the hotel facing the "El" train line--its really noisy with trains going by multiple times an hour. The rooms look like a cheap motel. For example there is a closet--but no closet doors. There is an ironing board--but no iron. There is a big bathroom --finished with a cheap corian counter and tile and cheap residential style fixtures. There is a jacuzzi tub--but with no jets. There is no clock in the room. The TV was a flat screen but half the channels were unviewable because they were too blurry. The cheap art work was literally screwed though the front of the picture frame to the wall with sheetrock screws--it seems they think you would want to steal it. There is a desk but no notepad or pen. Bottom line the place felt like a cheap motel room--but at extravagant prices. I have stayed in those motels and have nothing against them--but not at these rates and not at a hotel which mis-bills itself as a "boutique experience".

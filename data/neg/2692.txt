For several years, this was the only place I would stay while in Branson. Yes, you are off the strip, but still "on" the strip and it is quiet. However, our last stay will be our last. New ownership/management needs to work on their people skills! We were treated rude, the room has a terrible smell upon check-in, only had 3 towels and it was like pulling teeth to get a 4th towel! (There were 4 of us) The breakfast was cold and they skipped cleaning our room the day before we left! The Pub used to be a nice place to sit and enjoy some music on the deck, but when we were there, we could not hear the musician because of the loud drunks which I believe were locals. Again, they have lost my business and I have stayed there 3-5 times a yeaer for over 5 years!

Hi. I went to the Hotel Vibel Roma with my parents. It was absolutely nightmare! There was not public transportation to the hotel vibel from the main train station. When I arrived there, the lady of the hotel - she seems like the owner - but she can't speak english at all and she gave me totaly wrong information about the tram 19. At night in your room, you can feel the vibration from the tram and it's quite loud until 12 in the midnight. Breakfast is horrible, not enjoyable - coffee or juice (which sometimes you can't have it because they didn't prepare it.), toasted tiny bread in the bag (5cm x 4cm big), croissants. That's it and it's going to be served by only one person. When I was in Rome, it was beautiful day but we were worried when we left the hotel. - it was really far from the city and no public transportaion. I can say that it is cheap hotel but I paid same amount of money in florence with better breakfast. Cheers!

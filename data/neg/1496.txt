My wife and I carefully read many of these reviews prior to deciding to book a five-day stay with El Dorado, Maroma. We failed to realize how significant some negative aspects of the resort, identified by past guests, would become during our stay. I'm writing in the hope you don't make the same mistake... The most serious problem with this resort is the beach and ocean along the resort. Simply put, they smell. You cannot, while on the beach, ignore this smell. It is persistant and pungent. (You will not get a straight answer from any of the staff about the source of the smell. We surmised that it resulted from the barriers located about 100 yards off the beach, in the ocean, to deter erosion.) These barriers prohibit the constant flow of fresh water. Consequently, the water is too warm, murky, shallow, and stinks. Another problem is with the management: they are initially helpful upon your arrival but problems we encountered soon after -- such as with inconsistent room service -- and expressed to the management were never fixed nor was any serious apology offered to us. (On the other hand, the staff are mostly helpful and could not be nicer.) Other observations:  Good food, except at the Oriental restaurant, which is poor, but not gourmet, as advertised  Terrible snorkeling; the reef off the resort is dead  Occasional loud drunks at pool/beach, which management ignored. At a small resort, like the El Dorado, this obnoxious behavior (an all-inclusive hazard) is very annoying and cannot be escaped. All in all: unfortunately, this resort is not worth the cost.

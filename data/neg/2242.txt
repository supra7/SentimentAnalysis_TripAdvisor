I cannot understand why this hotel has the 4 star grade, including the service, hotel staff, and system. (except exterior) Above all, Front desk members are not polite and in a very businnesslike tone. Moreover I ask room cleanliness in every time and restraunt server are also not friendly and courteous. I travelled so many countries and hotel until now, but I have not seen this kind of hotel for several years. It was owful memory for us.

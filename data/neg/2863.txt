I have just returned from this Hotel and I would not rate it anymore than a two star hotel,we stayed in the Arbain Park Hotel which was a 3 star hotel on 18th December 2011 and it was certainly of a higher standard than the Al Manar. The standard of food for british people was not acceptable and generaly no checks had been done prior to you moving into the room,my son had three different room before he managed to get a hot shower .If you want to enjoy your holiday do not book Faulty Towers which is a correct description for this Hotel.

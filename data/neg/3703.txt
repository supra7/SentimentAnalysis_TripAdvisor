We were on a family vacation to visit Universal and Disney during spring break. Staying at the Point was fine. We booked a Grand one bedroom suite. It suited our family of four just fine. Though just one bathroom. Rooms were clean. Decent kitchen. Staff was very accommodating, and helpful. But, at checkout I forgot to take my best and favorite "HIND" running jacket. I travel everywhere with it. It is warm, versatile, breathable, indesructible. I called the very next day to inform management about leaving my jacket behind in front room closet. I spoke to "Fabio" who was very helpful, and informed me he would speak to all parties involved with my room and get back to me in a few hours. I was so confident that housekeeping would find it, that I told Fabio when he locates jacket I would be back in a few days to retreive jacket. Fabio called and informed me that he spoke to the room attendant, and room supervisor that room was "checked and cleared" by both and nothing was found. I owned this jacket for many years and many years left. I have many jackets, but you always have that one favorite one. THEFT! Very disappointed with The Point. Great Place! Till THEFT!

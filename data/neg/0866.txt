When we first got there it seemed like a decent place to stay, friendly gal at the front desk (I only saw her once). The beds were very comfortable for a hotel and we were having a peaceful rest until about 2:30 AM when we were woken up by several drunk 20-something men pounding on our door and screaming at each other. I looked out of the peep-hole and saw a guy completely passed out on the floor in front of our door... About 1 minute later his friend (drunk as well) was laughing and trying to pull him up off the ground. Then, we heard them go inside their room next to ours and got to enjoy hearing one of them puking in the toilet for 5 minutes. I called down to the front desk and they said they would send someone up to check on it and about a good 10 minutes later we got a phone call from the staff that they heard people "talking a little loudy" but "nothing out of the ordinary". There were at least two cameras in the hallway and they didn't see what was going on? We had an 11 year old little girl with us who was beyond frightened at all of this. Aside from that, every time we asked for something from the front desk, the gentleman acted rude and put-out. Definitely not worth the $200 we paid for two nights! On the upside, the breakfast was good and the room was pretty clean.

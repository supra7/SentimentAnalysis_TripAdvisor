I stayed here for 4 nights while on business at the nearby convention center. The Roosevelt's proximity to the convention center is its biggest (perhaps only?) positive. It is one short block away. The breakfast is overpriced and the same everday. A small selection of pre-packaged baked goods plus not so fresh bananas, choice of cereal, yogurt (vanilla flavor only). There are hot eggs and bacon, but the same preparation everyday - got old fast. Also, the breakfast is served in Vons, the bar, whose decor is somewhat strange at 7am. On the 3rd morning of my stay, the shower fixture completely fell off when I turned on the shower. This prompted a steady gush of scalding water to come out of the wall. The tub drain was very slow. There were two inches in the bathtub to spare before maintanence got the water off. I had already moved all of my belongs off the floor fearing a flood. While the maintenance staff were quite nice (even stating that this was the second time that had happend this month!!), there was no call from the front desk to make sure everything had worked out. Upon checkout I mentioned the problem and the desk clerks just stared blankly. The Roosevelt needs to update its plumbing fixtures and attitude. One positive was the size of the room. I had a sitting area and a bedroom area, which was nice for a long visit. Though, not enough to convince me to return.

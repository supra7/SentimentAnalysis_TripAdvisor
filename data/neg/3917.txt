The hotel has a great classic vibe but they charge three times what you pay at a nice Hilton or Marriot. The bathrooms are tiny and the low pressure, archaic tub wouldn't drain. They charge $12.50 per day for wi-fi - it's 2012, McDonalds and Best Western hotels provide free wi-fi - it should not be considered a "special" service but rather a standard amenity, just as much as phone and TV serice. Residential internet costs $12.50 PER MONTH. How in the world do they justify this? Speaking of phones, they need to update those too, they look like they came from a Miami Vice set. The room had no comfortable chairs to sit in, only two rickety dining room chairs so old that there was no padding left in the seats. When I checked out, I had to wait in a 10 minute line at the desk where two atttendants tried to service 30 guests. This place obviously has the resources to update the furniture and fixtures, hire more desk help, and provide free internet. But the truth is, they're counting on guests to be so enamoured with the idea of staying at the "Historic Plaza Hotel" that they feel justified in the ridiculous room rates and embarrasing lack of comfort and tech amenities. Next time I'll go to a Double Tree for a third of the price, reasonable guest servies, and a friendlier staff. This place is overated to the extreme.

When we arrived, our reservations that we made a month in advance had been cancelled and instead of trying to fix it they kept blaming others for the mistake. Once the issue was resolved, our credit card ended up being charged twice. One of the rooms we reserved had no hairdryer...although we called down for one in the morning, had it not been for us having another room we didn't receive the hairdryer until late in the afternoon. One of our rooms requested that they not clean then housekeeping called waking up the kids that were napping. That night we requested clean towels and washcloths and never received them. The next morning we found ants near the bed and someones used empty toiletries in our bathroom. We normally enjoy staing at this brand of hotels but will not recommend this particular one to anyone.

The front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful. But, the hotel is too trendy, too dark and too noisy. The corridors are poorly lit and narrow. The room was shabby and not very comfortable with a terrible view of a tall parking lot. The window covers do a very poor job of keeping out light from the parking lot which was well lit all night. Also, the windows do not open at all and the air conditioner made loud noises all night. The food was mediocre in the dining room. And , it was overpriced. I will not return.

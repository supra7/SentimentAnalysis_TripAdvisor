I booked my last night in Seattle here to make the airport easy to get to for morning flight. Ended up needing a place the previous night also, so I went to book the room two nights in a row. I was told by the desk that the room I booked online was a handicapped accessible room (which I didn't request, it is simply what I was assigned by the website). I was told I couldn't book the same room for the first night, "in case a handicapped person came in". I asked why I could get it the second night..."Because the website booked it as the cheapest room"...okay, so just give me any room that I can have for two consecutive nights. No can do! I could have a smoking room the first night, then move to the handicapped room. I asked for a nonsmoking room and was told that would be $50 extra! It was stupid policy, and the guy at the desk really wouldn't stop explaining to me over and over again until his associate was rolling his eyes along with me! Ridiculous! Then when I got to the room, I checked the website I originally booked on and my room was available at the same rate for that night, even though the front desk gave me every reason why it wasn't. Too late. Slept in the stinky smoking room....

Booked a Grand View room, 6 months in advance for my sister and I, and was supposed to have had Sweeping Views of Puget Sound and the Space Needle. When I checked in as a Starwood Member, I was told that I was getting upgraded to the Royal Suite. It was written on the card with my keys. We get to our room, which turned out to be NEXT to the Royal Suite. We walked in and we had a king bed and a city view! Went back downstairs to talk the check-in and was told they had NO rooms with that view I was promised available, due to being full capacity! They then got the Hotel Manager and after 2 hours of dealing with this they mysteriously found me a regular room with a view of The Space Needle! But, alas, NO Suite!

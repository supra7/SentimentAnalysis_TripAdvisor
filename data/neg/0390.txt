Not your typical Radisson, not luxury by any means I recently returned from a weeklong trip through CA/OR/WA and stayed at the Radisson at SEA-TAC (there are two Radisson hotels within a 3 block radius, so confusion is likely) the night before an early flight. The hotel, while very close to the airport, is not your typical Radisson. I had never before stayed in a Radisson but according to reviews from family members and friends who had, I was expecting a luxury hotel. It appears from the temporary-looking signage and the fact that there is another Radisson three blocks down the street, that Radissson recently acquired this hotel from another chain, perhaps Ramada. This hotel, or perhaps more accurately, motel was nowhere near the standards of luxury. I was disappointed and also glad that I had only booked a room for one night. I would not have been happy to have had an extended stay at the Radisson. It was subpar, at best. My main gripe were the beds, which were very motel-like and certainly not equivalent to what actual luxury hotels are currently offering like Sweet Sleeper's and the Heavenly beds. I happen to subscribe to the belief that the bed is the best indicator of how to rate a hotel and this hotel deserves a measly C-, in my opinion.

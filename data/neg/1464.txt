The location of this hotel may be OK, but it is a terrible place to stay! We booked two rooms at this hotel based on its website description and the description on the TD Canada Trust Travel Visa website - both listed the hotel as air conditioned throughout. It was NOT!! The halls were not air conditioned at all - the windows were open all the time! Worse, our rooms were like a Turkish bath. The thermostats were set at 5 degrees Celsius, but I think they were put there as placebos, and had no real effect on the temperature or humidity. The "air conditioning" blew hot air around the room, but did nothing to cool you off. In fact, it seemed to be hotter inside than it was outside (40 degrees Celsius)! We repeatedly requested the management to address this issue, but they were not really interested; their answer was that the air conditioning did not work when it was hot outside! We spent the (sleepless) nights trying to cool down by draping ourselves with wet towels! The only one who was any help was the one harried bellboy, who turned on the AC at 6:00 AM, when he arrived at work. It would go off again almost immediately, however. I paid a lot extra for the AC, and feel really cheated. In addition, the breakfast was totally pathetic - cold toast, stale buns, etc. This place was listed as one of the favorite hotels in Rome when we made our booking, but has since dropped considerably. Take heed of this warning!!

We booked a weekend stay at the Westin Seattle thinking that, being a Westin it would be clean and comfortable and the service would be good. We were quite wrong. This hotel is well below what I expect from a Westin. I'm not a normal complainer but at almost $300 a night you expect certain things, cleanliness being one of them. While the hotel is in a good location we had the following problems with the hotel. The white bed sheets has stains on them, the floors were dirty, the maids don't seem to vacuum the floors, the service was very slow. I had dropped some crumbs on the floor in the morning and figured it would get cleaned up by the maid when we got back at the end of the day. Not so. We got some wine to celebrate one night and called down for a corkscrew. We got it, 1.5 hours later. The last annoyance was the lack of a free internet kiosk. I know I should have brought my laptop but do you have to nickel and dime me at $12 an hour just to check my emails? This Westin is in trouble because there are plenty of other options for hotels in that price range. I certainly won't be back.

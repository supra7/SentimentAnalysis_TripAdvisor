Cricket infestation The hotel rooms are OK for the price, but this particular location seems to have a cricket infestation problem. Judging from the note posted on the front door, it's not the first time this has happened, but management has been really slow to respond. This has been going on for a few days but it's still unclear what they are doing to fix this. I'm not talking about one or two bugs. Several bugs were in my room last night. I counted 15 dead crickets in the hallway on the way to the elevator, and some of them have been around for a few days. The parking lot is littered with crushed/partially eaten dead bugs. Many guests have resorted to stuffing the bottom of their doors with towels to prevent crickets from entering their room. The crickets seem to congregate at this hotel. Even the mall across the street doesn't have nearly as many crickets running around. Other comparable hotels nearby (e.g. Homestead) don't have this issue either. Unless you absolutely have to stay at this location, I would recommend picking another hotel.

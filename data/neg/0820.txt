I have stayed at the property fairly regularly over the last six months. Generally speaking, nice hotel, great concierge service and the location is solid. HOWEVER, if you end up staying in Seattle on a windy night like I had (14 MPH winds, gusts up to 20 MPH), do not expect to get much sleep. As mentioned in previous posts, the window seals, a few interior walls and other components of the structure creek LOUDLY in the rooms in wind conditions. I have stayed in both towers (12th North and 18th South) in these type of wind conditions and it is a general problem for the whole building. I observed other individuals complain directly to the front desk at 2, 3 and 4 in the morning. Overall, good hotel, but if you stay, you take the risk of getting a windy night and then you will have a much different opinion on what is important to you in a hotel.

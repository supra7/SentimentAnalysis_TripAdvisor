The reviews on here are not always spot on but most times they come through. Not with the Moore. These reviews must be written by the owners or something because this place reminded me of something between a hostel and sleazy motel. The lobby is falling apart (like most of the building)the rooms are big, i'll give them that, but the bed sheets were torn and stained, horrible old mattress, pillows that me think it would be better if i laid my head on a brick. The place wasnt super dirty but it was not kept up. I realize its old but its just not worth it at any price.

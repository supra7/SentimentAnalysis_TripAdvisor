I booked this hotel on Hotwire. After receiving the specific hotel's name, and reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, I was terrified. Perhaps because of my low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised once I got there. The neighborhood is a little scary, it was hard to find an ice machine that worked, and the tub faucet ran constantly. Other than that, though, everything was fine. Check-in and check-out only took about a minute, and the hotel staff was friendly. The room was clean, and offered a TV, mini-fridge, and microwave. Even better for me was the $3 shuttle to and from points of interest. It's certainly not the Ritz, but I would definitely stay here again.

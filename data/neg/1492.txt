My wife and I had our were married in Playa and stayed at the Maroma for our Honeymoon. Granted the weather was nasty and out of the staff's control but we had the worst service ever. From the minute we walked in the staff dropped the ball. We brought our wedding cake and they offered to refrigerate it while we checked in. Poof! We never laid eyes on it again. Immediately we were hounded to attend a "presentation". Once we decided to not attend the sales pitch our concierge vanished. Several requests for simple items such as ice, candles and umbrellas went unfulfilled. We were eventually evacuated to another property due to inclimate weather and didn't have a pleasant experience there either. Our complaints seemed to fall on deaf ears. Only after emailing our travel agent did management listen to our concerns while we were there. We understand many people are at this property to celebrate a wedding, anniversary or honeymoon but we still expected some consideration and received none. We attempted to have these complaints addressed after our trip but were not offered any compensation or even an apology. If you're celebrating something special such as your Honeymoon, I suggest you book a different property. I would hate for someone else to have such a poor experience to begin a life of matrimony.

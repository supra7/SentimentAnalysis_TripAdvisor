1. Skip swimming. Indoor pool is dirty and not properly maintained. 2. Check everything in the room before settlign in - the guest service pointed out it is the guests responsibility to inspect the room before settling in (i.e. faulty shower rod - you may lose your head). According to the Hotel Act, which was posted on the door, it is their responsiblity to ensure everything in the room is in good condition. 3. Ask them not to you in with a high school group. Or you won't get any sleep. 4. Breakfast is basic - not what they say. I will never go back to this hotel for their lack of customer service, inability to handle complaints, their improper management of facilities and false advertisement of the facility. The guest clerk assured that the manager will be in contact. It is a ploy to avoid you. We booked this hotel because of its direct link to the Woodland Park Zoo - don't do it. There are better places to stay.

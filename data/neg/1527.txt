None existent staff, reality is NOT the same as photos online. Not a place for a honeymoon or regular stay, we left without staying one night as it was filthy and unsettling. We did not feel our belongings were safe at this location as it is completely open to the remainder of the building and there is no staff kept on duty; upon arrival we looked for any sign of life for about 20 minutes. The only person we found was a disheveled cleaning lady who handed us a set of four keys, no one asked for our passports or a credit card; as is normal practice. We opted to drag our luggage around Rome with us until a suitable/ clean option was found. Other: LOUD and AC does not work. Upon returning to the hotel to shower after an afternoon of hauling baggage around Rome, still awaiting word on another place, it was clear someone had been in the room while we were gone. As we opened the door to leave an angry Italian woman appeared abruptly, never introducing herself and had heard from our travel agent that we would not be staying. She yelled at us that we would stay and insisted that the room was not dirty, she blocked the doorway and would not allow us to leave the room. We proceeded to show her the dirty cups, bathroom, stains on the bed linens, walls and curtains. She continued to insist it was clean, and calling me an "American Sausage!", we left the hotel around 3:00pm and received a call minutes later that she had charged for the night's stay immediately upon our departure. Funny that we couldn't find a soul to check in with, and never formally did, but we could be charged within moments of departure.The following hotel felt like Heaven in comparison.

The staff/service was excellent. The cleanliness of the room was disgusting for a four star hotel or for any hotel tell for that matter. Would not take a shower because there were black foot prints in the tub, bathrobe was dirty (yellowed), soap dish has soap scum in it (inside shower), hand rail in show was soap scummed, mirror in hall way looked like someone flossed their teeth and it was never cleaned afterwards, half canopy over bed had 1/4 inch of dust on it (never touched), one remote didn't work, finger and hand prints on french door glass (all glass looked like it had never been cleaned) and the list goes on. Expect to pay a parking garage fee; parking is not included with the room!!!! $36 fee.

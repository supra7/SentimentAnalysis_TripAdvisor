booked this hotel for one night. i actually live 10 mins away from the hotel but booked it just to spend some time with my boyfriend away from home. i have lived right next to euston my whole life (23 years), my boyfriend has lived next to kings cross his whole life (24 years) so we are totally use to hearing noise all the time, sirens going 24/7, buses etc, but MY GOD THE NOISE AT THIS HOTEL WAS JUST UNBERABLE. we did not get a wink of sleep all night. the buses in and out of euston station were going right past our window all night. the hotel really need to do something about it, not sure what, but something needs to be done. on the plus side, the rooms were pretty clean, small but it is a travelodge. in comparison to other travelodges i have stayed in this is by far the cleanest and more 'up to date' travelodge becuase it was built quite recently. for me it was a NIGHTMARE, i was aware there would be noise but not the kind i had to deal with when i got there(and i can handle central london noise!!!) would i recommend it? Yes - to heavy sleepers who want a clean more 'up to date' travelodge. No - to light sleepers

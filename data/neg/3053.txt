I really want to like this hotel, but there are niggles albeit small ones. Travelled here on business for two nights sharing twin room with colleague. Check in was frosty, and receptionist seemed surprised that two male colleagues would share a room, obviously obvilious to the current financial climate. Had to insist on twin as online booking system did not allow to specify room type. Room ok aircon, flatscreen opening windows, laptop. Very nice and with a totally fantastic hydro shower in the bathroom. First problem 'no hangers' second problem ' no iron or board', having to travel with hand luggage does not keep clothing ideally and business attire required attention. Colleague went down to reception to enquire regarding these items to be told that the previous occupants must have stolen the hangers and that THE iron was in use, and its location unknown? Strange! The iron never appeared during the two days and feel that for a alleged 4 star hotel to have 1 iron is quite frankly pathetic! (Oh, the hangers did arrive!) This place is let down on the little things, very poor staff, lack of basic items(IRONS) and it is a shame because these are the easiest to fix and would suggest lack of effort! On the plus side the location is fab! with plaza mayor on your doorstep and the rooms are great if over techy, but feel once you scratch the surface it all begins to unravel!

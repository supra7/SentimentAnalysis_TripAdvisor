Just got back from our honeymoon in Maui/Oahu. We've stayed in Hilton (Oahu), Four Seasons, and Hyatt in Maui. The hotel rooms in Hyatt are way too old. $530+ including tax for Deluxe Ocean view is ridiculous for the quality you get. First room we got had broken sink drainage on first day upon arrival. 2nd room we've switched to has broken toilet flush. Later the night stand lamp went out as well... The room quality is about 3 1/2 star and service is so so. The outside facilities (pool and garden) maybe in 4 star and it's good for people with kids, but not for celebrating anniversary or honeymoon. If you spend anything beyond $300 or more, than you'll be very disappointed with the quality you get. I would suggest Four Seasons hotel for celebrating anniversary/honeymoon even though it's close to $500 per night including tax. There is no need to choose expensive room at Four Seasons. This is the best hotel that I've stayed at ever. Everything from room quality, service, and facilities are way beyond our expectations (definitely a 5 star hotel). Beware that Hyatt has an additional $15/day mandatory resort fee for in-house coffee machine, daily news paper, gym, 1hr of tennis court facilities even when you don't use them. Anyway, we had a great time in Maui/Oahu with the only disappointment of Hyatt's room quality as we weren't expecting such quality when paying over $500 per night. Hyatt in Maui needs a big make over to maintain 4 star status.

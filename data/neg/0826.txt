On a trip through Seattle my two children and I decided to see what Seattle offered. Choosing a centrally located hotel was essential, so we ended up at the Westin. The views were very nice. The room was satisfactory. The staff was courteous. Now, the irritating: why, after paying $250/night would an hotel have the gaul to to charge to park in their lot? When asked this question, staff looked as though they were sympathetic, yet powerless. With this experience, I conclude that "nice" hotels can charge for image. So, if you don't mind staying somewhere where the walls are rice-paper thin, the food terribly over-priced and a staff of attentive drones, give the Westin your business. But heed my warning, "you can't polish a ____". However, if you want a stay where you are appreciated as a guest, where someone acknowledges that YOU COULD TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ANYWHERE, choose somewhere else. Posh Spice is in LA, not in the Westin Seattle (regardless of how they portray themselves).

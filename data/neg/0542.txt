The hotel overall is clean and in a decent downtown location. Walking distance to most major attractions including The Market. The new wing is a bit nicer than the old wing. Charges for internet access are excessive but free computers are provided in the lobby. One of the most important expectations of a hotel is a good night sleep. I did not have a good night sleep on two different stays. This was attributed to the uncomfortable beds and very uncomfortable pillows. I woke up every morning with a neck ache. I never have this problem at Marriott or Hilton hotels where I usually stay. Until they improve their bedding, I will not be returning to the Sheraton.

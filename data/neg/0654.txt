I've stayed in many hotels over the years and this one by far exceeds a terrible hotel! I would of been better off paying $60 to stay at the Hampton Inn. I was charged $40.40 for one night parking and get this.... over charged $827 for one night stay in a room so small that I could barely keep my all my luggage in and walk around this tiny double bed. Don't stay there, you will be sorry you did. Try another place. Oh did I just about forgot to mention the train passing by every 40 minutes through out the night.

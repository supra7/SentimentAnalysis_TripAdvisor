Never again We had flown into Seattle, June 21 to catch the following day Alaska cruise departing from downtown. Yes, we stayed here that Thursday, June 21, 2007 This hotel is old and the AC was not working. The room was sealed up all day and it was stifling hot. The only thing we could do to cool the room down was to open the small window. I complained to the front desk several times and the best they could do was to loan me their small desk fan to put by the window. Their advice was to leave the bathroom fan going all night with the window open. Hopefully, I might get some cross ventilation. I must say, I never thought of that. (Who thinks of stuff like that???) Why don't they just fix the AC system? I was so hot, I could not sleep, so I went downstairs to get something cool to drink at their restaurant only to find their restaurant is closed due to renovations. It was a miserable night for my family and me. I guess the cruise made up for it. To be fair, the staff was nice but how do you make up for such poor facilities??? If you stay here, I hope you fair better. Thanks for reading.

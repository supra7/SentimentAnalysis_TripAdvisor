I joined TA recently so my stay at The Moore is not that recent but I'm so surprised by all of the positive reviews that I felt like I should detail our experience just for an alternate viewpoint. We had so many issues during our stay it's hard to know where to start. We spent 2 nights in October of 2007 and it was quite chilly but there was no heat in our room. The front desk person told us that it came on automatically at a certain time but it never came on at all for us. The sheets were thin and barely large enough for the bed so they slid off the corners all night. There was a closet but not one hanger to be found. The elevator was so small that if you had luggage you had to wait until there was no one else using it in order to have enough room to bring up your things. But the absolute worst part for us was that there were concerts going on next door both nights and the noise level was so intense that it literally rattled our walls until well after 11pm each night. I will agree that it was a great rate for the location but in future I would definitely pay more for a more comfortable room.

Since we live in the Chicago area, we were looking forward to spending a night in the city. We found the hotel uneventfully, but as we drove up to the hotel, we discovered that the one way street was now two way and there was no signage. There was no one outside to either take the car or tell us which way to go. We drove away and I called the hotel from my cell and was told, "I am with a customer and can't talk to you." We drove around the block and tried again. This time there was a doorman who took the keys. The front desk check in was efficient, although not friendly. The room was small. The only chair was the one at the desk. The two "window seats" were built into the window wells and so high that I could only reach them by climbing up onto the bed. The closet held clothes that looked like someone had left them there; on closer examination it was apparent they were for sale. The bathroom was nice but ordinary. The bath bombs were $8.00 apiece. Was it worth $259.00 plus $40.00 in taxes and $40.00 for parking? NO.

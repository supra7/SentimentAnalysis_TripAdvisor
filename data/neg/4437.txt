Upon arriving I was greeted by a very rude and impatient manager who had no idea how to treat customers with respect. Got to the room and was greeted with a big whiff of aged smoke, even though we picked a non smoking room. Really disgusting. It was probably the most OUTDATED hampton inn I've ever seen. They had old wood cabinets in the bathroom, a very outdated sink counter/flooring/bathtub/toilet. The wallpaper wasn't pleasant and showed its age. The room floor was dirty and I always made a point to have shoes on when walking around. This hotel needs a complete renovation and really fast. I found it absolutely insane the prices they charged to stay in such a run down place. My bill came to over 300 dollars for a weekday rate for one night/ king bedroom. BEWARE. They sneak charges onto your bill.. there is a 30 dollar hotel occupancy tax (whatever THAT is)... along with other charges. When I called to confirm my room, the rate was 219.. on my bill the rate was 229... along with the rest of the charges totaling over $300. (?!).... There is an emergency station very nearby. There were sirens going off at almost every hour of the night. I remember 4:30AM the most because I never got back to sleep after that. It takes valet 20 minutes to get your car. Why? Breakfast was subpar at best. I had some oatmeal and a biscuit. There was no fresh fruit other than some dented apples. The only pro is the closeness to the mag mile, but there are SO many other options for people wanting to be close to shopping. This hotel was absurdly a ripoff and you felt dirtier after having stayed there. Thank heavens for Hiltons 100% guarantee.

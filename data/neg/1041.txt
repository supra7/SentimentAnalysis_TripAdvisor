I stay in Seattle quite a bit for business and thought I would try something other than the Westin. BIG MISTAKE!!! This hotel has been given 3 1/2 stars and in Chicago it would be lucky to get 2. For starters, the room was about 100 square feet, the furniture had to be for decoration because it was so uncomfortable to sit on. The bathroom was barely big enough to turn around in and the shower head was broken. Has anyone ever seen a window air conditioner in a 3 1/2 star hotel? I could hear everything my neighbors in the next room were saying and the traffic on the street started at 5am...bus route right outside. I have no idea how this hotel gt any good ratings but if you want luxury for the price don't stay here!!!!!

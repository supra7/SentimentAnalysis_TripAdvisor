I thought I was getting historic,instead old unkept and dirtyThe mold coming out the aircondition was deadly for my lungs! Im still sick 8 day later!There was Concert near by and we could not sleep,very noisy,very old ,dirty,afraid to open my suit case, my night gown was left and after three calls they stilll did't find it. I suggested they might want to talk to the house keeping and he got nasty with me and said lady they turn in diamonds and watches,why would they want my night gown! Need less to say my bright blue,can't miss it if you clean the room night gown was not returned.I forgot to get it because I was in such a hurry to get out of that hotel I didn't check. When we got off the Clipper it was very late,when we arrived we were greeted by a very nice girl who told me no refunds! I guess she saw the look on my face when we arrived.I would have left but didn't know where to go! The Bedding was so gross,it looked like a by the hour motel!

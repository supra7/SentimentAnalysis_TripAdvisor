My husband and I went to Hacienda Tres Rios on our honeymoon through someone else's timeshare. We were reserved an entire week, but we only ended up staying ONE night because we could not take it anymore!!! First of all, you drive to the hotel in the middle of nowhere!!!! You are literally in a jungle and 20 minutes from playa del carmen and anything!!! As far as the ocean, its black. It is nowhere close to being the beautiful caribbean blue. We tried to walk down the beach to find the beautiful clear water, no luck. If you are going for the clear caribbean water, dont even think about going to this swamp. We were treated as second class citizens the minute we said no to the all-inclusive. As we tried to eat without the all-inclusive, we ended up paying $63 US Dollars for breakfast...ARE YOU KIDDING? There is no way you can go here and not pay the all-inclusive and eat for a reasonable price. The comments on here about timeshare sharks are true. They were going to try to sell to us but then when they were aware of our age, they backed off. And all of the sudden we were not able to get our "welcome package" and take our free shuttle to playa del carmen because we were no longer possible buyers. This place is seriously a joke....Enter the long dirt road into the jungle at your own risk!

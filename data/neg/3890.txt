Traveled to Boston with children who like to swim. Chlorine level in the pool was way too high. Kids had marks on skin, bathing suits faded, and hair congealed into tangled, chlorine-scented mess. It took days for the smell to get out of their hair. Renovation underway in hotel. Loud power tool started at 7 AM. Staff looking for handouts always. Great location. Not so nice on the inside!

Business travelers should avoid this hotel. The front desk service was horrible. I stood at the desk for 20 minutes before they were able to give me a room and this was after 6 pm. The hotel was full of families, so maybe this property is better suited for families. The halls were very noisy all night. The room wasn't the cleanest: the floor was dirty, the wall paper was pealing, and the room smelled of smoke (even though it was a non-smoking room). If you are traveling for business, find a better place.

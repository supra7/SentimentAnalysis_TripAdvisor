I stayed at the Hyatt the weekend of my wedding. The morning after my wedding my laptop was stolen. It was left with the valet's and when the car was loaded up the laptop was "mysteriously" missing. Of course it was brought to the attention of the security and management staff. We have been trying for a week to at least get compensated for the laptop and of course the Hyatt's insurance carrier is denying the claim saying there is no conclusive proof that it's the Hyatt's fault. Also, the hotel failed to inform me of the charge for delivering gift bags to my guests. It's $3/bag, if I had known about it ahead of time I would have made sure that they were at the hotel days in advance of the weekend. As it was all the guests did not receive bags. Also, the hotel has a website called passkey portal that is supposed to help keep track of your hotel guests. It lets you see who checks in for how long, etc. This didn't really do a great job. If guests made reservations by phone or in person it didn't track them even if they clearly stated they were there for a wedding and part of a group.

VERY old hotel (we normally love old buildings), Bad part of town, local cops told us it is a no-go area after 6.30pm and they were right. Homeless people everywhere in this area. No tea making facilities, No Aircon, No Fridge, filthy room (thanks for the pair of ladies panties laying in the middle of the room). Noisy, No Parking, No restaurant. The bad hotel in a 5 week trip. Pay the money and stay elsewhere. p.s. I tried to tell the full story on this place but Trip advisor refused to print it. Read my other reviews and see how my reviews are truthful and accurate and generous.

The front desk staff was extremely rude, particularly the arrogant foreign dude who could barely speak english!! I was lied to about late checkout. Confirmed twice that 'Oh yes, late checkout is no problem.. 3:00 pm.' Even checked one week prior to my stay and was told, again, NO PROBLEM'. However when I checked in I was rudely told by the foreign dude that due to full occupancy there will be no late checkout. And that I WILL adhere to the 11:00 am checkout. I will never stay here again and I have already informed a LOT of people of my experience. All it takes is word of mouth people. Besides that, it isn't worth the $$$$$..

I am staying here right now and all I can say is I can't wait to check out tomorrow. The room seems unclean and completely un-rehabbed - except for the AWFUL florescent lighting and bright white shades. I will not turn on a light all night - especially considering that the awful lighting will make it easier to see the disgustingness of the room. The heating cooling vents are covered in dust and what looks like asbestos - they are also super loud and annoying. Internet ios extraordinarily slow. Finally, this is just my room probably, but the mirror on one of the doors is half ripped off with peeling paint. I paid an outrageous rate for this awful room and want to cry. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member I expect, and usually get, more from my hilton properties. This place stinks.

Arriving in Seattle we stayed for one night in the Radisson Hotel at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. The location of the hotel at the airport is good - just some minutes away from arrival and departure. The room and the qualitiy of the bed are satisfactory. The reason for the rating is the fact that we had the impression that the bed-linen was used. This should not happen in any hotel and especially not in a Radisson.

We are currently staying here and are extremely disappointed at the service or lack thereof from the front desk people tonight. Since we checked-in here, I did not have a good impression of the hotel. Everything looked dated and the view from our 2 lanais is a roof and an air vent. Stunningly disappointing. Thanks, Hyatt. Then tonight the coin-operated self-laundry had a broken down coin changer. Of course, we will go to front desk for help and all we got was "we don't have change" and no effort to help us out. We had to go around ourselves looking for change (individual shops, bartenders)for more than an HOUR. The staff at the restaurant-- JAPENGO were the ones who looked for change, called other departments and asked their staff for quarters. Thank you guys at Japengo for going out of your way to help us out. Maybe you could share some good customer service pointers to your Front Desk people since they badly need it. In addition, the renovation that was started this week made staying at this hotel during the daytime intolerable. The noise and the dusty/musty smell along the corridors make for an awful start of our mornings. SELF-PARKING IS TERRIBLE. They should reserve an area for those who actually paid to stay at their hotel (after all, they charge us that ridiculous resort fee)and not go round and round looking for an empty spot since one has to fight for spots along with the hotel visitors (for their evening shows and dinners) We paid good money for this vacation hoping to have a good time but that's not going to happen at this hotel. I cannot wait what other horrible experience awaits us tomorrow. I will never stay here again and will make sure to advise all my friends and colleagues not to stay here

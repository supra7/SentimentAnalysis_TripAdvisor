We stayed in this hotel on 3 April 2009. This must have been one of the worst hotelstays we have ever had. We were given a room on the 9th floor, even though we had booked in January 2009. As a result, it felt as if we were sleeping right in the middle of the landing strip, and I counted 43 flights landing or taking off that night. It was horrible. The staff were very friendly and trying to be helpful, but the only other room available was also on the 9th floor. I travel about 6 months a year for work, including staying in airport hotels, but this is without doubt the worst experience I have ever had with an airport hotel. Sure, the location is very convenient, and the rooms are very well appointed, but the noise level - at least on the 9th floor - is maddening.

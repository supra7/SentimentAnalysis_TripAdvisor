Very dissappointed with the service. It was our honeymoon and we didn't get any sort of congratulations, or special welcome. The person at the service desk said "well I guess we can send you a bottle of champagne" which came a day later and it wasn't chilled. We were offered some sort of upgrade to a better view of the ocean for an additional charge, but then lost access to the special floor we originally had access to that offered free snacks and had a cocktail reception in the evenings. The service at the pool was OK, but later in the day as the pool hours were coming to a close, the staff would begin stacking the chairs all around us. The worst part about this was the staff would drag the chairs across the cement which made a horrible noise. Worse then fingernails on a chalkboard. I feel they had no desire to please their customers or make the stay as relaxing and enjoyable as possible. We went to the Four Seasons on the Big Island of Kona for the second half of our trip and the service was exactly what we were looking for. It didn't cost much more then the Hyatt.

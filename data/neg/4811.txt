I stayed for one night at the Sheraton Dallas for a meeting. My entire experience was subpar, beginning with a long line for check-in, followed by a very, very strange and robotic front desk clerk who immediately handed back my Starwood Gold card instead of looking at it weand then asked me if I was a Starwood Preferred Guest member. When I responded affirmatively, she just shook her head and said "No, no, no." Although she did locate my SPG number and apparently added it to my reservation, I did not receive an upgrade or even a room on the SPG floor of the hotel. My room was tiny, with a space for a fridge but no actual fridge, wet carpet, a rattling AC unit, and an odd, smoky smell. The capper was when I was already in bed, well after 11 pm, and two different housekeeping staff members pounded on my door, insisting that I had called to ask them to bring up a room service menu. I had not, obviously, although there was no hotel information in the room; the second staff member responded very rudely and sarcastically when I asked her not to return and that I was trying to sleep. Ironically, I was exhausted because I had been awakened by a 4:30 am false fire alarm at a different Sheraton in Arlington, VA that morning. The rooms where our meetings were held were adequate and the food was fairly good, but I would not recommend this hotel, especially for leisure travelers. I am glad that my company picked up the tab for the room, because I would be incredibly disappointed if I had paid for this room and the incredibly low level of service.

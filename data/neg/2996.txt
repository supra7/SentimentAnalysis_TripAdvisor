I'm not the kind of person who writes bad reviews about hotels. Hotel Dama was cheap, had a very nice,spacious and relatively clean room - and that is certainly a thing to consider. However, the problem resides on their staff... I had two friends in Rome that were looking for a last-minute reservation and, at the beginning, the owner said that it wouldn't be any problem for them to share the room with me...When my two friends arrived he started to say rude things for them about their arrival, and it tuns out he started to complain that I was disturbing the place due to my nationality...Ridiculous and offensive to say the least!

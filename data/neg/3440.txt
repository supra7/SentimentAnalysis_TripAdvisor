We were told it will cool down. We should have never tried this place again, but some friends went as well and we tried again. Never, ever, again will I stay at this property. Our room was so hot, both nights, if we were not with another couple staying right next to us, we would have left when they told us that our room would get cooler as the night went on. They felt bad for us even, because their room was freezing compared to ours! They had a huge group there at the hotel and I guess the rooms were all full. This hotel is in a great location, but the service and property is horrible.

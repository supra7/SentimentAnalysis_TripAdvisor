My husband and I have stayed at the Sheraton several times in the past and enjoyed the hotel's close proximity to the city's highlights. On this occasion, my daughter and her new husband had only a few days before they were separated again, so my husband and I thought we would like to give them a couple of days in the city. When I called, I made it clear this was a honeymoon trip, we wanted it to be special, and I wanted to have my credit card available to the couple. I was assured there was be upgrades, champagne waiting in the room, and the young couple would be treated well. A couple of days later, I called to just check on the reservations. I wanted to be sure it was a special time. There was no note regarding my requests, no note about a honeymoon, nothing!!! After four different calls, each time explaining the circumstances over again, the manager assured us all would be well and the couple would be treated well. I didn't have much faith. Sure enough, the room was mediocre, not on a special floor as suggested, nothing was in the room to welcome them as we were told....nothing was done! It was so disappointing. I will not be staying at the Sheraton again. It is hard to believe that after that many phone calls to get something "right", the place failed miserably to meet any expectation!

The elevator of this multistory hotel was broken; and no one was available to help me carry my bags up the tight winding stairs to my room. I repeatedly alerted staff to the fact that my room was cold; eventually I had to conclude that it was not a matter of their raising the 4th-floor thermostat, but that no hot air was coming out of the vent at any time. The staff were completely unaware of this problem and completely at a loss for what to do. I had no heat all night long. My requests for a partial refund were met with deferrals: you'll have to come/call back and speak to the manager at a later time. For a room in this badly-kept hotel in Philadelphia, I paid $150 incl. tax! This hotel offers *relatively* affordable accommodations in a wonderfully central and bustling location, so it's a shame that it is being run so poorly. Also, while the central Rodeway Inn website mentions a reward program, the hotel itself had no information on how to get credit for my stay, and I still can't figure it out.

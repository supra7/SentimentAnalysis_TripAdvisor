Pros ------- 1. Checkin anytime 2. Great gym 3. Overhead lighting in the room! 4. Free internet in Lobby area, supposedly Cons: EVERYTHING ELSE ----------------------------------- 1. Rude, incompetent front desk staff that lied to me about what my corporate rate covered. 2. Scratchy linens, uncomfortable bed 3. Ridiculously overpriced restaurant and in-room dining 4. Loud drilling and hammering that lasted all day and started, for the love of god, at 7 AM. Ridiculous! 5. Tiny, tiny, tiny bathroom. The sink area was so small that I had to put my makeup on my side table. 6. Tiny, tiny room that was very cramped. 7. In room internet is $12.95/day! I could go on and on about how awful this hotel really is, and I really wish I had not stayed here. I don't recommend it for business travelers at all. The hotel overall may have been a 4-star a long time ago but it's no more than a seriously overpriced 2-star, and my room was definitely a 2-star room.

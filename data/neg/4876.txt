We stayed Friday and Saturday night, July 24 and July 25 and I cannot remember a worse experience at a hotel. First was their parking deception......they do not have any free parking. They have valet parking for $17 a night or parking across the street and behind a BBQ restaurant, for $9 a night. Don't think you can find parking for free because it's not possible unless you want to possibly have your car towed. Checking into the hotel took about 2 hours friday afternoon. The parking attendants (kids) who parked the cars were all a bunch of wise guys. My wife checked in and I waited in the car and I had about four or five different attendants ask me for Valet parking and when I said no they all had some wise guy answer back to me. I wanted to carry my own luggage but could not get a luggage carry even though I asked one of the parking attendants for one....he said no I could not use it even though he was just standing there and not using it at the time. Second, the room was way too small and did not have either a microwave($10/night extra) or a refrigerator($10/night extra) unless you paid the extra charge for it. You also have to pay extra if you want to use the internet in the room.($10/night). Third, we were put on the 11th floor of the North tower so we were just that much further away from the parking and from the main pool which was at the end of the south lobby. My advice to anybody with a family on a budget who stays in Daytona more than one night is to go to an extended stay hotel such as The Residence Inn Daytona Beach or a similar hotel not on the beach. These hotels come with fully equipped kitchens including refrigerator and microwave and you're only a couple minutes away from the beach. If you must stay right on the beach, beware you will pay up to 50% more on lodging, food and parking than staying a couple of miles down Speedway Blvd.

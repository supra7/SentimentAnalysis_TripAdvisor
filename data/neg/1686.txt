My husband and I just spent 9 nights at the Hyatt Maui, from Jan. 12th to 20th, 2006 in the Lahaina Tower. For the money we paid, we found the hotel room not up to the standards we expected of this class of hotel. The rugs were stained and dirty. The lampshades were even dirty and smudgy. Sheets were only changed every 4th day. Patio was tacky looking. Thought there should be more attention to keeping rooms spotlessless clean for such a high room rate. Layout of room was good, although bathroom a little too small. Plumbing did not function well on arrival, so plumber had to be called to unplug the sink and make the toilet flush properly. Found the swimming pool to be way too crowded. The chaise lounges are jammed together so tightly that you can't even stand up beside the chaise, you have to crawl onto it from the end. Not acceptable for older people like ourselves. Also chairs placed too close to edge of pool making it impossible to walk around the pool to decide where to get in. Pool needs a railing to hold onto when stepping into shallow end. Again, not suitable for older people and there were a lot of older people at this resort. Outstanding breakfast buffet in Swan Court, if you can stand all the birds flying in and around the restaurant. Staff very pleasant for the most part. Grounds are beautiful. Parking difficult at best. The spa was very nice and we used it twice for a pedicure and a manicure. Loved Maui and will return, but definitely not to this Hyatt Resort! We think it looks and feels like it is past its prime.

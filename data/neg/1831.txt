Would NOT recommend this hotel. Booked a family room for 140 SGD (Can't believe they would price their rooms as such). Luckily we had not paid as when we got to the room it was without functioning air conditioning (90F), it was dark despite lighting, it had no windows, exposed electrical wiring/cords were noted taped to the walls and it had a very dirty looking bathroom. The front desk staff were very unhelpful and appeared surprised that we may point out these deficits. We were able to walk around the corner to the Parklane hotel which for 40 more SGD were able to find us a room on a Saturday night. Little India itself is a fantastic place.....Post Ambassador hotel all was well.

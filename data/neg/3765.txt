We have stayed in this campground each summer, for the past five summers. Why I keep subjecting my family to the same punishment is a mystery. This last trip we intentionally visited weekday in an attempt to miss the crowd. No such luck. The place was about 80% capacity, mostly with groups that knew each other. We somehow got stuck in the middle of a loud group who seemed to be on Hawaii time zone. Quiet times were not observed or enforced and like a bar, it didn't get quiet until around 2 am. I had to put earplugs in and run the A/C for white noise. The WiFi for some reason ALWAYS locks up my devices. I will say that the staff is friendly, the park is secure, clean and maintained pretty well. It's also pretty close to quite a few attractions. But if you're looking for some peace and quiet when you return from a day of sightseeing, look elsewhere.

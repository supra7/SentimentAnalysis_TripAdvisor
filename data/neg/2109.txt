Noone expects to park in Walgreens while on vacation. Unless you do not mind parking in a retails parking lot and wish to drive far to get to Duval Street and other tourist attractions and museums, do not book this venue. I will never stay here again. p.s. Paid for Ocean Front room and all I could see from our room where power lines running across the Gulf/ Not our idea of Oceam Front!!!

Wow. this place is Lame. staff and valets were all very friendly but the place itself just blows. Did the people who designed this place consider putting a Bar outside? There are no swim up pool bars and not one bar outside where you can sidle up and grab a seat and meet other guests. Yes, you can have a drink outside from a waiter who will go to a makeshift bar (two fold out tables and some coolers where your drink gets made). I was astonished that I couldn't sit at a bar outside while on vacation at a "resort" on the Caribbean sea. it doesn't make any sense to me. the staff will tell you that there's a bar outside at the Grill but there is no bar to sit at. just some crappy tables and waiter service. the whole design of the place seems like non existent. the one actual bat that you can sit at is a crappy 'sports bar'. zero charm. so again, there is no tropical or outdoor bar in the whole place. the dining room and fancy Mexican restaurant are again generic and not romantic in the slightest. who designed this place?? did they run out of money after building the structure and just put zero thought into the design?? other than the water being light blue you might as well be anywhere. our friends were staying at the Grand Mayan just up the road and it was like a different world. absolutely gorgeous lobby and stunning pool areas with swim up bars and amazing settings to enjoy indoors and out. the restaurant del lago was beautiful open air where the buffet is and it's just a stunningly designed space similar to the stunning lobby which is an 80ft high palapa. gorgeous. Hacienda is so generic and does nothing to make you feel like you are in a Caribbean resort. Once you see the other options nearby you would never choose this place again.

A group of 30 of us stayed here January 26-30 2012. My toilet fluhed every 30 minutes and they didn't fix it. I sked for 3 days for blankets and when I got them one was wet and teh other dirty. Many of my fellow travels complained that the heat in their rooms didn't work and it was below 35 at night. They promised us they would open breakfast early for us on Sunday so that we could get to our event. They didn't bother to tell the staff though and it didnt open in time for us. The rooms are old the carpets stained and teh pictures they show are all lies. Bypass this for something else. They promised no longer than a 15 minutes wait for a shuttle to take you locally. I had to wait 45 minutes on Friday. On Sunday morning when they promised us shuttle service at 7 a.m. we had to wait because the shuttle driver was parking cars (that's what we were told)

My husband and I live on the big island and went to Maui to see visiting friends. All we needed was a clean and safe place to sleep and bathe. The first room we stayed in was in an older building...we had the pleasure of carrying out suitcases up the stairs a few flights to get to our room as there was no elevator in this building. The hallway carpet was OLD and disgusting. The mattress felt like it was from the 70's or 80's and the quilts looked like they had seen better days. The bathroom....ugh. Mildew stains on all the grouting...if there was actually grouting present. There was a lot of worn/broken grout. The room with the toilet and shower was no more than 30 inches wide and maybe 5-6 feet long. I am a petite woman and the shower felt claustrophobic for me. Had we not arrived to our room at 11:00PM, we would have moved BUT I somehow managed to fall asleep. We got a new room the following day that had clearly been redone sometime in the past 5-10 years and the mattress, although firm, was better than the first. The only reason the hotel does not get a 0 was because the second bedroom at least provided the basic clean hotel room. All this for the Kamaaina rate of about $130. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not stay here hoping for a reasonable choice for a honeymoon/romantic getaway....maybe if you are traveling with 2 kids and want to fit everyone in one room?

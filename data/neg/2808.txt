Great hotel, business district location, so only if you really need to. If you are on business I would check elswhere. Purely on the service levels. If you need anything other than a room not sure this this hotel works. Bar prices are London or New York. If it is busy with a conference, forget room service. If you ring to ask where it is they cancel your order. Apart from that good rooms.

The hotel was nice yes and in a good location but the valet was terrible! I worked for a Hilton property and I was very embarrassed to even say I worked for the company after receiving the service that I did. I pulled into the hotel and no one wanted to direct us where we should go, no one took our bags, valet was just standing around didn't even approach us when we pulled up we had to go to them. The Hilton property that I worked at the valet is super attentive along with any other time I have had valet. Then when we walked into our room there was wallpaper ripping off the walls and hairs on the lamp shades, I was mortified. No one was helpful at directing us it just seemed like a very unorganized hotel I couldn't believe it.

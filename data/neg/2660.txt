We stayed in LA for 4 nights and I chose this hotel as it was closest one to the Hollywood sights. The only thng that spoilt it was the room smelt damp and the view was of a brick wall. I used my Priority points and as a valued customer hoped I would get a better room than the one we got. it was close to the sights though so if all you want is a overnight stay then it will be OK.

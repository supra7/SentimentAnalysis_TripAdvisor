The building the Sorrento in is very cool. Its a neat, old historic building. Unfortunately, for the price you pay, the hotel has an overall run-down feel. The night we checked in, there was one valet and one hotel desk clerk and they struggled to handle the 3 people that happened to arrive at the same time for check in. A simple request for some extra help was met with sorry I've only got one guy working tonight. Well for the 350 buck (275 for the room +tax +parking), I want some better service. The room itself was very average. The bed was nice, but the bathroom was really poor. Tiles were dirty and very standard appointments. Overall, this should be a two star hotel that charges 125 a night. For the four star traveler, this was a horrible place and I would not stay there again.

Checked in -- wish I had walked in and cancelled. The odor in the room was horrendous. Tried opening the window to air, however when closing the window the odor accumulated to the point that it would give you a headache. It was a nicely decorated room and spacious with a wonderful showerhead but just can't understand the odor. Tried an air freshner but to no avail -- just go somewhere else. I assure you that it's worth more than the odor (possibly a spray they use).

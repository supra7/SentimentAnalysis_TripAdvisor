First off i checked in to the hotel the third week of January for the weekend in Seattle with some friends it took nothing short of thirty minutes to check in which is a nuisance. finally after getting to the room was unimpresed to say the least i would compare the room quality to that of a motel 6, given they did have a fire place which added a nice touch and the bathroom was redone. me and my friend had spilt the room bringing my total to 89 dollars, the next day i see a charge on my account for 500 dollars in addition to the original 89. after discussing the problem with the hotel clerk she siad that there was nothing she could do about it and also told me some numbers that wouldnt add up no matter which way we looked at them. Then she had the audacity to say she had no clue how the hotel billing system worked. yeah no clue and it was her job. on top of all of the problems with the billing i had to rescan my key card eveytime i left my room. the tv just shuts off at radom times the is a horrible clicking the the ventilation the will wake you up in the middle of the night in room 337. we satyed there for 3 days and not once did the maid take out the trash or make the beds there are several hidden charges including the 40 dollars a day for parking your car there and outragous taxes for the room. dont ever stay at the hotel.

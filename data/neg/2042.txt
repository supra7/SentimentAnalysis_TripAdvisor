We had problems from the start. For one, we were told we had a free upgrade but when we got there the upgrade was an extra nightly surcharge. The "upgrade" basically included an extra bathroom and a kitchenette. In addition, they charge you a mandatory $15/day fee that includes access to the fitness center (usually included in most hotels), complementary water and coffee in the rooms (also usually included), free 800-number dialing (wow, thanks), and access to the parking garage, among a few other silly things. They charge delivery for room service plus an extra mandatory gratuity (more than 20%) on top of it. And, to top it off, there was no hot water the next morning for showers. When we complained about these things, management basically couldn't have cared less. We told them we were going to write a bad review and they said "fine, do whatever you want." We checked out after only one night and had a fabulous time the rest of the trip at the Palazzo.

Rooms have a lovely subdued elegance, and the hotel itself is beautiful. But no champagne glasses on new years eve, seriously, nor wireless in the rooms? I know this was an old monastery but would be nice to have hot showers in the mornings and a less cool reception. Restaurant recommendations? A shrug and the receptionist pointed down the road. 'there are plenty down there, go have a look.' um ok. 4 star, 300 euros a night, and a country with such high youth unemployment youd think they could do better. Note that one of the receptionists was more helpful than the youngest girl there, and the older gentleman at the bar was lovely. But mostly the service is disinterested and inadequate for 4 star. Get some staff who know the areas good restaurants and bars. Breakfast is good on the upside.

Located in an area of Deira no taxi drivers seem to know, not even when provided with a hotel card with a map on the reverse side. ROOM: Small single rooms, some with a view to an apartment building wall only 3 metres from the hotel window. Better rooms have a view to the street and a mosque across the street, so that prayer calls wake you up sometimes even before 5am. Bed mattresses are very hard and springs can be felt through the bedsheets. Noisy but efficient AC machine on the wall. No reading lamp provided either for the bed or the desk, even when asked. BATHROOM: All floors are tiled with shiny glazed tiles, even the bathroom floors, so make sure you hold on to something in the bathroom so you won't slip and fall. The rooms are provided with bathroom slippers, but after a shower they are just as slippery as your bare feet (hence the name). Lukewarm water drips from the shower head at an amazing speed of 2 litres per minute. Dangerous-looking bare wire ends hang from the bathroom ceiling. SERVICE: Plain and monotonous toast + omelet breakfasts are served by a nice old man looking like Manuel from Fawlty Towers 30 year later. Rest of the large male staff are much less service-oriented. Rooms are cleaned only if you leave your key when you go out. A rotting banana and other foodstuffs from a previous occupant were waiting in the clothes closet when I checked in. Missing remote control for the TV was never provided. When you ask the receptionists to call a taxi, the bellboy comes and leads you to a busy street corner 100 metres from the door and hails a taxi for you. When I asked for the missing hotel book provided by my tour operator, they just said someone took it and made no effort to ask for a new copy from the tour operator. In other words, truly 'effortless' service throughout.

A change of plans had us cancel our stay at the Ace Hotel. When we called to cancel - a week before our cancelled trip, we got a cancellation number. A month later, $240.57 (Canadian) had been charged on our credit card but we have since trashed the cancellation record. Given, we should have kept the number but the manager had been unhelpful, unsympathetic and snobby! Shame on them for being in the service industry. For $240.57, they have lost not only my business, but also of my colleagues and friends.

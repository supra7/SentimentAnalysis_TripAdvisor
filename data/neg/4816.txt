We booked online to stay the night after a 3000 person dinner. When we arrived at the hotel shortly after 3:00 PM, they had closed valet parking for guest and the parking garage was full. Upon check in, the King room we reserved was not available. We also heard other guest complaining that suites they had reserved had been given away. We took another room with two queen beds and we were given two vouchers for the buffet breakfast. Ok, that was acceptible. I did appreciate it. However, the person at the desk did not ask for any ID, so in reality they could have given our room to anyone. Once in the room, we found remnants of previous guests that had not been cleaned out. Nothing big, just tags in the top of the closet. But it does make you wonder how well it was cleaned. We had a small snack in the restaurant to tied us over until the dinner that night, signed the bill back to our room, only to be chased down in the lobby. At the desk, they didn't ask if we wanted to put down a cc for further purchases so the restaurant could not charge to the room. Again, nothing big, just embarrasing. The next morning, the staff at the restaurant was incredibly rude. The coffee cup I was offered was dirty, and the waiter slammed it into the saucer as he took it away. When we asked to break a $20 in order to tip, he was rude again. We are putting together a convention in Dallas for another proffesional organization we belong to. Even though the bid they gave us was good, I can assure you it will not be with the Sheraton.

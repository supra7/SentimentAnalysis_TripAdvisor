We booked this room as part of the Victoria Clipper Ferry Package. I had 2 nights at Victoria Marriott Inner Harbor booked, then decided we would return too late for the boarding of our cruise leaving on Saturday. We changed our plans and came to Seattle on the late ferry the night before. We were offered this hotel to substitute, with not many other choices for the same price. This no way campares to the Marriott , but we made the best of it. Rooms were dingy and bathrooms old and dated but clean , we managed. Good Location and breakfast the next morning helped. I would not choose to stay here again, it was not horrible. Friendly staff also.

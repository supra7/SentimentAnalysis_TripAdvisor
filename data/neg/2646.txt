The hotel is well situated in the Hollywood Walk of Fame area, within close walking distance to Runyan Canyon, restaurants, Jimmy Kimmel's show, the Kodak and Grauman's theatres. However, the access to the parking area from Highland is pretty impossible. Too many lanes of cars, high traffic area, makes it too difficult to navigate in and out of the valet serviced parking garage. The hotel and city need to create a solution, as we saw a multi car vehicle accident and witnessed many near ones. It shouldn't be such a headache to get in and out of the hotel attached garage and there's no other way to approach the hotel via car.

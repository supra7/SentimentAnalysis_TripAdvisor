We booked reservations at this hotel directly through the hotel's website several weeks in advance. When we arrived, we were told by the front desk staff that despite the reservation with confirmation number in our hand, that they had no room for us because their manager had told them to overbook the property. Apparently having a reservation is meaningless at this property. They did put us in a neighboring property, but the quality was substantially less than the Embassy. I will never book reservations with this chain again. I would strongly advise others to assume that your reservation is worthlessless, because ours certainly was.

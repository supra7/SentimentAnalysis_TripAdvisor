Nicely laid out lobby Room was NOT cleaned (dirty toilet, stains on marble floor were easy to see, carpet had fresh stains ...brown...ewh...that someone had tried to clean but only made the carpet wet and made it feel dirty) Bed frames were scoffed and had dirt stains on them TV kept breaking up The rooms were not sound proofed and I could hear people coming and going into the next room (at early morning hours) Management was told about the concerns regarding the room cleanliness, and told me they would clean it the next day at 10am but that did not happen and only when I called AGAIN did they come up to clean the room. Very irritating, and made what could have been a pleasant stay, very uneasy.

Today is July 1st 2011. I had to download the app to my iPhone and write this review, because I was so upset that I was lied to by the front desk lady, as well as the manger. When I confronted them with their lies, they had the IQs to create more blatant lies. I stayed at the corner room on the 16th floor, it was. Good size room with 2 beds. I asked for another rollaway bed, I had done this at the Marriott Copley square hotel where the room was much smaller. The front desk lady ( extremely unpleasant) said 'no , it's a fire harzard'. I knew it was a lie, because Boston rules And regulations should applied go both hotels. I asked for proof of of the rules, she could not provide. Her manager called , he said it was not Boston reggulation, but hyatt's policy, however, this is a policy he can not show me ( a customer), when asked why a hotel has some secret policy which is not open to customer, he again changed to another story, saying something like the maid does not want to have a rollaway bed because it is too crowded. How strange? I told him this room is 30% larger than the one I stayed at the marriot Boston, if it was not crowded at the Marriott ( they always brought the rollaway when asked) , why it should be crowded at the Haytt? Here's his answer: ' you can go back to the Marriott' So for those of you who've traveled around, here's your taste of the professionalism at the Hyatt Boston. I am extreme upset, but this is the July 4th , leaving is not an easy option, my only choice is get on here to write my review.

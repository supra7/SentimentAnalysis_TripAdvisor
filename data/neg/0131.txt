My brother, friend and I decided to take an overnight trip to Seattle. WE checked into the hotel and upon arrival realized this was defiantly not what the website made it out to be. but we were only sleeping there so it was not a big deal. We had a great time in the city until we returned to the hotel to find all of our stuff had been stolen. We immediately called the police and notified the front desk. The hotel did not even give us a free night at the hotel. Nor do they seem to care that if we were in the room we could have potentially been hurt or maybe killed. When we spoke with the "manager" he could not even provide us with the owners name. This place is extremely sketchy. I Would not recommend anyone to stay here.

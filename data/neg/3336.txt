I would definately not recommend this hotel because they have bed bugs! I stayed there 2 weeks ago on October 4th and the morning after I had lots of bites on my fingers and in various other places. And when I returned home I continued to get more bites only to discover that the bugs had gotten into my luggage and are now in my home. I would suggest being VERY cautious before you stay there but the best thing to do would be to find a new hotel.

We picked this hotel based on the pictures and the price on Expedia. The rack rate charged by the hotel is insane considering I could have gotten a decent motel/lodge for half the price. The room that was given to us was about 12'x9'. 12x9 doesn't sound too bad but put a queen sized bed, two end tables, a dresser/tv stand, and a lounge seat and you don't have enough roomm to breathe! The bathroom is no different. Good luck sitting on the toilelt. You need to be aware of surroundings. As soon as you sit down and sit upright, you feel a sharp pain as the bathroom sink enbed's inteself into your left shoulder blade! I would recommend using priceline or whatever else you can to go for a better hotel. If you want to save money, stay out of downtown and def. stay away from this hotel. It is renovated but they didn't spend a lot of effort on it.

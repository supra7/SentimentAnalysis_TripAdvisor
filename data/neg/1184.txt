We stayed at this hotel on route to and from Mexico - Dec. 16th and 27th. Although we had confirmed a rate prior to arrival, they wanted to charge us a higher rate. We stood our ground and received the rate we had been quoted. They were very disorganized and it took a great deal of time to check in. We wanted adjoining rooms and at first were given adjoining rooms with one on the 1st and 4th floors. I guess we forgot to say that we wanted them to adjoin to each other!! It took forever for them to pick us up at the airport on our return and when we checked in they charged us two different rates for our rooms. Again, they made the change but you had to be vigilant and check your bill carefully. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The breakfast was ok but not as good as other Hamptons we have used. I would prefer to stay at the Hampton Inn near the South Centre Mall the next time we are flying out of Seattle.

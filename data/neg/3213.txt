The only boutique reference in the hotel would be the word in the sales brochure, the rooms are sub-standard, miniscule in size, beds ordinary and the glaring sickly pink the hotel leaves you with a most distressing impression. Honestly for all the hotel selection in Singapore this Hotel represents terrible value, location and style.

I have just stayed at the W Hongong with my wife, daughter and parents-in-law for 3 days on a stopover on our way to Bali but our stay was covered with mishaps and problems from start to finish. First, the airport transfer the hotel organised broke down on the highway, then our rooms werent ready when we arrived at the hotel, then the rooms that we booked werent interconnecting as promised and once we finally got our connecting rooms we still had trouble with the room service. Granted, the hotel staff and in particular the welcome relations manager Alex Beatie were keen to sort everything out for us and make up for the bad experience but obviously these things shouldnt have happened in the first place and the resoltutions should have been smoother and quicker (eg we had to wait until 6pm for our rooms to be ready!). As an SPG Platinum Member i woud have expected that the hotel is better prepared for my arrival and also prioritizes my requests over others. On the bright side the design of the hotel, the rooms, the spa and the rooftop pool remain top selling points and the location and easy conncetion to the airport are also a plus. But in the end its the staff and the service that make a hotel truely 5* and here there seem to be a few weaknesses...

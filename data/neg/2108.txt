Our main problem at Parrot Key Resort was a security issue. At 2:00 in the morning, I was up with my daughter when I heard someone enter the front door downstairs. I sent my husband down there and by the time he got in there, there was already a man standing inside our room!! He quickly said that he thought we needed help with a problem, although he did not announce who he was or what his job was. My husband told him to leave. The following morning, I made 4 trips to the front desk to figure out who this man was. He not only had the card to get into our room, he also opened the door with a deadbolt key...Scary. We thought at first that he may have been a security guard, but the description of the man did not match the security guard. So, they had no idea who he was or what he was doing in our place (could have been there to steal or to hurt one of our children). They acted as if it was no big deal. There was no one in management there to speak to, they only have one person at the customer no service desk. It was handled completely inappropriately. Multiple emails and letters have been sent to the property manager, but i have never received a response or apology from anyone. They have a huge breach in their security at this resort. If you want to feel safe with your family, I would not recommend taking them there.

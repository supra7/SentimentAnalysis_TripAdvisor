The hotel room was tiny. The bathroom and shower was so small I was unable to dry off in the bathroom. I had to step out of the bathroom to dry off. The bathroom was the same size as an airplane bathroom. There was poor lighting in the room and only one mini mirror in the bathroom, Could not put my make up on in the bathroom, mirror to small. I would not recommend this hotel.

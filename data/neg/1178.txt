Great location, close to 7-11, Target, Southcenter mall, Starbucks and lots of restaurants. Our last time in Seattle I booked a hotel 2 hours from the airport, and after flying 5 hours from Atlanta this was a bad idea. This time we made it to the hotel in minutes, with th rest of the day to relax and recover. We used Hilton points to get a free room, so I can't complain too much, but if I had paid I would have been a little disappointed. The check-in was great, very friendly and helpful staff. The room on the 8th floor had a stale/foul odor, and if we were staying more than one night I would have asked to change. We brought air freshener so it was OK. This is another hotel with no exhaust fans in the bathrooms, so air freshener can help. I like the two room suites, plenty big, plenty of counterspace, and the room was clean. The walls are paper thin, but there's nothing they can do about that. When our neighbor's cell phone rang (it was on vibrate) I thought it was ours. Wow! Fortunately we had quiet neighbors and got a good night's sleep. I read the great reviews on breakfast, but we didn't go. At 8:30 there were 50 people in line, same at 9:00. By 9:30 the line was down to 40, but I already picked up our brakfast at Burger King down the street. Maybe it's just because it was Saturday, and the hotel was sold out, with lots of familes (softball tournament), but I didn't have the patience for that line. The Manager's reception from 5:30 to 7:30 pm was great, almost no waiting for drinks. We went to the bar after, and the entertainment was great. A girl singing and playing keyboards with mostly recorded music, but she was great. Charging $9.95 a day for internet access is so.... 20th century! There's a clear signal from the Best Western across the street, for free of course, so don't pay. Overall, some good, some bad.

This hotel is a complete sham. The "economy" rooms are a joke. I paid $189/night for one of the smallest rooms I have ever seen (smaller than many rooms I have seen in Europe) It gets MUCH worse. The room is horrendous. There are huge stains on the carpet, the paint is chipping off the walls, and I had to have my bedspread changed the first night I was here because there were yellow stains all over the front. The bathroom is tiny; we're talking 2x2 shower here, and the tile is so dingy, I wore flip flops while showering. The toilet has yellow water and ring where it was stained. ON TOP OF ALL THIS- the AC didn't work in the middle of summer!! What did I try to do to rectify the situation- 1. had bedspread changed. when I asked housekeeping to take a second look at the bathroom, she said that's just the way it is- "old hotel and all". 2.Complained about no AC twice and asked to switch rooms. I was apologized to- apparently it was out throughout the entire hotel (but somehow the lobby was nice and cool) I was asssured it wold be fixed by that evening. It was 90 degrees and humid today in Boston- no AC is not an option. especially when I am paying almost $200 a night. Now I'm sitting in my hot, stuffy, prision with no relief. AC still not fixed. I would NEVER stay here again, and I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. I'm sure the non-economy rooms are better, but not worth a penny.

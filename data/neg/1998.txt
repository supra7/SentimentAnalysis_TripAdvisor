I got stuck with the Trump through a Priceline submission. (Which itself was a total scam - after "naming my price," they ended up tacking on a pile of fees and taxes and charged more than 50% higher than I agreed to, with no recourse. The price I name should be the price, period! This isn't the Trump's problem, although they tacked on a "resort fee" the day-of, as well... but worth a mention, anyway.) I was staying at the Trump a couple nights with an extended family member. The hotel was very well appointed and what you'd expect for 5-stars, but when we got to the room we found only one bed. Apparently, the advertised two beds actually included a fold-out couch. When we phoned the front desk, they told us the only way to get two real beds was to upgrade to a penthouse suite at considerable additional cost. When housekeeping made up the sofa bed, it had a thin sheet with no quilt or comforter, and I had to sleep and shiver all night directly by an air conditioning vent. The sofa was quite uncomfortable and very small - at my height, my feet were hanging off the end! I imagine the Trump could respond with "buyer beware" and say that I should have known that this was a business suite, but it wasn't possible for me to know this since the hotel was sprung on me by Priceline. I noted above that the Priceline scam charges weren't the Trump's fault, but what is their fault is that they're associated with Priceline at all. I'd humbly suggest that the product they offer is not at all what most travel-site customers would expect to get, and they should really get off these sites and focus on marketing elsewhere so that unsuspecting users don't get stuck with this again. Again, a very nice place, but not at all what I was looking for.

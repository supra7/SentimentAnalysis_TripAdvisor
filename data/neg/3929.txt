We were terribly disappointed by this hotel. During our first night we were awakened by screaming and pounding on the door of the room beside us by some man who was clearly intoxicated. This lasted for quite a while and was actually quite scary. However since it was NYE we hoped it wouldn't occur the next night. The next morning the room service dishes that were sitting outside that room since early the day before had still not been cleared. Far worse was what we saw running through our closet and then under our door into the hallway.....a mouse!! I was horrified. After calling down and explaining the girl said "gross" and promptly transferred me to someone who offered a room upgrade and to comp that night for us. The next room had a mouse trap under the bed (empty thankfully). Obviously this is an ongoing problem for the hotel which they have failed to adequately address over the years.

Even though Travelodge Space Needle is inexpensive, I wouldn't stay here again. Serious noise problem due to the fact that it is in close proximity to city fire station. In the three nights I stayed here, the sirens went off 4 times in the middle of the night. Also lots of outdoor noise from outdoors late at night. Also, hotel is remote - you have to walk for blocks to get to a restaurant, and it is a three block walk to the monorail, which is the main method of getting downtown. Lack of cleanliness was apparent -- carpet was filthy - big stains. Front desk staff were not particularly helpful.

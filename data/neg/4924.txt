I went down to daytona to stay with friends and have fun on spring break. When I googled the hotel, I was under the impression it was nice, clean, and very classy looking. You should know that there are 2 sides to this hotel, and they only advertise the nicer side. The side I stayed in, Ocean Plaza Club, was dirty, smelled bad, gum on the floor (even in my room, the maid didnt do a very good job of cleaning and there was gum ON MY BED!) the employees were rude, (you could tell they hated thier jobs, and hated the guests at the hotel) The "breakfast buffet" was nasty, over priced, ugh. THEN, on top of all that, I was charged an extra 200 dollars after my stay, and have never gotten a call back as to why, I would strongly suggest never staying here....

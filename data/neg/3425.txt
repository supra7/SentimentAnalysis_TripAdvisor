Had to stay a few nights for business. Pillowcases were stained with penmarks, brownish-unidentifiable marks, black scuff marks like someone stepped on them. Sheets and towels were so thin they felt like gauze. The light-blocking curtains don't draw all the way making sleep past 7 am impossible. Asked for a quiet room but got one right next to the elevator. Food was ok. They had some kind of computer upgrade going on when I checked out and could not give me a receipt right away. An itemized receipt was to be emailed to me, but 3 days later nothing from the hotel. Location is good, right on the Dallas tollway & beltline.

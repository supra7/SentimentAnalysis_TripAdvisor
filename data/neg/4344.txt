My wife and I stayed overnight at the Hyatt. I am a big Hyatt fan most of the time, but I was not impressed in this case. Check-in was a total mess. The hotel was not ready for the number of customers checking in before dinner time. We had stopped by earlier to drop of a bag, which I am glad I did since the hotel did not have rooms ready for a lot of people at 5pm even though check-in is at 4. The room was very nice. The room had an out dated TV with no remote which was the only negative I can think of. We called to get a corkscrew sent up, and it didn't come for over an hour so we left for dinner. We also got charged for something in the mini bar which we never opened. The elevators and lobby also needed some refurburishing. We did have the breakfast buffet in the morning which came free with our room package. The service was great and the food choice was excellent. However, they did not have a chef to cook things on the spot which I really like to have. Even though it was nice I don't think it would be worth the regular price someone would have to pay. Overall the location was great for the going to a show in Boston. There are a lot of hotels right in the area. I think I would try a different one next time.

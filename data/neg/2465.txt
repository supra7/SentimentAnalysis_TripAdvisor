Great location in London & reasonably priced for London. Unfortunately the service was bad. The key card did not work everytime we left the hotel room. Had to be rest each time. Most of the time there was no one on the reception so we had to wait 10+ minutes ot get someone. We stayed on the ground flood, room was nice but the bed was not confortable & outside the hallway smelt damp. Wouldn'T be rushing back to stay here.

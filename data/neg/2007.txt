Stayed at this hotel in Dember 2009 and I would not stay at this hotel again for the following reasons: 1. No self parking. Valet parking only which is free but still need to tip everytime. 2. Mandatory $15/day resort fee! Are you kidding me? It was freezing (frost) cold and the hotel does not have a resort. If they call their little pool a resort then they are out of their mind. This was even more annoying as I had pre-paid for my hotel room in advance through 3rd party company and the charge was suprise. 3. THIS HOTEL IS NOT (LET ME REPEAT, IS NOT) on the Las Vagas Strip. You have to walk through a dark street (at night with no lights)with no sidewalk for a block and then you get to the Las Vagas BLVD. The walk is dangerous at night and you can get hit by cars and oncoming cabs. The hotel is located beside an empty construction land which is not at all pretty. 4. Additional charges for room with view of BLVD. 5. No rooms with 2 beds. I was given a room with a queen size and sofa bed. I would have had a better nights sleep at the a local motel. Upon opening the sofa bed, I found old shopping receipts in the bed indicating that the sofa bed had not been cleaned after the last guest left YUK. 6. This hotel has NO CASINO. Gambling is a big part of my vagas trips and if there is no casino then thats a big negative for me. I heard from a cab driver that the hotel could not get a casino licence due to lack of funding. 7. Leaking Shower in the room. 8. Expensive Internet access. On the Plus side: - The room was well decorated. - Clean lobby - Helpful staff and easy check in/out. In conclusion, I would stay away from this hotel and hope to never stay here again.

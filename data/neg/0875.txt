This hotel is not very clean. There was no bathtub- only a small shower. We were traveling with a baby- so we were not able to bath her there. It is cheap and the location is very close to the space needle. However, the area is a little bit seedy. We also recieved a call to our room- my husband answered and a woman on the phone asked "Do you want some company?", when he asked who was calling she said "Oh, this is Candy", and he hung up. We spoke with the front desk about it, and they told us that the call must have come from within the hotel- because there had not been any calls connected to our room through them. This did not make us feel much better. He said that it wasn't the first time that someone complained about prostitiues calling the rooms. We switched hotels to the La Quinta Inn and Suites, a little bit more money- but it was way nicer.

Me and my partner stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and found this hotel unbearable, due to its misrepresentation on its website and the attitude of the staff. We both belong to the hospitality industry and we understand value for money and this was least to say anything close to it. We have travelled extensively and have never come across something so mismanaged and anti-guest orientated. The service was slow and unprofessional and the hotel over authorized our cards which made our holiday a terrible experience. I would never reccomend this hotel to anyone and would suggest looking at independant hotels in La Rambla which is what I'll be doing on my next visit.

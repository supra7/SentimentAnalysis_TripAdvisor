very modrn and stylish hotel,we atayed while passing through madrid during summer tour of Spain. Situated in a very run down and industrial looking area of the city,we took a wronh turn out of the hotel and ended up in the bronx ! Cars with smashed windows along the whole length of the street. The hotel itself is very comfortable and has all mod cons.Fine for passing through,just get good directions if venturing outside hotel .

Good location, nice rooms, service was just ok We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and really enjoyed the room itself. It was very comfortable, nice linens, big fluffy towels, good sized modern bathroom. The bedroom was impressive with large windows and a chandelier. Breakfast was ok - one type of meat only, bread to toast with jam/nutella, pastries, juice, cereal. They made us a capuccino or espresso every morning. There is a small garden terrace where you can eat breakfast but it was too chilly to sit outside.It seemed to us that this is a family run hotel, the mother and father and one daughter rotate working the front desk, the other daughter appeared to be responsible for cleaning the rooms. The mother and father spoke very little/no English and when we went to check out, they didn't know how to use the credit card machine so they made frantic calls to their daughters to come in. We waited and as a result missed our train, but the daughters arrived and processed our credit card. We didn't find the service the friendliest or most helpful, we measured this against the excellent service we had at our hotels in Rome and Bolgona where the front desk person was incredibly friendly and hospitable with many suggestions and recommendations for restaurants, bars, tours, etc.

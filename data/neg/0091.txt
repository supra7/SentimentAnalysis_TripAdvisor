I called my husband in a panic before I even got in the elevator. The lobby was creepy, dark, old and in need of repair. My room had lights that stopped working in the bathroom, carpet was dirty, tv did not work, and the carpet was dingy. I was afraid to sleep with the lights off. The street noise is so loud I could not sleep all night. When I opened the curtains in the morning, the curtain rod came loose. If I hadnt already paid for the room on a discount website that showed pictures of a newly remodeled hotel room, I would have never stayed.... I wish I had read previous reviews before I came to Seattle.

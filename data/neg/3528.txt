Generally acceptable... Good breakfast, clean room, good bed... Being a business traveler, I am interested in how well the property suits the business traveler. Here's where they failed. The staff seems untrained or unsupervised. When I arrived, I was greeted with a ""Hey,Hey,Hey" and thy weren't particularly helpful. The room desk chair is to short for the desk making it unusable. The neighborhood is very noisy... I was kept awake for two nights by outdoor rock and roll bands. If you are here to party, probably a good value. Find another place if you are here to work.

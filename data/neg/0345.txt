I had a very bad experience in this hotel. The rooms have very thin walls and you can hear everything from the room next door. There was a constant loud humming machine noise coming from outside. People coming back at night drunk and making noise and partying in the corridors and rooms. I changed rooms twice but they were both equally bad. Eventually I changed to another hotel because I couldn't get a good night's sleep there. I'm not usually very fussy about hotels and I'm used to staying in not so good places but this was the worst hotel experience I've ever had. I don't recommend this to anyone who wants a quiet and clean room. Location is good though.

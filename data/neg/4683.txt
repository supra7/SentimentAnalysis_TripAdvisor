The Palmer House Hilton has never been one of my favorite hotels. I am required to stay here once a year for business. This stay was among the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. The "high speed" internet is hardley that. The property is under renovation at this time. I am a Hilton Diamond Member, and have never been treated this badly at any hotel. The Palmer House has decided to deny access to the Club Level Lounge (which is typical for Gold and Diamond Members.) They compensated with free breakfast coupons and water coupons. The breakfast was served buffet style, and typically had about a 20 minute wait, as the facility is small. The food quality was decent, but nothing more. This area is not yet equipped as a restaurant, so an evening meal requires leaving the property, or ordering room service. Room service charges $4.50 for delivery, and a 15% service charge. This turns a 14.00 burger into a 20.60 cent meal. Ridiculous. The desk chair in my room was not high enough to work comfortably at the desk. Not only would I never stay at this hotel again by choice, I will do what I can to move my company to another property for future stays.

When you pay $300 or more for a hotel room, you expect simple amenities, such as in-room coffee. Not here. Free in $40/night parking? room internet---not here. The wireless connection was terrible, only internet available was through the in-room ethernet. While I have stayed at many W hotels before, and enjoyed them, and while I have 2 daughters who live i Seattle, this will be the last time I stay in the Seattle W.

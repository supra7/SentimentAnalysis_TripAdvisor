Let's just say that I hope The Donald didn't approve of the hotel's policies before putting his name on the side of the hotel because simply put, if this is the quality of comfort associated with Trump knowingly, then I pray for his soul. 1. $15/night "resort fee" isn't mentioned when you book the room, what "resort fee"???... to use the gym and the pool, and to park your car?... isn't that included in a f**king hotel stay? 2. They run a train on you 50 times a day... literally... if that train whistle and rumble isn't enough to ruin your stay then maybe you'll actually enjoy the room. 3. $100/night hold on your debit/credit card... unless you're a coked up rockstar I doubt they need to do this... that's a $700 hold on your card (money you can't use) if you're staying a week. 4. $12 a day for internet... shouldn't that be included too? $12 a day is downright outrageous. Generally I'm not a picky person, but the insult to any guest's intelligence is offensive and I wouldn't stay here again, it's a shame, if they didn't screw you with all the hidden fees and "catches" it would be a nice room, albeit, noisy and not really close to anything else except the mall. With these crap fees and credit card holds it makes the price of the room jump close to $30 extra per night... why bother when you could get a "real" suite at another hotel?

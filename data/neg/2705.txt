This must be the worst hotel I ever stayed in. I am Dutch but live in London and for work, I need to travel to Amsterdam on a very regular basis. The room is indeed extremely small, but I could live with that. It was the street noise (bad insolation), room noise (slamming with doors and windows at 2am-3am) and works at a building next door that started at 7am that was totally unexceptable. It was as if the works were actually happening in my room. I got up from missery and checked-out at 7.45 as I couldn't bare it! I complained at reception and they were aware of all these matters. I received their excuses but that was it. If you want to spend that kind of money, you are far better of to stay in a B&B.

The concept is interesting but doesn't quite come together. The idea seems to be to offer a lower cost version of the W hotels but what you end up with is a hipper Four Points by Sheraton. The hotel is indeed very stylish, from the lobby to the rooms and bathrooms. The rooms were dead quiet despite being right by the airport and the blackout shades for the windows worked great. There were several things, though, that didn't quiet gel. The bed itself is rather firm, the sheets were scratchy and the pillows were not feather. There is a great flatscreen TV and a place to plug in your iPod, but no radio or even a CD player. When I called the lobby and asked how I could go about hearing some music they suggested purchasing a music channel via the TV. There is a bar but no restaurant on site, just sandwiches from the self-service center. You can go across the parking lot to the Hilton, though, and eat there. If they think through some more of the practical needs of a traveler and focus less on the style, the concept could be successful.

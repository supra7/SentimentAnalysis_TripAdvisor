Old, run-down, not clean, overpriced. We are travelers who don't mind small, budget or older lodging, but this was really unpleasant all the way around. Had the 2-bedroom apartment (reminded me of some of the cheap apartments I had to rent as a poor college student) updated in the 70's, perhaps. Air conditioner didn't work, so it was extremely stuffy all night, noises from neighbors on balcony precluded opening windows for ventilation, and paper-thin walls which let us hear the snorer next door made it not a good sleep. There was very old furniture and the unit was not maintained. The office smelled heavily of smoke, though the surly clerk insisted it was a non-smoking hotel. Cramped little breakfast room with packets of oatmeal, cereal, and the smell of smoke. Bottom line, only if you can get an extremely low price ($50-60?) and have nowhere else to go, might it be worth it.

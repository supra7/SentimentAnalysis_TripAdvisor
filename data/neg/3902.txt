We had made a phone reservation at a weekend rate. As we went to pay they changed the rates and ended up paying double for the second night. The staff was not helpful at all, they told us that the rates were subject to change and that, in fact they had changed because it was marathon weekend. The room was very basic, small and ot comfortable, towels very small. Absolutely not worth the price.

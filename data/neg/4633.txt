On the bright side, there is a Starbucks in the hotel, but that's really the only nice thing I can say about my stay there. I had a room with a king bed reserved. When I checked into the hotel, not only did they not have a king bed available, they put me in a room that was smaller than most walk-in closets. The room was located right next to the house keeping room, so I had the pleasure of listening to the housekeeping staff talking about their love life every morning. Even though my room was down graded, they still charged me for the delux king room that I had reserved. I travel for business quite a bit, but I've never been charged as much for internet access as I was here... over $50 US for three days access. Won't stay there again.

I called the hotel (same number each time) a total of THREE times over a WEEK AND A HALF period, leaving three separate messages. I have a public relations background so needless to say in each message I made very clear what I was looking to book and REPEATED MY PHONE NUMBER AND NAME AT LEAST TWO TIMES. Finally after the last message which made clear that I would at least appreciate a call back (always in a polite manner), someone finally called me back. By this time I had made other arrangements for our group of 8 (their loss) to stay at another hotel. The person calling me seemed perturbed, and said that she didn't have my phone number at all,,,,,upon her saying that I said well how did you call me back then? She seemed to quickly notice her mistake and correct herself saying well this is the only message I got. I told her of the three messages I left all including my contact information and even what we were looking for, although she said "sorry," she basically insinuated more than once that I was lying and that she or the hotel had received no such messages. HUGEEEE RED FLAGS and BADDDD customer service!!! Take it from me, if a hotel CANNOT CALL BACK SOMEONE LOOKING TO ACTUALLY BOOK (not just inquire about pricing) A PARTY OF 8 that is not a good sign, especially after leaving multiple messages. In addition if the person from the hotel THEN ACCUSES THE POTENTIAL CUSTOMER OF LYING, that is again not at all a good sign and doesn't reflect the hotel or their customer service well at all. Those are HUGGGEEEE RED FLAGS and this is before even staying there so I can only imagine what the rest of the experience would have been like had we booked. Judging by that experience, I would recommend staying away, and I will definitely be passing the word around of my experienc.

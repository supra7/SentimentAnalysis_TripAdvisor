I suspect that because of the low occupancy, staffing has been cut "to the bone". Only 2 front desk attendants for a 52 floor hotel? Insufficient wait staff in the dining area, room not cleaned until dinner time. Only 1 soap bar,no luggage stand, no decaf coffee in the room but $ 13 for a decaf cappuccino or a glass of house wine, plz. There is a quote of Donald's in the pool bar area that if you're going to think, think big. At this location, the plusses are big but... The rooms are clean, big and modern with jacuzzis (guess there is no water shortage here), but the shortcomings are too many. Also, some complained about the train whistle noise at night,but though I am a light sleeper, I wasn't bothered .

I stayed in this hotel for 1 night before travelling on the Eurostar to Paris. I choose it because its only a 5 minute walk from St Pancreas station and right beside Euston Station. However I did not sleep a wink because of the terrible traffic which goes on all night long. The hotel itself was ok for a Travelodge as it was clean an quite comfortable. We did have breakfast included, which was a bonus, but the choice was very limited. All in all very handy location but don't stay here if you are a light sleeper

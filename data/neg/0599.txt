I stayed here with my two sons (9 and 10) while we took in a couple of Mariners' games. We are by no means stuck up people who expect 5 star hotels at a budget price. What we did expect was simple, clean accommodations. We got simple, but we didn't get clean. The room had a very strong bad smell, was dirty and the carpet all around the bathroom was wet. My kids even thought it was gross and asked if they could keep their shoes on in the room - pretty bad when boys think it's dirty. On the bright side, it was less than $10 by cab to Safeco Field. Needless to say, I would not recommend this place.

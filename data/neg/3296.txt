I tried to reserve a 3 bedroom villa with 3 baths and they would not let me. They told me I could request one but that I could end up with a 2 bath villa. It is a deal breaker for my family. When I asked why they would turn down my business they said that the room MAY be occupied by someone in the room ahead of us. I guess they would rather take a chance that the room MAY be occupied then guarantee my reservation!.

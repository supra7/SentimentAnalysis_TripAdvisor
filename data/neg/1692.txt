My family and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Maui, a 4 and a half star hotel. Over 20 years ago, my sister and I stayed there, and it was gorgeous. Now, the hotel looks the same as it did in the 80s. Staff is friendly, and they claim they did a $19 million renivation, but it looks like they just replaced some of the furnature. The walls, ceiling, doors, patio furnature, etc are still from 1980. It is very load at this hotel. What made the experience more enjoyable was the birds in the lobby. If you are looking for a serene hotel, this is not the hotel for you.

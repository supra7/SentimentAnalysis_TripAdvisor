Stayed here as we had to stay an extra night in Chicago and the Conrad was full. it was less than a $100 less than our room at the Conrad but a world away in space, comfort and modernisation. The hotel wasnt bad, it just wasbnt great. Old carpets, Tvs, beds, faint wiff of Cigarettes [when did the smoking ban come in Chicago?]. better around for the money.

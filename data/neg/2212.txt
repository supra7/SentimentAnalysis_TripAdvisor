I stayed here this week and I thought I would add my thoughts Just remember what yopu are paying to stay here. The location was perfect inbetween victoria and pimlico stations The hotel was shabby.We had a small double and a single bed but I told my husband to have the single,only broken at the bottom My double,I had to sleep from corner to corner as it seemed to have had hardly any thickness to the mattress on 1 side.On trying to adjust the mattress the top of the base was broken with nails sticking up The curtains were hanging off the tracks although it would have been a 2 minute job to fix them. On the plus side I asked for an extra pillow that arrived immediately Yes the beakfast bar was in the back of the office with bar stools but fresh coffee,tea,juice,toast and cereal. I would use this hotel again but I hope the owners look at this site to see what the problems are

We stayed here for 2 nights and chose it because it was fairly cheap and in a good location, it is cheap and it is in a good location and thata about it... We were met by a woman who appeared to have no idea what we were doing there, and spoke very poor English. She wanted the money upfront which was a bad idea from the start, stupidly, we paid up. We were put in a 'bedroom' in the basement opposite the kitchen, subsequently giving us a view of a concrete floor and cig ends. We could squeeze around one side of the bed and sneak behind the door, imagina a double bed in a standard shed. The 'ensuite' was a joke, when you were on the toilet your knees were crammed under the sink and you could have a shower (rubbish shower at that) at the same time. We got back from a night out and found that we had ants in our room :( so went to tell the lady at reception. She had no idea what we were on about so followed us down to the room with a tin of air freshener and attempted to solve the problem with that..... We were offered no apologies, no alternative rooms and no refunds. Service was as poor as our room. If you want somewhere you can doss down and not look around then I suppose this place is ok, but you couldn't pay us to stay here again!!

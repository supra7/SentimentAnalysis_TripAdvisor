Avoid this hotel at all costs. Even at half the price, it would still be throwing money away. While the location is very desirable, it is in disrepair, ugly, unclean, and generally unpleasant. The toilet in my room malfunctioned daily. The television would only pick up two stations. Although I had a great time with a friend in Seattle, I was happy to leave this hotel. It should not have a star rating at all.

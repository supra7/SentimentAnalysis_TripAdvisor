Reservations for 6 nights. Lovely hotel. Attentive staff. Asked for a quiet room - the 5am (unasked-for) wake-up was trucks in back of the building, backup signals blaring, tailgates crashing. I was told by the hotel desk at 5am that the hotel had complained to the city before about the garbage collection noise early each morning. All I wanted was a nice, quiet room. The hotel could have put me on the other side of the building, away from the noise they new was going to occur. Instead, I was given a room that was blasted by the vehicle noise for over an hour that morning. I made arrangements around 7am to move to another hotel. At 8:30, when I went to check out I was then offered a change of rooms, even an upgrade if I would stay. Thanks but no thanks. The quiet room was mandatory, not optional. The hotel I moved to, not as nice esthetically, but quiet.

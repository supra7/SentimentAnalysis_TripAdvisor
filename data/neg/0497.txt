The main thing this hotel has going for it is its proximity to the needle and the park. Actually, you can walk a great number of places from this property. Also, the people working there are helpful and friendly. The hotel was pretty clean, and the rooms were in good shape so long as you are good with an early 1963 decor. Pretty new stuff, but still dated. If you will need internet service, I recommend you stay elsewhere. The wireless is free, and worth what you pay. The connection was miserably slow and the signal weak. Also, be careful out at night. We weren't approached by anyone, but we did see an illegal transaction going down.

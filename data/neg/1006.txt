I was dissapointed with my overall stay at the hotel. After travelling all day and arriving at 8p (10p my time) I had to HAUL my luggage up the STAIRS to the front desk. They all stood there and watched me struggle to get my luggage up, but were too cool to help. During check-in I had a few questions and the staff acted "too cool" to help and ignored half of my requests (two keys). I have yet to see the lights come on in any part of the hotel -- very strange to have dimly lit halls at 10a. There is NO coffee maker or hot water in the room -- good luck if you want a cup of coffee or tea. Prices are ridiculous and the towels and linens are cheap...they charge you to make a local call - come on! A little too hipster and completely over the staff being too cool for their pants.

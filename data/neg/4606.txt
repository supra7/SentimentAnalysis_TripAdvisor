Buyer Beware. I flew my 71 year old Mom to Chicago to celebrate Mother's Day at the spa. I decided to avoid the busy Mother's Day weekend and scheduled our appointments for Sat, May 15th. Much to my surprise, a few hours before our appointments, Spa Chakra indicated they were canceling the appointment because they have too much demand from groupon.com and someone was out sick. In 20 years of going to luxury spas, a spa has never canceled my appointment! Spas are in the service business. What is their contingency plan for covering for sick employees and serving customers. I insisted that they serve my 71 year old mom since she flew all they way to Chicago for her special outing! They did manage to serve my Mom. Please note that this spa has a 24 hour cancellation policy which requires full payment if you don't cancel before 24 hours. Although, they canceled my appointment, I wasn't given anything! So much for service from a high end spa! Buyer beware, don't book this spa for special occasions!

I'm lying in bed right now in this fab hotel, although I'm not enjoying the funky dcor or indulging in the well stocked mini bar. No, I'm having another nights sleep ruined by the ignorant staff here who are making a ridiculous amount of noise cleaning the rooms, grinding the king size bed off the floor tiles and sending a holiday destroying rumble up and down the hotel, there is no escaping it. I can not sleep in this hotel! So rude! So ignorant! So tired!

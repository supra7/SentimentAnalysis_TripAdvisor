This is one of the worst "hotels" I'ved stayed at - more like a MOTEL. The room were given was dirty, smelly, bathroom moldy and yellow stuff in the bathroom. The drain in the tub was clogged and no help to unclog it. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable I've ever stayed in. I mean motel quality (or lack of quality). The staff would not help at first. We had to wait until the next day for the day guy to arrive and asked him for a change of room. At least he did get us a new/better room. However, just because the room is bigger, doesn't make it better. It still smelled a bit, the bed was still HORRIBLE. In fact, we had to cut our losses and just leave early and book at the Marriott just down the street .

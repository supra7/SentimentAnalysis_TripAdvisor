The only good thing about this hotel is it's location. The prices of rooms and restaurant are outrageous for the poor quality and lack of service here. Smallest bathrooms ever, Toilets touching bathtubs, requiring anyone who needs to sit down to do so sideways. Very outdated rooms, but some "new" system (we were later told) requiring room keys to be left in slots to keep air/lights working while out. Small, old TV's in room that go fuzzy every few minutes. $25 for breakfast buffet that is very minimal and food not very good, along with nearly worst service in restaurant we've ever had. Most staff very indifferent, not helpful. 2 dishes of ice cream via room service =$25! Not only do you not receive a newspaper, but then the gift shop ran out of Boston papers 2 days in a row. Won't be back, too many other great hotels in same price range here.

Booked "Family Suite" so my husband and mother dont to sleep in the same room. Beds were not in "separate rooms" they were 2ft from eachother. Total gimick to charge more money. No draws for clothes, 4 hangers in the closet, you live out of your suitcase. No tubs, only stand up showers. Room was clean. Front desk and restaurant staff seemed to be inconvenienced by any request. 98 weather w/sun beating off the water, we had to eat on the balcony because no kids allowed in lounge. We were treated like loiterers not like paying customers. Front desk not sympathetic, didn't care about our satisfaction. Hidden fees $25/ngt valet parking, $15/ngt crib, etc.

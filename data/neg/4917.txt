My family and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in July. We were there for a time-share presentation/scam and this is where they had reserved our rooms. This hotel might have been a beautiful hotel once back in 1973 but now she is just old, bitter and needs to retire. The rooms were spacious and had a great view but it ends there. One of our two beds were sagging to one side, the bath tub faucet was leaking (I'm talking about a few drips, it was leaking a steady stream of water), the fridge was smelly and rusty on the bottom, I can see through to the outside wall where the airconditon was. It looks like the seal or seam of the unit was installed and it deterioted, exposing the outside. I was paranoird that some creepy crawlies would come through those holes the whole time I was there. The carpet was thread bare, there were cracks in all of the walls, and it looks like someone crashed something into a corner of the wall and took out a chunk of plasters and then it was left like that. The elevator was extremely slow so I ended up taking the stairs. Never again, as the stairwell smell like stale urine and vomit!!!! They also charge you $5 a night for parking but if you come back to the hotel after 8, it was full every time. We had to circle for 30 mins or risk parking on the street. The beach was very nice so we stayed mostly there just to avoid having to come back to our depressing room. Upon check out, the front desk clerk asked for us to go and leave them a positive comment on Tripadvisor and they will credit our credit card $5. Talk about trying to buy your way into a good review!!! Over all - if I were 18, only want to party and stay drunk in Daytona during spring break, this would be the ideal place. Otherwise, give this hotel a passed.

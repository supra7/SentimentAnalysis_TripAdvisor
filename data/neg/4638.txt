My boyfriend and I stayed at the Palmer House for two nights for a friend's wedding. The room was booked as part of a block of at least 10-15 rooms especially for the wedding party. While were able to check in properly, we learned that several people had problems with check-in or even getting a room! Our room (11th floor) was extremely small (about 9x10 with a 6x3 bathroom) to begin with. (There is no mini bar / fridge in the room by the way.) The room was clean when we arrived, but the next day, we waited all day for the maid service to come through and she finally showed up around 4PM. I asked if she could come back at 5PM and she said it was fine. But after we returned from an evening out, the room remained completely untouched. This also happened to another friend's room on the 21st floor and we wondered if it was a shared "perk" of being covered under the wedding reservation block. Needless to say, it was very irritating. We stayed at the Hyatt Regency the night before and I would absolutely recommend going there instead.

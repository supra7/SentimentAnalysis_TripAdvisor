When you entering this hotel the smell of the nasty food cooking is kicking in your face . When you entering your room the huge army of cockroaches are welcoming you . When you entering the bathroom there is no words to explain how nasty view you can see . You don't even want to use the toilet . I rather sleep in the airport instead of staying in this hotel . I have no positive things to say about this place . It is not cleaned period , bugs bugs and bugs , horrible location , whole property smells like indian food , no service , no regular hot water , rock hard beds , no normal A/C and finally very ugly front desk clerk .

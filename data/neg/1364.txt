I write this during my stay at Le Crystal. The hotel and amenities are excellent. The staff who I have encountered have been very friendly, if not fully or promptly supportive. Our group went out for lunch and shopping. Upon return, one of our rooms was locked and the key cards were deactivated. We made a call to the front desk and the receptionist advised us to wait by the door. An employee, Karen, was very helpful in contacting the front desk a second time and granted us access. A few minutes after Karen let us in, we had to call the front desk a third time. It took us more than twenty minutes to get our replacement keys. Upon check-in a day before, it only took twenty seconds. In addition, we had asked not to be disturbed. Someone from housekeeping had been in our room. We asked the hotel to respect our boundaries and the hotel breached them and left us without access to our belongings. We are leaving tomorrow and unfortunately will never return. This was my second visit to the hotel.

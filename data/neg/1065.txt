You could hear a pin drop. In the next room. If you, like me, think that a hotel room is only as useful as it is quiet and comfortable, then you might want ot skip the Hotel Max. Our room had three major detractors: -the walls between the rooms are paper thin so that we could clearly hear the conversations of both neighbours as clearly as if they were in the room with us. Needless to say this wasn't until we'd gone to sleep. -the heating/ cooling system is a window mounted unit that gurgles and rumbles the whole time it's on. We had to turn it off for the evening and burrow deep under the blankets to stay warm. -the bed, a king, was saggy, sinking low at the hips on both sides. I would compare this hotel to a youth hostel, only much less fun, and far too overpriced for what you get. I'll never stay there again. Oh, and the ear plugs they gave us were completely useless.

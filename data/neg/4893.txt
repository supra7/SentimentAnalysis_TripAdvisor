A friend to the family was getting married and my son was best man. I made a reservation to stay at the hotel for myself and my wife. My son made a seperate reservation for himself and the groom. When we arrived we were checking in and the clerk asked us if we were with this wedding party and we said yes. I was given keys to the room and taken there by the bellman. Once we got to the room, we found that there was someone else staying in there. We later found out that this is the room where our son was staying. The bellman went and got us keys to a new room and took us there. After moving our items into the room I went down to the desk to straighten everything out. The front desk agent I went to was supposed to know exactly what had happened and would be able to correct the problem. When I tried to explain to her, they could not find my son or the groom in the system as having a reservation. After about 15 mins. of trying to work with this person, she was totally confused and so was I. She then passed me on to another clerk, who as luck would have it had checked in my son and the groom earlier, so she knew who they were. After she fixed the reservation, I thought everything was taken care of. When my son checked out, he found that his reservation was now in my name but with his credit card number. The hotel staff were pleasant, but of very little help.

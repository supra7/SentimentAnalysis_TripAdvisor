I had a group meeting at this property - the only thing I can say is - don't do it! The hotel's air conditioning went out while we were in our meeting, and we were boiling, but they did nothing to accommodate us, or discount the meeting room charge. If you do go there, put everything in writing...I asked for a couple dozen cookies and sodas on consumption and was charged over $12 per person!!! Get it in writing! The carpets in the rooms are stained and drains in the bath-tubs drain very slowly. The bedding is old, and pillows lumpy. The promised cookies and milk in the evenings did not come as scheduled and the breakfast items were slim. The restaurant on property was ok - but did not bill to your room. For the location, you are much better off at the Hyatt Regency. Cleaner and safer area.

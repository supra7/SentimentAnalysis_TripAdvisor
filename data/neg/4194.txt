I stayed at the Park Plaza for two nights for a conference being held there. I was put on the 15th floor which must have been recently renovated. The room was good sized, plenty nice with a nice bathroom. The hotel, however, did not honor the conference rate on both nights so I paid different amounts each night. This caused all kinds of problems. I was checked out after my first night, called down to have it corrected - was told it was all fixed by a surly employee. Later on that morning as I was heading out the door to go to the all day conference I was called and told I had to switch rooms because of the different rate. This would have required missing some of the conference and I said no. Again a surly employee told me they would straighten things out. When I tried to come back to my room at the end of the day my key no longer worked. A third surly employee downstairs fixed it with a grudging apology. The next moring when I was supposed to check out they had me as still staying. The problem with this is it required yet another long wait in line to check out. The lines to check in and out were long, the wait for room service about 1 hour (although they would always say it was coming in 1/2 an hour), the bellmen hard to find and they had a charge for holding bags for an hour. The service was poor, the building fine. The conference also had poor service with too few chairs for the number of attendees and spoiled fruit at the breakfast.

Recently stayed here for 4 nights. Location is great. Hotel is realatively clean. The only problem is that all the workers I encountered are rude. It is a bother for them to help. Everyone from the Hostess at Champions to the three different front desk workers I experienced to the concierge to The Starbucks employees (I know these are not Marriott employees, but if you are going to advertise, you have A Starbucks then you better make sure they are somewhat civilized. With all the choices you have in Boston, my advice is stay somewhere else.

A pretty cheap place to stay. Paid US$52 excluding tax. The rooms were big. Towels were clean. However, the rooms, even the non smoking ones, smelt very strongly of cigarette smoke. I changed 2 rooms and the smell was still there. In the end, I gave up and just slept there for one night. Probably the smoke came from the central air con, but I am not sure. Another thing was that, in order to go from the parking garage to the rooms, you had to pass through the casino. Seems like that is quite common with hotels with casinos in Vegas. This hotel has no free wifi but has free parking.

1. We left a gameboy Dsi in the hotel room and we called and you shipped it to us, thanks!!! but someone took out our memory card out.. had many photos and games on it.. not happy. 2. Our room was never cleaned one day... even had the lights on to get it cleaned.. then got a message at 4:10pm that we couldn't service our room due to a do not disturb light was on.. we did not have do not disturb light on .. it was the cleaning one (100% sure). 3. We ate at the restaurant in the lobby.. had some issues with bad service ... ordered fries.. never came and our waitress after 20 minutes never came by... so i said something to the manager... next i know the hostess helped the table next to us and on purpose kicked the back of my chair. Come on.. i say at a lot of hotels and never have any of the above issues in a long time. I left two messages for the manager at the hotel while onsite and NEVER got a call back. Room was nice.. Tub pump did not work for bubble action. I just expected better ... that's is all... I go to over 30 hotels a year... and truly this is the only one so far i was disappointed.

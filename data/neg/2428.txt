on arrival at the hotel the staff could not find our reservation in the system after much searching they found it on there computer spelt incorrectly, Was booked in for a short weekend break which after a four hour train journey was expecting nice warm clean room what we got was a broken bed dirty sheets and damp carpet. reported fault to reception which was never manned told nothing they could do about bed as it the hotel was overbooked how i dont know ! where given clean sheets and duvet cover and basically told to sort it ourselves. Was hungry ventured down to cramped resturant/bar for evening meal wished we had not bothered reheated microwave curry which for a tenner was disgusting. hotel room overlooked grafton place which is a main bus route which is always noisy until roughly 1:30 in the morning not to mention the firebrigade station situation across the road only 3 call outs on first night 8 in total. for food recommend the Prezzo resturant across the road friendly staff and resonable cost unlike hotel staff. Unless you are as skinny as a beanpole you will never be comfortable using the bathroom AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID Could not have been happier when we left on the sunday morning worse three night stay in london ever !!!!

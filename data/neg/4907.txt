Ok here is what happen. We had made reservations at the hotel. Well we got to the first room and the key didn't work and there was a dog n the next room that kept barking so my wife goes down to the desk n let them know about the key and the dog. Well she comes back up n tells me they gave us a room (the second room) on the fourth floor. Well we go up there and the first thing that hits you is the whole floor smells like rotten carpets. So we put our bags n the room n leave. Well we get back at like ten at night n go to the room take showers. Shower head was pulled from wall call front desk maintenance comes up and pushes it back into the wall. Well I got up n go to the bathroom at one n kill two roaches. Then try to go back to bed. I lay down and hear all this noise from the next door at a party so I turn on the tv and fall back to sleep. Well at 2:13am some dummy decides to have a party in the parking lot and turns his stereo up and wakes us up. I call the front desk & they say they can't do anything about it cause they are in the parking lot next door. I hang up the phone & I see a roach on the night stand & kill it then call the front desk back & ask if they can call the cops n she says no so I call the cops so I can sleep We get up in the morning and look for another hotel n the manger called because we called our travel company to get our points n money back so our vendor calls the hotel. So the manager gives us a third room with a free breakfast everyday for the rest of our stay, we were not n there 5 minutes and killed five roaches my wife called the manager to come up to the room to see the roach crawling on the wall. The manager told us they didn't have roaches they were palmetto bugs. Manager didn't come up to the room she called back and said she was handling other issues but she has the cleaning manager looking into another room. We said no thanks and check out. Our stay was 1 June 2012.

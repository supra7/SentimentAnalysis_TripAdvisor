False advertising and really awful.. I have rarely had such a bad experience in a hotel. First, the heat/cooling was central instead of in the individual rooms, and the room was HOT the entire two days I was there. The wireless connection that is advertised is ONLY available in the lobby area, not the rooms, due to construction. Room was dirty, maid cleaned only minimally while I was there. Carpet was filthy. It was noisy, and felt very unsafe since two of the outside doors were broken and NOT locked at night, and it's not the best area to be in. Twice went to get coffee in the lobby and found the coffee urns empty, a got a shrug when I asked if more was going to be made.. staff was pretty nice overall, but not terribly helpful with directions or other questions. I would NOT stay there again.

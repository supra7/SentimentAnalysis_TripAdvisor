I stayed here previously and had a bad experience but the rooms were clean and quite so I tried it again. Still the same rude staff. I had this hotel booked for 2 days through hotwire and priceline but after the first rude encounter with the staff I decided to stay elsewhere the 2nd night, even though it was already paid for. I have always used travel sites when I travel and have never been treated as a second class citizen until I stayed at the super snobby Doubletree, The staff was not helpful at all my son left his wallet in the room when we checked out , he went back to ask about it and they gave him a cookie and dismissed him. May I add, they charge 16 dollars ( plus 1.52 in tax) to park your car. Internet is 12.95 or 14.95 as well, but they do give you a warm cookie when you check in ( ?) I went to another neighbor hotel the 2nd night and got free parking and free internet and the staff actually smiled at us, imagine that! Unless you are as rude and self absorbed as the staff here I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

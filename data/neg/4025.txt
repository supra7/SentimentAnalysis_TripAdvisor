The first impression of this hotel was excellent, the lobby is spacious and everything is very well maintained. Unfortunately there are a couple of things that we found very problematic. First of all, the rooms are tiny, especially since we were traveling with a 1y old baby, there simply wasn't enough room for us. I am fairly sure the room was the smallest I have ever seen in the US. For that price you definitely expect larger rooms. Also the service was not always that great, especially we felt the concierge service to be a bit rude after asking for our delayed luggage.

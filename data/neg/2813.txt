We stayed here for a conference. They made multiple screw ups, some small and some big. Our first night we arrived exhausted with our small children in tow. We were pressured to hurry and unload even though there was no one else waiting behind us to get into the loading/unloading zone. I felt rather unwelcome, as that made getting settled quite stressful. We then got room service for dinner, and ordered a set of mini burgers for our toddler for dinner (kids menu). They arrived rare, which we did not ask for and is really dangerous for a kids' entree. I called to complain and they were actually gracious and gave us a fruit platter to compensate. This is the only time they made good on mistakes. Housekeeping walked into our room twice while we had the do not disturb sign up, once while our infant was asleep and the other time my husband was urinating. They never knocked. Their only parking option is valet, so we paid the $48/day for that. When we went to pick up the car, we saw that the door on my husband's brand new car had clearly been hit into a concrete wall, a big dent and scrape. The dash heads-up display that was glued on had been ripped off and stepped on and no longer works. Between these two things that was nearly $1000 damage to the car. We filled out a report but no one was apologetic, in fact they acted like it was not their problem. A small ding is one thing but this was a large dent and scrape. Not pleased at all. Even if I attend another conference here, I would stay at a different hotel and walk over. I've had better service at a comfort inn! For the price you'd think they would make more of an effort.

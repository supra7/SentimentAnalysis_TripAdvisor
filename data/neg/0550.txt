Chose the hotel for location and pool. However, pool was closed for renovation. You can use the Westin's pool (5 blocks away) or pay money to use a club. The beds are nice, but that's about it. Rooms and hallways are a bit grim and dark, and none of the drains in the bathrooms worked properly. Needed late checkout, but was told the hotel was too full, which is fine but then they magically made a room available for a few hours for $50. But the key stopped working anyway. This was my first stay at a Sheraton and I won't be doing it again, especially for over $200.

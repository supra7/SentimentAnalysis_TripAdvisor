Just got back from a 3 night stay at Trump Las Vegas. Had a strip view room and paid a small amount to upgrade to the 1 bedroom. The room was nice but we had lots of trouble with housekeeping. The room was not cleaned properly even when we first checked in. They kept removing the glasses from the kitchen until we had none and then it took 5 calls and 1.5 hours to get them to return some glasses to the room. The friends we travelled with also had a bottle of scotch stolen from there room.

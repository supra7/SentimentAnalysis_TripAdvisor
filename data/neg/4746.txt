Our stay at this hotel was disappointing. To start, our bath robe (only one in the room) was dirty with makeup from a previous guest. Then I tried to run the bath tub and the water coming out of the faucet essentially looked like sewer water. For the price tag, there are so many other hotels in this area that I will definitely avoid staying in this hotel ever again.

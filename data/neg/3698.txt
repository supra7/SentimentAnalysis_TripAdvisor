Cheap, unappealing place near the Hauptbahnhof Naturally Hotel Pension Schneider's website doesn't indicate that it's in the red light district. Those looking for a place in central Frankfurt near the Hauptbahnhof will no doubt appreciate its location but the sex shops lining the street downstairs are not particularly appealing. Neither are they conducive to sleep, especially on summer nights when one would much prefer to have the window open. The facilities are basic but functional. The bed linens were clean but the place is basically just an old, beat-up mess. The bathroom and showers were clean and the breakfast was sufficient, but all in all you'd better be prepared for a somewhat depressing place which very well may not afford you the option of restful sleep.

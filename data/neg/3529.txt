I am surprised how high this hotel is ranked. I found the staff to be rude and distracted. During two different conversations with two different front desk employees, I was asking a simple question and they anwsered the phone while I was talking! The air conditoner simply made the room more humid and everything felt damp. The rooms are down long, poorly lit, and ziz-zaging hallways that made me (a female) worry what was lurking behind the next turn. I did appreciate free wifi and decent breakfast. It was also very quiet. This hotel is not up to Marriott standards, and I don't recommend it unless you're desperate for a place to stay.

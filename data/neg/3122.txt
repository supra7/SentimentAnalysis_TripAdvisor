Certainly not 4 star. At most 3. Rooms are small and awkward layout. Bathroom is an ok size, but the layout makes it awkward to use. Furniture is very old and there is no local or hotel information provided. Walls between rooms are thin. Every time the neighbouring rooms left the walls would shake. No views from room. Location ok for Paddy's Market and bottom end of town, but a little out of the main area. On the plus side the brakfast buffet is great, and the pub serves great cheap meals for lunch and dinner.

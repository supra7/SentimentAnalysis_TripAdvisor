Being close to the highway you would think nothing bad would happen. Our car was broken into, the security guard is suppose to be doing his job watching the hotel outside and in, he was talking to the people who work in the front checking in quest! Our first time in Dallas and this is what happens. There won't be a next time for us here in this hotel.

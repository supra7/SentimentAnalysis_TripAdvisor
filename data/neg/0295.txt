Stayed in the corner suite on the 7th floor. Room was nice from the walls up, but the floor squeaked horribly, everywhere. We had not been informed of the "no guests" rule when I made the reservation--only the people sleeping in the room may enter it. Definitely the kind of information you want before making a reservation. The people at the desk when we checked in and out were nice, but the night man was AWFUL. My roommates got on the elevator at the same time as someone in another room who had brought a guest. The night man stopped the elevator to badger those people, and couldn't get the elevator restarted, resulting in my roommates having to climb the 7 flights of stairs (while one of them was still recovering from a bad back injury). BUT THE WORST THING OF ALL was when the night man took one of my friends to be a drunk and refused to rent a room to him. My friend has cerebal palsy, and happened to be the headliner at the Moore Theater that night. Overall, it was a bad experience.

We stayed in space #138. Worst space in the park, in order to level our MH we had to raise front tire 6" off the ground. Our neighbors had to leave on an emergency and we asked to move to that spot, they told us they had already rented it. No one showed up. The spot is next to restroom where kids ride bikes on the side walk like a speed way. Will not go back!

My family and I stayed at the Boston Park Plaza this past weekend and I was not impressed. The front desk person that greeted us at first was very nice however, later the next morning when we had a problem with our direct bill the woman that answered the front desk phone was very rude, confrontational, and aggressive. Where is the customer service??? The rooms are very old looking and bathrooms even worse. The air conditioning was not working but the windows were hard to open and the heat kept coming on...even after it had been turned off. One of the most uncomfortable exchanges happened when we went to get our van from valet. The valet attendant was not happy with the $3 tip and kept knocking on our van door asking if this was the correct amount we wanted to leave. He knocked and approached our driver's side window 3 TIMES! Not Cool! We have children and this was very unsettling! Overall, I would not recommend this hotel. I will stick to a Marriott or Hilton thank you.

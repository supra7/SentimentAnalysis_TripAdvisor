I'm not one to write reviews on travel sites so I'll keep it brief. 1. The walls at this hotel are paper thin. The people in the room next to us were talking at normal levels and we could hear their entire conversations. 2. Air conditioning - The air conditioning can only be set down to 67 degrees. We set it at 67 in the room but the room still felt like it was 75. It was an early summer 75 degree day. I was so uncomfortable I slept without any blankets. What's worse is that when the AC kicks in it make a loud sound so it wakes you up every time it blows air. 3. TV - The TV is set to only go up to a certain volume level (my guess is due to the thin walls). This was a minor annoyance. 4. If you like elevators, you'll love this hotel - In order to get to the ground level you have to take two sets of elevators. It's a pain because you often have to wait for the lower level elevators. They have stairs but when we asked we were told they were for "emergency use only".

Friendly helpful staff and location was the best part of this budget hotel with sub-IKEA furnishings, paper thin walls and the loudest hotel entryway ever experienced. A pleasant accommodation where you will not sleep before 2am waiting for the constant wave of the inebriated loud and festive trudging up the wooden stairs right outside the front rooms to cease and the relentless dance music underneath to end. More hostel crash pad than hip hotel. Can't recommend or return until somethings done about the noise.

We stayed at the Palmer House for four nights with our friends. Both of the rooms were tiny and both overlooked a brick wall which made the rooms very dark and claustrophobic. To top it all off our lampstand bulb had blown too! We were woken most mornings by housekeeping shouting to their co-workers down the corrider who were oblivious to the do not disturb signs on the doors! This hotel charges for everything. The internet access was around $15 for 15 minutes and the breakfast was pricey. We had an excellent breafast at the Corner Bakery just outside the hotel. Don't be fooled by the impressive Lobby - that's about as good as it gets. On the plus side the staff were helpful and the beds were comfortable although, again, very small and the location was good.

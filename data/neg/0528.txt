We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Seattle until someone walked into our locked room at 4 am. The 3 members of our family were asleep but quickly woke up when someone fumbled with the door and then opened it with the key card. They were as surprised to see us as we were freaked out with someone gaining access to our room. The front desk had just checked them in and when I phoned down, the clerk said that there was supposedly no one in the room. I assured him that our family was there (2nd nite of our stay) and that we did not appreciate the intrusion. At that point I was told that breakfast was "on the house". Didn't quite make up for the shock!

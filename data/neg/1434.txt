Using points while on vacation, I was first placed in a smoking room while the preferance of a non-smoking room was in my profile. The new room's thermastat was placed on 65 degrees and never cooled down to that temperature. I've had better air conditioning at a Hampton Inn where my room door had a nice view of the interstate when I opened it.

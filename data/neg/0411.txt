My husband and I love weekend trips and decided to go for luxury this time. I wasn't impressed at all. First, they hit you with a $30/night parking fee and explain if you don't like it, just move your car to the street. The rooms were just large bedrooms. Nothing of elegance at all. There was nothing really wrong, I just didn't think it was special.

Ok location. Syrupy sweet clueless front desk staff. Generous size rooms. You should get a prize for finding the front door. The address is on 4th Avenue, but the entrance is actually on Seneca. Valet parking looks like you are pulling into the building not a parking structure. There is NO self parking. They will direct you to a garage on the corner, but if you are travelling on business or accuring hotel points this garage does not bill to the hotel. Very dark rooms, as in no lights, not as in dark enough to sleep late. Many better options in the area.

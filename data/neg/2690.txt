We stayed at the Lexington O & Suites April 19-23. The lobby was nice and clean, the front desk service was friendly but I got the impression that it was a very old facility in desperate need of attention. On one day the front desk was undergoing construction so the hammering could be felt throughout the hotel from early morning. On one day one of the two elevators was out of service - mind you neither of the two sounded safe going up or down!! Our room had a loose ring around the shower head which we believe was the entry way for two super large roaches that found their way into the room on two separate nights. (I am terrified of roaches!!). The room was extremely small and the furnishings very dark, including the curtains. If you don't plan to spend much time in the room it's a good place to stay at a reasonable rate. Location wise it's in good walking distance to many shops along Canal Street and the French Quarter. Not sure if I'd stay there again.

My family and I stayed at this hotel for six nights in May. The hotel is still undergoing renovations. The best and worst things about the hotel are its location. It is very close to the space needle (about three blocks away). It's also about a 5-10 minute walk from Lake Union. The neighborhood felt fairly safe during the daytime. I'm not sure if I would walk it at night. There were a few transients in the area. It didn't seem to us as if there were very many restaurants close by. The room was very small, but did seem as if it had been recently renovated. The remote controls for the tv were very simplistic, so that you had to scroll through each channel rather than being able to simply enter the channel you wanted. The free internet in the lobby was cool, but they ask you to limit your time to 15 minutes. The breakfast sucked! I'm still trying to figure out how they can say it has 26 items. The eggs were like hard biscuits and nothing had flavor to it. It was mainly bread, waffles, bagels, and danishes. The hotel staff seemed uninterested. You can hear everything that goes on above you and in the rooms next door.

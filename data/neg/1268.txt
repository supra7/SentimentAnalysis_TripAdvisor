Very disappointed in our stay this time. There was a large group there as well as our group. The other large group stayed out by the pool screaming, laughing, and yelling until 3 or 4 in the morning. When complaining to the front desk, they seemed uncaring and offered a small apology. We were there with a group of young girls ages baby to teen. They were in a competition and had a hard time getting sleep for all the noise from the other group on Friday and Saturday night. The hotel did nothing to try and quiet them down. The last night we were there after all the competitions were over, it was just after 9:00 p.m., the girls wanted to swim as they hadn't had much of a chance all weekend. The hotel threw a fit and wouldn't let them in because they are kids and would be too noisy! Say What??? After the last 2 nights, you were worried about OUR group being loud? They finally let the girls swim for 20 minutes on the condition that they were quiet. I'm thankful that they got to swim, but geez! They were waiting at the gate when that 20 mintues was up. Where were they the previous 2 nights? If was just one thing after another with this hotel and I was not impressed with the service at all this time. Especially by the front desk staff. AND...the servers at our banquet were the rudest I've ever encountered. I usually don't write bad reviews, but this was just a bad experience for a group.

We were relocated here from the Zagy Arabian Suites as that hotel was over booked or had maintenance issues. They also upgraded us to one of the larger suites. Location isn't the best. It is good if you want to be close the the airport, but not if you want to be close to town. On first impression the hotel suite was very large with 2 bedrooms, one with ensuite. There was also a large lounge with dining table, a kitchen and also a powder room near the front door. On the down side there were cracks appearing in the walls and ceiling. Lounge suite was very worn and alot of surfaces weren't very clean. Also plates and cutlery weren't very clean and there was no detergent to clean them with. Also about half of the inventory of the kitchen was missing. This included the jug, but I was able to phone the reception to ask for one and with 10 minutes they had got one for us. In summing up they have a cleanliness problem and are quite a distance from the city centre.

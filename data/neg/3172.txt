To start with the positive things: One of the receptionist was very kind and tried to help us always. Very nice guy. Also the woman who cleanes the rooms was friendly and tried to do the maximum she could... we are happy that we made no experience with bed bugs like other people wrote. Our room (number 10) for the price was good. Television worked, bathroom was okay (en suite), bed was big, coffe, tea gratis. Negative: LOCATION!!! When i waited alone with the luggage for my boyfriend at the exit of the metro, while he searched the "hotel" (not easy to find), I felt directly unsafe and watched by the people living in the area. In the night we felt both uncomfortable to walk the 10/ 15 min back to the hotel. The hotel or better B&B is situated on a mainstreet... in the night it was horrible loud... but like a person before us wrote: You had the choice of sleeping in a sauna, cos the heater was out of control, or trying to sleep with all that noises. When you entered the B&B there was a bad smell of garlic mixed with something else, that came out of the kitchen... fortunately our room was not infected of that smell. But we were not able to enter the kitchen a second time... so we had just one day breakfast. Toast, orange juice, tea, cornflakes... thats it... for the price good... but my cup was for example dirty, you feel like sitting on a bar, cos there are no tables, facing the wall... and this unforgettable smell! The owner was a little bit unpolite. In the end we have to say that London is very expensive and we paid just 50 pounds per night... also the way to the city center is easy. You need 10 min walking and nearly 15 with the train, BUT this are things that you know before. We would not book this hotel again, BUT when you want to save money it is a possibility (when you have room number 10).

Stayed at Hilton Bayfront primarily because I wanted to check out a new hotel. (have stayed at multiple other San Diego hotels in the past). To start, booked a room on the "Executive floor." Please ignore anything the hotel website says about this because there is no free continental breakfast (when I called the desk was told that they "don't do that anymore") and no executive lounge. So I paid extra for nonexistant executive floor perks. When confronted with this, management was completely unhelpful and said the price hike was for the higher floor (of course, I didn't think seeing the port of San Diego with its many dirty trucks and rusty ships was important to see from a bigger height, and I don't pay extra for higher floors anyway when I travel). The location is also inconvenient. The street (Harbor) is under construction and you must walk 2 blocks up and then 2 blocks to cross over the train tracks to even get to Gaslamp and Petco Park. It is convenient to the Convention Center and nothing else. This may improve somewhat once the construction finishes but there are still many more convenient hotels. The rooms are nicely decorated but quite small in size for a new hotel. The bathroom was also nice but small, with only a shower stall. The closet is tiny. Internet access is $12.95 a night, which I still think is ridiculous in a nice hotel. My girlfriend's parents stayed in a "suite" which was simply a corner room, with no added benefit except an extra window and nicer view. The lobby and restaurant are very nicely decorated and spacious, probably the only positives on this hotel. In conclusion, I've paid less money for nicer hotels and better location, and certainly won't stay at the Hilton Bayfront again.

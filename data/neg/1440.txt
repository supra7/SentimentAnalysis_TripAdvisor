Directions to the garage are wierd. Getting from the garage to the lobby is screwed up. Actually you dont know if you in Homewood Suite to Hilton Garden Inn- It does not say where you are - Good luck. At check in they stare at you - dont know how to greet and welcome a customer - who is bringing bread to their table -on and on- the valet rates just went up while I stayed there - surprise - the bathrooms are for midgets - yes I mean that. If you leave at note for housecleaning to leave one extra bag of coffee you wont get it - hush - they probably dont know how to read - or else - why would they not leave an extra bag of coffee? on and on I have stayed at better hotels same class with far superior service - the management dont know what's going on. I will go elsewhere next time. Try it you will be happier.

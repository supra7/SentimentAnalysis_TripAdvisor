We attempted to stay here in March of this year. We heard our local radio station sending trip giveaways to this location. We thought it to be a good location according to the pictures and website. In short, not at all what it is built up to be. This resort needs to be updated dramatically. It feels like you are stuck in the early eighties. What is billed as the most "hawaiian" hotel really means old. Nothing we saw looks remotely new. From computers the staff works on to the room amenities. We got a ocean front room. Upon check in we found dust on the ceiling and musty order. It felt like I got thrown back about 20 years. For the $320 a night, this would clearly be not worth it. After talking with the manager, she let us look at another room. Same thing!. Old and musty. We left this hotel for another one (RL). At the (RL) resort, we got modern amenities, ocean view room, and valet service for $70 cheaper a night. Choose another resort than this.

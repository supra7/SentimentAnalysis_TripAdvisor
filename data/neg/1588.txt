Where shall I start....Check in took forever and there were a lot of people but they didn't bring out more front desk employees to check us in faster. There was construction going on but the websites we looked at said it either was complete or there was no indication that there was construction. The rooms are only so-so. Nothing exciting about them what-so-ever. The bathroom was pretty plain - like a small cheap apartment bathroom. We were supposed to have an ocean view but it really wasn't much of one so we had to move to another room. The second day into the vacation I found a roach in the room and it ran into the mini fridge. When I complained they were nice about it but the attitude was "ok, so what do you want us to do about it?" rather than "let me get someone on that." Getting to the front desk to complain was an ordeal too. I couldn't find anyone to complain to without getting in line with everyone else who was checking in. It took so long that I gave up and went back later. They had a separate line for special members and even those people were told to get back in line. What is the point of having a special membership and line if you aren't going to honor it? And the roach? I found another one a few days later! Gross. Our stay was very disappointing. The service and quality of the place was not comparable to what we paid. Will never go back to that hotel, never recommend it. If anything we would tell anyone we talk to to go somewhere else.

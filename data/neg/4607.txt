We had a party of six including a 74 and 69 year old grand parents but were advised at check-in that our rooms had been ancelled via email from our tour operator. No proof of this could be provided and I strongly suspect that this was a simple case of overbooking and as tourist ( non corporate clients ). We had no opion but to accept being put up in two reception rooms on camp beds for the first night of our three night stay. On the second night when we moved to our actual rooms there were only two beds in each room when we had clearly booked for six adults ( daughter and son 18 and 15 ). When we requested two additional camp beds a very abrupt desk clerk ( Sean ) suggested this would cost an additional $40 per bed per night. A further visit to the reception to confront Sean and his manager Fayth managed to get a concesion on the charge but the whole experience left a very bitter taste and complete ruined the Chicago leg of our trip which was supposed to be the big treat. For completeness I would say we maganaged to extract $200 credit for the restaraunt but with a $36 cover charge for a party of six, six soups and burgers came to $260! not enough really for the inconvenience caused.

I was looking for a hotel that was away from the convention I was attending at the Hyatt, and this place sounded ideal. Unfortunately it is soooo tired there was just nothing redeeming about it at all. The carpets were obviously decades old, the bathtub was 100 different shades of off white, the walls are so thin I only got one decent night's sleep out of three, and to top it off the Hyatt (where I could have stayed) was gorgeous. The food in the restaurant is typical hotel restaurant- forgettable and expensive. And forget about hanging out for a drink after dinner- you are shown the door at 10.30 (on a Thursday night)- no ifs. ands or buts- you're done when they want to go home!

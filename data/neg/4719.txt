A foyer like the Sistine Chapel yes - but the rooms do not live up to initial impressions. We have just returned from a week at this Hotel and felt disappointed. Leaving the magnificent foyer and ascending to the lengthy poorly lit corridors, I observed part ceilings removed, perhaps for maintenance, but left open for many days. Ceilings were stained in a number of areas. The poorly designed bathroom meant there was only about 12" clearance between the opened door and the lavatory seat, so trying to manoeuvre while closing the door required vertical limbo dancing skills that I have never possessed. I assumed that the reason we had been given a room subsumed in gloom that overlooked the opposide side of the hotel was to avoid the noise from the El which runs parallel to the Hotel. It meant that very little natural light could enter the room and led to feeling of profound depression. Each day we returned to the hotel as late as possible, as we just did not like the stygian gloom. Holes in the bathroom walls from previously connected apparatus made the uncomfortable tiny room look even more scruffy. The prices for services could not be justified we felt. On the positive side, it was close to the Art Institute which was the purpose of the trip. But the final black mark against this Hotel was the disappearance of my brand new white broderie anglais pyjamas purchased specially for the trip! They cost me 49.99 and I wore them 4 times only. Reported to everyone from Security, to the Concierge to Housekeeping, but nothing recovered,or offered, not even an apology. They failed to deliver the paper for three days, I had to request it and the staff on Reception seemed vague and rather disinterested. To sum up, I would not return to this Hotel and would not recommend it to any other traveller.

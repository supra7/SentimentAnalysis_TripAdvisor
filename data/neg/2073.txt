4 OUT OF 10 this is a very spectacular resort but the service and the good are not good at all!!! for example, they did not replenish the shampoo bottles that were tiny everyday and when you called for a cart to pick you up at 7 10 it arrived at 7 35 after 3 calls to ask where the cart actually is. most of the staff do not speak english at all which made it hard to communicate and receive the service or the thing that you needed. i wouldn't go back there again.

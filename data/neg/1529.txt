Excuse me but that's not what I call a hotel! It's a b&b and I'm nice because a b&b is even a lot better then the Foro Romano Imperatori. I could accept to pay 40 Euro, but 125 is unacceptable for what we got! First of all, when we arrived in front of the hotel, it looks like a regular building, not like a hotel. We rang, we got inside and we had to go to the second floor to find the "reception" and the breakfast room. after that we had to go to the 4th floor without elevator because you need a key to use it and we don't have the key. The room was little, not really clean. The bathroom was a joke, the noise from the street was aweful (it was like sleeping directly on the sidewalk) and it was extremely cold (and the supplementary blanket was soooooo dusty). The breakfast was a joke also. Some fruits, but liing there for like 3 weeks, they could almost walk alone. The croissant, bread and everything else was hard and old. On the website they say that they have a room where we can put the luggage after the check out...It's FALSE...there's nothing. We had to fight to find a solution so that we could leave our luggage in a safe place because they wanted us to leave them in the middle of the corridor, where anybody could have taken it. One other thing, there's nobody at the reception. Only one person comes for the breakfast and for the check-in/check-out...otherwise you can't ask anything because nobody's there. The only good thing are the location, close to the Coliseum and the Foro. They "try" to be friendly and the roomservice (room cleaning because there is no roomservice) was ok...I say "was ok" because it was a good surprise, we tought we had to do everything ourself. Oh...and one other thing, we had to pay in advance, at the check-in. We will NEVER go there again...to much expensive for a such crappy hotel...how can they call it a luxury hotel...how can they call it a hotel at all !!!

This hotel is very convenient for people visiting patients in the hospital. The lobby is beautiful, the room is very spacious. Great roof top view with tables and chairs. The room needed some repairs: TV problems, windows wouldn't open (we had 4 windows in room), needed light bulbs, needed a plumber...All was fixed when I made the request. Breakfast was good, but they only had one person and she was working her tail off. We ended up eating breakfast at the Corner Cafe about a block away. It was great. This hotel is at the top of a hill, but my husband and I both enjoy the exercise. I would only recommend it by also adding the issues we had and to make sure all is in working order.

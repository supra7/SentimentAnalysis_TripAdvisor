Well, we didn't actually get to stay there!!!!!!!!! We booked the Hollingbury via another website "Hostelworld" (who were very very helpful & friendly)!! Our reservation went through fine, a deposit was taken and we were sent a reservation number. Just to confirm our booking (luckily) we emailed the hotel directly to inform them that if there were cancellations that we would prefer a double room rather than a twin. We received a response which stated "i'm sorry but we are fully booked for this night". So, if we had just turned up to check in to the hotel, there would have been no room for us!!!! We called the hostelworld customer service team and they informed us that its up to the individual hotel to update their availability. In short, granted we didn't stay there, but if anyone is to book via another online company, please contact the hotel first to ensure that your booking is VALID!! or you might be stuck with nowhere to stay on a very busy Saturday night!!!! But going by the other comments, I don't think the place is up to much anyway!!!!!

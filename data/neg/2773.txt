This was, without a doubt, the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The only good thing about it was the night clerk. She was very nice and helpful. The first room we were given was on the backside of the hotel where there is no parking. Did not feel safe at all! The room was disgusting...rusted bathtub, nasty shower curtain, the bathtub ran (not dripped) constantly, the outlets and wiring were falling off the walls, the light in the bathroom was hanging off the ceiling, and worst of all, there was a screw (the pointy part) coming out of the headboard! We immediately requested a new room and was given a room on the front of the hotel with two beds. This room was a little better, but not by much. We stayed only because we were not going to be there but two nights (arrived around 9:30 both nights). There is a train track behind the building and I believe this was the only building with the windows not busted out within a one mile radius. Oh, and the parking lot is a joke. It dead ends at the end of the building, so you have to drive BACKWARDS into the ghetto street to get out. Please pay a little more money and do not even consider staying here. I have absolutely no idea where they got the pictures of this hotel to put on their Super 8 website!

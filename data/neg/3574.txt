Changed rooms 3 times. Smelled like old antiques and cat urine. This place should be leveled and replaced with a parking deck . This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in and the city of Dallas should shut it down. Dont go to the restaurant because no one will wait on you. This place made me absolutely sick. Spend an extra $20.00 and stay at the Marriott around the corner...... It would be safer and cleaner! I would rather stay in a hostel with homeless people...... Thats how bad this place is. WHAT A S@#% HOLE!!!!!!

Traveled to Chicago for two nights on business, and arrived at the Palmer House around 10pm. HHonors Desk was closed, but was checked in quickly nonetheless. This hotel boasts that it is the oldest continuously operating hotel in the country. The first room I was checked into must have been the oldest continuously operating room in the hotel! It looked like it hadn't been renovated in about 20 years (the green tile in the bathroom was quite charming... really.) and had a lovely view of an A/C compressor that was bigger than my room! Went back to the reception desk, and asked if an HH Gold upgrade to the exec floor upgrade was available. Was upgraded to exec floor, to a room with one double bed. Room was nicer than the last one, but you couldn't have parked a Yugo in there with enough room to open the doors! Stay was pleasant enough afterwards. A bit noisy during the night. Lobby is undergoing renovations. Exec lounge was fine. Not bad for a business trip, but next time I'll be staying somewhere that has a bit less "history" in my room!

The Edgewater is a great example of Pacific Northwest style. The log fire out front sets the tone for a cosy look that is carried out throughout the hotel. The location is pretty good as you have the Space Needle on one side and Pike Place on the other. It is expensive but I would not say it is value for money. Seattle is one of the most 'wired' cities in the world but the Edgewater will charge you $25 for internet access. We were also woken two nights running by the fire alarms going off. Staff were giving contradictory instructions ('Stay there'/'Go to the fire point) and both times it was a fault. Apparently this is not an unusual occurence. No form of compensation was forthcoming. We were also woken by the Navy one morning who were berthed next door and like a big band and plenty of horns when they set sail. I also had to argue my case about a toll free phone call that they were attempting to bill me $70 for. So to summarise if you want to be kept awake in a lovely looking hotel who will suck the cash right out of your pockets then this is the place to be.

I booked a room through Expedia for $354.88. Mayflower sold my room to someone else. Was moved to a different hotel whose room rate was $99.00. Called Expedia AND Mayflower. They offered to refund me 154.88. That means I would pay $200 for a $100 room. No one takes responsibility. I've traveled for 30 years; never had an experience like that. There's lots of hotels and and online travel agencies. I will not choose or use Expedia or Mayflower Park Hotel again.

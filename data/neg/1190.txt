Red Lions have really gone down hill What a terrible experience. The only good things were the new coffee shop in the lobby and apparently they didn't charge me for my room. The front desk is so non-verbal I'm really not sure of anything. Checking in, the front desk gal continually yawned (and it was 6pm). She barely spoke to me. I had stayed here before and wasn't pleased but the hotel is close to my clients and I read they had renovated. What I found was a scary, dirty, smelly place. I asked for a safe room and was put as far away from the front desk as possible. The halls are dark and scary and I did not see another soul. My room had a strong smell of some kind of cleaning detergent that made my eyes water and gave me a headache. The bedding and towels all had this STRONG oder. I know there are worse odors, but this one was burning. My window would not lock and the sheets were stained. I considered asking to be moved to another room, but I felt my chances of getting anything better were slim.I will never stay here again and may never stay at another Red Lion.

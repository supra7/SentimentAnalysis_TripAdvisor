I travel quite extensively and very seldom do I have such a negative experience. First night.. pulled back sheet and saw two little black bugs.. but hey its humid and TX and they weren't bedbugs or cockroaches. First morning we went down (on time) to breakfast.. the one lonely sausage (I think it was supposed to be sausage)was burnt black and the one half danish truly looked as if someone had taken a bite out of it and the milk pitchers were empty. Later a housekeeping trash bag was left next to the elevator for more than an hour and housekeeping wasn't even up on the floor. The plumbing was sluggish at best with showers being taken in ankle deep water. Later when the toilet continued to be sluggish and we asked to have something done we were handed a plunger!! We never got to talk to the Manager as apparently they were in California(??). Second to last day we went to breakfast and sausage was again burned black (there were three total) and no danishes and maybe one small spoonful of eggs. We went directly to the front desk who only made excuses saying well the power was out. In fact, the power had been out for about 5 minutes more then an hour previous. We gathered our stuff and checked out a day early. No discount no apologies were offered until we pushed a little bit more and they asked what we would like to have done. A guest shouldn't be asked to do their own maintenance and if you are offering breakfast it should at least be edible and enough to eat. They have ruined Comfort for me forever.

DON'T go near this one. Not even sure the central park hotel is a hotel. might actually be an agency because NO - ONE is given a room in the actual building. EVERYONE is brought by taxi to extreme north london suburbs. We were brought to an absolute minus 2 star hellhole in Muswell Hill. had to get buses to get back anywhere near London which takes 1 1/2 hours on weekdays and costs 5 return. When we first entered the reception of the central park there was a french guy about to attack the receptionist due to this messing. Stay away FOREVER>

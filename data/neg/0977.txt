We arrived at the Hotel Vintage Park mid-week an hour before check-in after flying cross country and were somewhat put off that there were no rooms available for our requested (slightly) early check-in. The staff politely checked to see if there would be any rooms available only after we pressed them on the point, and we were told we could wait 15 minutes for a room in the very small lobby. We did, but instead of the king room we requested the front desk apologized that only a queen was available (this only 45 minutes before official check-in mid-week - somewhat hard to believe). Imagine my surprise to find not a queen bed at all but a full sized bed (we sleep on a queen at home, so I know the difference). When I asked about it I was told it was a queen and not offered a different room. Also, contrary to some of the other reviews, it was most definitely not a tempur-pedic mattress, though it was a comfortable bed. The bathroom had no vent/fan, and the room was quite small, so everytime we showered the room became stuffy and humid (even after leaving the windows open and returning after several hours, the ventilation was that bad). The Aveda products and free newspapers were appreciated, but offset by the expensive paid internet ($6/15 minutes) and lack of coffee in the room (served downstairs each morning). The only real positive was the location, which was right in the middle of downtown, near the library, symphony, shops and restaurants. For the nearly $200/nt price, I would not stay here again.

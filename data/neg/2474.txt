We booked this hotel for a weekend in London. When we arrived on Friday afternoon, we were issued with rooms on the main road, ground floor, where you could hear people talking outside on mobile phones. The main corridor of the ground floor stinks of cat urine and is worse first thing in the morning. The rooms are only barely a step up from your worst hostel. The beds were awful, broken springs etc. There is no phone in the room to call reception or indeed assistance if this was needed. We took in a show on Friday night and some of the group wanted a nightcap. The bar/"dining area" is tiny and there was no one using the facilities at 10.45pm. Bar staff member most unhelpful, rude and we clearly disturbed his TV viewing as he turned up the TV to a deafening volume to continue his viewing pleasure, whilst ignoring paying customers. We eventually gave up and left. Later that evening, there was a disturbance of a group of men returning from a night out who obviously were having a heated discussion, which resulted in one of them kicking a massive hole in wall outside our room. Being two lone females with no access to phone main desk for assitance this was a particularly scary and unsettling end to our evening. The heating in both rooms was problematic and the reception merely handed over a convector heater to our friends for their room, and didnt even check the heating panel etc or offer any further assistance. Given that it in minus degrees this was awful. There was poor poor quality of breakfast on offer, no cups, mugs, bread etc for basic tea/coffee or toast. Member of staff on duty said it was his first day and he didnt know what to do. Really - avoid this hotel, there are better quality "budget" hotels in the area but would neve use this hotel again.

We have spent 3 nights at this hotel, chosen after reading other comments. Generally we would leave in the morning, explore the city and return in the afternoon (between 4 and 5 p.m.) to rest a little and change before going out in the evening. Both days, when we arrived at the hotel, our room was not cleaned yet. When we complained at the reception, they told us that they were sorry but they were dealing with a large group! While we were paying  160 a night. Both a written complaint and an e-mail to the hotel afterwords, did not supply any reaction from this hotel.Unbelieveable!! Other than that, the neighbourhood was nice (typical Spanish) and the center was easy to reach by metro. Barcelona was great!

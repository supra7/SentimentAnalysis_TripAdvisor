It was a good deal and was booked with no problem online. I arrived late at night and the room was waiting for me. I got room 601 which was on the top floor next to the elevator room right next to me. There was a constant strong noise coming from there which made it impossible to sleep. It was raining that night you could here the rain banging on my ceiling pretty hard. The room was tiny and not much left around the bed. Could not open the suitcase - only on the bed. I felt I had fleas in the bed and was itching all night. The hotel has no restaurant or place to get something to eat. Its located next to a 24 hour food court which was nice. Other rooms may have been fine but the rooms on the 6th floor are terrible.

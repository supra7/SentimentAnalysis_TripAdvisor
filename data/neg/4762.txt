I am a seasoned traveller and frequently stay all sorts of hotels for business and pleasure travel. The Sheraton Dallas is a new low in conference hotels. The room was poorly maintained and unkempt (see pic with hair stuck to / paint peeling off of the shower ceiling). The main reason for this negative review, however, is the staff''s attitude. The desk clerk was rude and treated each of the guests in the long queue at registration as adversaries, quoting "Company Policy" as unassailable reason behind her inexcusable behavior. She was openly hostile to me. Avoid at all costs. When in Dallas, stay at the Magnolia, even if you find yourself one of the poor unfortunates attending a convention with the misfortune of booking at the Sheraton.

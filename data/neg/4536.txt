So my friend Jim has been telling me that he prefers Hilton and I tell him that I prefer Marriott. So I decided to go "out of brand" for a stay. I am so sorry that I did. When you walk into the lobby of the Palmer House Hilton, you will be overwhelmed by the beautiful lobby. They must have spent millions $$$ on the public areas. The areas outside of the elevators are spacious and that is where the spaciousness comes to an end. The room that we had was so small and a beautiful window that looked out onto a roof HVAC area with quite a bit of trashed sitting around. (Room 10-212) This room had the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel and I travel a lot! The toilet was situated between a vanity top and a wall with about 20 inches of room. I won't go into any more. The wallpaper is peeling in the bathroom and the floor is supposed to be white tile I believe. Check-in was long and frustrating. The lines were terrible and the staff appeared to confused. Every front desk transaction seemed to baffle the staff there. The rooms at the hotel are not cheap. Parking is not cheap and it seems to be the biggest rip off to pay so much for so little. If you want to stay here, that is up to you but you will never see me back there again.

I stayed at the hotel because of the location, once I checked in the clerk made me aware of all the surroundings and what was open to get something to eat late since since I checked in around 2am.He first said that there cupboard had many iteams that I could take up to my room to eat so I wouldn't have to leave the hotel.I asked how the hotel van worked and he said that they go in a 5 mile radius of the hotel but to check with the morning staff to get the exact locations of van services.Well in the morning thats when all the problems happen I talked to the office mgr and she didn't want to help me with any of my questions,when I asked her if I could maybe get a room with two beds because I was going to have friends stay over she said I would have to pay an upgrade fee and then extra person fee.No where does it say on there reservation screen of these extra fees.I thought since I was a PC member I would get some kind of break or respect but I guess not,this is a nice place to stay but I guess you just have to talk to the right people to get good customer service.

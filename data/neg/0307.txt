Both the General manager and Desk Manager are completely unaccommodating, to try and build a relationship in the hospitality industry these two individuals are completely ill-equipped, especially to a long term customer. Well never stay here again, and will inform all our friends who use to frequent this hotel to do the same. There are a heap of hotels in the vicinity, a Kimpton on either side and a W next door that would love to accommodate you better.

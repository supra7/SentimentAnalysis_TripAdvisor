Woud never stay here again. We pulled up to valet to check in and we were told that we had to park 3 blocks down because our chevy tahoe would not fit in the garage. I could not believe it! I told the bellman that for the price of the room ($250) I can't believe that you do not have parking for my vehicle. We had to drive 3 blocks away to park and then get a cab back to the hotel because it was miserable outside. Then when we checked out we had to hike 3 blocks to the car and then go back to the hotel to pick up our luggage.

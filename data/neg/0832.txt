We had stayed at this property before but after this stay, never again. I booked our room and inlaw rooms using the hotel web page. Our reservations said king with pull out, their copy of the reservation said 2 double beds. No one seem to take the difference seriously until I got home and emailed them a copy of the reservation. On arrival we tipped the bellman to have our bags brought to our rooms. 3 hours later we found our bags and our inlaws bags sitting outside the hotel and had to bring them up ourselves. We were on the 9th floor and on Sunday morning we tried to go down the elevators to have breakfast. We were there 20 minutes and watched elevator after elevator opened that was full. We finally put my inlaws on an elevator going up to get down to the lobby. We decided to take the stairs. Well there is no way to get to the lobby using the stairs. It goes to a alarmed door that goes outside so we had to walk up to the 6th floor and take an elevator up the 37 floors to get down to the lobby. Simple hiring elevator doormen during this peek hours could help with this nightmare. The room was awefully hot and wouldn't cool off even though it was December The biggest gripe is that they tried to get money out of you every time your turned around. They had a bottle of water in the room with a $5.50 price tag on it!! There was a coffee cart in the lobby but to use it you had to pay $2.50 for a cup. The kids did get a kick out of the $8.00 jelly beans that was sitting out in our room for purchase. For an old hotel, with poor service, and poor rooms, couldn't they at least not charge $5.50 for a bottle of water! I didn't even see that in NY city! We will choice another place next time. We usully enjoy staying in Westin Starwood properties. This is one they need to consider taking the Westin name off of it because it doesn't live up to the name.

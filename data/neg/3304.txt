My family and I stayed at World Quest a couple of weeks ago for 6 nights/7 days. Looking at the website, it looks fantastic. However, they fail to tell you that housekeeping only picks up trash daily. If you want towels or washcloths daily, there is a fee. Also, if you want your sheets changed, there is a fee. There is a fee for everything they do at the resort other than take your trash. While we were there, we had to call the front desk after being at the park all day, just to have someone come get our trash and bring us towels and washcloths so that we could take a shower!! And, we paid in advance for the service which is what made it even more frustrating. So actually, they didn't even do it with the fee until we would call. We were very disappointed with the service and the stay at the resort. If tyou plan on using the shuttle provided, be prepared. It only runs 3 times in the morning and 3 times in the evening. And, it drops you off at Epcot to catch the monorail. So, make sure you allow an hour just to get to Magic Kingdom or anywhere other than Epcot. We ended up spending so much money on taxis because of the inconvenient shuttle schedule. It is a beautiful resort, but the convenience and service is not worth the view! We are definately going to do our homework next trip.

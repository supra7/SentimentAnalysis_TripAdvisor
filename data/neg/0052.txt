Well where do I start? HORRIBLE!. Okay the location was good and the restaurant was superb. Ralphs market was across the street and great as well as Dahlias restaurant. As for the hotel itself. We arrived there an hour early and were punished. Desk Clerk had something to say about our New Yawk accent. We were then punished by being given a handicap access room that had no bathtub. The room was drafty and it faced the parking lot and construction site which was noisy. The bed and the bed linens looked and felt like they were from the original days of George Washington. Shabby and nasty. The tv was antiquated, the stations limited. No fridge, small towels and never enough of them. Parking was almost 30 dollars a night and internet was exorbitant as well. The pool was nothing to write home about and the fitness room was .,. limited as well. all in all i would say that if it were the last hotel in Seattle I would sooner camp out.

After arriving in the evening for a one night stay for work commitments met by a rude and unhelpful member of staff. I was given my room key once arriving at the room it did not work, returned to recpetion, had the same issue again on the third trip to recpetion I was given another room key, once I got into the room, I discovered it was someone elses room (luckly they were not in the room at the time - or in bed) I then returned again to reception who continued to be unhelpful. I finally got another room and key, I was expecting some external noise after reading reviews and the location, however spent most the night wondering if someone was about to come into the room. Cheap and know what you are getting with travelodge I can accept - but think this is unacceptable.

I honestly would have been better off staying at a hostel like my friend and I initially wanted to. When we checked in the room was not what we reserved, but the location was great so we over looked it. On and off through our stay the toilet stopped working, the shower was broken and our fan broke. When we asked if they would fix it..they blamed the broken fan on us and said it was fine, it's cold out side and you are leaving tomorrow so you don't need a fan. Two of the men behind the desk were decent, but one of them was just horrible!

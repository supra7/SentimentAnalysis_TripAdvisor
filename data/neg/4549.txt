tiniest room we have ever stayed in. difficult for 2 people to pass each other to get around the bed. also rooms tired. elevators incredbily slow despite 3 banks of them divided by floors for (one would have thought) efficiency and quick response. poor staffing-at 4:30 Saturday afternoon, only 1 concierge on duty--very long lines at registration. there was one highlight--pillows were amazing and in great supply. this hotel is resting heavily on its former reputation as a chicago landmark hotel.

I don't even know where to begin with how shocking this stay has been. I came to this hotel because it was highly recommended. BAD IDEA. Essentially, they have charged me over $600 for two nights stay at $99 each, as well as taking $300 CASH. They have no record of the charges to my account, and claim they wouldn't have charged my account, only done an authority - when I offered to show them my bank statement they changed their mind and agreed with me, then said it will take 5 business days to refund my account - by which time I will be back at home. Therefore - they're taking all of my spending money ((WITHOUT my authority)) and won't give it back until long after I leave the country. After the initial difficulties checking in, I offered to get an alternative credit card authority sent through. This seemed like like a fair solution - until the hotel screwed it up in multiple ways. Firstly, they sent the form asking for authority for my first night only - which, incidentally, they have already charged me for TWICE so it seems they want a 3-for-1 deal???; then the person who received it didn't print it out, and took the next day off which means that now, 48hrs later, even though they've received the authority and have charged me multiple times, they're asking for more money, denying they've charged anything to my card and refusing to use the credit card authority they've already received. All in all, worst hotel experience ever. Staff are not helpful at all. Hotel charges multiple times for single nights and takes money off cards they don't have authority to use, and mysteriously charge accounts and yet have no record of it. On top of this, the staff have been extremely patronizing. I get the feeling that this is because I am a young female traveling on my own, so ladies especially, DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!!!!!

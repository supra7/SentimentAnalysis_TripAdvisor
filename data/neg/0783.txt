If you like spending money and receiving no extras then stay here. At a rate of $252 per night on a week day stay, this is what you receive; analog TV, no breakfast, internet is $9 a day, $5 Pepsi 12 oz cans in the mini bar. If it wasnt for the fact the company paid for the room, Id check out and find a Motel 6. At least in a Motel 6 they give you some bagels, fruit & coffee for your stay. Room is above average. Otherwise its a RIP OFF. Pros are quality lobby & lounge. But expect to shell out some serious cash. Over all its a real disappointment. This place shoud have Jesse James' famous tattoo; "Pay Up Sucker!"

this is the perfect example of "you dont get what you see"...if you look at their website the hotel seems very fancy,( even if there are some signs of the lack of their seriousness in the way their website is vague about every relevant details ) but once you get to Amsterdam ..surprise! First of all its a 3 stars hotel ( a bad one) not 4 as the hotel rate itself on the website. Rooms are extremely small, the deco is very average. No mini bar, no hair dryer , no phone, mini tv ( in dutch only) , no shampoo/soap/toothbrush+paste ...dont even expect the basics! They dont even change your sheets daily!!!! Staff very rude, not helpful at all, one day we arrived in the room and instead of finding our steam room temperature we found ourselves in Siberia ....the smart maid turned off the heather and left the window open ... the very helpful receptionist look at me and my friend like we were 2 idiot and didn t even offers us another room or at least a hot tea!! The day before the water was down for maintenance from 10am till 5pm. Wifi doesn t work! THe day we checked out we were woke up by "someone" knocking an yelling like a hyena at our door saying we had to leave the room asap (it was 11am) ....overall the worst experience in the most ridiculous "hotel" with the most unfriendly and dumb stuff The owner should have kept doing his 2 rooms only B&B business. Only good thing is the location which is close to the museum district in a very quiet area

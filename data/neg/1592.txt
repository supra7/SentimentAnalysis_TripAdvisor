We were supposed to check in this weekend but after reading the reviews regarding the construction we quickly cancelled our reservations and booked another hotel. We booked our reservations well in advance and I am extremely disappointed that we weren't informed of the construction that would be happening. Even while we were making reservations for restaurants and cabanas and activities, not once was it mentioned - they did mention this would be a busy time for them, but nothing at all about the construction. Other hotels actually offer a discounted rate when they are undergoing construction, or they even close for a month or so - I guess the Hyatt is too good for that. Thankfully Expedia was kind enough to help us out and change our reservations!!

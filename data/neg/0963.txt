I didn't actually stay but am so mad I can hardly see straight. I called to confirm our over the phone reservations I'd made despite hesitation from these reviews. When I booked I talked to Marilyn who assured us an updated room, newer beadspreads and facing the space needle w/an actual room #. When I called 5 days prior to the date of reservation, thank God I did, was told by a heavy accented man they do not guarantee rooms because somebody might be staying in it. Yea like me. Isn't that one of the reasons you make reservations? He said "I just cancell you right now" So I let him because I felt I was taking a big risk by staying there in the first place. He was a very bad customer service person. I will be writing again if he charges my credit card because he has all my information.

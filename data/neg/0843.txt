We reserved three night stay at Westin Seattle thru hotwire. Now i have to say that this is NOT what you would expect from a four star hotel charging $150 a night! The carpets were absolutely filthy!! You could see stains all over the hotel rooms...not only on the carpets but also on the sofas and comforters!! We were staying at the Starwood Preffered Floor. At first i thought it was just our room, but upon checking the rooms of our other two friends....ours looked relatively "cleaner". They did not even have a fitted sheet on the mattress so the sheets kept riding up. But the major concern was the double sized beds which were too small for two people...so although my husband and i did sleep on the same bed, it wasn't the most comfortable way. Two good things that prevented me from screaming out of frusturation was the bathroom (nice showers, clean) and a great view (on the 34th floor). Three days before we came to Westin, we had stayed at Madison Rennaisance, and i have to admit i missed it terribly! It was much better, bigger, AND cleaner compared to the overpriced Westin. They even provided with the best complimentary hot chocolate i have ever tasted with every wake up call. Westin seattle was a total disappointement. Reminded me of a run down dorm...with a high price tag. You can find much better deals, trust me!

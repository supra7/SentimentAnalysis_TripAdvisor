We stayed one night and booked the park and fly 10 day pkg. The hotel valet parked our car and kept our keys while we were gone. When we returned someone had gone through our glove and jockey box and stole a few items. They also stole our garage door opener so they could have broken into our home too. Luckily that didn't happen. The hotel did not offer much assistance and tried to blame someone else. WE WILL NOT STAY HERE AGAIN!!!!

Completely dissappointed when we were told that this was a 4 star hotel, when it is really a 3. Service from start to finish was the worst I've ever seen except for David the bell-man, the youngest and most hard working of the entire crew. The valet manager (I believe) was a snot and argued with my wife in front of a group of guests calling her a liar. The room was cute, but the fireplace (heater) doesn't ever turn fully off and we had to keep the window open for ventilation. The fresh air was nice, but the trains and traffic didn't allow us to sleep. Back to the terrible service...at breakfast in 6 7, the waitress was friendly and the food was pretty good, however the restaurant or bar manager decided to call our waitress incompetent and say, "unbelievable, unbelievable!" as he shook his head and walked away. From our point of view she didn't even do anything wrong. Overall I'd have to say that there was nothing about this hotel that we enjoyed. It was one of the worst overall experiences we've ever had and I wouldn't stay there ever again!

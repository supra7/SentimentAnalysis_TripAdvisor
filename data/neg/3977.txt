My son got married last weekend, we reserved a block of rooms for ourselves, and out of town family. Stayed a night last summer to check the hotel out, all was very good for that visit. Since then, something has happened. At check in, we were told that the suite we reserved wasn't available. We wanted to suite, so we would have room to visit with family mambers. Pushed the issue, and the manager was able to give us the suite. These suites have two doors. After three attempts, and two visits from maintenance, they never could give us a key for the second door, only a master key could work. Several rooms had no AC, best they could do is offer a fan for the room. Several rooms had AC the worked, but only marginally. It's not like it was 100 degrees outside, it was only in the 80's. One guest found a roach in the bathroom. They wre moved to another room, and told that they would be comp'ed for the room that night. Until they went to check out, and had to fight for quite some time to get the room charge deleted. Billing for garage parking was fouled up, they tried to charge guests with no car for parking. Several rooms wern't ready for 3:00 PM check in, causing a scramble to get dressed for 4:00 wedding rehearsal. The staff seemed to be trying to do thier best, but the systems and infrastructure are a mess.

We were there durring renovation, so I wont judge the hallways and elevators, but there were ants in mine and my moms room! They sent somone to spay for my mom, and left her there... I had my 1 year old with me so they did change our room. My nephew was also with us and they gave him a room overlooking a dumpster and I hear it smelled bad. While we booked as a group our rooms were not together, in fact they were not even on the same floor. The beach it was on had some pretty hard waves rolling in and for me I would love it but for the baby not so much,

We stayed in the Sheraton for 2 nights in July. Really nice hotel, helpful staff, really nice bar BUT we prepaid for our hotel through our travel agent, there was a bit of confusion on check in and as usual they swiped our credit card for incidentals. Arrived back to Ireland and several weeks later they charged $230 to our credit card out of the blue!! They have conceded that this charge was made in error but six weeks later I still haven't got my money back. Really disappointed with how it's been dealt with, I've effectively been robbed by the hotel and they've made little or no effort to rectify their mistake in a timely way. I'm hoping to receive a repayment in the coming days but I've spent so much time on the phone trying to sort it out at this stage I'm still holding my breath. Fab hotel but massively disappointed with customer service.

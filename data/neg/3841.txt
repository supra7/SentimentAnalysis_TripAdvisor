This is a decent hotel, but definitely not worth what they charge for the room, even at a discount the rate was much higher than what I'd expect to pay for this kind of room and service. The standard price of $320 is about $120 too high. The quality of the rooms really doesn't stand out over much cheaper hotels and actually some aspects of the room such as curtains that fully close would be available in most budget hotels, but not here. On top of that they charge extra for basic services like in-room internet. At these rates I would expect it to be free. There is free internet in the lobby, but it is nice to read your e-mail in the privacy of your room rather than in a public spot. Dining options in the hotel are limited and actually quite poor, luckily there are plenty of better restaurants close by. The location is pretty good and the staff are friendly and helpful, but that doesn't justify the rates they charge.

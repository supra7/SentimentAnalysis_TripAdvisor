We booked this hotel from your site in good faith and believed your site when you said this hotel was a 4 star hotel. It was anything but a average 3 star hotel. We felt cheated when we found out that what we had booked was different to what had been advertised. The room was so tiny you could not open the wardrobe door without hitting the bedside table, TV had only 4 channels that worked, plus the screen was 15 inch which was not clear to watch either. The breakfast was appalling and certainly not 4 star. The building clearly was not a four star hotel and when we checked out they wanted to charge us for the hot water we had requested for making our daughters baby bottles. We were totally disgusted and disappointed with this booking.

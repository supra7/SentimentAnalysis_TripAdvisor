This hotel was a huge disappointment. We only needed a hotel for one night so we put up with "urine like smells" in the halls and filthy carpets--not dirty, yes filthy. Front desk people were OK, not great. We asked for options to SETAC and were guided to a town car of their choice for $38.00. They did not tell us we could get there easily for $2.50 per person on the new light rail--we located it on our own and it was great and convenient to the hotel. The restaurant is surprisingly good with a great looking bar; but our waiter thought he was a comedian--not really funny either.

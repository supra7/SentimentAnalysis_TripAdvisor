A very family orientated place to stay. Beautiful gardens and an awesome view of the beach. The location is fantastic! The rooms were very old and badly needed renovation. The room smelled musty and was not very clean. The restaurants were also old and dirty, althoug the food at the Tiki Terrace was pretty good (just dont think about the kitchens). The pool was less than stellar...also needed updating. The staff was very friendly and helpful which convinced me to try to get over the dirty room. Eat at the other hotels on the strip and at Whalers Village...and most your time will be on the beach snorkeling. Id go back for a family stay....but bring the lysol!

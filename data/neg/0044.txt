Saw the good reviews for this hotel on tripadvisor and wanted to give it a try. Maybe my hope was too high. Positive : 1. Complimentary high internet service 2. Lobby and the bathroom on the second floor of the lobby are nice. Negative: 1. Parking is US$27/night. TWENTY SEVEN USD!!!!!!!!! 2. There's NO fan in the bathroom. So you can imagine how it smells after you do your business. Sucks!! 3. Room and bathroom are kinda old. 4. We had to move to another room since the initial room we got was VERY noisy constantly. Sirens, cars, you name it. 5. Beds are not so comfy, kinda hard and small for 2 people.

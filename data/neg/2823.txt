The hotel is recently renovated, the staff tries to do a good job. The hotel doesnt have safety deposit boxes in the rooms. During our stay, my wife left her running watch in one of the drawers inside a pouch. Her watch were stolen. The hotel manager said he couldnt do anything. We are talking about $250.00 US. We paid much more for our stay. The least they could do is pretend that they care and give you a couple nights credit on your next stay.

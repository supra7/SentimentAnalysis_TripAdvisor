I travel often and frequently, and would never stay at the hyatt regency boston again. Iv never complained before but feel it necessary. When I stay at a hyatt i think of the one in lake tahoe, comfortable, nice pools, clean with good service. This hotel was dirty, poorly kept up, in a sketchy neighbourhood and the service was bad. The room was well worn! The housekeeper, never properly cleaned the room and left towels on the floor dirty and did not replace them. I am a gold passport member, and purchased an upgraded corner room, which was not even in the corner, and did not have 180 degree views as suggested. In a Hilton or marriott, they will at least upgrade you when you are a member or leave you drink coupons, a small bottle of wine, etc for special occassions however nothing on my birthday. I love boston, but this hotel was such a dissappointment that I will not stay at a hyatt unless necessary again.

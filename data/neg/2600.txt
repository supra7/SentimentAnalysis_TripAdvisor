After having seen reviews of this place where the hotel had cancelled existing reservations, we were uneasy about reserving here. Nevertheless, because we love the hotel's location and could not find rooms at a couple of other hotels in close proximity, we decided to reserve at the Pantheon Inn but we were very careful to verify and confirm our reservations by email with the hotel several times. We had no less than 5 separate email communications with the hotel over a 3+ week period verifying our reservations (and confirming our airport pickup), including one the day before we arrived. Needless to say, when we arrived at the airport in Rome the driver was not there to pick us up. After calling the hotel, we were told the driver was at the wrong location (eventually a driver picked us up). Once in the car to the hotel, the driver told us we were being taken to a different hotel in a completely different area of the city! We again called the hotel and were informed that the hotel was booked and they did not have a room for us!!! It appears that this is a common practice for these people. It is horribly unfair and inconvenient. We cannot urge you to STAY AWAY FROM THESE LIARS in any stronger terms.

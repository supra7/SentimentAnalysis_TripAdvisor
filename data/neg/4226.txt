Had the opportunity to stay for several nights recently. Hotel is really phenomenal, contemporary, and a GREAT location. Our room however was the size of a closet with a basic furniture in the room making it nearly impossible for people to pass each other navigating the room. To enter the bathroom you had to pass by the door, open it, then enter depending upon which side of the bed you were approaching from. The bathroom could be defined as an excellent use of space, provided you were 4' tall. Sitting on the commode, my knees actually touched the wall immediately in front of me. When I addressed my displeasure with the accommodations with the manager on duty, he quickly spouted of a square footage requirement of the room with a pompous snooty attitude like it was a daily practice. There were NO free options to correct the situation other than a paid upgrade on top of the significant parking fees. Significant street noise around 2AM ... but it is the city. Also a lot of hallway noise penetrating the door. What can I say, for that kind money and environment, the staff attitude was a real turn off! Considering the glut of rooms in the city right now, I would elsewhere in the future.

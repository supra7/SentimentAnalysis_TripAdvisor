Horrible hotel, worst I've ever been in and I travel for a living. There's no airport shuttle, their "complimentary breakfast" was unavailable on the weekends and too late on the weekdays to be of any use. When I complained about it, the staff was downright mean. Room was filthy, with stains on the carpets and burn marks on the counters. Uniformed security guard was lurking around the lobby all the time, so it didn't feel like the safest location either. I got a great deal on this room, and it still wasn't worth the price I paid. I won't even use the "complimentary stay" they've offered me to make up for this terrible experience.

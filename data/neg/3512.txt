Built in the early 1900s, this boutique hotel will charm you immediately. But ... If you're in a hurry, you'll likely grow weary of the antiquated elevators. Upper-level guests may at first feel lucky (as I did) to actually GET an elevator -- after a lengthy wait -- in the morning. But, consider this typical scenario: an overly crowded elevator stops on every ... single ... floor. You watch as the doors open, and disappointed/disbelieving guests look on hopelessly. I heard a few people say they grew so tired they walked 10 or more flights of stairs ... WITH their luggage. All the charm and friendly service in the world can't surmount the inconvenience of these woefully outdated elevators. The strangers I befriended on one lengthy ride all said they planned to stay elsewhere next time they're in town. Me, too.

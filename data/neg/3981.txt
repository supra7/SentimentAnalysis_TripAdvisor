We stayed here over memorial day weekend. I expected really nice rooms. The room was very small, about the size of a small bedroom. The AC like someone else mentioned was not working and it sounded like a train all night long. It was very claustrophobic not having circulating air all night. After our conference we went on an elevator that would shake really bad. Every floor we would go up it got worse until finally dust was coming off from above..l jumped off on the next floor and it was shut down. I mention this because I feel this hotel needs a major renovation. The floors need to be completely done over with some rooms taken out to make other bigger. My husband was also upset because at check in I was in a conference session and they wouldn't let him check in without my ID even though he was paying and they had his credit card. He had to come get me to get his credit casd back. All I can say is thank goodness we were here for a great conference and I think they bank on the fact that people will not be in their rooms.

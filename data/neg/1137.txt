Last night Saturday July 11, 2009, we drove down to seattle and checked into doubletree hotel near the seattle airport to escape our 30 degree celcius hot temperature here in vancouver, canada. When we arrived at around 10pm last night we managed to park our car far away because the most immediate parking spots are valet parking only. We have to drive through a ticket gate to enter the public parking, we asked the hotel check in clerk if there's a charge for parking at their hotel they said yes $16 plus taxes because it's location is next to the airport. If i knew ahead of time i would never stay at their hotel, i wasn't happy paying that extra fee because other hotels such as Hyatt at downtown Bellevue on weekend you don't need to pay for parking and they are higher in class. Inside our hotel room wasn't impressive at all, first thing i always check is the bed to see if it's clean and i found two black and yellow stains in the middle of one of the queen beds ewww. i complain to my husband about it but of course he already paid on the internet for this hotel stay so really we couldn't just walk away and go to another. The washroom is not as clean as it should be such that the countertops are not wipe clean properly and the glasses to be used to rinse up after brushing your teeth has residue on it. For a two queen hotel room they have only three bath towels to use...wow, The newspaper that you'll find outside your hotelroom the next morning, they already charged that price onto your hotel bill which is (Mon-Sat = $0.25 Sun=$0.75). The only good thing my kids like about this hotel is that they have a flat screen tv to watch cartoon.

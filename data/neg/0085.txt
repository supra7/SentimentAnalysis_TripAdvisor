The hotel is in a very convenient location, just a few steps from the University Street stop on the transit tunnel for free city centre busses or light rail. The price was very reasonable. The hotel was clean with regards to day to day cleaning - the lobby, corridors, toilet, shower were all clean, and the room was dust free with fresh smelling sheets on the bed, which whilst it was not the most comfy bed I have ever slept in it was OK. Deeper down bits of the hotel have seen better days. There was a rusty pipe and loose wallpaper in the corner of both my friends bathroom and my bathroom, both of our bathrooms had filthy suspended ceilings, there was also a bit of loose wallpaper in my bedroom and the TVs only worked on a few channels, in my room only one non religious channel in fact, and that was the "Opra Winfrey Network" - could not get any morning weather or news. Also the Wifi was in the loby only and it was a nightmare - the man on reception had to keep resetting the router. No breakfast in the hotel, they reccomend you go to the restaurant underneath for breakfast but it sounded expensive to us so we went to a nearby Subway instead. This hotel was OK for us for the price as we spent very little time in the hotel except when asleep. I would not have wanted to spend an extended amount of time in the room though.

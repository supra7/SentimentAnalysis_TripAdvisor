We travelled a lot but this was the worse service we ever experienced. They treated us like criminals. We had a room on the 8th floor and just around midnight - we were just falling in sleep - we heard a strang sound near the window . My son was sleeping near the window. I looked and saw that the whole window was crashed. We called the reception and they were shocked about what they saw. They told us it were hurricane proof windows. We were moved over to another room on the same floor in some minutes. The next day we went to the reception and nothing was know about this. After breakfast we got a voicemail of the reception that they will charge us $700 on the bill for breaking the window. At the reception they explained it was policy of the Hotel. There was no report of the damage - no detail of the $700 charge. I was very angry because I don't want to be charged for something we didn't do. Embarrassing was also that there was no manager available only the assistant housekeeper. He was not able to make decisions. We keep on telling him to take the $700 of the bill and credit card. He told us that they will contact the police. We don't care - so let's call the police and involve them. This was not the answer he expected. After some phone calls he told us that they will take it of the bill but still the on credit card. He asked me to contact the Manager the next day. I contacted the manager the next day twice - dropped him voice mails - never got any reaction. Luckly we had a great embassador at the Hilton Key Largo Resort to help us out in our next stay. She got also poor reaction of the Manager of Daytona Hilton - that he could not understand what I told him on the voice mail -strange she told us a we were not speaking chinese. We never received any excuse of the Hilton Daytona Manager. I would never recommand the hotel to somebody

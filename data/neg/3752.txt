This place is the biggest joke! We payed $200 a night for a "renovated room", which really only meant the bathroom. The cieling was old fashion ceiling tile, which had brown stains all over. The light fixture was nearly falling off and also their was barely any room to walk around. Like I said the only thing was renovated was the bathroom and the shower was still very small! I would seriously reconsider this place if you have already booked it and I dont even want to get started on the debacle that happened before we left. But, just to warn you dont leave forget your key in your room and then have to ask for another key to open your door. You will be scammed for $15, because they will say that you never returned the other key.

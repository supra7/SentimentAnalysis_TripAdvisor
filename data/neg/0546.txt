We had just finished a visit to Vancouver Island and had a wonderful time. All of the hotels, including the lodge we stayed at in Tofino, B.C., were clean, convenient, and comfortable. We had booked two nights at the Seattle Sheraton through Priceline. We arrived at about 2:30 PM and informed that no room with a king bed was available and that because we had booked through a third party, no room or type of bed could be expected. We were given a room with two double beds. We were also informed that our room would not be ready for at least an hour and that the parking fee was 39.00 per night. The published check-in time was 3:00 PM and we were finally allowed to check in about 4:00 PM. The carpet was stained and dirty. Perhaps this is what must be expected by booking through Priceline, but I would suggest that any hotel chain with any integrity, would provide a decent room to any customer. We were left with the feeling that Sheraton was taking advantage of people and nickel and dimeing them. This experience has convinced me of two things - I will not use Priceline and I will not stay at a Sheraton again.

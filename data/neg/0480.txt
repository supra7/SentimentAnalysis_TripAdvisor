This hotel put a severe damper on an otherwise lovely trip to Seattle. Staff - unhelpful, rude, condescending. We asked for a set of playing cards or boardgames and the front desk did not have any of the basic standard fare that any regular (read: not awful and low-quality) hotel normally would. Pool - unclean. Hallways - low ceilings, stained carpets, dated. Elevators that stop working at 6pm. Just dingy, eerie, and unclean. Rooms - TINY, no over-head lighting (just 2 small flickering lamps), bathroom made for dwarfs, radio not working, stains all over the bed and carpets, sheets looked & like they were dated from the 1960s. DO NOT STAY HERE!

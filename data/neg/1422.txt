We stayed at the Secrets Maroma Beach Resort for six night and seven days. The rooms were nice but some issues. We actually stayed in the preferred club area, no advantage to pay any extra for this area. They don't follow up with you to check to see what you need, the conceige was never at his station by the buildings, made a few request for things like bug spray, never came. The restaurants are a whole nother story. We made it to all the restaurants, the italian one was horrible, worse then the olive garden if you reheated their food. The bugs are extremely bad, you will need lots of bug spray, they are out at dusk and in the morning. When we arrived they didn't have our room we booked, they said they were having some air conditioning issues, I don't think the rooms were even finished. Be careful in the spa with your valuables. I wouldn't rate this hotel higher then a 3 star at the most, not even close to a four star resort. The one nice comment I have about this resort is that the beach is beautiful. I would suggest staying down the beach at the Maroma Beach and Spa Resort, looks much nicer and I'm sure the service is better. Very disappointed. We have been all over the world and stayed at four and five star resorts. This one doesn't come close.

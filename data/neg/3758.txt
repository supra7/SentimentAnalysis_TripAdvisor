Stayed at this hotel following cancelled flight. Around 50 passengers arrived at the same time and check in was completely disorganised. The hotel had accepted the booking from the airline however was ill equiped to manage the number that arrived. check-in was a shambles with only one member of staff working to allocate rooms and copy passports etc. Restaurant apparently closed at 10.30pm however at 10.15 we were told that they were closed as it was 'quite late' and they "didnt have enough food anyway". The hotel then arrange to have take-away delivered which didnt arrive until almost midnight. No heating in rooms ment that I slept with the supplied bedding (cotton sheets with 1 light fleece blanket) but also had to add a second blanket I had packed to use during my flight. Only 1 mirror in the room which was in the bathroom made it very difficult for two people to get ready at the same time. Advice that was offered from reception regarding transfer time from the hotel to the bus station at rush hour was also less than useless, a supposed 20 minute journey took almost an hour. Overall I was pleased that I hadnt paid to stay at this hotel as I would have been looking for a refund.

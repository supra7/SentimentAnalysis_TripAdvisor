Absolutely appalling. Should not be described as hotel - I cannot understand how this place is able to do business. I paid for ensuite single room. What I got was shabby single room with shared bathroom. T.V didn't work, no tea/coffee facilities, broken lamp & no light bulb in main light & worse of all window would not close - the manager's answer was to tape the window shut and spent 10 min tinkering about with t.v before I insisted I wanted a different room. The room I was eventually moved to was no better - stinking sink, broken lamps and this time had a broken lock on the door!! I felt so unsafe in such a sketchy place that I had to wedge a chair against the door. This room also had a shared bathroom and NO HOT WATER for the shower. Nothing was done about this and I was treated very badly. I had paid for 2 nights and following all this awful treatment I said I wanted to cancel the 2nd night & have a refund - I was refused. I feel robbed.

While I stayed in room 1115 on 8/6/2011 I experienced a very capable and caring staff trying to keep an old hotel viable. The first noticeable problem was parking. While it is a problem I'm not sure how the management of the hotel can fix it without buying property. Next problem was the elevators. Some much needed replacements of both elevators would help. All of the other reviews talking about elevators are correct. My family of 5 walked from the 11th floor to the lobby faster than the elevator. But again there is nothing the local staff of the hotel could do about this. We elected to do lunch at the restaurant (Atlantic Jacks) attached to the hotel for lunch but at 2:00pm it had closed for the afternoon. The bar served us and while it was served in take-out containers, it was quite good. Access to the beach was excellent and the pool was adequate. WIFI was available but on the 11th floor none of our 4 iPhones or iPad2 would connect. A call to the tech support number provided by the hotel to the 3rd party vendor providing service resulted in the tech saying apple product always have trouble connecting to anything. Upon returning from a day at the beach a guest at the hotel informed us that the hotel had no water but they were working on it. With that we went out to eat and upon return water service had been restored. Our overall stay was an experience but mostly not under the control of the local personnel. They did also promise a $10.00 refund for posting a review on Tripadvisor

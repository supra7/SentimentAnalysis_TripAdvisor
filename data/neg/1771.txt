My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon in Nov 06. This place is a dump. Please spend the extra $ and stay next door at the Sheraton. Get a garden view. There is no point to staying in your room. Its run down and for seniors. Which is fine if you have to save $$. Black rock is a 3 min walk down the beach and attached to the Sheraton. Ka'anapali grounds are ok but the rooms where like a hotel in downtown Detroit. DO NOT GO HERE. I beg you. The molokini snorkel trip was fun and worth seeing the turtles. Don't get the "extra" wet suit. Rip off. Or the snuba, another rip off. The clarity is 100 ft. No need for it. Haleakala was really fun and not that bad of a drive. I think a mountain bike trip is insane unless you like getting up at 2am on vacation. We went at 4pm and it was just fine and the drive is pretty tuff. Hana Highway was ok. Its a tuff drive. Pack a lunch and water. I suppose I'm glad I did it. There is a lagoon pool you can swim in which is worth the whole trip. Just be careful. Search out restaurants in Lahana, Cheesburger in Paridise is cool. Forest gumps is $$$ and crowded. There is a Italian restaurant called Pene's which is great! And a Mexican place with great burritos. Have fun.

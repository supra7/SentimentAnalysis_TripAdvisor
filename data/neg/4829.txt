We had 2 adjoining rooms. The couch in one room was filthy and disgusting. Both chairs were well stained. The bathrooms were not cleaned very well. I made the mistake of taking the stairs down to the lobby, instead of the elevator, the bottom landing of the stairwell contained numerous piles of garbage and used towels that looked like they had been there for months.

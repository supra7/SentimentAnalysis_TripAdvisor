I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference.... I let the FD know about the HVAC not cooling and asked to have it checked out. After returning to the room I noticed the air was turned off so I called the FD and they engineering call me in my room to let me know they turned it off since it was cool outside and I should open the window instead. For paying $229.00 a night I thought I could make my own decision to put the air on or off. At check out I let them know about my concerns as well as about the cleanliness and terrible condition of the bathrooms that appear like they are still back in the 1960's... No apology no response - I would not recommend this hotel to anyone... Very poor quality and customer service...

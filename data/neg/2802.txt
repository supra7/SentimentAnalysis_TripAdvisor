Nice looking hotel but that's where it ends. Stayed here over the weekend 26/27 Feb, rooms and view are good, air-conditioning stuck on the hottest setting, cannot turn down! Room is like a sauna, have to open all windows to be able to sleep. Oh by the way they are permanently locked so you have to break them to open them. National football team is also staying here and on returning to hotel we are told we cannot enter!! Staff treat us like dirt and tell us to walk round the back to get inside, by the way that door is locked as well. In the end bang on fire door until security open it. Ask us what is room number - tell him to get lost before I treat him to Glasgow handshake. Stay somewhere else where they treat you like a guest, at half the price.

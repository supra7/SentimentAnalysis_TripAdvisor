This hotel must not be doing well, based on the way that they try to get as much money out of their "guests" as possible. Parking- $72 for 2 days! There are several downtown hotels that have cheaper or free parking. 'Mini Bar'- $5 for a candybar, 7.25 for a budweiser(hahaha). The management should put the refrigerators back in! They obviously had them once, but now you can check in your leftovers, tag them and staff will take them down to some cooler somewhere, yeah right. $179 for a standard room, with double beds even. Worst night of sleep I've had at a hotel in the US. Grouchy 'express service' staff. The biggest insult: $16 for 24 hours worth of internet. Uh, where's the wi-fi folks? In a happening city like Seattle I certainly expect free wi-fi (like all the hotels in Portland... and others we've stayed at in Seattle) The only reason we went there in the first place was because my daughter had a dance competition there. I added one star because they didn't have a bible in the room.

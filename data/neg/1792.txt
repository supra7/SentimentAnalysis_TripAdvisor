This was our 25th Wedding Anniversary a special occasion - I think - the staff at the Hotel did not, especially the manager. First we did not get the room we requested (ocean front-non-smoking), the one we got smelled of smoke or something musty. The balcony was overrun with ants and the railing was covered in bird droppings. The bathroom also had ants. This hotel is old but that is not an excuse. The bed linen was clean and the towels fresh. We booked a table at the Tikki Terrace restaurant on the actual night of our anniversary (food here is good), arrived to find the table had been given to someone else. We hired a car and stayed away from this hotel as much as possible. The previous week we were in Kona on the Big Island and that was fantastic. What a let down then at the ka'anapali especially when it cost us such a lot. I think this hotel is over priced and overrated. Will I be back? NOT ON YOUR LIFE!

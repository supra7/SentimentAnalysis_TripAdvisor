Hardly Budget - Total Atrocity We *always* stay budget for travel, but this was unacceptable.1) Power outlets all failed (including lamps).2) Shower leaked greatly during usage and continued through night.3) No warm water in shower.4) Front desk never provided additional towels after we used the provided ones to mop up the leak.5) Upon reporting problems and requesting bill for single night, we were persuaded to stay for our second night in Seattle instead of seeking alternative accomodations if the staff investigated and remedied problems. They did pro-rate the two nights to less than one night at around $45 total, but we never received replacement towels, nobody ever checked our room and it was difficult to check out. (They had switched our reservation information with that of another guest.)6) Windows (and walls) are paper thin. This means you will be disturbed all night long by guests arriving in the parking lot area as well as when someone enters their room from the hallway, takes a shower, etc. You will also freeze because the thermostat stays at a frigid 50 degrees and the windows drip condensation in the early morning!7) Bring all of your valuables in because you will have to park your car quite a distance from your room (approximately 400 meters). This is quite inconvenient.8) I prefer to save money by staying at value lodges, but this was ridiculous. I should have stayed in my car both nights because I would have been happier than having stayed there one night.

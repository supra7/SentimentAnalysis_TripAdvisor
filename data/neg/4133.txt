I stayed here recently for a conference. The location of the hotel is excellent. Being unfamiliar with Boston I was very pleased to find it walking distance to many Boston highlights. A short inexpensive taxi raid for anything slightly further away or use the nearby public transport. First impressions of the hotel. A grand entrance lobby, smooth and friendly check-in. The main room for the conference, the ballroom, was also spectacular. However I do have several issues with the hotel. Elevators/lifts. For a hotel with so many rooms, conferences and guests the 6 lifts are inadequate. During busy periods expect to wait 5 minutes for an elevator. If you are on a lower floor, expect it to be full when going down to the lobby. Consider taking the very poorly signposted stairs instead. My room. Bad points. Small to the point of being claustrophobic. Not usually a problem for 1 person but if there are 2 of you, ask for a bigger room. Internet connection failed for 1 of the 3 days but the hotel waved the connection charge (about $10 per day) for my entire stay and wrote a letter apologising. A nasty looking brown stain on the headboard. Shabby carpet. Wires for the phone/internet/TV badly laid out and tangled up around the edges of the room. No place for a young child. Bathroom, cramped with the toilet 'off-set' to allow the door to open. A/C was dubious. Good points. The shower was excellent. The bed very comfortable. Food. The lunches supplied by the hotel for the conference were bland, tepid and generally poor. The coffee was allegedly supplied by Starbucks but was too weak to taste properly. So overall I was disappointed with this hotel. Its location and public facilities were excellent and the staff were all friendly, efficient and dealt with me politely and professionally. However this hotel needs a major refurbishment to bring it up to modern standards and halt its slide to becoming a shabby tourist hostel.

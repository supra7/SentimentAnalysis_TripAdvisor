Stayed here for 5 nights in June on business. The hotel is centrally located, just a few steps from Boston Commons, Arlington T stop and lots of restaurants. When I booked my time at the hotel there were a number of discounts available both through Expedia and the Starwood website. Without these discounted rates, this hotel would have been much too expensive for its level of service and aesthetic appeal. Check-in was quick and without incident even though I arrived hours ahead of the check-in time. However, the room left much to be desired. First, I had a hard time opening the door as it was quite heavy. The look of the room was very dated. The window had two old-style roller blinds with plastic cords. The wallpaper, the carpet, the old CRT TV...all added to old look of the room. There were a number of cup/mug rings on the desk as well. All this aside, it was the minuscule bathroom that I had the hardest time with. The toilet was very industrial looking, there was no counter space around the sink and the one shelf that did exist in the bathroom was very narrow and right over the toilet! I could not imagine two people trying to make use of this bathroom. On the bright side, the bed was large and very comfortable. I used the hotel phone to make long distance calls with a calling card (1-800 number) and it was quite expensive! Beware of this. Also, the balance of the express check-out invoice and what was charged on my credit card were not the same. After contacting the hotel, they sent me an updated check-out invoice. I thought this was very poor service on their behalf. I don't know why no one informed me of the change in charges when I called down to check-out. The charges had been incurred the day before check-out so I don't know why they weren't reflected in the original invoice. There are plenty of hotels to choose from in Boston. The Park Plaza is not one I plan to return to.

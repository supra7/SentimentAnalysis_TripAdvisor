I forgot to mention the "shuttle bus" in my review... #1. It isn't a bus. #2. He dropped us off & agreed to pick us up when we called. #3. We called & he said he was on his way. #4. He NEVER showed up... after about an hour we finally called a cab & got a ride back to the motel where he was sitting there watching TV! Grr... my ex's mother who has health problems ended up getting really sick from the heat because we stood outside where he told us to wait for him for so long!! He showed no remorse.

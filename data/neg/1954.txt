when we checked in, they told us that they have no strip view rooms available even we had booked two months ago. they actually tried to sell us a larger room with no view by an extra charge! how is that? we had to complain several times until they gave us the strip view rooms (there were still plenty available)... Beds are poor, she shift down on the head's side of the bad. the beds are shorter than the frame. the rooms are large and nice. it's also not at the strip (what you can see an the map as well but just to mention). staff is quite rude and unfriendly (specially the check in clerk. strip view you can forget. they charge extra money but you see nothing. it's fully behind the treasury island. The first room we got smelled strongly like smoke. hotel has a bad reputation in Las Vegas. Is known as arrogant and rude staff!! funny, this was also our impression we got of the hotel. finally, you only can do valet parking and always have to wait. if you're waiting for a taxi being organized, it could happen that they just to skip you because there's a other customer behind you they like more. if you finally try to catch your own taxi (after seeing two leaving empty), these odd hotel guys start to tell you off. how cheeky! I tell you... we took our own cab and I told this guy to show more respect. we have several gold cards too but we probably do not wave them around all the time...! this hotel should think about this. Only go there if you get a special rate. its far away from the strip and really offers a nice room only. venetian is much better.

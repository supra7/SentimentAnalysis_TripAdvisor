pre booked in december 2007.requested standard room with king bed and high floor.stayed hotel june 2008 on arrival given 2x double bedded room on floor 2 which was one floor above outside bar. requested change of room but offered room with no exterior view -only view of atrium so offer declined --big mistake!! the noise from the outside bar was super decibels and floor two (room 242 was ours) should be avoided at all costs when booking.make clear to the hotel that outside bar noise rooms are not acceptable. plus points:- location excellent food ok staff generally friendly

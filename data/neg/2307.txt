My father had open heart surgery and mother and I are not familiar with Philadelphia, so we opted to stay here for the night of his surgery. The hotel itself is located on Penn Hospital grounds, so it was very convenient but you pay for that!!!! I've stayed at some less than three star places, but this was probably a two star in my book. With a three star price tag per night. Location gets you a stay for over $150 per night. I know it's not a vacation destination, but that's literally highway robbery! Rooms and decor were straight outta the 80's and the beds were not comfy at all. Bathroom was kind of dark and moldy and the water was not hot at all!!! Warm if that. Stay only if you must.

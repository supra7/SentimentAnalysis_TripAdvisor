This hotel lacks everything to make guests welcome. First night arriving with a six month old baby who was tired and cranky, the crib provided was falling apart and had a dirty sheet on it. When I called the front desk they said to go there to pick up ourselves. Upon arrival at the front desk they say "We dont have any crib sheets", and was given a regular bed sheet. I explained this is not acceptable, and she says "I cannot help you with anything else". After a while I decide to take a shower, except there was no soap, so I took a shower with shampoo. The housekeeping department does not leave enough shampoo and conditioner for the number of adults staying in the suite. If you want ice, you have to walk all the way to the fornt desk. There are no ice makers as stated in the room information. There also no ice machines convenient to guest rooms. Also, we had dead crickets in our kitchen which were not removed by housekeeping. We had a premium 2 bedroom suite and were placed at the farthest suite from the front desk despite the fact that we had advised we would be arriving with a baby. It shows this motel is trying to cut back on costs at the expense of the guests.

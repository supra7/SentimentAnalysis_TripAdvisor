Wow, what a romantic stay in Venice!! On checking in to our hotel we were directed to our room. This was the only room on the ground floor. We were brought through the small breakfast room , throught the Breakfast room toilet and into our room at the back of the hotel. The room itself was large, but had a dank damp smell. We can't understand why this was a guest room at all, especially as when we went to leave for dinner (when we had to treck around the hotel looking for the security! man to let us out) and got to see upstairs where every other guest was staying. We didn't see inside the rooms, but they didn't look like survents quaters to us! Each morning we could head the breakfast room being made ready and then the other guests arrive. Some we had to listen going to using the toilet. Lovely wake up call! We did ask to be moved as soon as we say where the room was but we were told it was fully occupied, but they would get back to us on moving us the following morning. NO chance. Each morning we felt like we had come from the servents quaters and toilet to get to the breakfast room, where other guests looked at us in amazment.. Do all online bookings get this treatment!!

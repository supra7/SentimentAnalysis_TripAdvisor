Okay, I know that it all depend on what room you're given. But no 4/5 star hotel should even have room as horrible as the room I was given on recent stay. Small bathroom with a cracked dirty tub, nasty curtains, dirty rugs. I found out that later that you could upgrade for around $50 but there should be some basic level for all rooms, epsecially for those of us who think we've given this dump enough money already. The plus side is that it has the best lobby in Chicago. And during our stay, they were several wedding, which made the setting even more grand!

Upon arrival it seemed that we may have chosen a decent hotel. Once we got to our room after waiting forever for the elevator (one was broken), the door opened with a rush of hot stale air. There was nothing we could do to fix it. They gave me some excuse about the boiler was off or something like that. Tried the old junky air unit by the window which had no effect. Tried to open the window but it was limited to just a few inches, so no one can jump out due to heat stroke. They were nice enough to bring us an old dusty fan which gave the room a little wind chill. The decor was unsightly and the bed was as bad as it gets. The upside to the stay was the location. Very convenient to the downtown Seattle attractions.

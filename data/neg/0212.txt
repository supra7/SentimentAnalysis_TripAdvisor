Great location to Seattle Center activities and waterfront. The little outside courtyard looks nice. Once inside, things are not as good. They have tried to keep the cracks in walls patched and painted. Definitely a musty smell inside the building and room. The pillow odor kept waking me up at night. The queen bed is hard, the twin is like plywood. Surprised that the bathroom didn't have an electrical outlet, and don't forget to bring a hairdryer, as none is provided. There was a window along the shower/tub wall with no real way to keep the water away from it. The paint had peeled and there was a lot of black mold along the window sill and cracks in the waterproof wall material. I would not recommend or stay here again.

The only positive was the location. Fabulous location, very central and easy to get anywhere. The hotel itself was just okay, rather outdated, but nothing I would have complained about if I hadn't had such a bad experience with them regarding my husband's wedding ring. WARNING - don't leave anything behind in your room! We checked out, left for one hour, realized my husband had left his ring (I knew exactly where it was). Went back, room had just been cleaned, and ring was gone. Hotel didn't seem to care. They launched an "investigation" which resulted in me getting a cold letter saying that they won't do anything because the result of their investigation shows they are not at fault. So, just a warning. There are plenty of other hotels that are well located where your stuff won't get stolen.

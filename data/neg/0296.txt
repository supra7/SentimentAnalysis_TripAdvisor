The Moore appealed to my friend and I because it was in downtown Seattle and was, by far, the most "bang for our buck". At $70 a night in the downtown area, we didnt expect much but after reading the reviews, we looked forward to seeing the charm of a well- taken-care-of hotel from yesteryear. We didnt find what we were looking for. Our room was a sloppy mix of one picture of a skyscraper, furniture from an office in Hawaii in the 80's and an awful lamp that had a crack on one side. Although I craned my head out of the window and got a magnificent view of downtown, I tried not to open it that often due to the bad draft coming in. We had no shampoo for the shared bath down the hall. One of the toilets had a problem and you had to push a button inside commode to flush it. And if we hadnt had a small desk fan in the room for quiet noise, we would've heard everything downstairs. We were SEVEN floors off the street. As we wandered the hallways, we found that there was nothing charming about the hotel other than its old fixtures. The whole place is in dire need of plants, pictures and color. Parking was an absolute nightmare; THIS HOTEL HAS NO ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY OF THE PARKING GARAGES OR LOTS. It was "every man for himself" and more than slightly frustrating. Although the older front desk clerk kindly explained the procedures, I found it very inconvenient to have to get up at 7am or 8am and run down to pay for the parking after already paying for it overnight. The Moore did have something going for it: a very awesome location. Only a couple of blocks from Pike Place Market and anything else downtown. That was about it, however. Good price? Yes. Good location? Absolutely. Worth it? No.

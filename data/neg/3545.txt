This 4-Star only deserves 1/2 Star in my opinion. My room was shabby, there was the burn mark of an iron on the carpet, the bottom drawer of my very small dresser was about to fall apart, the tv control was worn out, the handle fell off the hot water faucet on the sink, there are no dead bolts on the doors, the bathroom floor wasn't cleaned behind the door, and the final insult was the ice machine sitting in the hall right outside my door in the hallway...it woke me up regularly at 4 am each morning of my stay. I've never stayed in a hotel where the ice machine was sitting in an open hallway until now. The restaurant was dark and dingy, and the food was barely adequate, very mediocre. The one bright spot was the bar, which was spacious and lively, the service was great, and I had one of the best Bloody Mary's I've ever drank.

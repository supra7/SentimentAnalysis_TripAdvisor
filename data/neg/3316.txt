Granted, this is a nice property, but the staff are a bit rude. Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, but I felt a bit alienated when I went to the front desk. I was in line for about 15 minutes, when I politely asked what the hold-up was, considering there were only 2 people in front of me. The front desk clerk said, "Excuse me, but we are busy!" So, I said, "Well, not really, there are only 3 of us!" Then the clerk gave me a dirty look and mubmled something to another employee and both looked at me. In any other place on the street, I would have knocked them out, but being the polite and savvy traveler that I am, I just said that they need not talk about me. There was no response. Room was okay. A bit musty. Overall, the room was okay, but the staff was miserable and some need to be replaced.

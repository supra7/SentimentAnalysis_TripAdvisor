At $505 for three nites we didn't expect much - but a clogged tub, one bar of soap for the entire visit, no tooth paste or shampoo and a maid service that could only say they did have along with a filthy room and some strange substance on the bed side table and only one straight chair coupled with a rude staff - well that says it all. Oh, expect long waits for the lift!

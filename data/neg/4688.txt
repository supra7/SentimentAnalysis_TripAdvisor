Most awful stay in a Hilton Hotel ever! 1. Staff mainly rude and unhelpful, happily standing by an watching an 80 year old trying to haul his luggage up stairs to lobby 2. Service in bars and lobby unmotivated, slow, unfriendly 3. Room made up at 5pm in a very sloppy manner 4. Being woken up by drilling and other building noises at 7am is annoying especially when on holiday and not being notified in advance 5. A gym surcharge for a dingy club like the one at Palmer House is not justified I will not rush back. Very, very disappointing.

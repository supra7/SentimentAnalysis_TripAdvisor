As a necessity I needed to be close to the hospitals in Dallas. I needed 3 surgeries. After the last surgery the manager called and told me the monthly rent was due the day before. I went in to pay and she told me that she had left a courtesy message on my phone the day before. Phone hardly works and shows no message waiting light. Her response was that "She was sorry, but I would have to pay a $15.00 late fee! This was 7:00am the very next morning no less. I had been staying there since April 08 and this was Sept. 08. Poor customer service. After I am well enough to leave I will never use their facilities again anywhere --no way! no how! Besides being a high crime area, the MANAGEMENT does not seem to care about keeping the good residents. Any complaints about anything will fall on deaf ears here. I do not recommend this facility for anyone. Empire Central and Stemmons Frwy, Dallas, TX

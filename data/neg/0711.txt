we thought the service was fair. the location good if you want to walk to pikes and the wharf area. we however do not trust the management as they try to add an additional 150 dollars to our bill after we had checked out stating that we smoked in the room which is completely FALSE. there is also no parking in the area and you are forced to pay for valet parking. i understand that a lot of hotels are trying to squeeze money out of customers thinking that we wont notice but this is so blatantly ridiculous

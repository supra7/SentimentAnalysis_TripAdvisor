I surprised my husband with an in-town getaway at the Sorrento for our anniversary. Although our room was cozy and our meal at the Hunt Club was delicious, I will likely never return because of what I learned after checking out. My sister and a friend each called the hotel to have a bottle of champagne sent to our room. They never arrived. Although there WAS a bottle of champagne in the room when we arrived, it also had a card from the hotel staff, leading us to believe that the hotel had provided it. We still do not know what really went wrong because we've been stonewalled. My sister, our friend, and we have not received any calls back from the hotel to explain what happened with the missing champagne. Even after writing a thoughtful letter to the hotel manager, I have had no response. It is shameful for a hotel of this caliber and expense to provide such poor customer service. It should be a common event to have people send flowers, wine, etc. to hotel guests. Please note that other negative reviews of this hotel have increased in 2006. It was our experience before this visit that it was the place to go for a real treat. I no longer feel that way. Try the Mayflower Park instead...it was a total treat during the holidays. Sorry, Sorrento, you need to go back to Hospitality School.

Pros: - location: 10 min walk to blue mosque, university and grand bazaar area (Sultanahmed area); - clean bedding and clean location; - elevator; - friendly staff although starting with the reservation and with the welcoming we were told each time to wait until the English speaking guy will come at concierge to help us with our basic demands; Cons: - no lunch/dinner restaurant; - thin walls through which you hear everything even if you do not want to; actually our room 303 and our neighbors room 304 were part of one apartment which was split by a thin wall through which any little sound could pass; the proof to this is that between the two rooms there is a door which was closed during our stay; anyway this is the first time living in a "Big Brother" kind of hotel where "sharing" by sound means everything but intimacy; - windows couldn't be closed very well and therefore all the noise on the street you can hear inside (remember Istanbul "sleeps" around 02:00 a.m. and awakes 05:00 a.m. of the same day so a good drink and/or a long day walk could help to fall asleep and ignore or the hassle and noise coming from your neighbors and/or street); - no parking place although on the phone it was told us that that will be not a problem; luckily we managed to park the car in front of the hotel (the single parking place available); anyway this goes only to those which dare to drive in Istanbul (I personally enjoy driving around the city and considered it a good driving experience - no rules are applicable other then common sens); - poor breakfast and meat products impossible to digest/eat (be careful); I can not imagine a longer stay then 2-3 days in this hotel with that breakfast "menu" included in the room price; - small rooms and bathroom; - cheep furniture; - dirty walls; - light is flickering and out of 10 bulbs only 3 were operating from time to time; - broken window; - bad maintenance and NO attention to details; All in all the first impression about this hotel is good but afterwards you may discover quickly what a bad choice it was. Anyway it could be worst though! About Sultanahmed area: - food - if you wish international cuisine or a good Turkish lunch/dinner + enjoy the old city be prepared to spend for a main course/person between 21-46 TL (9-20 EURO); a bottle of wine starts from 58 TL (25 EURO); - night out: we choose to enjoy the roof terrace of Pierre Lotti Hotel which is 4 min. away and which will be our next hotel to stay if we will decide to return to Istanbul; the food here was reasonably priced and the atmosphere & music was great; - shopping: Grand/Old Bazaar is an interesting experience; I returned to Istanbul after 10 years and can say the Bazaar is shrinking its offer and sellers are not any more so interested to negotiate in a old fashioned way; they are pretty bored and not very happy to talk as before; Enjoy Turkey! http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/

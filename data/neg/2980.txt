For the price this hotel is no where near worth it. The rooms were just ok. They were clean but small. The hotel is not in the city center but they charge like it were. The food at the restaurant was also just ok. Nothing to write home about. The bar closed early. Check-in was slow and the wireless access hardly worked in the meeting rooms. What really frustrated me though (and the reason for my rating) was their cancellation policy. I had booked 6 nights. When I arrived I informed the staff that I would only be staying for 4 nights as I had some other meetings come up in another city. Regardless of what I said, they insisted on charging me for the full 6 night booking. Even though while I stood there, they turned others away. I'm sure that they charged me for the room and are now renting to others making double their money. Sub-par room and food plus the way they treated me at the end left me with a bad taste. I will never go there again and certainly would recommend others to stay somewhere else.

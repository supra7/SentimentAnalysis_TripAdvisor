Save your money Flooded suites had to have all of our cloths laundered, no power, no air conditioning part of the time and when it worked it was to loud to sleep. Sheets did not fit the bed, doors not secure with cheap locks, no beach equipment, kids area not finished, steak house no steak, no seafood like every other resort I have stayed in the past 10 years, no towels for many of us at the pool, beach with glass everywhere, fitness centre no air and smelled like glue, no credit card usage, no blankets for pullout bed, mob boss manager clueless, night shows 5 out of 10, and I am going to stop now and give this resort 2 stars and that is for the friendly staff for the most part. I brought 70 people to this resort and the complaints never ended and thank god the weather was good or it would have been a nightmare. I would not go to this resort for at least a few years and maybe never if the owners are the same as they do not care about this resort, this can be seen by the workmanship of the entire compound. cheap, cheap cheap. Remember when you read this that I had the upgrade, you would not beleive the regular rooms if you could fit in the room. This is said to be 4-5 star what a joke, I have been to the DR 7 times and have never seen anything like it and SunQuest should be ashamed for booking this resort as is with out a huge reduction in price. Do not waste your money !!!!!

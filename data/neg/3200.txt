This hotel did not live up to its reputation.The rooms had inadequate lighting,the decor awful,and there was no dining room/breakfast room.We had to eat in the reception area with inadequate room for tables and chairs.The kettle in the room didnt work,and there was no microwave provided as stated in the brocure.It was advertised as being five minutes from the main tram system.This was not correct.It was about 20 minutes away down a very steep hill! The brocure said there would be a hottub on the roof,there wasnt!

Absolutely Despicable I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone! Our stay was the worst ever. We stayed here, knowing it was a BUDGET hotel. It took over 45 minutes just to check in, and we were the only people checking in at the time. Needless to say, the three ladies at the front counter needed some customer service classes.Finally after several attempts to locate our confirmation number and arguing that we had already prepaid for our room, yes they actually argued with me! I had the receipt showing a ZERO balance owing!!!! We went up to our room. Immediately upon entering, the bathroom door was open and towels were spread out all over the floor, the floor was soaking wet, and the toilet lid was off. We called the front desk advising them that the toilet wasn't working. They offered to bring new towels. I repeated myself...the toilet wasn't working. An hour later I called again. Maintenance was on their way. Housekeeping showed up approximately an hour and 20 minutes later. Plunged the toilet and left. About 40 minutes went by and the toilet was still running, we called the front desk...again. Housekeeping came by again...plunged toilet, brought towels. Then told us to turn the water off. When we needed to use the toilet, then turn the water on! Oh, I forgot we were staying in a roach motel! This was completely unacceptable. We complained, the front desk said there was nothing they could do, they couldn't find maintenance. Well, maintenance probably got tired of maintaining! To top it off, the sheets would not stay on the hard bed, which is fine, it isn't the Ritz. We moved the bed to put the sheets back on, and there were two used condoms underneath the bed! I'm glad they clean the rooms!The curtains were so dirty. The furniture was stained. I really wouldn't recommend staying even if you have no where else to go. There is no service and they don't care that they have upset a customer or have filthy non-working rooms.

This place was dingy and ugly. The front desk staff was not friendly. The room was stark. There was not one picture on the walls. The bathroom was tiny and the bathtub clean but stained and in need of caulking. The clock radio was broken and there was a lot of noise from the street. The room smelled. I couldn't wait to get out of there.

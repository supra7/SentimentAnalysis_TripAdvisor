It's a shame how a great chain of hotels can make such a great mistake in hiring employees and managers. The Hilton Back Bay is, by far, the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. We were not able to obtain a fridge so we basically had to dine out 24/7. The nearest laundrymat is a few "BLOCKS" away and they pretended to not have a clue where it is when asked. We gave in and had to "dry clean" some underwear and a swim suit, we never saw the swim suit again and we were acused of not filling out the itemized content list. They basically didn't believe we sent the swim suit to get cleaned. They knocked on the door at 7:00am the morning of checkout and yelled out "CHECKOUT" since it seems they didn't believe the copy of the checkout bill being slid under the door was sufficient.

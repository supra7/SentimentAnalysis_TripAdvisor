I stayed here for several days to relax after a business trip. I got the hotel through Priceline, which "upgraded" me to here; I bid for a 2.5* and it considers this a 3*. I knew that the Doubletree was considered a 3* on Priceline and I did not bid at the 3* level because I knew I did not want to stay here. While I got a nice, quiet room near the end of a hallway, and the room was roomy and generally comfortable, getting to and from the room was a long haul indeed. And it took me a couple of trips to get the directions down right, as this hotel is somewhat convoluted. The hotel offers no free parking and no free Internet access in the rooms. For both of these reasons, I cannot recommend this hotel as a place to stay. (Note, if you don't mind a short walk, go across the street that borders the south side of the hotel and up the hill (away from International Blvd.) slightly, you'll see a side road with no houses along one side. the parking is not restricted along this road, so it's a good place to park if you have a car.) On more than one morning, I came downstairs to find the gift shop closed. I wanted to buy a newspaper. No one could help me. i asked if being a HHonors member would get any of the added fees waived, but apparently not with Priceline reservations. The hotel seems to be not content with having you as a guest; it will find any way it can to extract more money from you. The warm cookie upon check in doesn't even begin to balance the scales. Not recommended.

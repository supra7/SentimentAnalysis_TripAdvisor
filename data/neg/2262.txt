I was in Philadelphia for a business trip. My room was booked in advance, but when I arrived they told me they had given my room to somebody else. Instead I got a tiny room with shower/toilet on the other side of the corridor. There was no heat in the room. I finally got a portable heater that dried the air in the room so much it became very uncomfortable. The room was also noisy, it was close to an alley where they emptied container all night. After my stay our secretary tried to get a detailed receipt of the stay, it took so long just to get it. The staff had continuous pb with computer. The room cleanliness was OK, but the other stuff was so bad, I wish I had taken another hotel.

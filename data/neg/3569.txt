This hotel advertises itself as a "boutique" hotel, but the rooms are very small and not very nice. They only had one elevator that worked and was a pain to wait on. Our glass sink was cracked. My husband and I shared the room with another couple and it was VERY crowded. Parking here is also weird. You can pay a guy daily to park in the paid lot behind the hotel or pay for valet. The maid retrieved my car when we checked, but she made sure to keep her dirty glove on to keep her hands from getting dirty. After she brought me my car, I pointed that out to her and she quickly removed the glove after she had already drove my car with it on. I would not stay here again.

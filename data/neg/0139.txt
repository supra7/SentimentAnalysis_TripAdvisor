Because of a change in plans, we were unable to stay our last night at Westen, a couple blocks away. Also unable to get a room on short notice at any other hotel downtown. If we had a car, we would have slept in it. Set a wake-up call with the clerk when we checked in and discovered when we got to the room, there was no phone. He gave me a spare from under his counter, but we didn't need it anyway because the wake-up never came and we never slept for more than an hour at a time anyway because of the noise and concern about an open window on the ground floor in the area the place was situated. Air conditioner didn't work--were told by clerk it worked like all the others and if we were not not satisified, open the window. One bulb in three-bulb bath fixture. Stay away. Made the Bates Motel look like a five-star.

We have been staying at the W Hong Kong on our honeymoon for the last couple of days. The hotel has a great vibe, is centrally located and the staff are really friendly and accommodating. The biggest disappointment by far is access to the pool, which for the last 4 days has been closed due to a 'deep clean'. Particularly annoying is that there has been no update on (i) when the pool is expected to reopen (ii) why the 'deep clean' is taking so long - every time you speak to the staff, although very apologetic, they really don't seem to have a clue - we've been told on 4 separate occasions now that the pool will open 'later today', or 'tomorrow' . . . perhaps next month eh??!! It's a pity, as this has left a slight bitter feeling about what on the face of it at least is a pretty decent hotel.

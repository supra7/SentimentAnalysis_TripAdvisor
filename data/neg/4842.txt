There are a few good things here - Location. Right on the beach and within walking distance to a lot of restaurants. The view from the rooms on the beach side are great. That is where the good stuff ends. 1. Internet is terrible! You will not be able to use this in any productive manner. In the room there was no wi-fi, only an ethernet cable. The speed was SLOWER than dial-up speed from the early 1990's. The last night of my stay - there was no internet. Two calls to the front desk and they acknowledged they had a problem and were sorry for the incovenience. 2. The carpet was old and worn - over due. 3. The tv had about 10 stations - that is it. Not even weather channel - you would think being exposed to hurricanes that would be useful. 4. Closet door was broken 5. The cleaning service was poor - no cleaning in the bathroom!

The lobby was gerat as picture shows, but that all. Room was small and tight. There is no extra space even for a small air bed. I stayed in Travelodge in the previous night and knew that the number of movie we could choose(purchase) in here was much smaller than that of travelodge!! Air conditioning in room was difficult to control. (too hot or too cold!) I'm very sorry to see my parents not enjoying the stay. My impression on this hotel is "just-the-bobby". That's all.

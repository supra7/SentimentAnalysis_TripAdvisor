FYI.....Hotel is nice. Iphone reception is VERY poor all thoughout the hotel. Even a staff member said Iphone users never have any quality reception. Also....note you MUST pay a premium for internet access, even wireless in the lobby required you to pay. You can do much better for a hotel in Chicago. Hilton let me down with this property! PS: There is not coffee pot in the rooms.

Apparently this hotel is famous for not having sufficient airconditioners for the rooms. My family rented three rooms and all three had busted AC. It was ok when we opened the widows, but the drunks on the street below kept us up the whole night. Cleanliness had a lot to be desired as well as I found an empty pack of cigarettes under the bed when we first checked in.

While tempting because of a nice, central location and price, unless you don't mind a hotel that has had no updating in over 30 years, including the disgusting orange 70's (used to be shag) carpet in the rooms - stay away! They did a fair job of keeping it clean, they only have so much to work with when the ownership obviously could care less about investing one penny in the property. The room smelled of things not to mention. If you keep the lights off, don't look in the corners, and wear your shoes while in your room at all times, you might be OK. No network available, so impossible for a business traveler. TV doesn't really work.

This hotel is living off its former glory. It desperately needs a makeover. What was considered luxurious and well designed 30 years mow seems run of the mill and verging on tacky. The tv set was a 30 year old clunker from Zenith. I don't care much for television when I travel (I don't think I turned it on once). I just mention it because it's an apt metaphor for my entire experience. For starters, I arrived at 4pm only to find out that my room was not ready. They took my cell phone number so they could call me when they were ready for me, but they never called. I popped by at 6 to discover that my room was ready and was left to wonder if they ever would have called me. (no apologies either). When I got to my room (which was no easy task as room 410 isn't even listed as a possibility on the signs facing the elevator) I was shocked to see how small it was (considering the amount of time it took to clean, check out is at 11 am by the way). It's one of those deals where opening the door to the bathroom almost collides with your bed. As for the view, I suspect some people in prison enjoy a better vista. They offer a complementary continental breakfast but I wonder what continent they are referring to. No customary cereal, cheese, or yogurt options. Just a sad fruit salad and a muffin or white or whole wheat toast. Again, I thought of prison as the service was less than smiley. The best thing about this place is the wonderful location and the building itself, one of the Chicago's oldest skyscrapers. Everything else was a disappointment.

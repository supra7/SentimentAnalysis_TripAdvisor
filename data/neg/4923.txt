This hotel needs a major cleaning and update. The hallway carpets are very dirty and spotted with I don't know what. I felt sorry for the group of teenagers that were sitting in the hallway eating. My room had only one closet door of what should have been by-passing mirrored doors and the track was completely rusted as was the towel rack in the bathroom. Everything in the room felt damp/wet including the carpet. When I got in the shower in the morning, my feet were so dirty from walking on the carpet it made mud in the bottom of the tub. Only one of the two elevators was working when we arrived. This was supposed to be a four day stay in Daytona. This hotel changed that very quickly. This is not a hotel I would ever stay in again nor recommend to anyone else.

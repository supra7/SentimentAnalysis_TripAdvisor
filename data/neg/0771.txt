I've stayed a month at SPG hotels in the past year & never have gotten the flat-out crappy service I experienced at the Westin Seattle. I goofed my reservation & when I called to fix within a few hours, I was told they couldn't fix it -- called SPG who got them to. Next day reservation still wrong; more calls, assurances. On arrival, promise of personal service & room in North tower away from elevator turned into South tower directly in front of the elevator. They just don't seem as intent on taking care of loyal customers as every other SPG hotel we've stayed at. Despite ideal location, we won't be back.

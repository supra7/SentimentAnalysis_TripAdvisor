We stayed at this hotel as part of family vacation package we bought from Costco we found hotel has excellent location and landscape but this is where good stops Service overall is very poor Specially in their free breakfast area and bell and vaelt parking area . Staff is untrained and even rude Carpet old and stinks. Not well maintained and water leaks when it rains We will not go back to same hotel.

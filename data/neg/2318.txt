I stayed at this hotel a few years ago and wondered how they stayed in business, but rememeber that it IS run by an Academic Institute of Higher Learning. Ever been to a dorm? A captive, albeit suffering crowd from the hospital helps I guess. Parking here is cash only if you pay at the ramp. Who works on a cash only basis anymore, unless you don't want to report income? Move into the 90's people, credit cards would be a start. Self pay macnihes like most medical facilites would be even better to free up the exits.

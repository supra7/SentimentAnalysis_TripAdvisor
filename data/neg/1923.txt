as Dubai is famed for its high standard of customer service, I was shocked when I came here. This should be a 2 star at most, it's absolutely filthy and the staff unprofessional, I checked out after 2 days. The first room they gave us had faulty air con, long dark hair all over the kitchen floor, food splattered all over the microwave and dust everywhere. One of the maintenance men looked at me as if I was strange for complaining of a 25 degree room temp and saying the place was dirty. We changed rooms and the second one was superficially clean but still substandard. The micro was dirty, the rubbish bin stunk and the kitchen equipment wouldnt fetch 50p at a car boot sale. The pans had bits of curry and oil in them so a trip to Ikea ensued for some cheap cups etc. And hangers too- there were only 3 in the wardrobe. The noise of the planes was unbearable and that's coming from a former air hostess so it must have been bad! The bathroom was also a disgrace- a coaster was used as a soap dish, the toilet seat wouldn't stay up- word of caution to male guests :)- the towels were threadbare and the shower head was rusted. The bed had all its life bounced out of it and made for a painful nights sleep. If that wasn't enough, the corridors were a disgrace too, with stained carpets and a hum of oil, smoke, BO and old food. When I was on my own, I felt the male staff leering at me and felt rather uneasy. Best avoided.

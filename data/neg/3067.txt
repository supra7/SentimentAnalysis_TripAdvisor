To start, there are a lot of little things/irritations that I am going to let go and not even bother really commenting on or this would turn into a blog. We stayed here for the weekend of April 20th-22nd 2012 to go see Amsterdam and Keukenhof Tulip Gardens. We chose this hotel due to the reviews...unsure why they are rated so fabulous. The entrance was a little difficult to find, and walking around the area to get to it looked as if we might be staying in a third world country. The cost of the room for TWO NIGHTS was almost 350 euro....looking at this price...we thought this was going to be a pretty nice area and hotel. We were wrong. The area this hotel is located in is very shady and ghetto....not the type of neighborhood I would like to walk around in at night. There is nowhere to eat breakfast in the area (this being why the hotel charges you 15 euro per person for breakfast) except for a small Middle Eastern bakery filled with mystery meat and fish pastries. The hotel staff is not very helpful at all. They do not explain anything and upon arrival they grab a map off of the counter and circle the hotel and draw a line (this whole thing happens in about 3.4 seconds). No one explains anything and their info on where/which buses is not accurate or understandable. There are minor things like the dust and dirt on the glass area above the coffee cups, but that did not really bother me too much. Needless to say, when we do this again we will be staying in Leidesplein...it is a more open area, lots to do, many food choices and seems to be a lot safer. On a positive note, the bus runs very close to the hotel and it is only like a 150 to 200 meter walk and we were able to buy a bus/metro travel card at a good price from the hotel. Also, I guess it is positive that nothing happened to either of us on our trip. Bottom line, if you want somewhere with food choices and closer to the city with attractions....this is not the place.

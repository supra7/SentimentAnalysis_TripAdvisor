Wanted a Vacation, Got Frustration In my years of travel (six countries this year) this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review on accommodations. Returning to the Dominican Republic for a weeklong stay over the New Year was an exciting prospect and this new resort promised to exceed the experience of our previous trip. The joke that this hotel was five star was evident upon disembarking from our transport. Sorry this place was neither Majestic nor Elegant. During the frustration of trying to get our rooms, the woman at the desk informed us ou should not trust your travel agent, you should have called us directly.?Are you reading this Travel Agents? It went downhill from there. We were lied to repeatedly, over the course of check in day, and the next, as to when the rooms we had paid for would be ready. We were told NOT to unpack and wait those two days to start our vacation. We never did get them.The problems with the room they stuck us in are literally too numerous to mention. My five traveling companions and I joke now that when we have any mishaps with future trips, this will be the hotel we compare all future problems to. My advice, if you can get your deposit back, rebook at another resort. Period.

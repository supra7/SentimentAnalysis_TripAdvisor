I really hope you will read my comment and, after this, to do not book in this terrible place. Only one thing: CONTRACT WITH LEGACY ABOUT THE CONDITIONS CAN BE CHANGED IN EVERY MOMENT, ABOUT EVERYTHING: in 4 months the Legacy staff removed many services. Ad if I wanted to have them back, I had to pay more (housekeeping, internet). The staff is very rude and they treat the people as they are stupid (taxi booking, informations). In 4 months, they left 2 time the door of my apartment completely opened...and another time, they gave my personal mobile phone number to some strange people I did not know. BE VERY VERY CAREFULLY THERE! OPEN YOUR EYES! THEY TRY TO RIP OFF THE PEOPLE! I WON'T COME THERE NEVER AGAIN.

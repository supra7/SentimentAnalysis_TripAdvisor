I stayed in this hotel in November while on a business trip. I am a Hilton Diamond member so I usually get upgraded to their better rooms. I had a room on the Executive floor. I was told that this was a small room without a desk, which was OK since I wouldn't have time to work inside the room. Wow...I have been in bigger closets! The troubling factor was that the room was in poor shape. The wallpaper in the bathroom was bubbling off and it was not the cleanest. The carpet was dirty, not at all what I had expected from and Executive floor room. Their restaurant was OK . I had met a client there and we had to be put in the back where the overflow went. It was just a bare room with some tired looking banquet furniture. On my next trip, I will go back to the Hyatt...much better rooms, more centrally located and updated. One more thing...the cost of the room was over $250.00.

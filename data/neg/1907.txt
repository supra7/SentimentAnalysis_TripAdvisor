Location first: 5 minutes walk to Kumkapi railway station which is quite nice, 15 minutes uphill to Beyazit subway station and Grand Bazaar. Right beside the hotel is a police station with a penitentiary for foreigners in custody pending deportation as well as a mosque. The hotel itself is located at a noisy street, thus together with the mosque this was not the ideal place to relax in the evening. Rooms: General Appearance - old fashioned and run down, especially our bathroom. There was an old refridgerator in our room which made a lot of noise so we simply unplugged it. As to electrical sockets: 1 in the room and one in the bathroom. Bed was comfortable, room wasn't too hot or too cold. Bedding seemed ok. Bathroom was old and stained. I saw other bathrooms in the hotel which were modernized but not ours. We asked to change our room but were refused as they told us that this was the best room in the entire hotel. Breakfast: normal selection of typical turkish food. Tablecloth and tableware were stained thus seemed dirty. People were smoking everywhere in the hotel even though it is against the law to smoke in hotels. The luggage room was unattended, thus leaving us with an uneasy feeling. The staff tried to push us to book tours. Everything did function all right but I have been in other hotels for the same price which were a lot lovelier. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, rather stay in a hostel or pay more.

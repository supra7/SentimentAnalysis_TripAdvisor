One hour before our plane was to leave for Amsterdam the Novotel Hotel notified us the hotel was under construction. Reception was in a tent in the parking lot, this notification was given prior to arrival even though the hotel was under construction months prior to our arrival. Should we have been given more notice we would have changed hotels to avoid the noise and disruption which occurred during our stay. The hotel breakfast is located within the tent with upscale plastic chairs. At 20 Euros, the breakfast consisted of some bread, eggs, fruit salad and instant noodles in a plastic container. The hotel staff informed me that the price point provided good value and was comparable to other hotels. This may be so, but not in a tent. Once I ordered a cup of tea, it came with a bag in a cup of hot water. When asked for a refill of hot water, I was informed that they would be required to charge me and addition 2.50 Euros for a second cup of tea, this is ludicrous. On the wall next to my bed was snot (nasal mucus) which had obviously been left there by a previous tenant and had existed on the wall for a significant period. After three days I had to ask the hotel staff to remove it. The hotel is designated non-smoking but people were smoking in adjoining rooms. One of our colleagues was incapable of walking to and from the RAI conference centre due to a recent sports injury. On more than one occasion the Taxi's outside the hotel charged this individual 20 Euros to drive the 5 blocks to the RAI Centre even though the minimum charge was 7.50 Euro. When we complained to the hotel the told us that we were ripped off, but did not provide any assistance as to how we should resolve the situation. I've been to Amsterdam several times but this trip left me flabbergasted.

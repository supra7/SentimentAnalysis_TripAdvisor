I struggled with how to actually "rate" this hotel because its only like $27 a night during the week. Now I'm talking about the Vintage Room not the Tower Room or the Cabana Suites. We had read on a different website that the Vintage Rooms are the way to go but I guess it just depends on what kind of person you are. If your OK with a very small room that overlooks a parking garage, a casino that is mostly coin drop and smells like baby powder or old lady perfume, and senior citizens with walkers and oxygen tanks, then this place would be just right for you. And although we are in our 40's we still prefer a little more "style" I suppose. The casino seemed very low-key and boring to us. We were booked for five nights but thank god they let us out of it early and we moved on to a more exciting place.

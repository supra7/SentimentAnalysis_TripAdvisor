I was looking for a nice boutique hotel in Amsterdam, and couldn't believe my luck when I saw the excellent rate the RobertRamon was offering. I should have known: there were basically rebuidling the hotel and it was a battle to get to the rooms. The rooms were designed by some famous designers but it was so tiny I had to stay on bed when I opened my suitcase. The shower wasn't a proper one, the walls are like paper (you can actually hear your neighbour talking in his sleep), etc... I won't recommend this place to anyone!

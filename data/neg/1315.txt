The room was typical Hilton style and furnishings. It was generally clean, although there was mold/mildew in the tub grout. I was expecting to be laid over in Seattle due to flight delays and I had checked ahead-of-time on the Hilton web site to see if they had rooms available. I could have booked a room with a king bed at the usual rate but I didn't in case there was some sort of miracle with the flights. The miracle did not happen and so I wound up getting a room by walking up to the front desk. The person at the front desk informed me that the king bed was only available for an additional $10.00. I could have walked away from the desk, opened up my laptop, and booked the king room at the same rate without paying the $10.00 and then returned to the desk and informed his smug face that I had a reservation but it was after 1:00 am and I was too tired to argue so my wife and I stayed in a room with two double beds. Why is a room with 1 bed $10.00 more in person than it is online when a room with 2 beds is the same price either way? I get less impressed with the Hilton brand every time I stay at one. I was only in this room for about 5 hours and their unwillingness to budge over a king bed in a half-empty hotel left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't stay here again unless I have to.

We were interested to see what this one would be like and loved the $109 Priceline deal we got. The check-in was great - place was practically empty. We liked being off the strip but close enough to walk. The room was beautiful; bathroom was super; but here's the deal: I was awakened at least once an hour all night long by loud long train horns, intermingled with sirens of emergency & police vehicles. It was truly horrible. We were on the 37th floor, overlooking the strip to South, but the train tracks issue was an incredible detraction from what would have otherwise been a fine stay. What in the hell could Trump have been thinking to build this on a train track and not soundproof the rooms/windows? I'd never stay there again, no matter the deal. I kind of like to sleep a little at night. Sigh.

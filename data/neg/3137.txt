I booked this hotel as a secret hotel on last minute.com. the description said it was 4 star - it was more like a backpackers. The room they gave me stank, it was dark, and so old and dated it felt dirty. I went shopping and was so upset with the booking that I immediately booked myself into the Sofitel Wentworth..not much more than I paid at the Pacific but soooo much better. Stay here if you are happy with dirty backpaker accomodation.

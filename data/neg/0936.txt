WARNING! WARNING! READ THIS! The place is a dump although we were fooled by the clean lobby. Owner accused us of lying about how much we paid. Told us we had to leave after our first night when we had already paid for two nights. Tried to push open the door while we were dressing, and when he realized the chain was on it (thank God), he stood and yelled at us through the gap in the door. When we offered to show him our receipt he refused to look at them and threatened to call the police on us to evict us! Unbelievably terrible customer service! NEVER, EVER, EVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL!

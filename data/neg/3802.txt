I requested new towels on my second day of my stay by walking into the office with my four towels from the previous day. I was impolitely told by the General Manager that I was only allowed to be given three towels. Three towels may sufficient to dry our bodies but my children needed a towel to stand on as the exited the shower. We would not have needed the towel to stand on if the showers were able to drain properly. There was no way to dry off in the shower due to the fact that there was standing water. Subsequently, I spoke to another family of four that were staying at the Motel and they explained that they had received five towels early that day from the office. I went back in to the office to speak with the General Manager about the matter and to obtain washrags and the General Manager became irate and threatened to evict me from the Motel. DO NOT STAY HERE

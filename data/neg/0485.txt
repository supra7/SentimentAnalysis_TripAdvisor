We chose this hotel as a jump-off for our cruise, as they provide parking at no additional charge. However, it was a miserable experience, full of large, screaming families, reeking of chlorine from the heavily shocked pool, and insanely small room. The common areas were dirty and run down, the room was relatively clean, but smelled terrible. The window gave a view into the parking lot and the room of the people in the hotel nest door. The bed was so hard I couldn't sleep -- thank God I brought my own pillow, because those were in short supply as well. The air conditioner works and the plumbing works. But I have a bit higher standards and I would rather forgo the so-called convenience for a decent night's sleep. Lousy start to a vacation, but it made our ship stateroom look HUGE!

There is no hotel with a more beautiful lobby or a more august history than the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago. However, guests don't sleep in the lobby, and heritage is no substitute for customer service. From the moment my wife and I arrived, we were made to feel as if the Palmer House Hilton was doing us a big, fat favor by letting us stay there. The doormen and bellmen ignored us, and the desk clerks were indifferent about serving us. When I asked the bartender for change for a fifty, he flatly refused, uttering something that sounded "Small bank! I have small bank!" Our room was cramped, with a bathroom even more so; the toilet paper dispenser only had the final remnants of a single roll when we arrived. As far as the furnishings, the word "adequate" is appropriate, but given the reputation of this hotel, we had been led to expect better. Our room had nothing to distinguish it from a typical Best Western or Country Inn & Suites, except for the fact that it was smaller, and the bathroom didn't even have a curved shower curtain rod. Also disappointing was a general attitude of "charge 'em for the lights, extra for the mice, two percent for looking in the mirror twice." We ended up spending thirty dollars for high-speed internet over two days. We booked on Priceline.com, so the room itself was 112 dollars a night, a spectacular price for downtown Chicago; simply put, we got what we paid for. Do yourself a favor, fellow traveler: Stay at the Monaco where your room will be extravagant and the staff will see that you're treated like a guest rather than an imposition. If the fact that Charles Dickens never stayed at the Monaco is a problem for you, walk three blocks to the Palmer and check out the lobby. Just don't ask the bartender for change.

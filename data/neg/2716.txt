The staff is great and the rooms are clean and spacious and you do have great WiFi access, for free . That is about where it ends. The windows are terrible. You hear EVERYTHING outside all night. You might as well sleep with the windows open. The only relief you have from the noise are the shutters that you can close at night. They block some of the noise. The location is great for the metro and train station, but you pay for that with constant traffic noise. While the rooms are nice you can easily hear the guests in the room next to you. Like crying babies. Hope you like a firm bed, because that's what you'll be sleeping on. We took the extra comforters out of the closet and placed them under the covers for extra padding. It helped. If you are a light sleeper, this is NOT the hotel for you. The breakfast they serve is extremely basic. I ate it one morning and not again. I find it funny that as I'm trying to post this review, their Internet went down. Ugh!

I stayed at the El Cortez for two nights. I booked online through travelworm.com. I paid extra to be in a Tower Room as the reviews said it was newer and slightly larger room. When I got to my room it didn't appear to be correct but I know the pictures online aren't always correct. It wasn't until the next day that I found out that they stuck me in a pavillion room instead of the tower room. The pavillion rooms are located outside. The walls are fairly thin. At one point during the night we could hear a man and woman arguing about how much she was supposed to get paid. We tried the cafe downstairs the service was horrible. It took an hour just to have breakfast and 15 to 20 mins of that was waiting for our order to come out. And besides that later that day I got sick from what had to have been the eggs I had ordered. If I wanted this kind of experience I would have stayed at the Motel 8 next door. The only good thing I can say is that the room appeared to be clean but who knows.

Booked this hotel for a weekend in November upon recommendation as "clean, Spartan room" from a travel book, so we were not expecting much... I was seriously under whelmed. The room was old, tired and felt very dirty. I slept fully clothed and wore socks at all times. The shower was gross, but sink and toilet seemed new and clean. Pillows felt filled with cotton balls, bed creaked and squeaked with the slightest movement (as did everyone else's around us too), walls and carpet were stained, did not feel the lock on the door would work. We faced a lovely strip club. The noise outside the hotel was expected due to the downtown location, but the noise from inside the hotel was obscene! People banging on our door at 3 in the morning, a party in the room above us (not to mention the 'lovemaking' we felt as if we were right in the bed with them!) Walls in general were paper thin could hear all of our neighbours conversations and whatever show they were watching on TV. Some of the staff was very friendly, others not the sharpest... The location was great and we could walk everywhere. Would not reccomend and am embarresed to say I stayed here!

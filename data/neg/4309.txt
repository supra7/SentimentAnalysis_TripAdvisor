The Hotel is a typical city chain hotel. Reception staff were unfriendly with little or no personality, their English was not the best either! The buffet breakfast at $20 a head and self service was a joke. The food was poor, cold and unappetising, not even worth $5 a head! When we came to check out after our two night stay they added a $8 tip to our breakfast bill which they eventually deducted, having first found the card slip with no tip signed by me, not a good parting gesture. However it was when we arrived home. I found that they had charged my credit card with $329.62 so I sent an email to them. Two days later i received a reply and my account was credited.The email contained the following words by way of an apology 'You may rest assured the matter has been addressed with proper staffing to avoid future re occurrence'. We will, understandably, NOT be staying at this Hyatt or any other Hyatt in the future!!

The room was very small - all you could do was walk around the bed. The shower cabin was tiny. We booked a double room and the bed was small and uncomfortable, the pillows were like a piece of soft rag stuffed into a pillow-case. Our room was situated on the first floor where the view was depressing -no greenery around the hotel, except for construction works. The hotel's reception desk is very unattractive and there is no lobby. We were deceived by the nice photos of the rooms on the Hotel's website.

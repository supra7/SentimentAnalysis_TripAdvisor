This was my second time at Destiny Palms. The first time went smoothly so I booked again. I called 2 times before my visit to confirm that I had a room with double beds as I was traveling with a child. When I arrived at the hotel at 12 am I was told that I would have to pay an additional $7 for "upgrading to double beds." The manager yelled at me when I tried to tell the him that they should have mentioned the fee when I called. The entire time he spoke down to me, told me to be quite and spoke to me as if I didn't understand how my hotel was booked. I travel frequently and have stayed anywhere from roach motels to 5 star hotels. Never have I been treated this poorly. I understand hotels have policies but they should have informed me about their "upgrade fee" at least one of the times I called so that I could make other arrangements if necessary. In fact, the last time I stayed at Destiny Palms I requested double beds and no fee or upgrade was mentioned at that time either. Moreover, the rooms were terrible. Chairs and carpets were filthy. Worst of all, the walls were paper thin. I woke up at 4 am because the woman next door was screaming profanities at her children.

EDM was not for us and we will never return. We stayed a week and I wished we had checked out early. Don't get me wrong, it might be heaven for others, but not for us. The staff was very good, but disorganized, rooms were very nice and clean. The negatives. First they put us in a room that overlooked the restaurant. After enough of my input, the moved us into a good room. Room service never, never showed up and never answered the telephone at night. The booze was watered down deluxe. You could drink all day and night and only get a sugar rush. They have no ice makers and you have to order ice. The food sucked and was always the same! I quit eating. I like Mexican regional cuisine that features the local seafood and you will not find it here. You could not order drinks to your room. All the activities there consisted of follow the leader. I hate watching people jet ski, etc., in single file. For R&R, it was okay; pretty beach. But definitely, it was not the experience I seek in Mexico or the Caribbean. This may be a great place for honeymooners or others; but it was not our style. I like real food and real booze.

Arrived on a Saturday morning and left our bags at the desk to do some sightseeing and arrived back around 5 PM. Wihing 10 minutes of getting into our room, we heard metal-against-metal from above and the "air conditioning" became a heating fan! We called the front desk and they sent the two stooges up to fix the unit. One actually climbed a ladder to look at the unit and the ladder tipped over! They claimed that it would take 30 minutes for the water to start working and we would have cool air again. Of course, nothing happened and we called the front desk. The "manager" claimed that he had spoken to them and they said we may need to wait another 30 minutes. We said that was unacceptable and wanted to get another room. The manager said "no, he woudl not do that". My husband then got on the line and told him that we were packing our bags and would be down in the lobby to get another room immediately. The manager then showed up five minutes later to our room and escorted us to another room, which was only slightly better with the cold air. From reading the other reviews, it is clear that this hotel does not have air conditioning that works and the staff simply lies to customers. We had to stay here for a business conference staying here after our weekend of sightseeing, but I wished now we had booked into the Hilton Istanbul and moved here only for business part of the trip. The staff did not display any friendliness and the manager dealing with the air conditioning was rather rude about initially refusing to change our rooms. Note that the second room we moved to had a very dangerous tub situation. The tub is quite high off the marble floor and there are no handles anywhere to grasp on to aftering showering. I do not recommend this hotel for anyone. One can do much better being closer to the sights and better accomadations. In a city as hot and humid as Instanbul, air conditoning is a must.

Rooms were clean and well-decorated and the bed was comfortable. That's where my positive experience ends, though. To begin, in three days, I never once experienced a truly warm shower: after ten minutes of running the water, it began to approach lukewarm at best; the staff's explanation was a sheep-faced, "uh, sorry, our boilers are old". To make matters worse, there must be no insulation in the walls; I'm not a particularly light sleeper, yet I heard (and couldn't sleep through) every bathroom activity of neighboring (above and adjoining) rooms; it sounded as if the water other guests were running was running in my room. And I've never encountered a toilet with such a loud flush before! Finally and inexplicably, the TV was about twenty feet away from the bed and at a right angle to it so that there was no way to comfortably watch TV in bed, as I like to do when I'm traveling on business. All in all, it certainly seemed to me that this is a hotel coasting on its historic status and location; I recommend avoiding it, particularly when taking into account the price (not cheap).

We arrived to our room and were greeted by the smell of vomit. Soon discovered the smell came from the hall right outside our room, rather than inside, which smelled fine after the offensive odor dissipated. Phoned housekeeping for help. Two hours later, no help. Phoned again, and they never phoned to say that they had been by to clean, but upon leaving the room it now smelled like carpet fresh powder AND vomit. As it was late and once inside the room it was ok, we stayed in the room and the hotel was able to move us to another room the next day. Throughout the hotel it smelled of carpet powder, rather than actual cleanliness. The hotel has supposed to have undergone a renovation, which isn't apparent in the rooms other than the new granite counters. The room decor screams 80s hunting lodge with a blend of plaids, paisleys, stripes and solids in hunter green, burgundy and yellow. Wow! Your designers can mix colors and patterns--only it's rather garish as opposed to pleasing. The newly renovated lobby doesn't look sleek and modern, it just looks bland.

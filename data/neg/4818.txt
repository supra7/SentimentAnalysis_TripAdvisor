It's hard to imagine who this hotel is aimed at. The only folks I can imagine who would end up here are people who would choose it based on its name. It's not worth it. This isn't a bad place, it just seems like there has to be better value for the money. The room I had was clean, large and had a high enough view. I felt comfortable and my room was quiet enough. The core problem is that I didn't feel like the quality/price ratio was right. Aside from everything from the internet connection to the bar and restaurant being wildly, wildly overpriced, the cost of the room itself suggested a five star stay, but the room was really only about three. The location is nothing special either. Despite being downtown, there is precious little within walking distance. I'll be looking for a better value the next time I am in town.

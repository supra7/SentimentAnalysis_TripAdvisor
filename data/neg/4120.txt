A room the size of a shoebox came with the price tag of $219 plus $27 tax. It cried for a real renovation, but obviously nobody listened for at least 5 years. There were cracks in the walls, bathtub drain was badly clogged. A comforter -- coffee stained. Internet was $10.95 for a less then a day. You cant order a drink downstairs and take it to you room, you have to use the room service, which is taking much longer and is a bit more expensive. When our order arrived, it was served on a recycled tablecloth with fresh wine stains. The only good reason to stay in this once probably great hotel is location, location, location. But there are quite a few other hotels also happily situated in the same area, which might be better managed.

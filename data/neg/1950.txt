The rooms are very cute and functional but the BEDS are ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE...we tried seven different beds and everyone of them sunk to the middle!!!..furthermore, because the beds are so soft (worn out) every time the other person rolls over it makes a ton of noise...we were here for an entire week and didn't get one good night sleep...to top things off - on the mountain side - there's an annoying train that blows its horns about 3 times a night...I definitely would not recommend this property till at a minimum all of their mattresses are replaced!...one last things there was mold in the shower area which completely turned my wife off...she asked that it be cleaned, which they tried to, but the stench was still there.

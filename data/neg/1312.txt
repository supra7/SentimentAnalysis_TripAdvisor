Rooms are normal Hilton but front desk service is very poor and rude. I stay in this hotel quite often and it has got worse and worse for service. The new team are arogant and rude. They also love to nickel and dime you on internet etc even though a room is normally $225 plus. Spencers the resturant onsite is also way overpriced for average food. I am done with this specific Hilton and will be using the (better) Hampton close by......

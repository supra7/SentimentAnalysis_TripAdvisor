My family and I just finished a 7-day Alaskan Cruise. We were looking for a hotel in Seattle, WA that had a shuttle service from the Pier to the Hotel, from the Hotel to the Airport, and a place to leave our luggage for 5-6 hrs as we went around site seeing in downtown. The booking company for this particular hotel assured me that all of my criteria's were met with this hotel and I booked the room (just to store our luggage) for $115. It ended up there were no travel accomodations to the hotel or to the airport. We ended up having to take 2 taxis to each of the destinations. Needless to say, I was very angry and it was an extra $80 over the hotel bill! The hotel manager was not around or ever available via phone. The customer service reps finally got back to me after I called 5-6 times and sent an email from their website. The matter was resolved, hopefully. They said they would reimburse me for the taxi fares, but I'll believe it when I see it. My advice for anyone in the same situation is to grab a taxi to the airport ($30 flat fee from anywhere downtown to the SEATAC airport), check in your luggage early, and take the ride-on bus back to downtown ($1.50 each way, .25 for seniors, free kids). It's free to ride on the bus in downtown Seattle until 7pm everyday.

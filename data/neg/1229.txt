The pictures are out dated and so is the hotel We were scheduled to be at the hotel for 4 nights but we left after the first horrible evening. If it were not so late when we checked in we would have not stayed one night. Our view was of a parking lot of 18 wheeler trucks that woke us up at 6:30am with their diesel engines. The rooms and hotel smelled badly. The halls were dark and scary. They do not have elevators. No locks on the bathroom doors. The carpets are dirty. We had to park on the far side of the hotel go up several flights of stairs and down many long hallways because there was not adequate parking. I can go on but I think you get the idea. Pay more, drive past, keep going, and don stop.

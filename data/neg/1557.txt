I had a great room on the 30th floor with a great view of the bay. The room was nice. What bothered me about the hotel was the lack of value for money. On top of the already expensive room rates, there was a charge for everything! Internet, the gym, parking...it seemed a little excessive. Even the Starbucks in the hotel was overpriced! I also found the staff unaccommodating. I was here for a conference and asked if I could check in early. They said they would rush my room so that it would be ready early and call me. They never called - I checked back multiple times and was finally able to check in....at 5:30pm. All in all, I was very disappointed and dissatisfied.

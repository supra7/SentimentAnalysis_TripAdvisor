My husband and I arrived at 2 am and were assigned to a room that was filthy - bed unmade, dirty towels on the floor and full trash cans. After complaining, we were placed in a closet size room with a single bed that could only hold one person. When we requested it, we were sent a non-working refrigerater and neither the television remote nor the coffee maker worked and the furniture was in a state of disrepair in the room. Needless to say, the next morning we complained again and stated our intentions to leave based on our housing. Miraculously, despite previous claims about the hotel being booked solid, the receptionist suddenly remembered a room that was available. Given the cost of the rooms at this hotel, we should NEVER have been treated in such a shoddy manner. Also, as is customary with other hotels that we stayed in, none of the desk staff bothered to greet us on the way in or out of the hotel. What an unmannerly lot. I will never stay there again. The only display of good customer service was from the lady who cleaned our rooms. BEWARE!!!

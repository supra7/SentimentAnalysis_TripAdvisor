Stayed at the Dallas Sheraton in June 2010. The accommodations were disappointing. Check in was very lengthy and staff was not knowledgeable of the rooms or Starwood status. I am a Starwood platinum member and usually receive excellent service. I was given a room in the North Tower and the room was extremely noisy due to an elevator malfunction. The noise was like a train going through the room. I called the front desk to ask for another room and was told no other rooms were available. Then I ask if I could check out and move to the Westin next door and to my surprise a room magically became available on the 30th floor. This room was a standard room but was quieter than the other. The bathroom did not have a bath mat, had one bar of soap and one bath towel. I guess they where trying to cut cost! The standard rooms are very small so travel light I would not give this hotel another opportunity for my business.

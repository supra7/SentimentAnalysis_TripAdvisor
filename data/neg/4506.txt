I was disappointed with this hotel. The location was fantastic and the suite was very nice, but I found the service to be poor. There was something wrong with our door lock. The first time we had an issue we got locked out of the room and had to wait about 45 minutes outside our room before someone came to fix it. That night when we left the hotel for dinner and came back, we were once again locked out of the room. We went down to the front desk, and the personnel were not very helpful; we asked for a room change and they basically said they didn't want to deal with having to clean a new room for us to go into. While we were waiting for the front desk to call to have it fixed, the woman answered phones and dealt with other business before calling for us. When she finally called, she gave security the wrong room number, which caused a delay in their arrival. When they arrived, they indicated that there was something wrong with the keys that the front desk had made, and basically said that there were tons of complaints in the hotel about the dooors; that the door locks were supposed to have 6 batteries but, as a money saving measure, they were only allowed to put 3 batteries in, and therefore the doors were slow and were acting up. This seems crazy to me... just put the proper number of batteries in! While the security/ engineering folks were helpful, I found the front desk to be unhelpful and unapologetic. Also, while I thought that our suite was great, it was poorly designed. The toilet and shower were right next to the head of the bed, so it was hard to sleep if someone was in the bathroom. Also, for the amount of money paid, it would have been nice to have high speed internet availbable for free. Prior to staying at he Omni I was at a Holiday Inn where they have this for free.

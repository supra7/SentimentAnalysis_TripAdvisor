I had a bad experience with this hotel from the start. I work in a hotel myself so I know what good customer service is supposed to be but this whole experience was awful! I booked this hotel on Hotwire - a site where you don't see the hotel name until after you book - and I initially booked because of its location (which I must say is good). Because I had booked online I called this hotel to add a request to the reservation and was transferred to 5 different people! Once I managed to speak to someone in reservations I was spoken to very rudely ("I dont assign the actual rooms M'am! I can't help you"). The guest service agents we checked in with were very polite but the room itself had walls that were so thin I could hear every single word that the guest in the room next door was saying. I called the desk to ask that someone please solve the problem and they sent someone to ask the guest to quiet down but it wasn't as if the guest was being loud - they were just talking. But because the walls were so thin it was like they were in our room with us! I had to call the desk twice to complain and even then I didn't get any sleep until 3am! At checkout (which like a previous guest said takes at least 30 minutes) I spoke with a guest service agent about the issue and she disregarded me as if I hadn't even said anything. I told her that I had the worst sleep I had ever had (and I have a 3 month old son!) and she didn't comment or ask about the issue. Needless to say I was not impressed with the way they treat their guests and will never stay at this Sheraton (or any other) ever again.

Was expecting a great resort from the pictures but was greatly disappointed. Stayed for 6 days. The resort is 30 years old and is showing its age. The pool was too small, and you were crowded like a sardine. The beachfront was nonexistent. Was placed in a room with stained carpet and old furniture, but was changed after insisting. The front desk was not sympathetic and could care less. The resort is loaded with seniors on a meal plan. Not anything like I expected.

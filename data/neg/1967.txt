Our manufacture recommended us to stay here since our meeting was held in this hotel. The first morning I didn't want to be disturbed, the next thing I know a "housekeeper" came in without saying a word! I told her to get out! That night we returned from our meeting to find ALL OUR CASH hidden in our bags, and MEDICATION was stolen!!! I called security, they brought up the woman that "wasn't given permission" to clean our room. She denied all of it...Lawsuit will be filed. DO NOT STAY HERE....DO NOT STAY HERE...DO NOT STAY HERE

We had a terrible time at this hotel. The hotel itself was fine but our entire room was washed with a dirty cloth (it seemed) so there was a layer of grease on EVERYTHING - including the DISHES! They were smeared with the same disgusting grease as the toilet seat. When we complained, we were told that our room would not be cleaned. We had booked for three nights, but they said that their policy was just to clean before guests arrived and only provide clean towels in the room, and a quick tidying, after that. And unfortunately we even had to call down to get those! No one ever came back to even tidy our room. The hotel is not cheap. We expected affordable and clean, but not fancy. I would emphasize to anyone not to stay here. You can definitely find better for your money!

Last Friday, I booked a suite for my daughter and I at the Elliot. I drove about 31/2 hours from NY, to help her move from one section of Boston to another. After a full day, and evening, we got back to our suite at around 10:00. We were tired, and I had a long drive to make,alone the next day; so we went to sleep at around 10:30. From 10:30 until about 12:30, we were both tossing and turning, because as soon as we'd fallen asleep, we were awakened by blaring horns which sounded as if they were mere feet from our room. I called the front desk, and they told me we could move to a quieter room down the hall. We dragged our tired selves over to the other room, opened the door, and discovered other peoples' belongings there. We called the from desk back, and they said we could go to a diffierent room, four floors down from us. By that time, I had finally drawn opened the drapes, only to discover that the window was broken, and opened very widely. My daughter, and I somehow managed to close the broken window, and finally went to sleep, at around 2:00 am. After waking up at around 7:00, to get ready to do more moving and drive back to NY, we walked over to Starbucks and ate breakfast; ( The breakfasts at the hotel were a fortune!) When we got back to our room, we discovered the broken window had fallen on my bed. Thank goodness I wasn't sitting or sleeping there. By this time, I was totally exhausted. I explained the situation to the manager, who offered to reimburse me $60.00 off the price of the almost $400.00 a night room, plus the $34.00 I spent on parking. I thought this was most unfair, and was told to contact the general manager on Monday. When I finally contacted her, she agreed to give me another $100.00 back. Frankly, I don't think I should have had to pay anything for a room with a broken window that let all the street noise in, and kept us awake most of the night! We will never return.

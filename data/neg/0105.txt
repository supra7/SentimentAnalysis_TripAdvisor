The only decent thing about this hotel is the location, which is excellent, I've stayed in better value hostels. The room was dirty, the ceiling plaster had a great chunk missing over the bed and the shower backing was falling off the wall The staff were just not interested. The decor dated from the 1970's and was all various shades of brown, grim and depressing Only stayed one night , then found somewhere else.

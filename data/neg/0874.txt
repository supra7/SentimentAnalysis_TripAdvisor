I'm considering relocating to Seattle and spent nearly a week touring the area on a budget. Even for the price (about $70 per night), this place was well below what I expected. The room and hallways were dirty; the smell of urine permeated the parking lot - seems several homeless people were sleeping behind the hedges at a neighboring business. There are other economical hotels in this same area -- try one of those instead.

Booked two nights in this hotel mainly to get a room with Space Needle view so my Mom who is a senior citizen can see the New Year's eve fireworks comfortably inside the room. When I booked online, I specified that request. When we arrived at the hotel on Dec 31st at 1pm, again I made that request and I was told a room is available with a king size bed, which is fine as long as it has the Space Needle view. I was ready to pay to reserve the room but the receptionist refused to take my card and told me to come back at 3 instead and the room will be ready. Came back at 5pm and another receptionist checked us in but told us the room is not available anymore, they transferred us to a City View room. Why??? This receptionist told us we only booked for a deluxe room and WE NEED TO UPGRADE to get a room with Space Needle View! I would rather these people be straight with me and say they want more money rather then give me excuses!

I used a booking.com site to reserve a room at this hotel for an event at the Seattle Center I was planning on attending. Quality Inn overbooked and first wanted to place me in a room far out of the way from the downtown area. Booking.com assisted to arrange a room closer to the event and Quality Inn was suppose to pay the difference of the late reservation to a hotel close to the Seattle Center. After the event I submitted the proper paperwork to Quality Inn for reimbursement. THe Hotel would not respond to multiple emails and phone calls. Booking.com has tried to assist but it has been six weeks since I submitted the paperwork to Quality Inn and they will not even return a phone call. Their service in this matter has been extremely unprofessional. Do not use a booking site with Quality Inn and Suites of Seattle. They can not be trusted.

We found a great deal on Expedia and were excited to stay at the Hilton. When we arrived the valet guys seemed like they had nothing better to do than harass us. We checked in and later that night I wanted to have a bath. To my surprise, tge tub filled with green water. We called the front desk and they sent someone up to check. The guy who came said it was the city's problem and left. The manager called and said the water was safe and we explained we did not feel comfortable bathing and brushing our teeth in green water. We asked him for another room and to check it first. We waited an hour and got impatient because it was midnight. We called and they said they had one room but the water was green too. We asked for a discount or something and he said he would drop off some breakfast vouchers. We woke up to no vouchers under our door and had to call and explain a couple more times the situation. What an ordeal. They gave us continental vouchers. What an insult. We confronted them and they gave us a full breakfast. The breakfast was actually the highlight but the service at this hotel was disorganized and rude!!

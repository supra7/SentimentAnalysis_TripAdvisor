i stayed at the crown with my friend for 5 nights and 6 days, for 200.00 a night i was expecting class A treatment and little things in the bathroom and room. with all the airline limitations i had to asked for a soap, they gave me 1, mini that in for baths was... gone, come on you charge 200.00 and the customer needs to beg, no way; definitely im not used to this treatment. then we asked how to get on highway for portland,oregon and the front desk oriental girl didnt know, wich is fine maybe shes new, but her attitude was like umm,umm and didnt pass the buck, another no,no. very,very dissapointed,and i will never go back to crown plaza hotel at seneca street, so expensive the parking place 32.00 a night and not even nice soaps at the room??? something wasnt right, ah>

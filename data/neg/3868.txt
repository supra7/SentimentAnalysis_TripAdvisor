A package (Summer Short Stop) was advertised on television that included Red Sox tickets, which was the major inducement. In May, we purchased the four-night package which came with two Right Field Box tickets to the 9/1 game. We were extremely disappointed with the hotel when I was informed just a couple hours before game time that instead of the guaranteed Right Field Box seats they only had Bleacher Seats. When I complained, the best the hotel could do was give me a $100 credit to my credit card. Plus a bag of assorted inexpensive baseball trinkets. I decided to make the best of it and accept the compromise, but if I knew before hand that all the hotel would provide was bleacher seats, I would never have made the deal. I don't know if the bait and switch was deliberate or as the result of incompetence, but it does not inspire tremendous confidence in the hotel administration. Word to the wise. Upstate NY Red Sox Fan

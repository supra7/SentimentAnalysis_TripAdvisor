Upon check-in, I found my room preferences were ignored, but the front deck clerk fixed that. Nice TV, way-loud A.C. Breakfast: below the average for this type of hotel. It was a bit odd that the front desk staff allowed a cabbie to hang out by the elevator, asking anyone with a suitcase this morning: "need a ride to the airport?" It's bad enough to be badgered on the streets but I expect this NOT to happen in my hotel.

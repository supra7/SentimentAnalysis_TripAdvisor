Although the room was reserved for 4 people, there were only 2 towels and we had to ask for more. The next day, they took our 4 towels and replaced them with 2 towels...so again, we had to ask for more. Although the beds are very comfortable, they are too high to sit on and there is really only ONE chair in the room. This makes the room very uncomfortable for 4 people. So we went out on the very nice back porch, but there were no chairs out there either. We basically couldn't stay in our room unless we were ready to go to bed!! In addition, we were charged $24/DAY for some sort of "RESORT FEE" (covering internet, pools, parking, fitness center), which was ridiculous because all we did was sleep here. We did not use the pool, the internet, the "fitness center" or anything else. We couldn't even use the parking lot as it was always full and we had to park in the adjacent drug store parking lot. All in all, if it wasn't for the "RESORT FEE", I might recommend this place to others (if they bring lawn chairs). I felt that charging us a $24/day RESORT FEE on checkout, after we had paid $170/night for a room with 2 beds) was a complete ripoff and I would not recommend this place for that reason. (I had no knowledge of this fee until after I had paid online for the room, which I think was VERY deceptive).

I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for 3 nights while traveling on business. The room rate of $359 per night was outrageous for an average to poor room with no amenities. The beds were not very comfortable, the pillows were flat, and the bedspreads were dirty. Yuck! It was a disappointing experience. Our room smelled like an overdose of air freshener and I had a sinus headache every morning.

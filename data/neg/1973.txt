The room was clean and comfortable but the hotel is uninviting. Abundance of glass and gold is in poor taste. The location is poor. It's a long walk to get to anything and the hotel doesn't offer much, They do provide a shuttle to Wynn but it wasn't running when we needed it. I also got harassed by a security guard who bowed to a hooker in front of me. It's so embarrassing that it's funny.

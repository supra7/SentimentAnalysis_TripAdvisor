Friday the 13th! The motel experience at this Super 8 fits the date. I would guess this was "another brand" motel, with recent renovations and a new manager (Mid-Eastern). Location was just off an expressway, in an industrial area; warehouses and apartment complexes. First impression was okay until closer examination showed concertina (barbed) wire on the fences of the property and a side entrance closed off. Outside room entrances, 2 floors, no elevator. Several construction vehicles in parking lot, meaning the property is used by transient workers. Rooms were very nice, clean, and conditioned air. AARP rate, 2 adults, $62.09 total. Small, outdoor pool, looked okay but in front of property-lots of road debris. Manager had a mesh fence around the pool to try and keep the debris from the road entering pool. This worked partially, there were still some papers, cigarette butts, leaves, etc. in pool. Big sign on road (as well as motel brochure) advertised wifi, exercise room, and whirlpool- all non-existant. A car alarm went off outside our room at 2:30 AM-thankfully not ours. A man (intoxicated?) was sitting in a p/u truck, fiddling w/alarm(stopped it). But then he started trying the doors of the car next to the truck. I called front desk to inform them but got no answer after a dozen rings. Informed desk next AM, no concerns expressed (an Asian thing?). I always ask for connecting rooms on our vacations. Queried about this again. Same response at this inn- the only rooms that connect already had one occupied. This after a 4 month reservation lead time and a personal phone call 2 days before the arrival- why can't inns grant this request? Continental breakfast in AM, not bad, but crowded area. I would not recommend this property.

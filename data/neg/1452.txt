Our first hotel upon arriving in Rome; the location was great right on a bustling street. Some noise depending on your unit but we were so tired we slept well. First room given to us (405) was designed without any thought clearly; the bathroom area does not have a glass door and the floor ledge wasn't raised so the entire bathroom was flooded and threatened to reach the carpeted floors. Requested for extra floor mat and even so, both were soaked. It was horrible because you're walking in and out of an extremely wet, slippery and messy bathroom. The hotel was obviously trying its luck with this room, and that wasn't a nice impression really for the number of stars it had. Can't imagine if we were stuck with that slushy and messy bathroom for 3 nights. Spoke to concierge & they changed to another room with bath tub and jacuzzi, room was slightly bigger as well and it made up for the awful 1st night experience. Breakfast was fantastic; various types of ham & salami, cheeses, cakes, cereal. Staff were helpful and courteous but even so, that didn't change the fact that they tried to trap us with a room which was clearly not meant for staying in with the shower they had. To be sure, request for a room with bath tub, or look for another hotel in Trevi area!

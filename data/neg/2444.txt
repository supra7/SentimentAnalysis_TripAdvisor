Stayed one night in a first floor room. Room was an odd shape, door opened straight on to bed, television was mounted on wall beside bed making it difficult to watch. There was a thin section of the room alongside the bathroom that was only useful if you needed to store lots of luggage. Bathroom was spotless, shame the bedroom wasnt, carpet was dirty and there were bottles left lying under the bed. Bed was very firm and not comfortable, pillows rather flat. Biggest problem was the window which opened in to the room. It blew open every time there was a strong breeze or a lorry drove past, and there was no handle to shut it. Phoned reception to ask if they could lock it  no answer. After 10 minutes (not an exaggeration) ringing the bell at the reception desk someone finally responded and came to lock my room window. Even with it shut the outside noise was unbearable. If you do stay bring earplugs. Breakfast was continental only and was disappointing. I wont be staying again. It is cheap for a reason.

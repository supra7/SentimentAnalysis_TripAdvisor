The hotel lobby is beautiful. We enjoyed having a drink and listening to the live band play during cocktail hour. We walked around the entire hotel, the ballrooms are beautiful. We had a good dinner at, Lockwood, the hotel restaurant. We'd recommend the filet mignon. The pool is very small and was very crowded both times we went. The smell of chlorhine was overwhelming. We stayed on the 13th floor facing Monroe Street. The room had 2 double beds, they were comfortable. The bathroom was very small. The door missed touching the toilet by an inch! The biggest drawback for us was the noise from the El Train, all night long. It was VERY loud. The hotel has thin walls, as we could hear our neigbhors tv, conversations and bathrooms. If you like it quiet, do not stay at the Palmer House!

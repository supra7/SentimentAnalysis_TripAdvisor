Stayed here over Mother's Day weekend. I've been a Hilton Gold member for several years and I've stayed almost exclusively at Hiltons. This has to be one of the worst stays I've had. The hotel is new and exceptionally clean - but that's pretty much all that's going for it. Our first night, the A/C vent was very loud and I couldn't sleep. They were kind enough to offer to move us to another room in the middle of the night. I guess that bothered them because they gave us a wake-up call at 0700. Upset my kids and wife. My wife complained and they apologized. Then on the second night, they gave us a wake-up call around midnight. We didn't complain anymore so we don't get any more surprise wake-up calls. Also, they don't offer Gold members a lot of benefits. No free breakfast (got a coupon for Starbucks coffee); no free internet. I suppose if you're here for business and your company pays for everything this is a great hotel. But for leisure, your better off somewhere else.

Truly an old hotel still living off of it's good reputation. Terrible service, it seems that the staff hasn't even been trained? Switched rooms twice after our airconditioner was making loud noises, our bathroom was filled with black hair and in the last room our toilet overflowed on the first night, we then got the excuse "it is an old hotel". We were not reimbursed for anything, not even offered breakfast or complimentary room service. Good prices and great location but that's about all they have going for them. You'd expect a little class staying at the Plaza but instead we got stained sheets, small rooms, hairs in the bathroom and poor service? Will not stay there again.

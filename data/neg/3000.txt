On the first morning we found splatters of blood on our sheets near the foot of the bed, and after inspecting ourselves, knew that it was not our blood. Not raising a stink about it like we should have, we put out the sign for our room to be cleaned and remade, and thought this would take care of it. We were wrong. The next morning (did not inspect the sheets that night as we should have) we saw the same spots of blood in the same spot on the sheets! I was disgusted and even though my husband did not want to say anything, I did. But that isn't the worst of it. The worst of it is when I told the manager when we were checking out, she seemed genuinely concerned and had the head of the cleaning staff go and check it out. That woman went upstairs to check it out, and came down and looked us in the eye and essentially blamed us for the blood and said we ruined her sheets. After being spoken to in such a rude and embarrassing way, I went to speak to the manager who sided with her, saying "if you have a problem with it, then you should just not come back". This was the worst experience of customer service i have ever had. Obviously if it was her fault that the sheets were bloody, but also failed to get changed with this obvious mistake, she clearly was looking to get out of this huge failure to DO HER JOB! But then to blame us for it and to treat us like the common criminal was ridiculous. If we had ruined her sheets, why would we TELL them about it?? I will never go back and here.

Hotel in Singapore is expensive and due to only stop over for a night, we did not want to spend much on a hotel and decided to get a three star, that turned out to be a very low budget hotel. Location is perfect but in a matter of cleanliness and comfort are way far from a three star rated hotel. Room is very small and shower is attached closely to the toilet, and so when you take shower everything will go wet! Staff is really nice, very attentive to help. Value for money is a bit expensive since we pay for room only, but I doubted they served breakfast since we just found out that the hotel itself is really small.... Will we come back there??? I don't think so....might stay at another hotel...

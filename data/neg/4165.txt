This is the kind of place that is good enough...IF someone else is footing the bill. I was in town for business, so this was the choice that was made. I doubt I would have picked it myself! Don't come here expecting charm or nice decorative touches. It is simply a functional business hotel, nothing more. Oh, and they charged me $1.75 for each local call made from the room! Breakfast is not included in the hotel price...and rather expensive! No complimentary coffee or coffee pot in the room. No fridge. My hotel room was cold the night I stayed, and the heat was not easy to figure out how to adjust. To their credit, I arrived on a Tuesday night and found the staff to be friendly and efficient. (I did not encounter the Rudeness problem that others spoke of.) My friend raved about the mattress on her bed. I liked the soap, lotion and shampoo provided in the bathroom. The shower was fine. I found the chandeliers in the reception area very tacky. I was not at all into the overall "interior design" of the hotel.

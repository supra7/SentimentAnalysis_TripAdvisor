This hotel was the worst of my traveling experience. Besides all the other problems in the other reviews, the window was duct taped shut, the floor slanted toward the bathroom, there were trip hazards in the bathroom, we were double charged for the parking, the breakfast was stale, and the clerks and owners were extremely rude and completely unaccommodating. While the room had recently undergone a renovation, of sorts, I don't know how the hotel passed a fire inspection. The elevator didn't work so yes we (senior citizens) carried our luggage down 4 flights of stairs. This hotel is supposed to be set up for handicapped people; I find that laughable. A rat infested field would have been a better choice. The price of this hotel is obscene.

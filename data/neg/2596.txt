After having read so many great reviews of this hotel we were disappointed overall although the location is great. We booked a 'suite' for family with teenagers and emailed beforehand to confirm that everyone would have a 'proper' bed. We were assured that it had two kingsized beds whereas in actual fact one was a very uncomfortable lumpy sofa bed. The shower leaked onto the bedroom floor and our room wasn't made up on either day of our stay. Having the room by the lobby means there is constant noise from the front door opening & closing particularly at night. We also didn't find out about the lift til we checked out (they assumed we liked carrying 3 cases up 3 flights of stairs). Breakfast just horribly basic, stale cereal, disgusting hot drinks machine n juice in plastic disposable cups. Not an attractive place to return to after long hot sightseeing days and defintely not somewhere we'll be going back to.

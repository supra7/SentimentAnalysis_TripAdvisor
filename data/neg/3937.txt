If you have never stayed in a pre-war hotel before (2nd WW!) then this is for you  even if just for the one-time experience. Reminds me of the Abbey Victoria in NYC  affectionately refered to as the Shabby Abby for a reason  before they tore it down 20 years ago. What do you do if you own a massive edifice in the center of Boston with wide corridors, double doors (for your suits to be placed in and pressed overnight) and bathrooms the same size as the walk in closets. (A 10 x 6 bathroom with less than 2 feet between bath/shower and wall for the small toilet yet wide entrance and huge amounts of wasted floor space.) Massive hotel entrance reception, expensive boutiques and restaurants, wide corridors. Too expensive to modernize the infrastructure  so you emphasize the old world charm on the hotel video - and hope the AC works. Mine didnt. Would have been O.K. if the windows opened; as they had indicated on the reservation confirmation but they were blocked closed. No jumpers here. I suspect I know as to why this was dropped from the Starwood/Sheraton Hotel chain around May 2011. Perhaps a little too much of a curiosity for the modern world even with the Ethernet - which the receptionist denied was available (?), Keurig coffee maker and flat panel TV. But, the peeling ceiling in the corner, the water that was warm/never hot, the non-functioning AC and the double charge for the Internet made it less than a perfect experience - quaint or not. I was a tad surprised at the cost for such an experience and will not to stay here again. I guess thats personal taste. Squeezing in between bathroom door and sink with huge expanse of entrance floor space behind me I realized I just prefer to live in the 21st Century and this was too much 30s. If you like old chandeliers, brocade, ornate gold colored molding etc, this is the place for you.

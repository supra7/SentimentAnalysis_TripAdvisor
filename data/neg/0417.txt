I stay in Marriott properties (including Renaissance) on a regular basis and have tried them around the globe. This is one of the most disappointing properties I've stayed in. First off, the hotel is located over a highway which is somewhat of a convenience as the hotel is located very centrally within Seattle. My initial room, however, was over the highway and had surprisingly little sound insulation. I literally could not sleep due to the traffic noise - and I was on the 17th floor. When I requested a room change, they initially told me there were no available rooms. When I told them of my Marriott status - which they did not request when I checked in - a room suddenly materialized. Although this is a non-smoking property, I was overwhelmed with smoke from one of my neighbors on several occasions - bad luck on my part. The concierge lounge is the smallest I've seen and extremely crowded. I personally will try one of the other Marriott properties the next time I'm in Seattle.

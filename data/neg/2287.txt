Frequently I have to book a hotel near the Philadelphia airport on short notice. Sometimes I have to "settle" for this place because everything is fully booked. I can now see why this is the only place with available rooms. These rooms are not properly cleaned. The rooms smell like mold, the bathroom sink is crusty, and even though the bed is made, the sheets are wrinkled and appear as if someone has already slept in them. The corners of the room have some sort of brown crust accumulating. I had to leave and purchase some sanitizing wipes to prevent myself from vomiting. It does not help that people are allowed to cook in their rooms. The entire floor smells like a take-out restaurant. Hotel guests obviously unhappy with their own disgusting food smelling up their rooms put their garbage outside their room in the hallway. The only problem is that this establishment has no maid staff on the premises. Cleaning is only done every few days. Rotting food sitting around for hours on end leaves the entire hotel smelling like a sewer. I felt as though a film of filth was accumulating on me the longer I stayed in the hotel. Interestingly enough I filled out a survey trashing this disgusting establishment. The only thing this accomplished was getting me on Extended Stay's mailing list. Now I get e-mails every other day advertising their hotel rates. Complaining to the staff does nothing. When the person at the desk asked me how my stay was, I told them how horrible it was. He half-heartedly apologized and did nothing else. People only stay here because it is a busy area and it is in a prime location. Do yourself a favor and sleep in your car instead.

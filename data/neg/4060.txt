I travel for work and pleasure non-stop and this is the worst hotel that I have stayed at in a very long time. Check in went smoothly, but when I got to my room it was very old and the door in great need of a paint job. I ordered room service dinner, which came and was wrong. Upon reordering dinner it took another hour to have it sent up - and 3 phone calls. While the supervisor removed the room charge, I was starving and not happy. There are no hair dryers - what hotel doesn't have hair dryers in this day and age - the bathroom is tiny and street noise went on all night long. For the money, stay someplace else! This hotel is an embarrassment to the Starwood chain.

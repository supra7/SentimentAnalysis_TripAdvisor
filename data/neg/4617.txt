I have literally traveled the world and this was BY FAR the smallest room I have ever stayed in. The claim to 4 stars is laughable. The bathroom is a joke. It is so small one cannot even turn around in it. There is no mini bar, no coffee maker, no place whatsoever to do anything more than lie in bed. The TV is so close to the end of the bed that I had to sit on the bed to squeeze between them! The pool closes at 9pm, the gym costs a supplement, the ethernet cable costs $15 for the very basic reception, and the line at the hotel's reception desk is enough to turn you away. If you want to stay in a small and expensive 2 star hotel in downtown Chicago, then this is your place. If you desire nicer accommodations, then by all means, keep searching!!

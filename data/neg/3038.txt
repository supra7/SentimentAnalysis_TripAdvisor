My colleagues and I were booked in this hotel as the result of overflow registration for an exhibition/congress. On the surface, the hotel is clean and relatively new, and the staff tried hard to keep customers happy. For those attending meetings at McCormack Place - this is anything but a desirable site. The hotel sits in the middle of a very bad neighborhood, requiring taxi service to get you anyplace (that is, if you can get a Taxi to come here). The hotel rooms are large and clean, but relatively spartan. There is no food service or restaurant in the hotel. Our travel planner took this option as it showed up as recommended by McCormack Place when all other hotels were overbooked. The travel planner relied on the website to make this decision and believed that it would be more suitable than traveling to/from Chicago from the only hotels with space available (at the airport). Given the option again, we will make the trip from Airport Hotels.

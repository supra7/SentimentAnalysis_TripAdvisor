* Though the hotel advertised wireless AND wired internet available in rooms, unless you had a direct view of the Super 8 down the street AND got the password from the Sterling Hotel manager or owner, you were screwed. Add to that the wireless that you could get in the lobby was pretty worthless and had a cap on number of concurrent connections. * NO service in the restaurant. NO...I don't mean poor... We sat there at breakfast, one of only 2-3 tables occupied, for 10 MINUTES without getting a menu, water or drinks. We spotted a breakfast buffet and went and helped ourselves...never DID get water, or coffee, or drinks... (This happened on THREE different occasions over 4 days where it took over 2 hours once to get sandwiches!) * Elevators constantly going out of service on Sunday and remaining that way for a couple of hours each time... And then...the coup de grace... I bring towels almost everywhere I travel. Not your average towels, but HUGE, thick, DARK BLUE bath sheets. Never once has anyone ever mistaken them for the postage stamp size, white, thin hotel towels...until this weekend, when they disappeared. According to the hotel and housekeeping they must have grown legs.

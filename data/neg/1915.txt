The hotel is very close to istiklal street so it's at the commercial center of city very close to very good restaurants and bars. The staff was polite and the service was very good.The " Hammam" of the hotel is excellent and the personnel working there was very polite. Very good masaz. BUT........... the rooms were extremely small (i haven't seeing a 4 star hotel room smaller than that!!!) if I had a second suitcase there will be no room for it. The worst thing though was that there is a club under the hotel rooms. I return to the room at Friday night and the music was so loud like I was going to sleep in the club!!!!!! no joke about that!!!!! the noise was so loud I couldn't even hear the TV!!!!, worst night ever in a hotel room!!! fortunately I was so tired that when the music volume decrease at 2.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!! pm I slept in no time .....

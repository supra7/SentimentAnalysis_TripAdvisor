I stayed at this hotel for two reasons: discounted corporate price & central downtown location. It's location is central, close to public transportation. However, this hotel comes with nothing. I have a great view from my room, nice beds, great dual shower head. However the hotel stocks the fridge with a 400% markup on items. If you use the fridge for your personal use, you have to pay a $7 fee. There are no vending machines or soda machines. There is a drug store within a block but it doesn't keep city hours. The room also ran quite warm. We were burning hot each night (might be the posh beds). Beware that the parking is $40 for a 24 hr period. This is about the most expensive for the city. It's not pro-rated either. The parking is run by a private contracted company to the hotel. Really just okay considering what you pay. Not being able to use the own fridge in your room was just pitiful. The hotel also charges for internet and printing. I did enjoy the views for the higher floors. I was disappointed that the curtain facades were not dusted. Totally coated in dust that the AC blows directly on.

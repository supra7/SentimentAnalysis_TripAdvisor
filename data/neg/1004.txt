First of all, the staff is very dry and not friendly. Second of all, they do not explain anything to you when it comes to hotel charges. Third of all, and by far the most classy of all, if you want to stay here and are interested in picking up some prostitutes in seattle, this is the place to stay. After hanging out at the bar with some friends on a friday night, we got to watch a couple of guys pick up some hookers at the bar. Top notch and classy. I will never stay here again! Not for this price!

Booked a 4 night stay, moved out after 2 days and left the prepaid room empty because this place is a S-hole. The hotel cannot control the lousy neighborhood, winos, and addicts that form a gauntlet on the way in and out, but the can control the customer experience once you enter the building. Room was NOT ready on time. Room was absolutley FILTHY; Did not expect much based on price and reviews but this was below one star. Mold and mildew all over the bathroom, the room stank, the beds and floors were dirty. I have never seen a property maintained with such indifference. Everything was worn out and disgusting; an appointment with a wrecking ball is 20 years overdue. Front desk would not offer an alternate room (we even offered to PAY for an upgrade!) Website photos and descriptions are hugely misleading; had to have been shot decades ago or extensively retouched! If you are looking for budget accomodations, look somewhere else; there are plenty of inexpensive options in Las Vegas that are nowhere near this bad!

If could rate this a zero we would. We are not complainers but this hotel is dirty and smells moldy and smokey. Rooms were not clean, dead roaches in closets and under the bed along with dirty drinking cups under bed. Rooms were not cleaned of restocked daily. There are no refrigerators in the rooms as advertised. Food was cold at each meal that we ate in the resturants. Paid too much since $1.00 would have been too much for this experience. If hadn't been here for a group function would have left after seeing the room. Friends said shower in their room didn't work at all the entire weekend. Will never stay here again.

I booked a maui vacation package through a travel agency and paid for it in full around three weeks before the trip. I arranged to stay in Maui Eldorado, after reading the favorable review here and in Frommer 2004. The night before arrival, I called Maui Eldorado for confirmation and was told that the reservation was found under my husband's name. When we tried to check in the next day, we were handed a letter signed by the manager and was told that they overbooked and as a result they are moving us to another Outrigger property called Royal Kahana, without presenting us any additional options. The letter presented the arrangement as "upgraded", even though according to trip advisor both average price and review of Royal Kahana is lower than those of Maui Eldorado. During the time we were in Maui, Kahana had frequent rain and drizzle while Kanaapali about ten minutes' drive away is clear, has dry road, not to mention has abundant options on activities and shopping. Subsequent discussion with Maui Eldorado did not lead to anywhere close to getting us out of the tired-looking high rise and into some place sunnier and more conveniently located like Maui Eldorado. This experience is extremely unpleasant. Please speak up if you have similar experience dealing with Maui Eldorado or with outrigger chain. As a vibrant online community we can help make sure that our vacations do not get ruined by unsavory business practices such as bait and switch, discrimination, etc.

First of all, hilton hotels are my favorite chain of hotels. However, The Hilton DownTown Miami florida is one of the worst hotels I ever stayed in. When arriving to the hotel it seem like a luxurious hotel. The moment I walked in the room I was disappointed. 1.I was advised when I booked my reservations(2queen bed bay side view jr suite) that there would be a microwave and refrigerator in my room but there wasn't. 2. As usual when staying in a hotel; I lifted the blankets and check the sheets and found blood stains, hairs, and other stains on the sheets of one bed and yellow stains on the sheets of the other bed. I called and spoke with the hotel manager and she came to inspect the room as i was taking pictures of all the stains and hairs that were on the bed sheets. 3. On my last night of stay, my camera was stolen out of my room. I call for room service to bring some mouthwash to the room in which they promise that they would. 30mins later I haven't received my mouthewash in which I understood because they were sought of busy, so i placed my camera on my suitcase and as I was leaving to go to the mall I saw a male housekeeper near the elevator so I advised him that I haven't received my mouthwash; the male housekeeper said which room are you staying in because I will bring you some; I told him. then he asked if anyone would be in the room. i told him no but he could leave it in the room because we all was going to the mall. upon gathering my luggage to checkout for the next morning, I noticed that my digital camera was missing. On that morning when filing a report with the hotel security staff, she spoke to me as if I was a liar. I advise her that I was in law enforcement and that I know you may get false reports but this one is not. There was a moment when I thought to myself that they may have had my camera stolen because they saw me taking pictures of the sheets. can prove anything with no photos but I do have a bunch of witnesses.

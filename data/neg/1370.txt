I stayed here with my wife in June whilst on a 3 city break with Great Rail Journeys. In my view and that of most of the others on the holiday this hotel is not in the best location to get into the centre of the City.Its a decent walk to the tube a bit shorter for a tram.The hotel did not live up to expectations, food was at best average,they seemed short on staff at times and hotel reception standard was variable. Its in a bit of a shabby area and some of our travelling companions who were mainly over 65 didnt feel that safe at night in the area and one was apporached right outside the hotel lobby by some very unsavoury individuals. I have to say many of us wondered why our tour company had booked us into this hotel in the first place due to the location the hotel is at very best a 3 star affair nothing more so dissapointing all round..

My best friend and I took our daughters for a little girls vacation to watch High School Musical on Broadway (which I highly recommend). We took the Amtrak there which I would highly recommend when traveling with children. We arrived at the Palmer House in the late afternoon and we had to wait in line for quite awhile to get checked in. When we finally got to check in, the lady took forever and wasn't friendly at all. She told me that we just had a double bed room and I told her it should be with two bathrooms as well. She agrued with me about it and I told her that I had read reviews on Tripadvisor that they do this to people all the time. I told her that I contacted their hotel directly to book the room and I called to verify our room reservation just the day before and was told that we would have a double bed/2 bath room. She finally went and talked to someone and we got the room we were supposed to but she wasn't friendly about it. I overheard a couple checking in beside me and the same thing was happening to them. I was very disappointed in the check in process. The hotel was beautiful and close to pretty much everything. The restaurant there is wonderful and the Corner Bakery next to it is fabulous. I think the Palmer House is over priced for the service you get but worth it for the location.

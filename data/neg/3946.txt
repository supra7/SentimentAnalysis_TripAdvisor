My wife and I spent weeks trying to Priceline a hotel room for the 4 days we would be spending in Boston for a convention. We ended up winning the Park Plaza and were skeptical from the start. We immediately realized the only redeeming quality of this hotel was its location. That's it. You would think a hotel that purports to be higher quality would at the very least offer a complimentary shuttle service to and from the airport for guests. Not so here. Instead, they charge $17/person. Is this hotel so hard on times that the $400-500 it charges guests per night does cover such costs? Also, no complimentary wireless internet service. I've had better at lesser quality hotels. I realize there are some things the hotel can change and cannot. For instance, the hotel rooms were small to say the least. Ok, it's historic. But as long as you keep the rooms this size, at least install thicker walls. I heard every bodily noise/function of the guests next door. The guests on the other side were up partying till 3am. I think someone complained about the noise, and we even saw a hotel agent walk around our floor. Despite the noise, the agent declared "all clear". And the fitness facility was closed due to remodeling. Guess where the temporary facility was. A conference room of the hotel that was the size of a guest room. Imagine 2 treadmills, 2 eliptical machines and an exercise bike crammed into a small room with no ventilation. Thanks, but no thanks. Overall, the location was great, but for such a price, I was very very disappointed. The hotel could have done little things like even offer loaner umbrellas on a rainy day for its guests, which might have made the experience somewhat more palatable. Otherwise, if you have a choice, I would strongly suggest staying away or paying much less.

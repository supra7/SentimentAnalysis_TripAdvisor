I stayed at this hotel whilst at a works conference and was gobsmacked. The pictures on the hotels website looked great and I thought it would of been a comfortable stay. How wrong was I. The Radiator had fallen off the wall therefore all you could see was the wallpaper hanging off. The lamp shade's had fallen off therefore lights were not working. The shower was disgusting there must of been 2inches of mould/limescale on the shower head. Please Please Please do not ever stay at this hotel. It isn't suitable for a dog to stay in. I only wish i had enough pics to show!!!!

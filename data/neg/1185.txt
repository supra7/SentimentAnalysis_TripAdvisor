I had a jet fly through my room every 10 minutes. The loudest one was at 5:15 am. I gave up on sleeping then. They just kept coming. This is an older property. Probably early 1970's. The neighborhood must have been much nicer back then too. The location has gone down hill. The bed was extremely small, but reasonably comfortable. One roll over on either side and you would have fallen off. There were stains in the bathroom from the years of wear. Not dirty, just very old. A black streak here and black flecks there. The front desk was nice. Very close to the airport. The breakfast was okay. I did like being able to buy a Coke out of the machine for the bargain price of $.75 per 12 ounce can!

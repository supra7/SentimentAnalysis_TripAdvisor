This isn't really a hotel in the modern meaning of the word -- it is basically a motel (or bed and breakfast). It reminded me of those American motels which can be seen in movies. I stayed there for two nights. It is located in a nice residential area, close to the Rebibbia metro station (Line B). Therefore, connection to central Rome is easy and painless (about 20 minutes away). The room was clean enough and the staff was fun. Sound isolation is terrible, so you can hear people talking in the room next to yours. Breakfast is basic, but okay. The WiFi is free for all guests. It was fairly cheap, so the value you get for the price is great.

The hotel is lovely with nice and friendly people working there! Lots of restaurants and things to do within walking distance! The parking situation is unacceptable!!! Having to wait thirty minutes every time I wanted my car is very unprofessional...in fact they lost my car and could not find it for over two hours...I was late for my sons wedding!!! Every morning around 3 AM we were woken up to extremely loud noises of metal I-beams being dropped which lasted for about five minutes! The water pipes on our floor rattled when someone showered! One ice and cola machine for the whole building of 26 floors with 330 rooms!

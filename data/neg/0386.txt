Ok, so this hotel is inexpensive for Seattle city centre, but we think that cleanliness should be included in the price! We switched rooms as the bathroom was definitely cruddy and the bed sheets looked and smelled like they had been slept in and just smoothed over. The front desk gave us another room with no qualms. Rooms are a bit pokey and ours had a view of the parking lot opposite, but for one night before our flight the next day, it sufficed. The hotel is well-located for seeing the sights if you don't mind walking, you can get the monorail to the Space Needle just down the street too. The airport shuttle drop-off is a convenient block away. Last word, the breakfast is fine if you're on the go, coffee and danish from Seattle's Best Coffee downstairs.

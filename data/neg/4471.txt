Stayed during "Looptopia".Some short-stay guests might have a great day or two.Our week-long stay however,allowed us to get quite familiar with hotel.It did have it's compromises. Paid extra for 2-room suite.Both rooms small.Lack of space for baggage (ok if just an overnight bag),bathroom very small w/chipped sink & worn out showerhead. Front desk staff ok but gave us incorrect subway directions & the florist they suggested was lacking in service,choice & freshness of flowers.Doorman often non-existant..Poor service in the Atwood Cafe which included stained chinaware.Room safe located on floor of closet ..the low light & on-the- floor- location seems thoughtless.As my wife requires injectable medicine,we asked Front Desk for a appropriately-marked disposal container. We were handed a small,plain plastic bag & told room cleaning would pick up used needles when tidying the room (!). All other hotels we've stayed at in Chicago gave her plastic,sealable container with the renowned "hazard material" logo on it. Not the Burnham, though. To it's credit, the loop location,great windows, the historic & charming ambience & nice touches throughout hotel are very nice. But in tallying up our experiences for the week,we admit it's not our kind of stay.

Fair location due to public transport links. The rooms have been refurbed - they look nice on the surface, but will quickly wear, due to the cheapness of the fixtures and fittings used, especiallly the showeroom, a shame really. The aircon was having difficulty keeping up and never seemed to get to the promised minimum setting of 19 degrees - the room was like an oven, and the noise from the road - unbearable! The newly refurbed restaurant is totally lacking in atmosphere - it serves bar meal quality food, but without the bar. Of the 5 or 6 main dishes that were on the menu 2 were not available. It took over an hour to get the 2 courses - the soup was lovely though, the lasagna not so. The breakfast service was very poor, very slow again, with poor choice from the continental section and very poorly laid out; the glasses were away from the juices and the dishes were away from the cereals - not thought through at all. I am a Platinum customer on BW - no room up-grade, no newspaper, no discount on meals, no need for me to stay there again!

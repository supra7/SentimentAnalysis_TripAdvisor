It's a very loud hotel. If you want a good and calm night's sleep in a quiet area you will not get it here. If you are looking for a hotel near great restaurants you will not get it here. If you are looking for a hotel that is situated in a picturesque neighborhood with a lovely view... please just look somewhere else. What you get with this hotel is CHEAP and CLEAN. Cheap and clean can go a long way. I never felt unsafe but there is NO ONE on those streets at night. The train passes by the window REALLY close and my room had a view of only the train. I can sleep through anything (thankfully). The area is a really crowded Chinatown. Walking on those streets can be stressful but at least the train is nearbye. Ha ha.

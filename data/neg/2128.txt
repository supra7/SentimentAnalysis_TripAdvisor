L,et me start by saying that I travel extensively to Mexico and the Caribbean and only at all inclusive hotels. Hacienda was by far the worst experience. We had over 40 people in attendance for the wedding which was planned a year in advance and I spent most of my time at the front desk fighting for our guests. I was also told they were at 80% capacity and that there were no king sized beds available for most of our guests. Turns out this is a family resort and that is who they cater too. The resort was clean, if you don't mind your room being cleaned at 5 pm when your getting ready for dinner and the food was barely edible. The Grill was the best so for 5 days that is where we ate, everything we were entitled to as a large group was a fight. Out of my 6 day stay, 5 of them was spent fighting with front desk over something or concierge trying to get things organized. I was given an upgraded room with jacuzzi on roof and it never worked and when it did it was scummy. Topping on the cake was when my safe would not open and they had to drill it put and replace it. Another 3 hours spent in my room instead of with my guests. If traveling to Mexico I recommend the Excellence playa Mujeles adult all inclusive.

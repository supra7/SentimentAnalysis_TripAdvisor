Upon arrival to our room we found dozens of flying bugs in our room. We could not even open the patio door because there was holes in the screen. Also,the room was not clean. When we asked to change rooms we were treated rudely. We were told that bugs this time of year are the norm and we should just accept that. In addition, the room was on the first floor by the in-house Medical Clinic and every time we left or returned to our room, there was a line of sick people in the hallway we had to walk by. The hallway smelled and the trash was overflowing. We were initally told we would never be able to change rooms because the Hotel was booked for the entire time we were going to stay. We then talked to the manager and eventually we were moved to a new room and we bought cleaning products and cleaned the room ourselves. Luckily the room was located on the main floor because we did not have to depend on the elevators that we out of order. We have traveled extensively and we found this property to be overpriced and in need of improvements. This was our last stay at a Hyatt because it destroyed the trust we once had in the Hyatt name.

While I didn't stay overnight, I attended a luncheon during an international convention that was held at this hotel. The hotel charged $39.00 for the food which consisted of a few cubes of chicken mixed with a few pieces of iceberg lettuce followed by dessert, and that was it. When I asked for extra bread, because I was still hungry, my request was ignored. $39.00!!

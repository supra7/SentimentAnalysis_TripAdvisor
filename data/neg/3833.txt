I don't think this hotel meets the stars it claims or basically delivers as promised. Its in the centre and thats about it. I stayed on 30th floor and all three nights there was some whirring noises on the floor above. The bathrooms were poorly equipped and anything requested came in a quantity of 1. I mean the hotel charges so much so surely they can be generous with bath supplies and tea facilities. BTW there were no such things like vanity kit, shower gel, shower cap, shavers etc etc....so this is where it ends for me. And with all this poor service, no doubt the cleaner leaves the envelope for a tip.....

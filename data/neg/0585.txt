We stayed at Sixth Avenue Inn two-nights for a Michael Buble Easter concert. Unfortunately when we arrived, the hotel had given us two single-bed rooms instead of ones with two-queen beds. The room director had said that 3rd party companies promise a room-type, when in fact it's just a room-request -- actual availability can only be guaranteed by the Hotel. We've booked via companies like Priceline, Expedia, Travelocity and hotwire for 10 years and have never had this excuse given to us; besides, when the invoice specifically stated that we had selected a room with two-queen beds as opposed to one, it really is not supposed to be the customer's problem to deal with. Because the Sakura-con Anime convention was happening that same weekend, the entire hotel was booked solid. Management had offered us roll-away beds, but room service ran it up to the wrong suite. Since our key-cards kept demagnetizing, we ended up taking several trips to verify this. In the end, they refunded us one day's parking fee for our troubles ($15) after some lengthy discussion at the front-desk. Location was nice, within blocks to dining (Dahlia Lounge/Lola/Pacific Kitchen) and about sixth blocks walk to Pike's Market/shopping. There is a Mcdonald's right across the street for convenience. However, our rooms were facing a strip club next door. Walls & windows weren't insulated enough -- We could hear outside ambulance/police sirens, and talking/speaking in the hallways. Having seen four rooms, we found that there was inconsistency in how the rooms were setup: some had fridges while some didn't, some had different placements for AC plugs, and all had three pillows per bed (not four) Parking is $15 for downtown, about standard. Free internet wifi was a plus. Primarily due to the hotel booking mixup, we will not be staying here and advise our friends/family to avoid this hotel in their Seattle stays. There are simply too many other options elsewhere downtown to overlook this experience.

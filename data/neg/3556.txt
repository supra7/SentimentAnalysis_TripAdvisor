Booked a three night stay here on Expedia. The rates were good and this hotel was conveniently located. First impression was that the lobby was a little run down, then it got worse. The lamp shades on the bedside lamps were broken. The control for the hot/cold water on the tub was falling off and there was no hot water in the tub that evening. The next morning, still no hot water in the tub. Called maintenance. They worked on my bathroom for a while and then I had 1 minute of hot water. That evening I changed rooms. Also had broken lamp shades and no hot water. Changed rooms again. The third night the restaurant had no hot food because there was a gas leak in the kitchen. Also, no hot water. They had to jack-hammer the cement floor to repair the gas line and the entire hotel shook. At midnight I had had enough. I had to pack up and move to another hotel.

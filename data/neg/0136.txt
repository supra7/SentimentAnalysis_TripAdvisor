We wanted to stay close to the city, that is why we had chosen this hotel. The location was really good, but the rest really was not. We are not so demanding guests, but what we have experienced here, was really a bad dream. The hotel seemed nice from outside, but then everything relieved. Dirty bathroom, no breakfast (only coffee and tea!), dirty room. What was the worst - we have realized next day in the morning- there was some flea in the bed, so we had more than 40 stings all over our bodies! If you have to stay in Seattle, please look for a better hotel!

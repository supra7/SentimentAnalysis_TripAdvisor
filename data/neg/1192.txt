Awful time in Seattle Hotel was below standard. No air conditioning. Noisy. We were first booked into a room that somebody was already in. Then we were not registered correctly and thought to be checked out. The room was not cleaned and supplied with fresh towels and toiletries. On our second night our room was booked to someone else, while we were in it. Very poor service and very poor management. Very disappointed by the whole experience.

My child was in chop for 6 weeks.I spent my first two weeks at the Sheraton and Penn tower.Both were very disappointing to say the least. The Penn Tower was awful.The staff was rude...snide and non accomodating.The whole place was weird I felt like I was in the Twilight zone.It is old and stinky!! My child was dying in the children's hosp. and these people treated me so bad....Overpriced and disgusting! NO way would I stay there again. There should be a law againest this type of place...highway robbery!!!!! There is no wi fi and no amenities no room service or anything! I need towels and I had to wake up the sleeping clerk to get me some haha!!! I had no choice but to stay there.

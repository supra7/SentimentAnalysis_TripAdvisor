We just came back from TresRios. It truly is a beautiful place, a little maze like, but well appointed, clean with a service staff (waiters, barmen, service people) that were just delightful. BUT, as many people have said, they attack you upon registering to buy this, buy that, get this, get that, take their sales tour, etc. My answer is NO. I also said no to an outrageous all-inclusive price. Well, we became 2nd class citizens... their food prices make the fine restaurants in New York City that I frequent look like the corner diners in 1950. They should be ashamed of themselves. Another issue is the quality of the staff in the lobby (we're talking about anyone behind a desk). Poor doesn't quite fit. NO one either knew any answers or gave us wrong answers or misleading answers or contradictory answers. As good at the outside people were are as bad as the inside people are. I would not recommend this hotel, nor would I come pack...

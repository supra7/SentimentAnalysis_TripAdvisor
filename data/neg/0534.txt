Where do I start. I used my SPG points since I have a few of them being a gold member and all. You'd think that would get you some free perks. I was expecting free breakfast. Wrong. Ok, maybe free crib... wrong again. Free microwave for warming baby bottles... wrong again $30 a night. Free parking... nope, add $33.xx a night. Ok at least it's a free night... nope, wrong again... they have the nerve to charge me $56 a night for the option to use my points for a "free night". So my so called "free nights" ended up costing me over $200. You'd think they'd mention the $56 a night charge for the free nights up front when booking the room or AT LEAST when checking in. Nope, not until you get the bill. Is this even legal? Bill someone without mentioning a price beforehand? We'll see how well my credit card company agrees with this disputed charge. One last thing, if you plan to stay here, have a pocket full of singles to tip every employee who touches your bag or car. These are the sorts of things you don't count on when making a booking. In cases like this you may be better off staying outside of town and using Priceline.

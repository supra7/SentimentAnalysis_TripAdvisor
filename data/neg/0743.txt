We have stayed more than 5 times at this property now and my last stay on March 1st was extremely terrible. We were given room which had very bad smoking smell and then we were told that bell boy will help us change rooms but they made us stay for almost another 30-45 minutes in the same room. This was extremely dissappointing and since my business takes me to Seattle, I might have to consider another hotel in Seattle downtown.

This place is huge! Over 800 rooms - probably over 1500 people when we were there - we completely misjudged this place. Normally we enjoy boutique hotels, but there either aren't any on Maui or they are very difficult to find. The resort charges a 'resort tax' of $25 per night - a rip off that doesn't appear in hotel pricing searches. It's compulsory - so why not include it in the rate and be upfront about it? They all seem to do it. Having been to Anaheim years back with the kids, it reminded me of the hotel there. Teaming with people, tables, chairs, lounges so close to each other you know all about your neighbour's lives by the end of dinner/lunch/sunbathing. And.... to get a lounge chair in the shade, you have rent a cabana or a lounge chair on the lawn - for either $100 or $50 a day - on top on the 'resort tax'! The 'partial ocean view' we booked and paid extra for overlooked the roof of a building and we could only glimpse the ocean by standing on the tiny balcony (next to the air conditioning compressor!) and straining a look to the right - about 300 m away. Unfair advertising. We checked out other resorts to move to, but we ended up spending less time there rather than the hassle of moving. Renting a car gave us external options.

1.The front desk is rude, the phone was more important than the guests waiting in line. Very unhelpful and uninformed.Or just plain dumb. 2. The room is very small. Not worth the price. 3. At 4am on a Sat. the fire alarm went off. Walked down 12 flights and was told it was a false alarm and that it would be a long time before elevator service would be restored. No sooner did I get back to my room, after walking up 12 flights, the fire alarm went off again. Repeated the whole process again. Finally got to bed around 6:30. When I went to complain to the manager in the morning I was told he won't be in till Tuesday. Checked out and went to the Marriott- great hotel. 4. It may be cheaper than other hotels in the area. BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! Which isn't much. Not even a good nights rest. AVOID!!

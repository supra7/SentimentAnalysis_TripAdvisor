This property should be dropped like a hot potato by Hilton. The only good thing it has going is the staff. Most of them are amazing. But the property is in major disrepair and needs extreme updating. It is in a prime location, but is also run down and not as clean as it should be. See the pictures...I never attach pictures, but this time it was a must.

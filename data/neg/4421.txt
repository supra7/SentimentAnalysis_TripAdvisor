As stayed in this hotel April 2011 I got lice as a souvenir. Did I got it from the hotel? It is very much possible, but I can not be sure of it. Room 105. I hope you at the hotel management read this message and please do just about everything you can. Location of this hotel is perfect in Barcelona. I got very very good service at all times. Thank you everyone at the reception. You have been most kind and helpful staff I have seen and met during my holidays. We did have lots of problems with air conditon during our stay at the hotel. It was weekend, and all the machines stopped working after our first night. It was terribly hot in our rooms. We could hardly breath in the room. Staff at the reception couldnt do enything for it, which I understand. Someone who was resposile for that, was not working for the weekend. That was something I do not understand, as payed fully price for the room. Tip number one: please get someone esle to do it as next time will come. Hotel itself was nice and very nicely decorated. Size of the room was good. Bathroom was tidy and very large. I would say it was in a very quiet area, allthough we had some noisy neighbours... group of men shouting at three o`clock shouting the morning in our neigbouring room (106?). Drunk, very drunk. All of them. But thats what people di in their holidays, so what can you possibly do? other than compalin abbout it in the mornig... Breakfast was in a level of reasonable. Not very exciting, but ok. Would I come back? Possibly not. Reason is simple - lice. Barcelona is really a nice city, I loved it.

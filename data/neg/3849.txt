As other reviewers have noted, this hotel has a great location, especially in the winter because there is a skywalk to the Prudential Center, a major shopping mall with some mid-range restaurants (e.g. Cheesecake Factory). But we had major mold in our room. We stayed on the top floor, which was billed as being a perk when we checked in. When we got off the elevator, the smell of scented room spray was overwhelming. It got worse when we opened the door to our room. The ceiling had been patched for a water leak. Within two hours my husband had respiratory problems, extreme fatigue, aches and pains. A day later, after three inches of snow, water was streaming out of the ceiling in the hallway and the staff had put out four waist-height trash cans to collect it! Clearly, this is an ongoing problem and we now realize the room spray was to cover up a musty odor from mold. We had just joined the Marriott Points program. The joke was on us. Never again. (You can also use the skywalk from the Westin).

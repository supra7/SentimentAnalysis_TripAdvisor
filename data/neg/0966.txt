Whew, this place was bad. The pool had such a scum on it that I wouldn't let my kids in it, the whole place smelled, and in the middle of the night drunken guests called my room and made obscene comments. I was literally scared of this place, and when I reported it to the desk, they just said they couldn't stop the calls because they were coming from within the building. Sounds like the beginning of a teen horror movie, doesn't it?

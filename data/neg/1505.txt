This property will not "wow" you. We had great weather, a nice time, enjoyed the beaches - but would never return to this hotel. We love this area and will return but to different accommodations. PROS: GOOD ROOM with great beds, nice towels, nice showers - both indoor and outdoor Decent Beach CONS: FOOD: First: they "claim" to have three restaurants - they have one with three poor menus. The restaurant is sectioned off into three seating areas where they serve each cuisine. Second: this chef tries to be "fancy" and ruins EVERYTHING. He tries to be Jose Andres (yumm) and uses Molecular Gastronomy but uses it SO poorly that it ruins the dishes. He will make "foam" and put it on toasted white bread - it looks impressive but taste like soggy wet toast. Third: the menus stay the same - so you will have the SAME choices of poor food (asian, mexican and italian) over and over again. Also all the ingredients are recycled - you know what they have "bought" for the week because every menu will feature the same ingredients regardless of if you order breakfast, lunch, asian, mexican or italian. Fourth: we were truly looking forward to having a healthy trip with fresh fruit and veggies - but they don't have that. They use low quality food. The fruit they serve is Honey Dew, Grapes - you will not find any fresh berries in site. Fifth: you will enjoy this food if you eat at Chilies, Cocos, national chain restaurants. GYM: it's small and poorly equipt POOLS: NO POOL ARE HEATED - the water is very cold. The private infinity pools aren't heated either. The only pool which is heated in the small 2 feed deep water outside the swim-ups. This, however, is heated by a wood burning brick oven outside casitas #8. This heater is inefficient AND they SMELL (terribly smell the property especially the #800 rooms) BUGS: if you are sweet they will bite you to death.

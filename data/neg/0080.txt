i made reservations and when i showed up, i quickly started laughing at how pathetic is was. first, they didnt even have parking near the hotel. second, i asked if they had wi-fi and they replied enthusiastically," we have it in the lobby!" how is that even a perk? finally, i said screw this place for these rates and left. the manager offered other places and followed me to the door. the next day, they charged me for the reserved room and said that i was a no show! the people are rude and have not given my money back yet. they should post their business as a motel at the very least! all i can say is never again!

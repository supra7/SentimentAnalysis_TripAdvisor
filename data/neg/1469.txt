Never again! Appaling service, no room reserved, despite having written confirmation and had checked our accomadation the previous week when we had been shown our room. Extremly rude reception, very unprofessional behaviour to say the very least. Rooms were average while very dark and noisy. Breakfeast dreadful. The hotels best feature was its location and its worst feature its staff.

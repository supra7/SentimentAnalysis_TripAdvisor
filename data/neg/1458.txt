I booked this hotel online for one night before leaving on cruise and when I arrived after a long journey I was told they had no rooms available but that they can find me another hotel "close" by. I had no choice but to take it because i was exausted and needed to shower and rest. When I arrived to the hotel the hotel was nice yes but a 15 minute bus ride away from the center. The purpose of me choosing hotel trevi was for location because I was there one night only! I didnt stay at the hotel I was sent to. Went online and booked another hotel at the center that was much more expensive and out of my budget. The man at front desk at hotel trevi tried to act like he was nice but It was all a act and he was rude trying to keep me seated in the waiting area so that other guest would not be informed of what was going on. He quickly rushed me out of there and lied and said the other hotel was close by. I just tried to get a refund and the hotel manager refuses to refund me only because I was offered another hotel. Yeah another hotel that I did not stay in or choose to stay in. This hotel a great location but I dont think they handled my problem correctly. I understand thing like this can happen but to want to keep my money and not refund it IS WRONG!

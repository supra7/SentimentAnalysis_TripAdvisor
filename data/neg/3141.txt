I had the misfortune of being booked in by my company for an overnight stay after our Christmas Party. It starts out hard to find as there is another Pacific International(Apartments)down the road and if you park for this you are subject to carrying luggage 15 minutes back up the road. Once we knew where to go there are parking stations quite close at A$15 per night. Check In was OK but I had booked a smoking room and was advised the whole hotel was non smoking. Arriving in the room was a real let down. Bad lighting, aged and worn furniture and a musty smell that could not escape as the windows can't be opened.The air conditioner had a rattle that was fixed with a couple of hits. The room was tiny as was the double bed, my feet hung over the edge. It was so dismal that we forsake the bottle of wine we brought and went to the bar which is quite good. Upon returning after the party we had a reasonable sleep until 4AM when numerous young men returned to next door which highlighted paper thin walls. The bathroom was as big as the room but had no shower screen and water pressure and temperature were a problem and the toilet leaked. Breakfast is A$11 per person and upon arriving we were sent back to reception to buy a ticket before entering the area and they were reluctant to add this to the room and requested cash. The breakfast was not to my liking, cold bacon, no serviettes, the orange juice was empty and this was only fixed after making a complaint. All in all I would never stay here again whatever the circumstance as there are far better and cheaper hotels closer to the main attractions.

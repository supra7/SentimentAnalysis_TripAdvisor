Hotel located close enough to the French Quarters but far enough away to avoid Bourbon's nightly "freaks". Pros: helpful hotel staff, decent rate, wide variety of breakfast foods, secured parking Cons: very small rooms, extremely small shower (forget shaving your legs), paper thin walls (couple next door know what we mean), room temperature very cold at night, and last but not least.......BED BUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I woke up after our second night with 3 bites on my ankle and two on my leg. Will opt to stay elsewhere next time we visit.

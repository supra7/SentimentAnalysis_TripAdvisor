I have stayed in hotels all over world and this was one of the worst experiences, and that is rating this hotel against much cheaper ones. We only stayed one night and had so many issues. My patience was def tested at this hotel at the incompetence incurred. Firstly our room smelt of smoke so they had to come spray the room, then there wasnt a hairdryer so they came and provided that, then the tv didn't work so they they had to come fix that, then we paid for valet at $27 for our car to be returned with bird droppings all over it. Wait it gets better! Then upon check out our bill was suppose to be for $320 but they charged $388, they claimed it was a hold authorization...I've never had a hotel do that upon checkout. They finally corrected that charge, but now 2 days later they have charged a separate additional charge of $121! So I called AGAIN to ask why, they said it was for mini bar. We went out for dinner and then straight to sleep, then left early in morning bc construction noise woke us up, so we didn't have time to eat anything from mini bar. Plus my husband doesn't drink and I'm 6 mths pregnant, so pretty sure we didn't access any alcohol at the mini bar. They havent offered any sort of compensation or lousy apology. Still waiting for this latest issue to be resolved after being trf to 3 ppl at the hotel. Absolutely ridiculous service for any hotel let alone one u pay $300+ a night for. Save yourself the trouble and stay elsewhere. I'm spending more time sorting out issues than the time we spent in the room. I've never written a review but want to save ppl this drama, thanks the joule for totally ruining our first wedding anniversary!!!

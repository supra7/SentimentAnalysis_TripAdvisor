ARG! How this overall ranked as 3 stars is completely beyond me. As I was checking in, rats were climbing all over the counter squeaking for a refund. Ok, no real rats. Nor bugs that I noticed, but for the love of Seattle, this place was a DUMP. Where to begin the street level parking is awful. The underground was horrible as well. The room was the size of 3 closets put together. The one elevator with buttons from 1912 was scary. The staff was incredibly unhelpful. There was no breakfast. The bathroomoh GOD the bathroom was small, old, disgusting, dirty and full of hair and rust - no joke! There was no Kleenex in the place. The bed was hard and scary. Thank goodness there were three locks on the doors because the place didnt seem secure. Now, its in a great neighborhood, and the views were very good of both downtown and the space needle. Its on the Monorail, but be prepared to walk  mile one way or another to board it. It has a reasonable price. Butwhat I had to experience there, was not worth $10. The ONE-WAY ramp into the underground parking was so narrow, Im surprised a scooter could make it. And even then, youll have to back up, move forward, back up a few times to get into a spot. Again, I liked the neighborhood and area, and the price was okay, but dear Lord, I worried about all the contents of my car the entire stay I had there  I was moving to Seattle and had all my belongings in my vehicle. And equally, I could NOT stand the disgusting bathroom or the free Wi-Fi that only worked one of my two nights there. The only reason I didnt move out after 1 night, was because the price only matched hotels 20 miles away from downtown and thats where I needed to stay. Please, PLEASE, do not stay here. If you care about your belongings, your sanity, your security, your cleanliness or your well being, you will avoid this place like the plague it is.

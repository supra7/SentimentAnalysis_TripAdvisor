I really wanted to give Belltown Inn a good review but they really screwed up our stay. So even if the hotel is a good value for money, nicely located, has free bikes to use, etc. they couldn't even make sure that we had a working toilet in our room. First morning we wake up, toilet is overflowing. We call downstairs and it takes them about 2 hours to finally get a maintenance guy and cleaners in to clean up the mess. By the time we get out of the hotel to go for breakfast, I tell the receptionist that it doesn't seem like the toilet is functioning properly despite the maintenance intervention so could she send the maintenance guy to have a look at it again while we're out for the day. We get back at the hotel around 7 pm and I ask if the maintenance guy has checked our toilet, the receptionist tells us that there is no request slip there, so it must have been done. Next morning, the same lovely surprise with the toilet. Basically the hotel had completely ignored the request to make sure that the toilet work was working properly and we had two ruined mornings instead of one. As I said in the beginning, I really wanted to give this hotel a good review but by the way the handled the toilet problem, they basically ruined part of our stay in Seattle.

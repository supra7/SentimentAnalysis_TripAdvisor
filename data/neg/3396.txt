Antique analog tv, burn holes in linens, no pay per view, 70's dated atmosphere/decor. We checked out and went to the Hilton the next day since the rates were the same. I think they forgot about the 3rd floor when they redecorated. Breakfast was the only good asset which was good as the only close place to eat was Jack in the Box.

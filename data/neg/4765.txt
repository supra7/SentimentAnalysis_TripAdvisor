This was a Friday night stay therefore a part of the weekend deal and not the rushing weekday business travellers... So on Saturday morning the housekeeper on our 21st floor of the North Tower came and loudly "rapped" on our room door with a key or other hard object yelling HOUSKEEPING. We had not set our alarm but had suddenly been awakened at 8:30am at a hotel that has a 12 Oclock check out time on Saturdays. I had NOT checked out, so surely I was NOT on the list that most housekeepers start with... No, as I lay in bed rudely awakened, I could clearly hear this housekeeper go to the room next door and proceed to rap on this door as she did in sequence with all rooms on my floor. Forward to 9:45am I am again suddenly awakened by the constant SLAM!! (of the room door, next door) Over and over, every 1 to 2 mins SLAM!!! So I get up and look, and guess who? HOUSKEEPING!!! In short, my review of this hotel is that when you consider; the management who did not process my bill correctly, the dominating HOUSKEEPING staff that ruined a relaxing weekend for me and my wife, you should stay away on weekends. Although the fantastic DRAFT lounge in the hotel does warrant a visit do so while staying/relaxing and getting a correct bill at a hotel next door!

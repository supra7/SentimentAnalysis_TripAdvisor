Booked online for 4 nights on hotel web-site starting from the 3rd of January, 2012. Upon arrival, noted overpowering smell of air freshener in the lobby. Check-in reception allocated us Room 1011, apparently one of their Business Rooms. Upon entering the room, found false eye-lashes from previous guest in bath-tub...disgusting. Poorly designed bathroom door spontaneously opens outwards. No way to close the door from outside the bathroom. Bathroom fixtures flimsy with exposed pipework. Bedside lamp faulty, pillows hard and thick, poor TV reception, only 1 pair of slippers and 1 bathrobe for 2 guests. Bathrobe stained and frayed. Curtains have gaps and walls are thin enough to hear neighbors having a shower or talking. Newspaper delivery erratic. Air-conditioning vent vanes pointing directly at the bed and not adjustable. So one either turns the air-con on and freezes or turn it off and bakes. Check-out staff communicated with male guest only, female guest made to feel invisible even though she was settling the account using her credit card. In summation, this hotel is overrated. It unfortunately makes the short-list as one of the most tackiest hotels I've stayed in. Will try somewhere else when next in Singapore.

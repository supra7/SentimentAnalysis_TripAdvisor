I don't leave reviews -- positive or negative -- very often. But I feel in this case, owing especially to the noble history of the Palmer House, that an exception is merited. Our family of four stayed there on the 10th floor just one night (August 7, 2009) and found the hotel is efficient only in service to its bottom line, and not to service. In other hotels (even the lowliest of mo-tels, for chrissakes), there would've been wireless or at least a phone book at my disposal. Neither is available to Palmer House guests, who are forced to trudge to the over-burdened concierge desk -- where the lines are Soviet in length -- for even the most mundane travel-related information. This arrangement is exemplary of Palmer House tactics which seek (apparently) to herd compliant guests into an utterly dependent relationship with hotel services. Yes, there was mildew in the bathroom, too. But I'd be inclined to excuse that (owing to the building's age) if only some enlightened attention were paid to guests. Mind you, every employee I met was courteous to the extreme. And yet, they were emasculated by -- who knows what, really -- but presumably by corporate attention to the bottom line. Everyone was friendly, but ineffectual, therefore. The fact I'm forced to waste my time now in addition to my money previously adds insult to injury. But so be it: I feel it's my responsibility as a considerate human being to warn others. Too bad Palmer House management doesn't take the notion of hospitality as seriously as do I; which is ironic considering the fact my own professional orientation is quite unrelated.

The location of the Inn at the Market was great, right by the water and the Pike Street Market. We had a free upgrade to a waterfront room our first night at the Inn. The bellhops were great, and the front desk staff were very warm and inviting. However, the $35 dollars a day seemed a bit steep for valet parking (albeit the staff was very prompt in pulling our car up); was hoping there would be a cheaper parking alternative near by. However, when we checked out of the hotel (after a 3 day stay) we left our netbook, in a case, on the bed of the room. We did not realize it was gone till later in the day,but came rushing back to get it when we did. The laptop NEVER made it out of our room in our possession. It's "lost" and we are $600+ dollars in the hole. The staff made every attempt to find it, searching lost and found, the safe, sending out an e-mail to all staff etc. But we honestly feel it may have been taken from the room by housekeeping. We left very disheartened and angry. I have a feeling we won't be getting it back and someone has a nice new password protected netbook, (among other things in the netbook case) that they are going to have to reformat to be able to use. I called back to follow up with the manager once we returned. She said nothing was turned in. Also, she suggested I call the Washington State Ferry lost and found. I did, with no avail. I know the laptop never made it on the ferry, because it never made it to our car.

Following a mix up on the hotels part (which they refused to admit to), we were shunted into a room with no en-suite, a very uneven floor and a window that didn't lock shut. The (one) shower, shared with several other rooms was more of a dribble and the sink in the toilet was partially hanging off wall above all the broken floor tiles. In the morning there was no toilet roll and no staff to be found. Hotel was clean, but there is nothing else positive I can say about it. Considering Argyll Street and the square is crammed full of hotels, there are plenty of other hotels that can only be far nicer than this one. I would recommend avoiding this hotel at all cost!

Really all a hotel has to be is clean. For this place I can look past the very rude front desk, the ridiculous $5 a day parking fee, slow elevators, and even the poorly done patch work but it was not clean! Bathroom looked it had not been cleaned for a long while. The floor and shower was dirty and had hair everywhere. The shower curtains were covered in mold and there was all kinds of hairs covering the sheet at the head of one of our beds. I didn't dare walk on the floor without shoes. The lobby was nice enough and the location was great but not worth staying here. NOT a 3 star hotel by any standards.

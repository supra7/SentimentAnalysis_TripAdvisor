I booked my 'comfy king' room over 2 months in advance and was placed in a dungeon. The hotel's description of a comfy king includes 'a half wall of floor to ceiling windows' and the only window we had was on the door to the small balcony. There was no where to put clothes other than the hangers in the closet so we had to keep everything in the suitcase in the already cramped room. The 'free breakfast' is actually a $10 voucher towards breakfast, which would be fine if they did not advertise it as a FREE BREAKFAST. Service in the restaurant was horrible. we had to ask for things multiple times from multiple people. The 'Complimentary Wine Tasting' was comical as well. It was entertaining to watch the bartender and a person whom appeared to be the restaurant manager scramble to try and find the cheapest wines to pour during this hour, I must have been there on the busiest day they have ever had because they were running in circles. The phones in the room did not work, the staff was fairly friendly but unattentive until our checkout day when I had recieved a late checkout and the maid knocked on the door twice and I got a phone call, which was hard to answer because you had to try and find a phone that actually worked. I told both individuals that I was told I could checkout late and the lady on the phone stated that there were no late checkout that day and when would I be ready to leave. Ha, I told her I would be ready at 2pm like I had agreed upon with whomever gave me a late checkout and hung up the phone. There are other hotels in Chicago that I would go to before I go back to the Dana Hotel and spa. It is a nice hotel aesthetically but way too much attitude and terrible service in my opinion. ( I did go during a very busy time in Chicago so you may have a different experience if no one is at the hotel since they staff it the same way regardless it seems)

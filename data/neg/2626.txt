We stayed here for 3 nights in March 2012. The hotel was nice and modern, the room and bathroom very clean and simply furnished but the service and facilities were atrocious. Although I spoke basic spanish, the staff (except for Carlos & Bea) were unbelievably unwilling to help, you almost knew in the end that every question you asked would be answered with 'no'. There is no currency exchange (except for Euro to Euro - not sure why you would want to change Euro for Euros?), the menu in the restaurant has a ridiculously limited choice and the food is bland and uninteresting. The service in the restaurant is shockingly bad and noticeably unhelpful. One evening my husband came in for a coffee at 11.30pm after watching Barcelona play Granada at Nou Camp Stadium in the freezing cold. We rang the bell on our table for service and were completed ignored by this older guy who seemed to run the kitchen and bar/coffee area. He served another table who arrived at the same time. When he ignored us, I said "Excuse me", he walked away from me, went to the kitchen door, turned around and said "Cerrado (closed)" and turned all the lights off!! I could of understood it if we had been drinking or noisy but we were stone cold sobre! Reception staff also gave us copious amounts of totally inaccurate tourist information. Beware this is a very poor excuse for a 4 star hotel.

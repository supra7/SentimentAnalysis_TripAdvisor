The ka'anapali beach hotel is highly recommended here in trip advisor as a great hotel however I was less than impressed when we arrived. Our room although huge with a big bed , lots of space etc but it smelled musty and damp. A smell I just could not shake throughout our 4 nights there. I am rather sensitive to smells so I was uncomfortable the whole time. I know its not about the room however it is meant to be our home away from home and i don't like a smelly home! sorry about that. Also although there is a huge room there was no kitchen facilities at all. would have been nice to have nice cutlery and glasses , a microwave on another note AT LEAST it was in a great location. If you just want to hang at the beach and have a very quiet relaxing holiday this is for you. Unfortunately hubby and I like the hustle and bustle of waikiki - beach and shopping!

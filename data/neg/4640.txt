My wife and I left in a hurry last night and stayed somewhere nicer down the street. We were here for a total of 2 nights and saw 3 rats (two outside the building and one inside). Absolutely disgusting! I know a large metro area like Chicago has it's problems but to see a rat inside the building is inexcusable! We saw the rat on the third floor as we were taking our morning walk. Then, later on that night as we left for dinner we saw two more while waiting 10-15 minutes for our cab. I spoke to the front desk and they informed me that they have had a rat problem for awhile (that makes me feel better!). Avoid this hotel like the plague, which you just might get if a rat bites you!

Worst hotel i have stayed in. Only good thing was the location They completely overcharged us for the rooms. These rooms were tiny and cramped and the walls were so thin you could hear people using the bathroom next to us. There was construction being done one night and we could hear loud banging for most of the night. We called down 5 times as well as went down in person to ask them to make the banging stop The staff was unprofessional and extremely rude. They yelled at us when we complained about the banging Do not stay here.

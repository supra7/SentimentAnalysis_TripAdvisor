We booked this "hotel" for our 3 night stay in Seattle mostly because of the price. We certainly got what we paid for. Dark, dingy hallways with a weird smell and stained carpets, the same 3 cigarette butts and crushed red Lifesaver on the outside steps the whole time we were there, the key card was hit and miss, the ugly, ugly hot tub area at the opposite end of the building from the pool, thanks, that's very handy. Now for the room: it's quite large, so that was good, but we were put right next to the stairwell so we could hear people going up and down at all hours, the air-con was soooo loud there was no way to sleep with it on so we had to open the window and listen to the street noise and people checking in at 2 am. First day I pulled back the bed looking for an outlet for my laptop and there was a pile of goldfish crackers that had been there for who knows how long. The sheets on one of the beds was torn and the towels were frayed. The continental "breakfast" was horrible, and they were out of orange juice 2 of the 3 mornings we were there. And now, I have saved the best two things for last: the fuse for the room would blow each morning while I dried my hair. I guess we were foolish to think I could dry my hair with the TV and one light on. And finally, the shower would fluctuate from scalding hot to freezing cold every shower, every time. We were nervous for our young son to take a shower for fear he would burn himself. I think the shower thing bothered us most of all. For compensation from the front desk we got a paltry $30 taken off our bill. I guess the location is good if you need to be near the University or the hospital, but for us it was a bit of a trek to the downtown area. So folks, consider yourself warned!! Thanks Travelodge for being a memorable part of our visit to Seattle,

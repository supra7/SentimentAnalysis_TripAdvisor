Free wifi. Speed is enough if you are using mobile where you can open 1 page at a time. There are 4 accessible bus stops that goes to different locations in Singapore. Nearest bus stop is 2mins away. Taxi is abundant because of its location, red light district. The lady receptionists are nice. The Indian staff/room boy is always ready with a smile on his face. Room looks like newly renovated. One male receptionist which I've seen only once when I have request like fresh towels and taking out the garbage slammed the phone down on me and was rude while taking my request. Rooms at the 7th floor are noisy. Last 2 days of our stay hot water run out. When we have it checked and also request for housekeeping before we go out, they didn't do anything about it. This hotel is good only for overnight booking they don't have enough storage. Bad cable reception. Less than 15 channels.

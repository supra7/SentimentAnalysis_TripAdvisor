We reserved room 611 for the nights of July 25-26, 2005. We arrived on 7-25 as expected and found our room waiting. It was nice, clean and comfortable. My wife was having brain aneurism surgery on the morning of 7-26, so we left early. My son had driven in that morning and we were going to use the same room that night. He was replacing my wife as she was in ICU. At 11:45 am we called to make sure the room was available and we were told it was all ready for us. That evening we left the ICU and got back to the room about 10:30 PM. We immediately found someone else in our room (611). The desk was very helpful and tried to find us a room in another hotel to no avail. A lady assisted the clerk and located a room in the hotel that no one was using (604). We waited for it to be cleaned. She came back and said she would 'comp' the room to us for the night of 7-26 since they had given our original room away. She then said they would hold that room for us since my wife was to be released on 7-27 and the hospital wanted us to stay in Seattle one more night before returning to our home in Spokane, Wa. We would pay for the 2nd night in room 604. My wife was released from ICU at 7:30 PM. We started for our room, but just to be safe, I called ahead only to learn that it too had been given to someone else during the day. The same lady that had saved it for us was the one I talked to. Again, she was very nice and apologized, but we had no room. We were asked to come over and they would see if there was anything they could do about locating something else since they were full. At this point with my wife hurting and in need of a place to stay, we decided to head east toward home and see if we could locate something else which we finally did...in Ellensburg. Fool me once, shame on you...Fool me twice, shame on me!

This is a nice buidling, with a great lobby. The rooms are fine, but reflect they were built in a different era (which has both good and bad effects). However, the reason for the poor rating is the fact that the hotel gouges its guests (and, sorry, but there is no other way to put it). I travel often for both business and leisure and have gotten used to the piling on of fees (resort fees, internet fees, gym fees, etc...). But this place takes it to a new level. I arrived at noon. Normal check-in time is 3 pm. As I typically do, I asked if I there was an available room I could check into. They said there was, but that because it was prior to 1 pm there would be a $25 "early check-in" fee. I've never heard of such a fee and it doesn't make sense. If a room in the category I paid for is available whenever I check in, they ought to let me have it without requiring a fee. I used the gym (decent, but not equal to a full gym) and was surprised to be hit with an $18 fee. That is the highest I've had to pay. Not only is there no free internet, but the fee they charge is the highest I've ever seen. I do not recommend this hotel. Hilton ought to know better than to gouge guests like this.

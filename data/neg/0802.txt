I can't believe that I had to pay $15 to write this review!! What year is it 1991? I mean, I thought Seattle was the hub of technology? I am blown away by this. Room seems nice and the location is right in the heart of it, but NO FREE INTERNET!! Plus, I am connected to the wall here- where's the wifi????? Totally bogus, I expect more for my dollar and from the Westin name. Good Night.

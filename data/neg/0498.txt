BAD EXPERIENCE! We purchased a Seattle Tour Saver, partly because of a 2 for 1 coupon for this hotel. The coupon states it for a value UP TO $197.98. When I attempted to reserve a room using the coupon the very polite young people answering the phone referred me to the manager, Heather Patrick. I told Ms. Patrick I wanted to use my coupon for the room at $89.99 per night listed in their hotel website. She said the price of the room would be $197.98 and with 2 for 1 coupon it would be $89.99 per nite. When I questioned this logic, she rudely told me to take it or leave it. Stay away from this hotel. If we are treated this rudely on the phone what would the hotel experience be?

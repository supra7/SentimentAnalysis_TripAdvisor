Husband and I went to Boston to celebrate our wedding anniversary and stayed at the Fairmont Copley Plaza and we will definitely not return. We had the King Fairmont room and was so disappointed at the size of the room. Besides the bed and a writing desk, there is no space left, not even an armchair to sit on. My husband stayed there during the week for business at the gold room and I flew in to join him for the weekend where we booked the Fairmont King room. My husband asked the staff if there is anything they can do for us since we are celebrating our anniversary there and they had nothing. Dined at the Oak Bar for lunch, sat down, and waited for 5-10 min each time to get greeted by a server and to get a glass of water. Awful awful service. There's some kind of construction going on across the hallway from our room as well... I heard knocking and drilling during the day in the room. When we check out, some charges on bar and snack showed up on the bill which we didn't consume. Talked to front desk and they took that off. The location of the hotel is excellent, but if you're paying that kind of money, stay somewhere else.

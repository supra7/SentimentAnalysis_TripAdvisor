The view from the room of the Space Center was nice, the balconies, nice, but overall the price and lack of security makes this hotel, in my opinion one of the most unsafe. We had an issue with an ex s/o continuously finding his ways back into locked rooms after key cards had been changed. Security did a half hearted attempt to look around the room and failed to find the intruder twice. After notification of the front desk the response was not prompt, and only after several completely frightening experiences and numerous phone calls were the police called. The hotel overall is old, so understandably outdated, but the beds were not comfortable and housekeeping not prompt. The happy hour was great, but otherwise the food extremely overpriced for what was served. Because of the situation with the lack of security I was too frightenend to leave my room for the remainder of the trip, resulting in ruining my only free day to explore Seattle. The manager was aware and while apologetic, there was no followup of the result of the lack of security, nor any incentives for us to come back. Just cold reception. Save your money, there are plenty of other hotels in this area that are updated, safer, and offer an equally pleasant view.

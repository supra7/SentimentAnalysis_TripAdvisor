Just a quick stop in Seattle on my way to Canada. I don't mind using a bathroom/shower down the hall to save a few bucks on a hotel bill. It wouldn't be the first time. But this was the first time I've ever stayed in a "European-style" hotel that didn't even provide bathrobes for the hike to the shower. The towels were like sandpaper. I've seen more luxurious bathrooms in a frat house. My room was tiny and depressing, although it did have a nice view of Puget Sound. Too bad the windows were so filthy...

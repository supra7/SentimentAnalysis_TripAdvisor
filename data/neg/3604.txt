I arrived at the shuttle pick up and sat there for 20 minutes, called and they said they had never been called, that someone would be there in 15 minutes, 30 minutes later the bus drives by and never stops, I call the front desk for the 3rd time and they are non responsive, 1 1/2 hours later they picked us up, no apologies, nothing. The rooms are noisy and they place is run by people that do not care!! Don't stay here!

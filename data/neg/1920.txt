The guy at the desk was ok. The room is sweltering, the sink spews water all over the floor from a leak around the waste pipe. The shower room is wet wall to wall because the door to the shower can't be shut and the floot covered in black dirt. It stinks of cigarets in the hall and there are people shouting drunkenly all night. The slab that you sleep on sort of looks like a bed. The location is excellent. Basically, stay here if you just can't find anywhere else but otherwise, you can probably do a lot better.

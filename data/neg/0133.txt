I never cease to be amazed at hotels that look so nice on-line, but in reality are quite the opposite. This place was so awful it was comedic. How about cigarette butts on the hallway carpets? How about transvestites asking you for a corkscrew at 8:00 am? How about a general "lock up' at night? Do you like broken 1950s plumbing? Do you like 1960s polyester spreads, drapes, carpeting, and uphostery? This place should have been torn down with the majority of the Seattle Worlds Fair buildings in 1962.

I booked this hotel for a one night stay through Priceline.com (which by the way is the last time I will use Priceline). I had requested a smoke free room. When I arrived, not only was the hotel not in a safe part of town, there were some shady type men walking around in the parking area. I get to the "smoke free" room and it's over powering smoke smell immediately gave me a migrane. I turned in my key and told the desk clerk I could not stay there...not only for the smoke smell, but I didn't feel safe in this hotel and area. I went a couple miles down the road to the Days Inn at Canada Road and couldn't have been more pleased! It was wonderful. **Priceline will not refund your money even when they book you a less than standard room****BEWARE OF PRICELINE.COM and the Days Inn at Sycamore!!!

My aunt and me have just returned from our Xmas stay in Rome. As it was my aunt's first trip to Rome I've chosen this hotel to be as centrally as possible. I was really going to recommend the hotel. It is very modern, well furnished, clean. The bathroom had bathtub which is not typical for Italian hotels and was a nice thing to have after a long walking day. Breakfast can be served in the room for no extra charge. Good size plasma TV with the choice of TV programes as well as paid movies. Very pleasant front office staff. The thing that we asked for twin room and got one with one double bed didn't put me off. Neither the aircon which had been apparently switched off for the winter (during our stay in Rome the weather was very warm and we needed aircon rather than heating which made the room as hot as oven). What really surprised and upset me was the false charge for minibar. We didn't even open it to say nothing of drinking stuff from it (I never use minibars especially when you can buy whatever you want in the shop next door and so much cheaper!) Our arguments made no difference - they insisted that we had to pay. So petty and unworthy of a place like that. On top of that we realized we were missing some toiletteries of ours! This is really ridiculous! I'm speachless... Overall, the hotel is nice but be ready to lock all your luggage you leave in the room and count everything in minibar as soon as you are introduced into your room.

I come to Indianapolis frequently for buisness. I often meet at the Holiday Inn on Michigan Ave near the Pyramids. I stopped staying there because of the large number of families with kids who come to the water park there. I chose the Emassy Suites about a 1/4 mile away as an alternative. I have stayed there 4 times. It is undergoing reservations, although their website would never tell you that. As a Hilton Platinum member they put me on the 8th floor where there is hardwired (ethernet) internet access. This is important since their wireless network has significant problems. I found out on subsquent visits that there are some "hardwired" rooms on other floors. If internet is important and you must stay here then request a hardwired room. OK, the rooms, most haven't been updated since early 80's when the hotel was built,. Dirty carpets, small bathrooms, 19 inch TV's. Breakfast is your generic Sysco stuff. I imagine once the renovations are completed this should be an adequate place to stay. For now, on future stays I'll choose of the 2 nearby Hampton Inn's or the Doubletree nearby.

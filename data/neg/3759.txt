Very small rooms. The rooms have not been renovated since it was built ... carpet was the most disgusting I have ever seen. Very nice staff, however, who complained and said that all rooms were in the same state. Poor breakfast with undrinkable coffee. Cheapest bread, cheese, ham etc.. Scrambled eggs made of mix. Internet 9 Euro / h! Four stars ... where they bought them?!

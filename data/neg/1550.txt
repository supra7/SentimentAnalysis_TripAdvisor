I travel extensively for work and leisure (more than half my year is spent in hotels). Also, we are in our early 30's, so we aren't elderly people who need the quiet all the time. I booked this trip as a birthday gift for my husband and was hoping that it would end up a positive trip, but unfortunately, the hotel situation ruined part of the weekend. When we checked in to the hotel things looked great. Directly acorss the street from PetCo and right on the water in Downtown. However, the hotel hallway doors are NOT sound proof and you can hear everything! Literally EVERYTHING. It's awful! We had a room on the 12th floor looking at the bridge. Beautiful view. However, we had early twenty something gang members in the rooms around us (but we couldn't locate the exact rooms to call the front desk) yelling until 4am. We would have said something but they were less than nice and we didn't feel like fearing for our safety. Needless-to-say, we didn't sleep at all and that was tremendously annoying. My recommendation, don't book this hotel when you have a ton of other options around this area. I hear that the other hallway doors are sound proof at this Hilton location, but that was not our experience. I understand that we should have called security, but if you saw these gang members - you wouldn't have said anything either. I am a Hilton Preferred Member and understand what I could have done, but this was just a bad situation and left a bad taste in my mouth for this Hilton location.

MY CONS..... Stayed here with my husband and son, the room had an old smell to it..I even had plug-ins, wipes, and disinfectant spray and the smell would not go away. The shower also didnt work no pressure just a stream. lol, The room was extremely small, The keys would work after about 5 tries at a time. I think for me it was just old and out dated...But that old closed up attick smell was horrible. Oh and the pigeons and crows are everywhere. I felt like I was in an alfred hitchcock film. My goodness! MY PROS..... Now the customer service was great!, Staff was nice, Valet guys were great! The location was great!, The bed was Comfy. The valet to me was worth it, you can come and go as you please and not have to fight traffic looking for parking all for $22.00 per night. I didnt mind that. I loved all the different lounging/sitting options in the hotel. It was a very cozy feel. I wish the hotel room's atmosphere was as comfy as the lounge areas. The receptions was cool, the free cookies and milk, as well as the free spirits at 530 was a nice touch. The breakfast wasnt bad, but the omlette station had a fee, I didnt mind that either. I like the restaraunt nect door, The Iron Cactus, good food, There is a breakfast place within walking distance that has good food at a cheap price. We rented a car and drove around dallas so we were not just limited to the downtown area. For the most part I would recommend this hotel. I personally wouldnt stay there again, now if I absolutelly had to because the overall custer service was great that was worth it. The aquarium is near by, that was great.

This place was a dump. The room was small, beds were uncomfortable & low to the ground, the carpet was gross, the noise from the street was constant and the night stand looked like it was picked up at a garage sale. Sorry we missed the breakfast everyone raves about. It was within walking distance to many sites. College kids would do well here, not recommended for a family stay.

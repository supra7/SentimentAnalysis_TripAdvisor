We stayed at the famed Edgewater Hotel for business and will never return. The cost is not worth the accomodations. We had a leaky gas fireplace which was never fixed - my collegue had a headache the whole trip because of it. We complained to the hotel at the time of checkout and again online direclty to the hotel and never got a response to either. No apology, NOTHING!!!!

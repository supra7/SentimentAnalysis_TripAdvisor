I arrive at the property & ask where could I park when I am checking in they take my keys and park it for me. I get at the front desk and ask for a check in the Men was pretty snob telling me my on a very pretentious tone your room have no water view but I could give me one I reply I am here for a meeting and this is not important to me Thank-You I try to request some information on Parking ( Do you have hourly rate for Parking as I am on a 6 City & 23 days tour I have book a long term parking at the Airport) I was told a a very firm tone I am not the Valet they are over there go & ask them I reply you are the one with my CC in your hand . So I left get to my room and try to rest a bit and then decide to go park the car at the Airport, I leave the car at the Hotel for a hour and the cost was $ 34.00 One of my client from Portland was in Seattle and try to reach me via the front desk and was told there is no one with this name at the Hotel, he e-mail me to ask me to call him on is cell, I call from the hotel to try to set a appointment, first time it is voice mail & second time I reach him the call where under a min. each time for a cost of $40,71 + $1.00 for a local call to another Seattle Client Internet fee $9.95 (when all coffee shop have Free WIFI) All this for a Extra charge of $95.36 The hotel is not bad look like those old Whistler propriety build in the 70s with nature theme but the attitude of the front desk really make me feel bad, I know I do not fit the profile of a business men as I dress casual, my accent do not reflect a very confident person as I try to communicate in English but I do not expect to be treated as if I am nothing by Staff when I paid to be on the property I was very polite & I do not understand why I was treated with such snobbish

We stayed here for our last leg of our honeymoon in Rome. The location is excellent, within walking distance to the major historic sites and good dining. Unfortunately our room was very dirty when we arrived, dust bunnies along the floor, the walls are covered in fabric and were stained and you can see where the leaks ran down from the ceiling. The tiles surrounding the bathtub caulking were mouldy and our bidet leaked. Not sure if it is only our room (room 401) but due to this we will not stay here again. Also the breakfast room is in the basement of the hotel and it is not well kept either. They did not change the table linens between guests so we ate among stained tablecloths.

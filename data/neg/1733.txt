The rooms were clean enough but thats it. In the mornings at 6am there was no hot water. When I called the front desk I was told to let it run for awhile. I said that I had for 15 minutes and no hot water. The desk said they would report it. 4 days later still had the same issue. The buffet restaurant was closed except for Mothers Day. Then only open for Breakfast. No room service. Front Desk service was almost non-existant, not enough help. Only had one person. The best service was the Valet's. Parking was too high for hotel guests.

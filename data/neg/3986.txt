I guess I can't complain too much becaues I got this hotel from Priceline, BUT I did [ay $160 for it, and I checked the 3.5 star box... and I can confidently say that the room was NOT a 3.5 star room. The location is fabulous... The Arlington station is right across the street which was a quick ride to the Garden, and we were able to walk to Fenway. It's also close to Newbury and several great restaurants. The lobby is very nice. My issue is with the room itself, which was smaller than any room I've ever seen (including NYC hotel rooms) and looked like it had not been touched in decades. The room was very dark (minimal sunlight). The queen-size bed and small desk took up pretty much the entire room. The bathroom was tiny (my husband and I could not even brush our teeth at the same time). There are a lot of hotels nearby (we've stayed at the Sheraton before which is MUCH nicer) so if you are planning a trip to Boston, I'd suggest you skip the Boston Park Plaza.

We had stayed at Penn Towers before when my husband had to be at the University Hospital, and it was always comfortable and very convenient. What a change this time! The two bedside lamps didn't work and the TV volume was so low we couldn't hear so we called for maintenance. They fixed the lamps but couldn't do anything about the TV. To watch our favorite show we sat about two feet away from the set. An arm was about to fall off one of the chairs which could be dangerous for an elderly person (and who else stays there?) There was a holder for the hair dryer but no dryer. There are extra charges for refrigerator, microwave, even calling an 800 number! The room was fairly clean and the bed was comfortable but otherwise our stay was terrible. For this we paid the "patient rate" of $145 plus tax plus $10 parking. Maintenance said the hospital owns the building and the two hotel floors will be taken over for offices soon. That's good because we'd hate to see anyone else waste their money on this place.

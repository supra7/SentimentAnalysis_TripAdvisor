All rooms are around the 4 (small) pools. At 08:00 hours in the morning the music from all speakers start (nobody knows why when you ask but they guess that people like that). Nice on vacation to be woken up at that time by loud music. Actually the pools and grounds are nice but there's music from all corners. First morning I went to the tiki bar at 10:10 hours to get coffee and a few bagels or so. Reaction was (bagels were still on the buffet): "we're closed come back at 11:00 hours. Others guests who we're still drinking their coffee told us to go across the street to get coffee (excuse me, I have to go across the street for coffee at 10: 00 in the morning in a 4****star resort ?). Next morning at 10:00 hours I went to the Tiki bar to get Beach towels, answer to question was: " no beach towels, come back later". Question: "When are there beach towels ?", Answer: "There are beach towels when they are there". Nice service in a 4***resort ! Day 3: Room was not done by 17:00 hours, I had to run after the Assistent manager for 40 minutes before they managed to do the room. Mistake he said, they forgot to do it. Actually, room was never done before 16:00/16:30 hours. Tried to use the internet, during the day, la la, not fast but ok. Some evenings impossible to use the internet, no connection at all. They told us they only had one line for the whole hotel. No working desk or table for eating or so. in your suite Nice suites but not very practical. You pay $ 25,00 resort fee for very slow internet ,loud music at the pool and bad service. I stayed there 4 nights and paid over $ 200,00 a night and we have been served by people who (I guess) must have worked at the goelags in Russia.

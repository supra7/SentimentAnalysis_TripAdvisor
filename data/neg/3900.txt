Very nice hotel and room BUT ... the parking is a complete scam. We pulled up late at night and asked where we could park ... an employee asked if we were staying at the hotel ... when we said yes he cheerfully said "right here then, i'll take your car." Later we found out that this was going to cost us $42 per night. Absurd. Also they have rates for non-guests that are hourly and are a MAXIMUM of $42 for a full day/night. So you're not even getting "a deal" by staying at the hotel. Insulting. FYI my wife and I live in New York City and are used to ridiculously high prices ... we live next to Lincoln Center and even here parking overnight costs less than $30. The $42 charged by this hotel was ridiculous and really took advantage of their semi-remote location within Boston. (FYI it turned out there was a much cheaper garage option about a block away; I recommend you find that if you have to stay here. Would have been nice to be told about that when I asked them where I could park, instead of being misled and taken advantage of.)

I arrived late in the evening and the staff ws very friendly. I got to my room and the air conditioning would not turn on (it was hot there that week) and in addition the TV remote did not work. I went down to the desk twice to try to resolve the TV and air conditioning. A staff person was very kind and worked on both via telephone with a maintenance person. I noticed near the bed, door, and lampshade were these red beetle looking bugs. I also found one or two in the bed. I went to bed and kept waking up with something crawling on me...it was those red bugs! By now I am sure they thought I was nuts, but I could not sleep there, so I called down to the desk at 12:30am and asked about the bugs. Without hesitation they moved me to another room. But I guess I was discussed by the front desk. It seemed when I went to the front desk they already knew about the lady with the bug problem. I liked the smaller room they put me in, but the TV remote did not work in there either and sometimes the TV would just switch channels while I was watching.. I did not dare complain...since I the ordeal with the bugs. The business center has one computer and their connection is slow. The fitness center had an assortment of old equipment, but two nice treadmills. The breakfast was good and dining area had a nice view of the corner. The location is great. But where are the Hampton Inn cookies? They did not serve cookies in the evening.

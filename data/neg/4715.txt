My daughter attended a conference at the Palmer House in March and I joined her (I like Chicago a lot) and paid for the (expensive) room. Our room was past its prime-the drawers would'nt stay shut, the bathroom robe hook was broken, and the door lock never opened untill we tried it many, many times. My daughter needed to receive a fax, and the hotel staff told her (very kindly) that she would be better off going to Kinkos, since the Palmer House would charge her so much. I have never been to a hotel that had wireless internet in the public places but not in the rooms-there was a cable hook up and (of course) a charge for it. I assumed that the bottles of water by the coffee machine were complimentry, as this seems to be common in even inexpensive hotels. It was only after my daughter drank one that we noticed the card indicating how much they cost. I seriously wondered if the Palmer House would charge me for my wake up call. The convenience of staying where the conference was being held was importent, especially since the weather was still unsettled. But overall, being nickeled and dimed was kind of sad-this used to be a wonderful icon of Chicago.

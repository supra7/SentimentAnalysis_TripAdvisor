Hallo folks. I booked this accomodation, last minute as I drove down to London. Since I was travelling alone I didnt want to pay an arm or a leg at other premium hotels! And to compound my problems it was the first friday of the school holidays. So I managed to book and reserve a room here using my credit card by phone. The staff were friendly, check-in was easy but despite providing my credit card details to reserve my accomodation, I paid in cash and asked to scribble out my card details. The stay was fine although a bit small. Rooms were clean, linen fresh. Bathrooms were shared, so not entirely 100% clean. Well it was just for a night so I would cope! The stairways were narrow too, so managed to scrape my bag on the wall as I clambered up the stairs. Parking was a problem. Its all Permit holders and Pay and Display only! Several days later I realised my credit card was being misued around the globe. I cancelled that card and informed my bank immediately. I rang the hotel and asked to speak to the manager. He refused to provide me with his name and then became abusive and vulgour. I informed the bank again and the police. Stay here but pay in cash. Dont give credit card details.

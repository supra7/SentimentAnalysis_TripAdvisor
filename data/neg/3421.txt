I wanted to love it. I read the reviews here and they were poor. BUT, those problems were fixed. I had a nice room on the 11th floor, and it was evidently a remodeled room, and had a lovely large flat screen TV. However, they had a terrible problem with their linens. I took a shower after the hot day, grabbed a bath towel and it had a large, black, what looked like mascara stain on it. Yuck. Grabbed another one. Another stain - not as big, but still gross. I toweled myself off with a hand towel, and called the front desk. They sent new towels up and said they had been checked. Fine. Later, i go to bed, and find the same type of stains on three out of four of the pillows. I took a picture of one of them - attached here. Wish I had taken one of the towel which was similar. Too tired to complain now, called in the morning. I did call, the manager wasn't in yet, and at 9 AM I spoke to her, camera in hand. I expressed my displeasure and she agreed. Supposedly there's a problem with their machine - if that's the case, they need to fix it asap. Because I had paid with priceline, they couldn't refund my money (really?) but they comped two room service bills. Bottom line - this is a very nice hotel, and this type of problem is unacceptable - period. I would not stay there again. My biggest requirement of a hotel is that it be clean - and 5 separate pieces of linens being stained is NOT clean. I think my stay should have been comped or a better remedy.

I had stayed at this hotel in 2000, and enjoyed my luxurious room and breathtaking views of Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains. So, I was looking forward to coming back for a four-night stay, but this hotel has definitely gone downhill. Check-in was chaotic - it reminded me of airport lines I've faced in Third World countries. The clerks were pleasant enough but seemed inexperienced and overwhelmed. My room wasn't ready yet, so I left my luggage with the bell staff, who gave me claim checks and said they'd move my luggage to a secure area right away. When I came back three hours later, my luggage was still sitting out in the open lobby area - free for the taking by any dishonest soul. But I wasn't alone - there were at least a couple dozen suitcases left unattended near the check-in desks. I had a standard guest room with a king-size bed; it was spacious enough, and the bed was quite comfortable. However, the bathroom had not been properly cleaned, so I had to call Housekeeping to give it a proper cleaning. To their credit, they responded promptly, but didn't quite know what to do when they arrived. I had to point out, for example, that they should remove a half-used bar of soap left by the previous guest. Even after the daily cleanings, my bathroom had a vaguely mildewy smell. The TV had a very limited number of channels compared to Marriott and Sheraton hotels I've recently stayed at on business. I tried to order room-service breakfast one morning, but gave up after (twice) letting the phone ring for 12-15 rings and receiving no reply. The concierge desk wasn't helpful or knowledgeable about restaurants or bus routes. These things didn't add up to an awful or disastrous stay, just an unsatisfactory one. If this had been a budget hotel, some of the shortcomings would be more acceptable. When I'm next in Seattle on business, I'll definitely stay elsewhere.

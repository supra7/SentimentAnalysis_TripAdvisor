I'm a frequent Hyatt guest at properties around the globe, and I am somewhat disappointed at this particular property. I had to move to 3 different rooms on the same day before finding one that I "liked". The first room on the 17th floor was great except that I heard everything in the hall and next door, so the sound insulation was not great. I moved to something on the 8th floor near the end of the hall which was supposedly a non-smoking room. But, my allergies kicked in immediately as the slightest hint of smoke, so I moved to something on the 11th floor near the end of the hall. By that time I was frustrated and tired of moving that I just gave up and stayed in the last room. All 3 rooms had severe grout issues in the shower. And, the hotel had shower dispensers for the bath amenities (shampoo, conditioner, bath gel) which I don't care for (I like sealed containers). On a more positive note: The room service personnel were the outstanding and genuinely pleasant folks I've come to expect from Hyatt. Service was prompt, servers acknowledged me by name, food was hot. Had breakfast in the restaurant and encountered similarly great service that is uniquely Hyatt. Loved the T-Mobile wireless service in the guest rooms. Great location; just a block from Macy's and Filene's; right at the foot of the entry to Chinatown; right in the Financial district; block from Boston Common.

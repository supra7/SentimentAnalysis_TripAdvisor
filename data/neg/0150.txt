its freezing cold and the heater is broken. there is a replacement heater that shorts out the power every 15 minutes,,, asian guy behind the desk said and i quote "dont use the electric"!!! no clock , no heat, no power. and im being blown off. there are no extra rooms. i feel like a hitman on a stake out. this is the very worse hotel ive ever been in. the pictures shown online must have been the only decent room. seriously these are not exxagerations. do not book this room! the health board needs to be called. suicideboards@yahoo.com

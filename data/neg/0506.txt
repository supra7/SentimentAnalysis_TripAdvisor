While traveling down the PCH from Bellingham, WA to San Diego, CA we made reservations for and stayed at the Seattle Quality Inn & Suites. Yes, the hotel was within walking distance of the Space Needle. However, when I requested a 2pm check-out (we did not check-in until after 7pm) as per the special services extended to "Choice Privileges" members, I was told the latest we could check-out was 1pm; the room was small; there was an accumulation on dust on the top of the drapes which fell down on me when I pulled them closed; only one elevator worked and it was slow; the complimentary "in room" coffee service was provide only for one person; after showering, the bathtub took forever to drain (over 8 minutes) and left behind scum; we had to walk through the indoor pool area to reach the breakfast room; the business center computer was out of order; and the sole desk clerk was so harried trying to do several tasks at once that several guests left after waiting too long for service.

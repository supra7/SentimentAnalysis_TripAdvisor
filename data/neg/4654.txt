We stayed at this hotel because my grandson had an interview with a colleg in dontown Chicago. This hotel was recommended by the school It is a very attractive hotel Walking in and out you are always blasted by stong gusts of wind. Minor complaint. I asked the front desk , on the day of departure if we could check-out 11/2 hours later than scheduled time.. She said yes but there would be a $25.00 fee. I have traveled and lived all over the world, NEVER has any hotel asked for a fee for late departure. The answer is no or yes. I thought it was cheap and insuling considering the class of this hotel. I left with a very bad impression of this place, very ungracious in their treatment of guests!

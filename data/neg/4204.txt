I booked this hotel for myself and my boyfriend for his birthday...booking a "DELUXE" room with a king size bed, non-smoking. I booked through Expedia and will never do that again either. I arrived to the VERY CROWDED hotel around 6 p.m. and went straight to the reservation desk. The man says, "ok, queen size bed." I replied, that no, I requested a king size bed. He said that they were very busy and there were none left, but the room was still a "deluxe" room. Ok. Fine, I need a place to stay right? So, we head off to the elevator where we had to wait 10 minutes for one to come and be shoved in like sardines...with people very provacatively dressed. (By the way, un-beknown to me, there was a leather/fetish conference going on - being a "distinguished" hotel, don't you think you'd weed out conferences of this type?? Anyway, we make it up to the 12th floor and go over to our room. There was a tray of leftover room service outside the room, which remained there the rest of the evening into the morning. We open the door and are shocked. The "deluxe" room is a box. No joke, it was a 10x12 room. You could hardly walk by the dresser to get to the bed or to the window. The view from the 12th floor was of a brick building...oh wait, the hotel! The bathroom was no better than a public restroom with a toilet as old as sin. Oh and so much for a non-smoking room...even if it was non-smoking, we could've smoked a pack of cigarettes and the smell would be no better. We're tough, so we spent the night there. I get home and find two charges on my credit card bill for the hotel. One from Expedia, which I expected and the other...from the damn hotel. So, now, I am fighting Expedia about the charges, whose Problem management group works bankers hours of 9-3. This whole thing has been a nightmare; take it from me, and stay away from the Park Plaza in Boston.

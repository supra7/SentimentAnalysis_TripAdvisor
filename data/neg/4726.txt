I was disappointed in this hotel. I had just come from the Hilton in Austin, which was impeccable, and expected more from the Palmer House. I found hairs on the fresh towels 3 times. To me, that is just gross. I would think a hotel of this caliber would take more care in inspecting the towels. Elevators are abyssmally slow, and the distance was very far from my room to the elevator. It is easy to get lost if you visit friends on another floor because the hallways wind like a maze and elevators are not well marked. But the on the plus side, this hotel has some historic charm, especially the grand, sistine chapel-esque lobby. Convenient little place called Jacque's on the street level had quick bites and kind clerks. The bellmen were helpful in procuring cabs. The location, right in the heart of downtown, was excellent.

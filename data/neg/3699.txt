The Pointe Resort is not a resort. One should conjugate the verb "resort" instead. 1) I resort---to having cleaning service that only takes out the garbage and makes the beds. So it is a lot like home. You get the level cleaning your kid may do and then you do the rest! 2) You resort-to having queen size beds a foot away from flimsy windows. Perfect for giving parents heart attacks when toddlers are jumping on beds. I was told this set-up was in "all of their rooms." 3) He, she, it resorts-to no WIFI. They will say they do but it is only in the lobby. Nice. I have a million dollars in the bank, it is just not in my bank account. But they do offer Ethernet cords which would be helpful in 1998. 4) We resort-to the lowest common denominator. It was our wedding anniversary. We asked for a bottle of wine. BTW- There is no room service so we were transferred to their "bistro." You would think I was asking for gold. They couldn't make that happened. Also, the basic free continental breakfast was great. Only it was 9 dollars per person. But this was unnecessary for us as the aroma of breakfast lingered in our room for our first day. It smelled like hash browns. We were told it was probably our neighbors. Dem da breaks! So yes, it is a resort. This should be your last resort. I have no idea where the place these folks stayed that was four or five stars. I travel quite a bit and had better accommodations in Siberia.

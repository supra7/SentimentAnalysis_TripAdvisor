I selected this property because of the reviews. Upon check-in, I was placed in a smoking room!!! Instant headache and the smell is STILL in my nose! By the way, I specifically reserved a non-smoking room via a fully prepaid reservation!!! They couldn't move me because the hotel was full! The next day, they moved me but to a room immediately next to the elevator! I asked to be moved again but...only smoking rooms are available. "I'm sorry sir."

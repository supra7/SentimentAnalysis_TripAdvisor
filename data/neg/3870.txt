I had a business meeting at the Copely Marriott for a small group of about 30 people, most of whom (including myself) stayed at the hotel. Unfortunately for us, the American Psychological Association had its annual convention at the same hotel at the same time. The result was that the hotel was overflowing with people and the staff was totally overwhelmed. After setting up our dinner on the first night, the servers disappeared for other activities, leaving us to take care of our own requests... The next day - when I returned to my room at 6PM from a day full of meetings - I discovered that my room received no housekeeping attention since morning. Getting to a person who would understand the problem (and do something about it) by phone was unsuccessful. I had to go to the reception desk in person to explain my problem. Waiting time for the elevators at any time of the day was at least 6 minutes, and in one case 13 minutes. I was very relieved when I could finally leave this disorderly place.

I would never do business with this hotel. I had a room booked for Friday night because the Marriott was unavailable. Turns out that they had a hotel room and I was able to stay. I called the Hotel Seattle at 10:00pm the night before and they refused to cancel my room. Yes their check in policy is 2:00pm and yes I was 8 hours late, but generally most hotels, who rely on travelers to book their rooms, are more than happy to work with you. Unfortunately not these guys.

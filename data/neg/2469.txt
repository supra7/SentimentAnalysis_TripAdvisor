Attempted to check in using the automated process in the lobby (a note was on top of the reception desk pointing to these). I tried and failed (probably because my company had booked through Inntel) so I went to the desk but there was no sign of life. I called out "Hello" and a man appeared from a backroom, pointed and said "use the machines". I replied "doesn't work" and all I got back was "name?". I was then handed a card and told "first floor" and that was it. He dissapeared back into his back office. The room was small, a bit tatty and the road noise was bad. The window blind also didn't keep the street light out. I didn't get much sleep. The room rate was 90. I would probably pay 30 to stay here and if I was forced to do so again I would take eyeshades and earplugs. The only positive I can think of for this hotel is it's location for Euston station. This was the only reason I chose it. I certainly will not be back.

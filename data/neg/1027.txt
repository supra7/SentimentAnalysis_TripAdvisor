Ok I am a Starwood member and have wanted to stay at the W. The baseball teams stay here. The rooms were spacious and the staff friendly. Nice artwork... BUT No coffee pot in the room? This is Starbuck's flagship city. The lobby had LOUD techno type dance music blarring even early in the morning. I am not sure what their target market is but I heard more than one person complaining about it. At least play something I recognize, like Jimi Hendrix. The halls are dimly lit which I didn't like it. Some may call this hip and trendy, I call it, I won't be back!

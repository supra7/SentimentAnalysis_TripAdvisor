I picked this 3.5 star hotel for location (Pike Place market) and style, although it turned out to be right over the freeway and not really where I would consider the Pike Place area. There was great (free) public transportation just a few steps a way so that was not a problem. The hotel staff was cold: check-in was efficient but indifferent; concierge was so full of himself that he did not even make eye contact or smile while he was on the phone. I finally walked away. After we unpacked, left and then returned from our day, we found the toilet did not work. They had no part on hand (for a toilet??) and the maintenance man told us we would have to pack up and move. The desk was unapologetic and sent us to another room, which turned out to be a corner room and extremely small. After 5 pleasant days about town, we would have taken this all in stride -- until the ultimate blow. My favorite, and one of a kind, jacket was left hanging in the closet when we departed to stay with a relative and when we called to retrieve it, it had not been turned in. We called for several days: the lost and found, then the hskp supervisor, then the GM, but they could not or did not attempt to retrieve it from the dishonest staff member/thief. The GM (had a french accent) even said "I will take this personally." We never heard from him. STAY AWAY. There are much better choices for hospitality and locations in Seattle.

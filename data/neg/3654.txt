Pirate's Cove is by far the dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed in. The walls were dirty and cracked, there were no covers over the outlets, the furniture was very old and busted up, the towels and sheets and blankets didn't feel or look very clean, the bathroom was tiny and very dirty, the air conditioner froze up, so it was hot all night long while we were trying to sleep, the toilet barely flushed, and the drain in the shower was clogged. The only nice things about our room were the flat screen t.v., which seemed very out of place in this dated room, and the view of the beach and ocean. I would not stay there again until I have seen that this place has cleaned it's act up.

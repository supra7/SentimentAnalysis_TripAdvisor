Let's start off on a good note. The staff was great. Very nice and helpful. Perhaps I got them on a good day. Now for the rest. The price was variable and I feel too costly for the quality I got. Rooms were small. Linen was old and sometimes tattered but clean. Locks on bathroom door did not work. Bathroom renovations were cheap and poorly constructed. Obviously not a contracted job. Rooms were clean but not that clean. The continental breakfast was a joke. Watered down juice, packaged doughnuts, a bowel of hard boiled eggs, old cereal, stale mini bagels, a brick a butter and a tub of cream cheese. Very unsanitary! The neighbourhood is close to the airport but is very poor and messy. The rollaway cot had a mattress that was completely void of any padding what so ever, plus the wheels kept coming off. I recommend you pay a little extra and go somewhere else that's nicer. I would not pay more than $40 a night for this place and I'm being generous!

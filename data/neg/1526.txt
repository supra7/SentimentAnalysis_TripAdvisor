this is not a hotel it is a B&B without the cosiness. the owners do not live on site and the "hotel" is located within private residences including a dentist. no reception area and the noise form the street is like sleeping beside an underground. Rome is a noisy city sleeping in our bedroom felt like sleeping bang in the middle of the street. the hotel staff comprise one cleaning lady that prepares breakfast and cleans, seems a bit like slave labour. she was stressed and hassled all of the four days we were there. breakfast is meant to between 8-10. forget that first up gets what ever is on offer. the first day we arrived for breakfast at 9.15 and there were just croissants, some processed cheese slices, a machine for making capuccino , some apples, a carton of cheap juice and awful pastries. lastly, the owner, a Lady whom we saw once on our arrival and then again when we were leaving. she arrived late eventhough we had specified the exact time we would collect our bags, our prebooked taxi driver had to wait 10 mins as we were locked out of the hotel (no reception you see). my husband luckily had the number of the hotel which incidentially is her mobile phone as it was pointless ringing the front door bell which we did anyway as there is no reception. eventually he got her and made a quick getaway never to return. stay here at your peril.

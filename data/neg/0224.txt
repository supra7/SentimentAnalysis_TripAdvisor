This is one of the worst accomodation experiences in years, including countries like Senegal or Cambodia. The place is absoultely ready for tear down and re-buid. Cracked paint everwhere, old furniture, dirty, bad-smelling "kitchenette", rotten smell everywhere. Let alone the carpet in the hallway - probably 30 years old. You dont want to know, what creatures live there - probably at the brink of intelligent life. DO NOT GO! Good was the WiFi access and (my) bed. Other trevellers of the group however had different experiences with their beds. Aircondition, only in some rooms and inacceptably loud. Windows are thin, in fact you are sleeping on the street in respect to the sound level. Different members of our group were charged different rates (although all booked at the same time through the same online portal) - between 74 and 101 USD.

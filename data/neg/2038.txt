My husband and I booked a room for one night in Las Vegas. The room appeared beautiful when we entered. We quickly discovered the flaws. The toilet seat came off when we sat on it. The TV in the bathroom didn't work. The room had no black out shades (but it did have a track for them). There were not enough towels. There were no extra little products in the bathroom that one is used to in a 5 star hotel. 6 hours later, the engineer called to fix the TV but it was 10PM and we just settled down to sleep. No turn down service. It is a little bit sketchy walking to the strip from the hotel - there is no paved walkway all the way there and no lights. The pool has no umbrellas/no shade. There is a train that comes by frequently and you hear the noise loudly at the pool and in your room (we were on the 18th floor). Last year we stayed at the Wynn and were completely happy. Don't bother here.

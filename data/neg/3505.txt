My 70-year young mother and I stayed at Magnolia over Memorial Day weekend as a mother-daughter holiday. We were not informed that the club level was under construction and everything was moved to the rather bland 3rd floor. They need to do some decorating to make it warm and inviting. The area for breakfast, reception, and cookies is bare and cold. Also, I got stuck in elevator #2 for about 30 minutes. The response that I received when I pressed the emergency call button was "no answer"! I couldn't believe it. I pressed the alarm button that rings continuously and no response either. I resorted to banging on the elevator door with a flat hand and yelling at the top of my lungs for someone to get me out. It took 10 minutes before anyone finally found out that I was stuck. I also hurt my hand slapping on the elevator door so hard. They seriously need to make sure that the call system works properly so that no one else will have to experience this. It was awful and put a damper on our short vacation.

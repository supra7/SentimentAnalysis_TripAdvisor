called the number listed in RoomSaver magazine passed out within MWR (active Army 15+ years) and was answered by a man named Tony. Requested two days 30-31DEC10 for 29.95 and he said he was not honoring the coupon within the RoomSaver magazine. Wish I had more time and money to fix that *** false advertisement ***. This was recommended by a guy that works at MWR and was just there for xmas for 29.95. Something odd going on here.

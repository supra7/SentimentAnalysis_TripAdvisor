I was so excited to take my wife to the W for our anniversary. Unfortunately, the hotel was nothing of what was expected from the photos and other reviews. The hotel is old and the elevators continually whiz up and down all night and you get to hear them the whole time. When other rooms are taking a shower, thats right, you here it. The room was small, lacked all hope for trendy and upscale, and was layed out like a Best Western. Valet parking was awful. I understand it is Seattle and parking is like oil, expensive. However, to bleed your paying guests out of $45 (including tax) a day to park, you should look at some other options. Another fee to add to the fun, use of the fitness center! The only bright spot was location. It was easy to walk to any place we wanted. Unfortunately at their concierge, the girl giving directions was off on one of our locations by six blocks. Another time we asked for the nearest US Bank and were sent to the convention center (several bloacks away). Later that weekend we walked one block down from the hotel and surprise there was a US Bank. - Once again, lacking in "spectacular". To summarize I would say you would be better off spending your $725.97 where you can get a good night sleep, better parking, a nicer room, and real "whenver, wherever" (their signature phrase) treatment. I hope this helps because in this economy I think all of us, wealthy, middle class, and poverty, deserve to have a great experience when we are spending our money that we have worked hard for.

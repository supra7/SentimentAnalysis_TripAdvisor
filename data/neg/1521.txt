Although another room was available, the first night they let as sleep in a room with obvious dump on the wall above our heads and so smelly we had to keep the window open all night!! The cleaning lady (very polite and helpful) told us that the room has always been that terrible and that they can't fix it. The man at the reception said that a small problem could have occurred and that theyll fix it soon!! On the second night they gave us a really nice room (TV not working though) but sometime at night (9 o'clock) another resident enter into with a door key and with his luggage on hand! That guy at the reception told us that that could be the man to fix the TV!! However the breakfast was good and it is a beautiful hotel but not at all money well spent.

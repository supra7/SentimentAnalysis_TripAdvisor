For the price you can't expect too much. We only used it as a place to sleep. Only one light in the room worked and the lock was suspect. No wifi or breakfast but Top Pot Donuts is next door which is a plus. Service wasn't great but wasn't bad, although they did make the beds after our first night. Good as a place to sleep and location but not much else.

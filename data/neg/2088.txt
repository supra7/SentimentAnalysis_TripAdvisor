The grounds are beautiful. The desk staff were nice. We thought the description of rooms was a little vague. It was interesting that there was a microwave and little refrigerator, but no sink. Not well equipped. BUT the biggest complaint was cockroaches. One was found in the bathroom. gross. complained about it and they said they would send a maintenance person to spray. the desk commented that this was a tropical place and we should not be surprised by Palmoto bugs. Did they think calling them a different name would change our reaction. Really?? Too expensive a hotel to have to deal with a lack of pest control.

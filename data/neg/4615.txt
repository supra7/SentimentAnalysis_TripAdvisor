sure it's beautiful. location is great. historical. and if you want to step back in time, great. if you are not a business traveller, this place might be for you. here's my gripe: $15/day WIRED internet $15 is already outrageous. if you want to charge me extra for a glass of wine at the beautiful bar and call it ambiance, i get it, it's worth it, but this is internet, there is no ambiance, the hotel is choosing to screw its clientelle at this rate. still, this is, if a little high, toward the average for 4+ star hotel internet rates. what really gets me is that this is internet with a 4 foot cable. you're tethered to a desk. by no means can you relax with a laptop in bed. no way. if i order room service, it comes with a convenience charge, i'm paying extra. i don't have to move. again, i get it. but this $15 tethered interent is the hotel telling you to come to the kitchen, make it yourself and drag it back to your room and pay triple.

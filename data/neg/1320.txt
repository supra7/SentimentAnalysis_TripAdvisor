I'll start with the good. The beds were very comfortable. I suppose if you need to be close to the airport its a good location. Other than that my husband and I were very disappointed! We were quoted $69 per night through Hotwire and this hotel cost us over $100 per night with the extra taxes and fees. We didn't even pay for the internet, which was $5 per day. The lowest rate for parking was $18 per day and the parking lot was a ridiculously long walk from the rooms. The property has no queen beds, only double or king, and we were told that the king bedrooms are a premium for a premium price. The staff was pretentious and unhelpful. We travel for a living and have stayed in many, many hotels that don't bear the Hilton name that were much more luxurious and much, much cheaper. Shame on them!

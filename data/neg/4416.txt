Let me start by saying I know I should not complain about staying at this hotel for $84 a night, as I found them through Priceline (I never thought a hotel of this caliber would be on that site!) but soemthings just aren't right, even at that price. When I arrived, there was no one to greet me and I struggled with my bags to the desk. I asked for an upgrade (and I was a little upset about having to lug my bags) and they put me on the Gold Floor...what a treat and it made me immediately forget about my poor reception! The room was ok, but the lounge and the service in the lounge was great, as well as the food. Would I spend $300+ a night to be on the Concierge Floor, the normal rate,...no chance, would rather stay at the Ritz or Four Season. It was nice, but definately not great. But for $84 a night...it was a treat! The bathrooms was very small and not very clean...the hotel is just old and in need of a renovation/TLC as no one seems to care about dirty corridors, little tears and chips all over, chipped bath tub and peeling wallpaper. Nothing terrible, just not crisp as you would expect on a Concierge floor or at the Ritz/Four Seasons. But, the biggest issue was that I saw a mouse in the Oak Bar and also saw a mouse in my room! It was awful! I travel very frequently to city hotels and have never seen one in a hotel before! This would lead me to believe that they have cleanliness issues throughout the hotel and there were room service trays that stayed in the corridor for quite some time. I guess Mickey runs around looking for those leftovers. When I saw the rodent in the bar, I mentioned it to the waitress who basically shrugged her shoulders and said it is part of being in a big city...so I guess they had these complaints before. Would I go back? NO! Not with MICE! But if there were no mice and priced at $175 - $200 a night, I would consider it! I have heard great things about Jury's, right around the corner and will try that next time!

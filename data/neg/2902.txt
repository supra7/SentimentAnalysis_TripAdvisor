My partner and I arrived at this hotel in late afternoon of December 31st. Upon checking in we were told that we absolutely had to wear thick blue plastic bracelets for our entire stay. When asking if anything can be substituted for this the hotel manager literally attacked us with enforcement. He began yelling through the entire lobby that rules need to be followed and proceeded to ask us to leave...all because I asked if we can carry the bracelets instead of wear them since they clearly would not have matched our formal attire for the evening out. As a seasoned traveler I stay in many hotels all over the continent, both for work and pleasure. This was the first time anyone reacted so hostly and rudely to suggestions about a policy. Perhaps on a regular evening when you don't have to interact with management this hotel is okay, but I would definitely not recommend it on a holiday or a busy long weekend. I suspect they cater to a younger crowd and are used to disrespecting their clients, so beware. Even though the room was tidy and the location was great, this kind of interaction upon checking in would undoubtedly ruin anyone's experience.

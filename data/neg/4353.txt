Disappointed with the hyatt chain. First time we've ( my partner and I ) have stayed in a hyatt hotel and we won't again. We stayed over New years. Needs updating, security for New Years Eve wasn't very good or organised as we had a group in the room next to us that weren't booked into that room. Maid service wasn't very efficient. Our privacy sign on the door was ignored, we were only ever given one bathrobe and there were 2 of us, and the toilettries weren't always stocked up. When we left, they didnt put all our belongings in the taxi so we had to wait at the airport for them to send them. There were some positives in that the bed was very comfy, mike on the concierge was very helpful and the bar staff were brilliant. We have travelled many places around the world, and some of the hotels in the poorer countries have been by far better than this one.

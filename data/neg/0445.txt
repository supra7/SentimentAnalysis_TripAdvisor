We made our reservation through Hotels, last minute, and with taxes paid over $200 for our room. You can get free coffee or hot chocolate only if you request a wake-up call. I have stayed in similar boutique-style hotels in other cities for less and they had in-room coffee, fan in bathroom, and non-chipping tiles in bathroom. Personally, would not recommend this hotel even though the front desk personnel were helpful, and reasonably friendly. The bell personnel, however, left us waiting in 90+ weather for half an hour when they said, "we'll be right up with your car".

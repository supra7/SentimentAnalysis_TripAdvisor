Stayed here for a couple of nights and had to change room 4 times before finding a room with working heating!! the rooms were like fridges and some were very noisy due to the 24hr bus route outside which shakes your room. Rooms were quite small but ok. bathroom had a nice shower but annoying curtain which was useless and resulted in the batroom floor being flooded each time. Breakfast was ok and staff were very nice, location in terms of seeing london is great and only 5 mins walk from Eurostar terminal

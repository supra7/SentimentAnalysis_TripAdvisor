We arrived late in the evening. It took the desk clerk a long time to get everyone checked in. Then when we got to the room we found our room would not lock when we left the room. We asked the desk clerk to send someone up and they did, but we were told that the lock had to be replaced and they were not able to do that until the next day. We could however lock the room from the inside for the night. Since it was late, we agreed to do that. The hotel was old and needed some updating.

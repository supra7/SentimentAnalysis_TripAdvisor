I stayed at the Park Plaza for a conference. The hotel is an older property, but the facilities are well-maintained. The lobby area was very nice and reception was always helpful. The room (612) was of average size with a queen bed and work desk. Overall, the room was very clean even though the rooms are "older." Unfortunately, the room smelled very musty on checking in. When I turned on the A/C, it smelled like it was burning. Maintainence came right away to make some adjustments, but the "burn" smell never went away. Also, the A/C is older and can't seem to "keep up" if you want the room very cold. The bathroom is on the small side, but clean (especially the shower). Given that I'm paying $180 per night (which I hear is a steal in Boston), I think this hotel is adequate. It certainly has personality, but the musty smell might turn some travelers off.

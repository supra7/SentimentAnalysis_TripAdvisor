Well I'm not sure where to start. If I give the place the benefit of doubt it would mean that everyone else who placed a negative review here stayed in the exact same room as us but I don't think that is possible. I know that all states have some kind of regulations pertaining to rooms being cleaned between guest stays. We observed would appeared to be jelly on the mini blinds and wall. There was dust on most of the surfaces. There were splash stains on the inside of the lampshade. We had a broken chair which we discovered after trying to sit in it. The water in the shower was two temperatures cold and just short of a luke warm. The comforter, well let it suffice to say, that things had clearly happened on it before our visit which involved bodily fluids. The shower was as small as that of a WW II submarine but I know for a fact that the submarines had a shelf and a hook to put stuff on unlike the one in our room. The TV is an RCA model which has not been made since the early 1980's. The room had two phonebooks but it didn't matter because there was no phone. The hall smelled like a hamster cage and there were ants on the trash cans. In addition, should you want your room cleaned, you need to sign up for it which is something they didn't mention when we checked in. I would mention the common veranda but if you have an imagination and read the above rating my guess is the picture in your head would be accurate.

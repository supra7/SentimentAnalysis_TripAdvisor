Came here after spending some time in Oahu. This hotel was such a disappointment - we were literally sick about it. It's run down and desperately in need of remodeling. Hawaian activities were soooo boring - definately not designed for the younger crowd. And everytime I asked the staff a question they were not at all interested in helping unless you planned to buy something from them. It may be cheap, but I would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone.

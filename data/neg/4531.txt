I had a relatively enjoyable stay at the Palmer House. I will say that the concierge and bell staff is absolutely exceptional. For example, I had a question about parking and asked the bell man. He was unable to answer me, but then later sought me out to give me an answer. That is above and beyond service and is definetely appreciated. I have stayed at the Palmer House several times. The first time I had the lovely accomodations which included two bathrooms and absolutely fabulous fixtures and finishes. The second time I was put into a room where the wall paper was falling off the wall, the fixtures were rusted, and the tile in the bathroom was moldy. I literally threw a fit and was granted a free voucher for my next stay. That brings me to my most recent stay. I was once again put into a not-very-nice room with rusty fixtures, a dirty bathroom, and scratched furniture. Since it was free, I was okay with it. But thank goodness I was only staying one night. I travel quite a bit, and I will tell you that I've stayed in nicer hotels in the middle of nowhere Wisconsin (for example the AmericInn). The lobby of the Palmer House is outstanding. The vibe is wonderful, the restoration is beautifully done. The food and drink is delicious. My recommendation is that the Hilton people find a way to improve their dumpy rooms ASAP. I will continue to recommend the Palmer house for a drink and dinner, but will advise all travelers to be sure to specify one of the suite rooms (green decor) if they choose to stay there. Otherwise, you are better off at one of the other fabulous hotels that Chicago has to offer in its downtown.

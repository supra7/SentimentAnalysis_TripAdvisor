Checked in, my room was on the ground floor about 15 feet from the entrance to the hotel and all the car traffic, so had to keep the curtains closed in darkness. Asked to be changed, the hotel was full, okay, understandable, not happy at $300+ a night but okay. Then go to shower next morning and the light is hanging a foot down from the ceiling above the shower with debris in the tub, light and the fan are out of order, so shower in the dark. Asked to be moved, they accommodate me later that evening. New room is higher up so that was better relative to the parking lot, but I plugged in the iron and then realized after waiting for it to heat up that the electrical outlet was broken. While waiting for it to heat up I was brushing my teeth and noticed the drain was plugged in the bathroom so the sink filled up, lovely. Likely just bad luck on my part, but at that price I was paying for a Seattle hotel and the "best hotel in Seattle" moniker that gets thrown around, I expected a lot more. I won't be staying here again.

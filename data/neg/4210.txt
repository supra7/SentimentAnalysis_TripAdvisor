This "four star" hotel was not nearly as good as the oldest 39.95/night Super 8 that I have stayed in. The rooms were inadequate and underfurnished. The only good thing about it was a fairly new (less than 50 yrs.) bathtub. During our stay we were involved in a fire evacuation at 3:30 AM. Fire procedures are a danger to anyone that stays there. Quickly, go somewhere else!

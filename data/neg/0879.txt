The rooms are cold and damp and NOT cozy by any means and the building is old. The windows make you feel like you're in jail or something. The hallways have that old run-down, cold motel feeling. For $10 more you could stay at a nicer inn/motel/hotel down the street at the La Quinta and get a better experience, that's what we did the very next day, and we were very pleased. The travelodge by the space needle leaves you with a bitter cold feeling when you're there, but if you don't care about coziness and want to save $10, then this place isn't bad. But being in Seattle when it's cold and rainy, you will long for that warm, coziness you can get at the La Quinta on 8th ave and not here. I will never want to stay here again after what I experienced. The only thing I liked about the hotel was that the staff was real courteous.

From the moment I began booking a reservation, it was an absolute nightmare. The out-sourced reservation line was impossible to work with and incapable of meeting my business needs. After being forced to demand to speak to the hotel directly, I was promised the same room for my entire stay. To my surprise, I arrived only to be told I would be staying on a sofa sleeper in the "parlor"... the living room of a suite. And to further insult injury, I would be forced to move rooms in the middle of my stay despite the assurance that I would have one room in order to accomodate conference calls. As if this wasn't enough, I left the hotel with 6 bug bites on my arm without ever wearing short sleeves. This was the most disappointing and frustrating hotel experience I have ever had. I would rather stay in a Comfort Suites (where I can have the actual suite and not the sofa sleeper in the living room) before ever staying here again. Do not waste your time or your money.

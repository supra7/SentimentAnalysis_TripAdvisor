We just returned from Maui and could have had a terrible vacation had we not been able to cancel out of our reservations at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. Think the worst Best Western in west Texas and you'll still be disappointed with what you get. The rooms are long overdue for a renovation, the beds are worn out, the rooms stink and there are bugs at the front desk and even bugs in the soap packages in the room! The grounds are ok but the pool is small when compared to the other hotels right next door. Over priced and over rated. The location on the beach is attractive but there are other options right next door including more modern Westin, Sheraton, Hyatt and The Whaler condos. Don't be swayed by all the reviews about how nice the staff are. They are just as freindly at the other hotels as well. We had originally booked for 8 nights but after staying 1 night we were fortunate enough to be able to switch to the Sheraton Maui at Block Rock. Still had a beach view and for less money! Now that is a great hotel. We were able to have a fantastic Maui experience staying at the Sheraton. It would not have been the case had we remained at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel.

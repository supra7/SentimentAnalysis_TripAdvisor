We upgraded into the preferred club upon our arrival. The preferred club rooms were the same size as the average rooms. Our intention was to leave the patio door open and listen to the waves from the ocean splashing on the beach through the night. However, parties at the ajoining beach properties were so loud until 3:30 am we were forced to keep our door closed. Don't waste your money on the upgrade.

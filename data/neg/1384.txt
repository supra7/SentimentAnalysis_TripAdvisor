Planned a trip to Kissimmee with my family and found this hotel on Expedia. It had pretty good reviews and the pictures were nice. The price was not cheap, but not expensive. We arrived and were given a room that had no bathtub, which for us is a problem because we have a young child who takes baths only. When we asked to be switched to a room with a tub, we were told NO rooms in the entire hotel were equipped with bathtubs!! Upon further investigation of our room, we found mucas on the wall, and bugs in the bed!! When we told the manager, he asked if this was "going to be a problem?" YES!!!! Our total stay...was 10 min, we checked in, and right back out again!!!! The hotel did not want to refund our money ($300), but Expedia got involved, and our credit card was immediately credited! PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS ROACH MOTEL....ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE TRAVELLING WITH YOUR CHILDREN!!!!

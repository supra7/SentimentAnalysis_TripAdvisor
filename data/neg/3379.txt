Having the Courtyard Marriott right next to the Fairfield Inn causes a bad case of comparison! The price was right for this hotel (stayed two nights) instead of the Coutyard Marriott. Denny's right next door if you don't want the breakfast (pretty slim picking but not that bad). Nice pool but seems like it is in lobby.

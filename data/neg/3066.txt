This hotel is located in a nice area of berlin near the ubahn station of spittelmarkt.it was clean, the rooms are a bit small but suitable for a city break. However when myself and two friends booked what was advertised on their website ( namely two double rooms with connecting door) on arrival we found that this was not the case, in fact they did not have this type of accommodation at all despite having written confirmation to the contrary. After a couple of hours deliberation we were finally accommodated. this hotel opened in my opinion too early and was not ready to receive guests. The breakfast area is located two sides of a passway in the lower basement of the hotel. found this a bit claustophobic. Reception staff do not comnmunicate with each other when trying to solve a problem that did arise when we stayed there. with time and effort this could improve and maybe this hotel will rise in its rating.

Hotel is clean, conveniently located, and well-priced, with friendly staff. Had no problems with booking or check-in, although it seemed odd that we were asked to pay in full upon checking in. Perhaps a lot of guests depart early? We did - none of the people in our party could get a good night's sleep due to noise - the front rooms face a bus terminal and hear buses idling and beeping when they back up, at all hours of the night. Another room toward the back of the building shared an air duct with the room across the hall, and we could pretty much hear every word the neighbors spoke. Seems like a safe, friendly bargain hotel for young travelers who plan to stay out late anyway, but not a good choice for light sleepers.

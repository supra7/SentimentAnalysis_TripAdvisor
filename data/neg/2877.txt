the hotel is made only for chinese people.... i stayed there for 4 days the rooms are small and the bread for all 4 days at the breakfast table was stale and even had fungus on it... except for reception each and every staff is chinese and cannot understand english... on the breakfast i asked the staff for a boiled egg dhey refused to me saying they dont have it and 10 min later a chinese man was served the same.... on complaining to the manager he said we have good chinese customers and we serve them well... the air conditioner was not working in my room and when i requested to change the room or to get the air con fixed they denied it saying the hotel was full... on chatting with the cleaning staff later we were informed the occupancy is less than 60%... if ur chinese this is the place to be if ur not chinese dont even stay there for free...

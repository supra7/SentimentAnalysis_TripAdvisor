Location - ideal for convention centre, Petco and Gas Lamp Quarter. Room - clean (nothing spectacular). Very expensive USD 140 plus USD 25 parking. We declined the chargeable upgrade at check-in which meant we didn't have a view. We ate out so I can't comment about the restaurants. In the morning our passports disappeared from our room. Only housekeeping had access but the security guys obviously didn't believe us. It cost a small fortune in money and time ....... police reports, embassy visits, replacement documents etc. During this time the entire Hilton staff (reception, security, lost property, housekeeping, management) could not have been less helpful. A couple of weeks after returning to the UK, our passports had been recovered and were forwarded onto us from the Hilton. I can't see that I will ever stay in a Hilton again.

Positives: Near the airport, near the supermarkets, low cost hotel Negatives: This is located in Deira which is a very busy place. It is very hard to get a taxi. If you plan to stay in this hotel for a holiday, it is better to take tour packages which has hotel pick up. Telephone was not working (at least based on our experience). Don't expect a good breakfast. Place mats on the table are very dirty. Some staff are friendly while others are not. Even though, you have already prepaid your stay through a credit card, the front desk receptionist will ask for your passport as a deposit. Otherwise, he will ask for money equivalent to 1-2 days stay for deposit. Don't give your passport. It is better to give money for your deposit. If you need to take a taxi, leave early in the morning. You can still find taxi in the adjacent major street Naif road during the early morning say between 6:00 to 7:00 am. Good luck.

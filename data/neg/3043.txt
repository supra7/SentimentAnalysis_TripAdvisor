The room when you arrive is not ready and the reception staff make you wait for 1/2 hour while trying to get you into the "sister hotel." They seem to have no booking policy and overbook the hotel. There was an early check out (not suprising) and I had to wait for that room whilst it was "Cleaned." I was told to go for a coffee and given brief direction through a car park to a "restaurant" (more like a cafe.) The coffee was tepid and breakfast inedible and cold. Service was also non-existant. After a day we checked out and went to the Habtoor which for not much more money made a more pleasant stay in Dubai.

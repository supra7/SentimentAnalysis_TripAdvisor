The only good thing about this hotel is the location. We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights before our cruise to Alaska (room only thank goodness). The hotel decor was depressing the sheets were threadbare and the bathroom the pits. They messed up our booking due to the fact that someone there booked us in the previous weekend so when we arrived on the Friday evening at 10.00pm US time (very tired) after a 10 hour flight they said there was no reservation for us. We had no option but to use our credit card to cover a one nights stay until it was sorted. We then had to wake up at 3.00am to phone the travel agent (due to the time difference) to try and sort it. This did not get sorted properly until the Sunday morning when we were due to leave for the cruise. This spoilt our stay in Seattle.

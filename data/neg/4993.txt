For $30 bucks a night- you pretty much get what you pay for. This my experience at El Cortez: I had reserved a non-smoking room, and they gave me the opposite. I had put the DO NOT DISTURB sign outside my door, and three hours into my stay, a maintenance man knocks on my door telling me that he had to fix the bathtub because it was not draining properly and the faucet was leaking. I got hungry, and thought I'd try their Chinese Buffet downstairs... it was the worst chinese food I've ever had. Worst than those fast food chinese places in your neighborhood. The location itself is pretty ghetto and slummy. And the hotel was kinda dirty. But like I said, you kinda expect these things when you're paying bargain basement price.

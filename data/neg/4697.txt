Rooms are small but very clean. Pool closed on one day, yet hotel still wanted to charge patrons $11 to work out in exercise room. Common sense would dictate the hotel pick up the cost to work out in exercise room. Brought this up to hotel staff and they said hotel and exercise room are owned by two disparate companies, thus unable to waive cost. Still, that doesn't preclude the hotel from picking up the tab for exercise room when they close the pool, without notice, for repairs. In all, people are generally very friendly and hospitable. There was, however, a bit too much construction going on in the a.m. Daughter was trying to sleep at 8 a.m. and was awakened by the sound of hammering from above (we were at one of the top floors). If I had it all to do over again, I'd pay the extra $$ and stay on the north side of the river.

Very disappointing. We booked (and paid in advance for) a room on the Towers Level as part of our honeymoon trip to the States & Carribean. On arrival we were shown to a lower grade room on a different level without any explanation. When we queried this we were told the Towers Level was closed for refurbishment. Surprisingly(?!) there were lots of guests who appeared to be involved in a convention at the hotel using the Towers Level. We got some money back, but it didn't offset not getting the room we expected for our honeymoon.

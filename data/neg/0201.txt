Stayed at the Crowne Plaza at the end of April, 2007 and it was just ok. Reserved a room on the "Executive Club Level" and it was a joke. They have complementary beverages and snacks EXCEPT for Fri and Sat. Hello? Don't most people stay in hotels on the weekends? They instead gave us a coupon to use at their restaurant. Who wants to eat at the hotel when you have a beautiful city like Seattle to explore? Definitely not worth the upgrade to executive. The view was spectacular, rooms were average at best. No microwave, refrigerator barely kept drinks cool. "Sleeping aid" package is a joke. One thing that was nice was the location. It was within walking distance from Qwest field and Pike Market. After talking with some friends that stayed at the Hyatt (and seeing their lobby and room), I will stay there next time. The Hyatt has a "club regency" floor that was WAY nicer than anything at the Crowne Plaza. Will not stay here again.

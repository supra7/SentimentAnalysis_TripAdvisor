I do not suggest staying here. I decided to stay here rather than the Copley Westin since I have stayed at the Kei Lani in Maui and liked it. Not this Boston Fairmont. Not a lean hotel. Saw a mouse in my room and was moved. Could NOT believe that I again saw a mouse near the elevator too...Never felt clean in this hotel. The bathrooms are TINY too. Not worth the money. Never again.

On the way to town, my transfer driver asked where I was staying. He said: "That's a five star hotel but it is not a five star hotel." I asked him where I should eat: "Not at the hotel." His review was spot on. On the surface, this place is nice: a pool, marble everywhere, etc. But it doesn't hold up once you are in the room. Non-smoking rooms that stink of smoke. I asked to move. A shower with no door, so the place gets soaked in a shower. Mold on the caulking. No coffee maker, just one towel, beds hard as rocks and an air conditioner that made sleeping difficult with its howling. The service was grudgingly friendly, as if my requests, as a customer in a "deluxe room" paying 200 dollars/night didn't rate alongside those of the clearly wealthy businessmen and families making demands. And the food was mediocre. A 15 euro breakfast got you a boring buffet the same as every other hotel buffet in Turkey. Though the "western" coffee was decent. Further, the milk you for every cent: 200/night does not get free printing in the "business centre" (which include a couple computers and a printer and a fax machine) but instead you pay 95 euro cents per page! The wireless is of intermittent quality in the rooms, occasionally dropping out, which is frustrating on a conference VOIP call. As for cleanliness: my room was clean, except for the mildew and so on, and except for the opened box of milk that had been in the mini-bar for a long, long time. I opened the door and the blast of sour milk smell was charming. My friend was around the corner in the Nippon at 95 euros/night. Brighter, more comfy in many ways, and utterly friendly service. Go there.

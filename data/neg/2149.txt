We just arrived to HTR and from beggining I'm very disappointed. This is my 5'th time is Rivera Maya. We usually stay at Dreams or Iberostar hotels. Like always I send them and e-mail befor, requesting king bad with nice view. I received parking view room with double bads. I called and ask them for king size bad and better view and they told me that they are famili frandly resort and they don't have a king size bads. But they Italian restautant, and one of the pools is adult only. Go figure... My request to talk to the manager was left unattendent. I'm stlll wainting, by the way. Now about beach - it stinks and it is dark brown. Pools don't have steps, not easy to access and especially get out. I'm very disappointed. Food is middle core nothing special about it. If you ever been in Dreams Resorts, this one is not for you. Service at the front desk is really bad. They don't care about you, only thing that they care is to sell you time-share. I said NO for this resort, NEVER AGAIN. I have a high expectations, I'm looking for high-end customer servive. This hotel doesn't have this. My next trip will be to Dreams, where they care about me. Thank you.

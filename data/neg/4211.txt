I booked this hotel for its location and the history of a grand hotel. What ever you do, stay away from the Boston Park Plaza. My room was small with also no room for moving about. The paint was chipping, the carpet was dirty, hardware were missing in the bathroom. The general condition is just sub-sub standard for a hotel of this class. I even had to pay to have my lauggage stored for a few hours because we were there too early. I had hotels in Asia that will keep my lauggage for days when I went on a side trip at no costs to me. Unless you are paying $35 per night, this is a poor poor value.I have to say that the front line employee were all very professional and were doing their best to make a poor situation seems better. There are many good hotels in Boston in this price range; my advise is to stay away from the Park Plaza.

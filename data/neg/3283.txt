Stayed at the Amerisuites for one night with boyfriend. The hotel is really clean although I did receive a double room when I reserved a king room. The problem was fixed very quickly.The room was clean although in no way shape or form a suite in my opinion. There is a wall that separates the bedroom from the sitting area and I found the room the smallest suite I've ever seen. The kitchen is functional with small fridge, microwave, and stove. However, the problem is insulation. We heard every noise going on outside from the construction, the people upstairs, the people walking by outside in the hallways. There is no insulation to guard against noise. Didn't get a good nights sleep at all. The heating unit is one of those in the wall units that only heats the immediate area which wouldn't be a problem if Texas was not having an ice storm that day so it was freezing! The breakfast buffet was decent as long as you don't mind warming it up. There are very few restaurants nearby and the staff is not very knowledgable. I would not return but may be economical choice for business travelers

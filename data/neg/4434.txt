I've stayed in this hotel several times, and I have to say that things are getting pretty bad. We dealt with maids not observing the "do not disturb sign" early in the morning, fire trucks blairing all hours of the night, and teenage kids in the hallways screaming and slamming doors. I'm not generally very picky when it comes to hotels. I want a clean room and sound sleep. You'll only get one of the two at this property. Also, the clothes washing situation is deplorable. There are two washers and two dryers for the whole hotel. They each require $1.50 to operate plus $1.50 for detergent. That's $4.50 per load of clothes... ALL IN QUARTERS!!! The front desk didn't have quarters, so I went to the bar -- no quarters. I walked down to the Seven11, Subway, another Seven11, and down two city blocks looking for quarters. It was absolutely ridiculous. It takes 18 quarters to do a load, and I had two loads to wash! The hotel staff couldn't have cared less. All this to say, I definitely would NOT stay in this hotel again. There are plenty of other options in Chicago.

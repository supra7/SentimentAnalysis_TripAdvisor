We stayed here for its close proximity to St Pancras, as we had a Eurostar journey early the next morning. I was aware that the area is fairly busy, but didn't realise to what extent. The traffic does not stop, or even slightly diminish, at any point during the night. Worse, the hotel is opposite a fire station, which means regular sirens, and a church is also nearby which bizarrely seemed to chime every quarter-hour even during the night. Basically, you won't get to sleep. I'd say i'm a pretty heavy sleeper myself, but found it extremely difficult to get to sleep. I guess the main problem may be that were given a ground floor room in the hotel, right next to the road, and we were unable to change rooms as it was fully booked. I suppose if you end up with the right room, you might not hear the traffic - but why play Russian roulette? The actual hotel, apart from the noise level, is fine - same as any other newish Travelodge. You know what to expect: Tea, running water, TV, itchy starchy sheets, free soap.

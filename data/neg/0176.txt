We could hear everything from our neighbors under the door. To be fair we were there as part of a comic book convention and we should have thought of the type of teenagers, etc. that would be there at the same time. I think odd numbered rooms face the highway and it was HORRIBLY noisy. We complained and were switched sides and it was very nice for sleeping. On the other side of the hotel the ear plugs they provided weren't enough to help me sleep! We'll not stay here again. We were in a high numbered room and the highway noise was still horrible.

I was on crutches when we stayed at this hotel. There was no hadicapped parking and we had to park outside on the roof. We had to walk down two ramps in the rain to get to the elevator only to find that it wasn't working on that floor. We were not allowed to drop off due to the $36.00 valet. When we complained to the front desk about the inconvenience they were very rude and unconcerned. This was so not the service we expected from a Hilton. We will NEVER stay at a Hilton hotel again. When we returned home I contacted the home offices and have yet to receive a response. Not even close to what customer service should be in a supposedly high end hotel.

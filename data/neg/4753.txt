I am completely baffled by all of the good reviews, and I do not understand why this hotel would be ranked at all by Travel & Leisure. It is outdated, and probably has not been updated since 1990. As a Chicagoan I am ashamed that this would be a place that would be recommended to stay in this wonderful city. Nearby is the Sofitel, and Four Seasons which are not that much more expensive and have much better service. The Sutton Place is small and not charming and the service is non-existent. Housekeeping knocked twice this morning to clean the room while we were still sleeping. Housekeeping stood outside the door waiting for us to leave last night after we requested turn-down service. There is a cd player, but no ipod dock. Who uses cd's?, and the ones in the room were from 1990?!?!?! We did not even have a coffee maker in the room. When we checked out, we had to wait in a long line because there is no express checkout, as they actually use keys for the rooms instead of cards like every other hotel in the 21st century. Then the reception desk smartly did not ask us how our stay was because they probably knew that it wasn't to the caliber we were sold. We also could not fill-out the comment card in the room, because we couldn't find a pen anywhere in the room! Our last moment before finally leaving was waiting 15 minutes for our suitcase they had held for us.Please choose another of the dozens of hotels in Chicago with great service and great gold coast location - I love the Sofitel, or if you want budget in the area stay at the Whitehall. The Sutton place should never be on the same list as the Peninsula, Four Seasons, and Sofitel.

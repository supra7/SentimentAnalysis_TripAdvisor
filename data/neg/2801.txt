This was my first and last stay in this hotel. The hotel tower itself is impressive enough and so is the room design. And when you're high up, the views are incredible. Staff is friendly enough and most of them speak good English for Spanish standards. The 135 Euro room rate was also fair enough. Dealbreakers for me: No hot water in the morning. Only ice cold water. Other than "sorry" no solution or compensation offered. I could not take a shower or wash properly and had to shave with ice cold water. Only to end up with a 20 minute wait for checkout. The checkout desk was fully staffed (4 people) at 7:45am but it takes between 5 and 10 minutes for each guest to check out and I had at least 10 people in front of me and the line quickly grew to about 20 behind me with aggravated business people like myself under pressure to get to their meetings. Unacceptable for a 5-star hotel and there are far better options available in Madrid.

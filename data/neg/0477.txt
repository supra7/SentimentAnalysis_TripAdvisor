We booked this hotel because of the good rate and how close it was to the venue for a concert we were attending. If I had known that there was a travelodge next door I would have booked it there instead. I was very unhappy with the service that we received from the front desk staff, who was quite rude and would not answer our questions. Not only that, the rooms we had booked were unavailable, and our group was dispersed through out the hotel... We were also never informed that the hotel was under renovation.

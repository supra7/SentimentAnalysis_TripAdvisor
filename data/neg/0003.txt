I hated staying here and would never return. I was here for a 8 days but we had hot water for morning showers for only 4 of them. It's a ratty sort of decor that you get tired of looking at very quickly. The location is good but there are other hotels nearby and the worst part is that as you travel from the Monaco to the convention center and other places you stare wistfully at those other hotels wishing you had made the better choice and stayed at them. The only reasonable feature of the Monaco is the staff, all of whom are relentlessly friendly and helpful; for example, they gave us a voucher to soothe the grouchiness caused by cold morning showers. The goldfish deal is a total gimmick and matters not a bit. We didn't take advantage of the afternoon wine. Our room had a view of a concrete wall from street to sky - in other words, we could see nothing. The bed was uncomfortable and there were strange noises in the room, the source of which I could never figure out. Lots of nice hotels in Seattle but this is not one of them.

If you are used to a marriot or similar you will be disappointed in this hotel. This hotel is advertised as the most hawaiin hotel and I guess that what it is. There are no fancy facilities, the pool is small and the rooms are ok. Not kept very clean, in fact there was a bug on the floor in our room when whe arrived which I purpously left to see how long it would be to be swept up....it was still there the day we left. Location, however is good......it is amongst other hotels on the beach. Another grievance was we had to pay $9 a day for parking even though we were guests at the hotel. If you are looking for an upscale hotel at Kannapali beach, I suggest the Hyatt or similar. If you are looking for a family type vacation hotel this is your place. For those of you who are English, I would compare this to a Butlins Holiday Camp without all the entertainment ( although there is some, including an english family of magicians)

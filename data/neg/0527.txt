This was a very frustrating stay. The stay began very well, as the front desk clerk was extremely friendly. However, I was disappointed that for $250.00 a night I experienced the following: sheets that when I moved it woke me up multiple times (I likened it to sleeping in Christmas wrapping paper); and two gigantic bird droppings on our bedroom window. Additionally, when we went to breakfast in the morning at the Daily Grill Restaurant we experienced a 15-20 minute wait. While this typically would not be bothersome, it is when you see over five empty tables that were not being bussed. The restaurant had only one busser moving below average speed (I would be too, if I was stuck bussing an entire restaurant by myself). Anyways, we ultimately got sat after one of the tables that was dirty when we walked in was bussed 15-20 minutes later. Our wait should never have taken place. While many people will praise this hotel for its location, the Seattle downtown is HUGE. There are hotels on nearly every other corner, each with a prime location. In fact, friends stayed at the Washington Athletic Club one block away and were granted with an equally nice room and view, at a price of only $150.00. Overall, I was disappointed, because if I'm going to pay $250.00 a night, I want to walk into a well-oiled machine and not feel nickel-and-dimed. I will definitely not be a repeat customer at that Sheraton.

I am re-submitting my review b/c many of you wanted to know why my husband and I were not happy with the resort. First of all, I have to say I had a great time, not because of the resort. Because of my wonderful husband, amazing location, beach and just being far far away from the stresses of home/work. Good: Beach is Amazing The people can not be any nicer, they all will bend over backwards to make you happy. The rooms are big and nice, our bath tub wasn't working. the resort is nice, I have been to better...but the beach makes up for it. Things that were bad, but eventually will get better: Not all the rooms are available, we got double beds and they didn't switch us until 3 days later. They are understaffed, don't listen to what anyone else says. Thats coming from some of the staff themselves who have been working double shifts. B/C of the under staffed situation the service isn't that great as far as clean rooms etc. No Spa Things that were JUST BAD: The food, very bad. beef and chicken horrible. Fish was ok, sometimes raw so ask them to cooked it well done. the French restaurant was a nightmare, and talking another couple so was the italian. Breakfast was great. And I know a lot of people are getting mad at the bad reviews saying this is a new resort. Thats not why my husband and i are upset. we are upset because we were misinformed. we paid good money and spent quite a bit of time planning this vacation, but we were very disappointed. There were reasons why we chose this resort, and none of those features we received. It is important to let you know that this was not my first time in Mexico, this was my 4th trip down there. So I am not naive about my expectations. I have been to 4 star resort as well as 5 star. In my opinion a 3 star resort would have better food than them.

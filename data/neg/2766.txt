I totally agree with the universally bad reviews on this site. After travelling around the US for 5 weeks, this was undoubtedly and singlehandedly the worst accomodation we experienced. We stayed in several very good Super 8 motels, however, this one was so bad that it has put us off ever visiting another again. A shame that one bad experience has led to this, however, better safe than sorry. The guy at the front desk's reception was cold, unsmiling and indifferent, however, in fairness, as soon as he discovered we were New Zealanders his countenance transformed and he became friendly. Not a good first impression, however. The room was dirty and dusty. For some reason every item of furniture, apart from the bed, had been placed in the centre of the room. It was as if the cleaners had moved them to clean behind them. Unfortunately, they appeared to have not been bothered about doing any cleaning & had either forgotten or been too lazy to replace them from the centre of the room. The towels were old and ripped & the smoke alarm hanging from the ceiling by its wires, quite probably non-functioning. I felt like I was in a scummy backpackers in a 3rd world country, although, having travelled extensively in the third world, few places I stayed in were as appalling as this. On checking out, the girl at reception met me with a cold, blank stare, took my room key without a word, and didn't offer any thanks or basic niceties. We checked into another 'chain' motel in Memphis the next day and had a completely different experience. We had a wonderful time in this city and stayed longer than we thought. It's a great place to visit, however, do not, under any circumstances stay in this cesspool. If this was our only experience of Memphis we would have shortened our visit considerably.

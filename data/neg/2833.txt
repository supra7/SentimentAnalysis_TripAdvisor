Booked this hotel for one night of our honeymoon on the strength of previous Tripadvisor reviews and I'm afraid it didn't live up to our expectations. First, when we arrived neither the safe nor the shower was in working order. Although the safe was subsequently repaired this happened too late for us to actually use it. The shower was not repaired at all (forcing us to improvise our own fix using a hair clip!) and we were given no explanation as to why. In addition, despite paying for one of the more expensive rooms breakfast was not included in the rate; in fairness, we should probably have checked this in advance but I have stayed in Paris numerous times in the past and never paid this much for a hotel which charged extra for breakfast. In addition, the room was far too nosiy: the windows are very poorly soundproofed and we were woken at 5am by the sound of traffic outside. There's also no air con so the room was very stuffy at night. I reported all of these complaints to the front desk on check out and asked that they be conveyed to management: however I have yet to receive any response or apology. The one thing I will say in mitigation is that the front desk staff are very friendly and helpful but they can't make up for a hotel that is overpriced for the level of service and comfort we experienced.

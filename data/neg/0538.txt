I never write reviews of hotels, but wanted to share that while hotel location is great, it lacks in a few other areas. I'll start off saying the lobby is very nice, staff is great, Daily Grill restaurant in hotel is good. Where it lacked was in the cleanliness of the room and other services. Room smelled musty and carpet was dirty. Air conditioner clanked when fan on low and medium. Internet connection (via wireless and ethernet cable) sucked. Attended a conference in hotel, heard loud drilling throughout sessions (renovation of ice/vending areas in progress). Went from Seattle to Chicago where I stayed in at a differnet chain's property and the comparison was vastly better. Shame.

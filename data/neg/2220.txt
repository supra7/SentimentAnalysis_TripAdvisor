I could right a novel on how bad this place was but I will shorten it. First, our room had never been cleaned for 20 years. The amount of filth on the floor was soo built up that we had to wear shower shoes and turn off the lights so we could not see how nasty it really was. Second, the window was covered in mould as well as the walls, the showers, the floor, the microwave and the tables. These people who run this place are disgusting. Third, the window was broken, the door had fist holes in it, the microwave and all kitchen utensils were unusable becuase no amount of soap could clean them. I felt dirty just being in the hotel. Fourth, the staff was none exsistent, and were completely rude. I have slept outside and felt cleaner then I felt in this place. On the way out we saw the exterminator come to deal with the bug problem. No air conditioning and even if there was I would not use because you might contract TB. I would not let my dog sleep here. Furthermore, I have never written a negative review about any hotel, but this place needs to be condemmend. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!

We made our reservation after reading the excellent reviews on TA. The good points: the hotel is located near the theme parks. The bad points: location near the theme parks means you are in the middle of nowhere, or better, in the epicentre of hundreds of junk food providers. At check-in the receptionist first gave us hotel key cards which did not suit the allotted room and, worse, after all the trouble going up and down the elevator and to and fro the reception, we realized that we had received access to more than the allocated hotel room (!), i.e. we had access to the room of our neighbours as well. Furthermore, our room had already been occupied by other guests! One of the guests told us that he had arrived the same day and the same thing had happened to him as well. Avoid the breakfast in the hotel, it is poor by European standards. The remote control had one battery missing. We left it there for the housekeeping woman but she ignored it and did not replace the battery. Next annoyance: We wanted to print out tickets for the KSC using the printer in the business centre. After purchasing a card for the computer and the printer (which by the way had run out of paper) I realized that the computer did not have Adobe Reader installed! Hence I had to download Adobe to print out the tickets using up several more dollars of my account. I informed the receptionist that you cannot call something a business centre with important software not installed on the computer. I was told that the business centre was run by another company and that I could contact them if I liked. No intention on his side to give me some discount to compensate for these mishaps.

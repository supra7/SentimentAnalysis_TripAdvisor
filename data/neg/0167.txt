Generally i'm not a picky traveller, and i've stayed at the ace several times in the past 2 yrs but the this last visit will be the last. The Ace is a great concept, hipper than thou warholian installation a la auberge. Knowing that some rooms are better than others I reserved well in advance and requested one of the deluxe rooms in the back. When i arrived they'd given the room to someone else offering the excuse, "well, the previous guest decided to stay an extra day", and the front desk person was very rude and put out by the whole exchange. The room i ended up with was small dark and very noisy. It was impossible to sleep or enjoy staying in the room as you could hear everthing from the adjacent rooms. Nothing like listening to "Cops" blasting from the room next door at 1AM, or hearing your neighbors snoring, coughing, flushing their toilet, and wondering how much they could hear as well. Unless you're twenty something and planning on partying all night and coming home and passing out aka leading the psuedo rock star life style i suggest stearing clear. There are plenty of other places in the area to stay.

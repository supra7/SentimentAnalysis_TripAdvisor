The carpet is new, but the mattresses are old, filthy and smelled like urine. The "newly renovated" refers to the carpet only. Management is horrible and smokers are welcome. If you are a chain smoker, enjoy the smell of urine, then this is the place for you. Management should be ashamed of themselves. I am a gold member and I checked out after seeing these mattresses are at least 10 years old with bugs on them. Ick.

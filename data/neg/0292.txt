This hotel is about 3 blocks from Pike's Street Market and 11 blocks from Amtrak station. That is one of the reasons we chose it. Problems: It's really old and needs renovation, there is no air condition, there are street people hanging outside the door, there is no parking for the hotel, parking behind hotel is $7 for 2 hours, there are night clubs opened most of the night so you get entertained wheither you want to or not, you can't close the windows because there is no a/c, some of the windows are at fire escape so you don't want to leave them open, and last but not least, the mirror in the bathroom opens to the outside.

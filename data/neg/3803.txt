Within 45 minutes of checkin I received a call in our room from the office with an irrrate manager literally screaming in the background that we were making too much noise...my 17 yr. old son, husband and I were unloading vehicle to our 2nd floor room (no elevator). Night #2 around 6 pm my husband and I were sitting on our bed deciding where to eat and the phone rang....The manager "DEVON" was yelling at my husband about us making too much noise!!!! My husband tried to reason with this manager but was in disbelief when he was told to walk quieter....stress & anxiety was our experience staying at Tides Motel because of the manager. We will NEVER recommend or visit this place again.

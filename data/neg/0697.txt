All I can say is the front desk staff - (Thomasina or something) - she was the worst I have seen in awhile. You can give some leeway to age, etc., but outside of that - she was so rude. Ugh. The hotel was OK , it really only has the location going for it. Also, as I was looking around the hotel there was a sales person and a manager arguing in the gift shop. Classy.

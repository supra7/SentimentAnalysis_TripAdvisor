While it is obvious that this hotel has been recently "renovated," it still has its share of issues. First, the a/c is different temperatures depending on what floor you're on. There are no temp controls in the room, you have to call the front desk, and when they say they'll adjust it for you, they DON'T. Secondly, this hotel advertises free wi-fi access, but don't expect to use it if you are staying on an upper floor. They only have one router - the one on the first floor. I was staying on the 6th floor, and had to go hang out in the 2nd floor breakfast area to use the internet. Third, the elevator almost never works during the day. It's like it can't handle the volume of calls to the different floors. It's terribly small, creaky, unreliable, and OLD. Nothing like paying over $100 for a room and then having to walk up 6 flights of stairs. The fourth issue is the outside noise that is all too prevalent. People screaming outside at 2am, the city jackhammering out the sidewalk at 7am... don't expect to get a good night's sleep here!! Fifth is breakfast. Your options are milk, juice, coffee, bagels, cereal, and donuts. Occasionally you are offered yogurt, but that wasn't consistent. Not the greatest breakfast, but my greatest complaint is that there is no cream cheese for the bagels. I mean, come on!! They offer butter and jelly, who puts that on bagels?! The last point of concern is the bathroom. It's almost impossible to get into the shower without getting water all over the floor, the towel rack is in the most inconvenient place possible, and you can't turn on the bathroom light without an incredibly loud fan running the entire time. While the negatives greatly outweigh the positives, I don't want to entirely discount this hotel. To its credit, it has a great central location, and it isn't dirty in the least. However, that's about all I can brag on. Do yourself a favor and find a better hotel!!

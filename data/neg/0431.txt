I chose this hotel because I am a Marriott rewards member, and this was the closest hotel in the chain to my destination downtown. This was my third stay at the hotel, and once again I had to ask (after checking in) to be moved from a room overlooking I-5 even after I had specifically made the request, and was assured by the reservationist, that I would not receive a room on that side of the hotel. I understand that they need to move those rooms but the whole check-in charade has gotten old. However, the biggest complaint I had was the lack of free wireless internet. The fee for wired internet service is $10/day. The hotel staff I encountered during my stay were all very friendly, from the housekeeping personnel to the room service staff. They were the ones who made my overall stay much more pleasant. Next time I travel on business in the Seattle area though I'll probably stay at either the Spring Hill Suites or Residence Inn downtown - they seem to have the accommodations which more closely fit my needs.

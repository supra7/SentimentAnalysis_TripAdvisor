Not good from the start I'm afraid, for those that know it there is a character in Little Britain "computer says No" that was our welcome on the Sunday - maybe she didn't want to be in work? No help with parking despite being told in advance that there was off street parking "No space, ask tomorrow, you can pay outside tonight and hope to get a space tomorrow" Once a police officer arrived outside to help us things changed somewhat..the officer had to rush off though as there was a deal taking place across the road....thus started our stay in Seattle The room was clean but small, bed comfortable. However we were opposite a dog park (yes a park dedicated to doggie fun..paddling pool the lot!!) so that was very noisy early in the morning - people taking their dogs there before leaving for work I guess? Public transport was excellent, walk too far to main part of town really but good bars and restaurants 5 minutes away if you can put up with the tramps, beggars, dealers, prositutes....i just couldn't- hated every minute of it. I felt unsafe there the whole time - and I live in London, not a quiet village somewhere. Such a shame, I was so looking forward to Seattle, but never again. We were told that they were trying to "upmarket the area" hope it happens, but the area was unpleasant and the photographs of the hotel didn't quite add up to what we saw.

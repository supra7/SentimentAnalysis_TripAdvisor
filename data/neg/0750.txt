Biggest problem: my room smells. In fact, the room, the fridge, the hallway outside the room, and the elevator all smell bad and each in different ways. There was also a wet spot on my carpet, a stain on my duvet, and the bathroom light switches are grotty. I know different people have different standards, so for reference, in the past twelve months I've had 30 different hotel stays around the country, and this is the first hotel that seemed gross to me. This would be unacceptable at any price, and at this price it's an outrage. I tried to move, but everything is booked up for a conference.

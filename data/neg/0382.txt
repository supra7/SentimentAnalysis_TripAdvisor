Executive Pacific Plaza Hotel, Downtown Seattle. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody as the basic hygene conditions were also not met. On checking in and visiting the washroom, the toilet had urine in it. The towel had shaved hair on it. The bath tub did not drain and I was forced to be partially submerged in dirty water while taking a shower. Try and find another place, any other place but not this.

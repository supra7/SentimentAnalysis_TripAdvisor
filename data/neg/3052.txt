I am starting to get very sceptical about tripadvisors' reviews - which is very disappointing. We thought we got a fantastic deal at 160 (about 180 Euros) per night for a very highly rated hotel on Tripadvisor. Excited, that is, until we actually saw the room - a miserable pokey room with zero view (the window looks into directly into a wall & windows of another building). It does have a flat screen tv (which must be standard issue in this hotel) which we never switched on and a creepy door leading presumably to another room. I complained immediately at the downstairs office and they said politely sorry that is what you get for a standard double room. Separately I asked for a couple of other routine requests that I would have thought a hotel should be able to service and they politely said no they could not help - no effort was made to assist. I will acknowledge some positives - nice modern bathroom (although the door leading to the bathroom had a dirty black mark on it), beds were ok, breakfast ok, also they did not charge for the water we had from the mini bar. Overall, nice central location but poor room.

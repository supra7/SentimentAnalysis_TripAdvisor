was lured to hotel by promotion that gave you $50 credit if you presented a gas receipt for up to $50 and you parked your car over night. upon checking out I got a $43 credit and a reduction of taxes due of $7. So I received $43 not $50 advertised credit (sould be $50 credit which triggers an automatic reduction in tax, unrelated to credit). More shocking is they dont" tell you they charge $43 to park your car overnight, yes $43 for overnight parking!!!! More significant, the rooms are small and my room had a very distinct off smell that was very unpleasent. For the money it is not worth it and if you have a car you pay $43 plus tax per night just to park!

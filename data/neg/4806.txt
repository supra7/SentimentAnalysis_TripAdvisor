These people are crooks and do not have common sense! Make a long story short, they made a $200 charge on my credit card for a smoking fee. What?!!! Hello, me and my husband are non smokers. We even advised the front desk that our room smelled like smoke, to which they kept telling us to hold on (were understaffed). We figured it was no big deal and left to our dinner reservation until weeks later saw the charge on our statement. For which, the manager declined to credit it. What do they base themselves on??!! Can they show me proof? Very rude and just waiting to see where they can steal from you. Will never stay at another starwood hotel in my life, and will def tell my enourmous circle of friends and family about this!!!

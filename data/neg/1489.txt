We had reservations for 2 rooms for over 3 months. When we arrived they only had 1 room for us. When we showed the mngr our confirmation he said gee sorry, I can give you 1 room with 2 king beds and a pull out, FOR 8 PEOPLE. Since nobody will return phone calls or e-mails, with an explaination as to what happened, one can only assume they were greedy on a busy weekend and wanted to get more for at least 1 of our rooms. Its too bad, it looked like a nice place, and probably is, just very poor managment. BEWARE !!!!!!!!!

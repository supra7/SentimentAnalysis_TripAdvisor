Only stay here if you have no other options We did not have an enjoyable stay at this hotel. When we arrived it took nearly 30 minutes to get checked in. The front desk was very disorganized and understaffed. Despite the fact that we had reserved a room with two queen beds for three people ($65 per night), we were given a room with a single king sized bed. Once we had checked in, we were given a key to a room that already had guests in it. When we returned to the front desk to get a different key, there was no one there. We had to wait in the lobby for another 15 minutes until he returned. The room was very basic. Nothing to get excited about. To top things off, the thermostat did not work so we were unable to shut off the air conditioning.The day after checking out, I called the manager and requested a refund. After listening to the problems we encoutered, she granted a refund of the $65.

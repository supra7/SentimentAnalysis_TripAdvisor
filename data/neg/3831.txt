The Marriott property is expensive even at Convention rates but I could have been at a Motel 6 or hostel with the my experience this week. First of all, the power went out which meant cold showers, dark rooms and walking up 14 flights of stairs. Next, the lack of communcation on the part of the staff was unbelievable. We had no understanding of what had caused the power outage, when we could expect power to be restored (basically were told 4:30 then 8pm then 12midnight, etc...) to no avail. The staff gave out water and glow sticks if you happened to be "hanging out" in the lobby that also had no power or internet. If you left the hotel you had no idea about what was being offered guests. One surprise was that now that the light is on, I realize that the granola bars given to me were EXPIRED (1/12). I guess since it was dark we shouldn't notice, right? The noise in the hallways was loud as well as from the stairwells and outside. I would recommend the Hilton if you come to this location. Although Marriott may have a good name nationally (better than the Hilton chain which can be quite variable), the mgt at Hilton worked to have generators restore power, internet, hot showers quickly AND put guests up at an alternative Hilton locations (with free transportation) that had power. You might wonder what the guests at Marriott were given for the trouble? A $100 discount TOTAL for 3 nights stay (~ $33/night) on a $237/night room rate. Even with power this hotel is not worth it. Yes, the location is convenient to the convention center, but this property does not live up to the chain's reputation. The one positive is that the beds are comfortable.

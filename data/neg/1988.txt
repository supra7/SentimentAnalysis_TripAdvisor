It took 1 hour to get our luggage after several phone calls to the bell desk. The valet person that greeted us upon arrival was rude and impatient. The tv in the bathroom did not work (not really important but still). The tv in the bedroom was fuzzy and then the cable went out (second day was working). The pillowcases were missing and had to call housekeeping several times. After an hour my husband flagged down a housekeeper in the hallway who was kind enough to replace them for us. The room smelled like cigarette smoke and it is a non-smoking hotel. Enough said.

we were really looking forward to a great city break in barcelona, our first time in the city, been advised to stay in the Gothic Quarter in the heart of the city. searched hotels and found great rates for a new four star hotel, website made it sound perfect. and it was, but to get to the hotel you have to walk approximatly 5 minutes up side streets from metro. One of the streets you take your life in your own hands as everyone looks like they are about to mug you, and on the other you go into the heart of the red light district and it is not pleasent. One afternoon the sun was shining and we sat in the bar to have cocktails, but the small square outside sat what can only be described as scarey characters and prostitutes. it was like being in gold fish bowl with a cat waiting for you to jump out and eat you. really not good. we stayed in and had a meal in the resturant or got taxi everywhere when it got dark. we were brave during the day!! which all added to the cost Another small thing, the swimming pool, is small to say the least i would think paddling pool would be a better discription. if you want to survive you trip to barcelona dont stay here. sadly great hotel built in wrong place

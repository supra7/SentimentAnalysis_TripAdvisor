From everything I saw on the website for this hotel I thought it was going to be a nice stay. However, once we arrived to the hotel I was surprised at a few things. First was the size of the room and bathroom. This is one of the few times Ive run into having a 3x3 foot shower in a hotel in the states. This is normally something done in small hotels in London or Paris but not common for Seattle. The rooms was also not much larger then the bed with windows that havent been updated for at least 50 years. Each unit has its own in window air conditioner which was appreciated. Also the rooms had very little sound proofing between each room which allowed us to hear everything the neighbors did through the night. For the price there are much better places to stay in Seattle. I would not recommend this hotel to a friend or visit it again.

Stayed there 1 1/2 nights was not impressed on a business traveler aspect. When I arrive at a hotel, I usually need to get to my room and get connected to the internet. I don't have time to wait on the bell-hop to bring my luggage to my room, I always bag-drag it myself. Case in point for any hotel manager reading this: Have your desk people ASK the customer if they would like their luggage sent to the room. Don't INSIST that it be taken up for them. As for the room: Placement for connections for electricity and internet is very inefficient. The Ethernet connection is by the bed and the desk is on the other side of the room. I had to request a cable and the maintaince guy brought me one he spiced himself. The overall design of this hotel leaves me wondering if this was a first attempt for the architect. As previously posted, rugs would help. For those who enjoy a libation, this is a dry hotel.

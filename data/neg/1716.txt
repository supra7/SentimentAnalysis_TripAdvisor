Where do I start from. Maybe from the fact that they surely are glad to have you as a guest... so that they can take as much as money as possible from you, and not offer anything in return!!! In the end, you end up just sleeping there, and getting as far away from the hotel as possible. Of all the hotels in the area, they had the worst entertainment program (almost none), you pay for your safe deposit box, parking, daily internet (for a week it equals approx. the double monthly rates that you pay at home), and the welcoming breakfast they are offering is just an embarrassment and a personal offense. But, if you are looking for a place to crash in, this is the right place for you. Check the prices in the other hotels, though. You might get more value for your money!!

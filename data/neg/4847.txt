We recently stayed at the Hilton Daytona Beach Hotel on the Oceanwalk over Thanksgiving for the National Youth Football Championships. The hotel is very pleasing to the eye, and has a lot of great offerings. However, during our stay we had several issues, they are as follows; No hot water Lack of towels Unable to get in and out of the parking lot with key card Breakfast buffet was the worse food I ever tasted Those four issues will keep me from every returning to this hotel, for the simple fact that mgmt wouldn't do a thing about it. I was not pleased with the mgmt, however I wills ay those who work in housekeeping, valet, and other areas of the hotel were outstanding.

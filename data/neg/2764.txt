I was looking for a no frills inexpensive place to sleep prior to the St Jude Half Marathon. The room met the purpose and I saw none of the "horrors" that had been expressed in other reviews of this hotel. Hotel staff was helpful and the room was clean. The continental breakfast was typical. The hotel apparently brought me luck as I was an award winner in the race.

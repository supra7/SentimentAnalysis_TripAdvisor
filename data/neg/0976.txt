We arrived an hour before check-in and after waiting 15 minutes in the lobby to check in, were given the key to our room. We were shocked to see that the desk clerk had assigned "our" room to the couple ahead of us. Thankfully they were not newlyweds. On again waiting in line, we spoke to the same clerk who was shocked that such a thing could have occurred and chose to personally check the next room herself, before assigning it to us. Presumably, she felt it was a computer, not a human error. We were not impressed by this point, especially after being confronted with a $30/night parking fee. We were then given a corner room - the only demonstrated make up - that was bright, fairly large and airy (at $260 US per night, it shoudl have been). The bathroom was tiny and the toilet did not flush until we adjusted a valve in the tank. The T.V. could not be viewed from the bed despite offering a "variety" of pay per view movies. The bed was one of the worst I have slept on. It was not the "Kimpton Perfect Bed" boasted of in their brochure. It was a hard, cheap king mattress, with no down featherbed on the non-pillow top mattress. It made for two bad nights sleep mitigated by good black out curtains (needed to augment a bad sleep with more sleep) and soundproof rooms. This hotel has potential and would be wonderful it if lived up to its brochures.

My wife stayed here March 9-10. Just like others have said, the place smelled musty and was very run down. Location of hotel is very good, but rooms are shabby and bed hurt my back. However, the price we paid for ocean front room was cheap at only $300 per night, so at that price, I wasn't expecting Westin or Ritz, but still would not recommend staying here. I won't be back, that's for sure.

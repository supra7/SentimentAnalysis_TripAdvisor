Problem #1: When we arrived at 7 PM, our concierge level room was not available anymore. No problem, they said, we'll give you concierge access. Apparently they gave access to everyone at the hotel during a convention using an inadequate facility. There was no room to sit, not enough food, you had to deal with a mob of people, plus they were closed two of the five days we were there. Ok, we had to live with that. Problem #2: Over the weekend, new neighbors moved in to the room next to us. The screaming started around 10:30pm, followed by people trying to come into our room through the connecting door, and then the front door. It took two calls, and a threat to call the Boston police for the front desk to respond to this abuse that lasted until well passed 1:30AM. We were trapped in our room, afraid for our safety. This was not acceptable. We were up most of the night, having to get up for an early flight. We will never stay in this hotel again.

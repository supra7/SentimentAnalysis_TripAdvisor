Stayed here for Daytona weekend. Checkin was abit chaotic. We were put into rm 317 which was clearly not one of the renovated ones. So here is the list of negatives. Large hole in the corner of the microwave so when you turned it on you could see into it thru the hole. Power tripped off the first day so no TV till maintenance turned up. Had to find the housekeepers every afternoon and ask them to do our room. Mildew over the outside of the fridge. Deck furniture aging and dirty. Windows were so grubby it was hard to see through them. The tap in the bath would not turn off and dripped continually, you could hear dogs barking in the neighboring rooms and the ice machine ran water for the whole time we were there. One of our beds had a spring that kept popping out and the other one had a huge sag in the middle. Pool had a number of drunk people smoking as they swam with accompanying butts. The lifts were incredibly slow. The parking was mostly disabled and beach parking so finding parking next to the building was a real challenge. On checkout the desk clerk was busy with her head in the computer and did not make eye contact or speak to me for over 3 minutes. Left me feeling very undervalued, as though I did not exist and certainly was not important. I would have told her about the faults in the room so something could be done but was so frustrated by her attitude I just wanted to get out of there. The good thing for the hotel was the maintenance man was really helpful. You can do better for your money than this hotel.

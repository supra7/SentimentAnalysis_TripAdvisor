The Lobby and it's history is nostalgic as it comes. Hands down no question about it. For my money, I would have gone somewhere else. The in room wired internet is more expensive then other major establishments, and it doesn't include phone calls. Then there is NO free wireless internet in the lobby which other major establishments do have. There is a Starbucks, but only my iPhone could connect to it. My iPad would have needed to pay for a wireless connection in the lobby and it is PER HOUR. The starbucks unfortunately (by no fault of the hotel) was under staff. Lines went out the door. This should not be, and management should call for action from Starbucks. Parking, this coming from someone from NYC. Way too expensive for valet. Room, sad to say, I have had bigger rooms for much less. Service, well I never ran in to them except for my usual 4PM Vodka Martini, so I would say average. No one was rude, staff was friendly, but for the money........I would go elsewhere. I would come back to take pictures of the Lobby, and have afternoon tea here. Thats it, nothing else

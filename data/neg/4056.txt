Stayed here 2 nights for a conference. I generally like old hotels, but have very mixed feelings about this one. The room was small, which was OK, and the bed was great. Room was clean. But the bathroom was a challenge- you were smack up against the TP rolls when using the toilet, and the sink faucet did not come out far enough so washing hands, etc. meant some wrist contortions. It got to be quite annoying and uncomfortable! There is no free internet service of any type anywhere in the hotel. Their cafe is small for such a large hotel. I would not like to stay here again if all the rooms are like this.

We stayed at this hotel upon the recommendation of our travel agent. We were going on an Alaskan cruise, and stayed here the night before. The room was terribly expensive and very, very small. Our cabin on the cruise line was bigger than this hotel room. Also, there was a wedding on the floor that we stayed on, and kept us up most of the night. The management did not seem to care of our inconvenience. The food at the restaurant was very overpriced for what we got. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!

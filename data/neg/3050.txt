Stayed at this hotel in June this year,never again!Rooms so, so,Pool area disgusting,"breakfast" a joke.Only highlight were the staff.All very helpfull but overworked.The girl on the front desk told us she hadn't had a day off for a month.If looking for somewhere to stay that won't break the bank try The Golden Sands apartments,miles better.Oh and AZ Arabia you were well and truely stitched up with the phonecalls.All local calls in the UAE are free.

I have attended an event at this venue since before it became a Sheraton or Starwood property. While it was an Adam's Mark, the staff was always polite, responsive, and at least appeared to be trying to help, even with an event that overtaxed the hotel's capacity. The first year as a Starwood property I made some concessions for the change in ownership and branding, new staff, and management inexperience with the event. I can no longer make excuses for this venue. With the exception of one manager (detail lower down), the staff was rude, unresponsive, and incapable of assisting with any requests, answering any questions, or finding out who would be able to assist or answer questions. Typically, if service is simply very good at a Starwood property, staff learning that I am (was) a platinum member immediately lead to excellent service. At the Sheraton Dallas, the staff went from ignoring me to rude and condescending. The restaurant has also gotten really bad. The food was not up to previous standard for the venue or Starwood venues in general. Sitting at a booth, our waiter served the two people on the outside of the booth first, and then ran his sleeves through our meals to serve the two people in the inside of the booth. We had to repeat our orders multiple times because he was too busy joking with the hostess at the door, or just had too much on his mind and couldn't remember what he was doing after he left our table. Service was very slow and impossible to get hold of. We actually had much better service from every other waiter in the restaurant than our own (as they did more to get our orders, promptly, and correctly).

My first complaint may not bother everyone. I like my room to get very cold. I'm an insomniac, and cannot sleep at all in a hot room with no air movement. The windows open about 4" on either side, but the drapes cover up that area of the window, so I'm unsure why they open at all. My next complaint I'm sure would bother anyone. After checking out I discovered a used plate, fork and knife had been thrown on the hood of my car, along with other garbage. One of the reasons I choose to stay in an expensive hotel is that I believe my car will be safer there. Next time I'm in the area I'll be staying at cheap hotel with an actual functioning air conditioner and know that my car is just as safe there as at the Seatac Embassy Suites.

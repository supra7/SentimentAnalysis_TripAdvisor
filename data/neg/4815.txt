I'm here, and will be here until friday, at a convention. The room is ok, but very cold. The heater does not work. When I arrived, my TV did not work. I called to ask for service. They said it was on its way, never got to my room. I just called for room service, to have dinner in my room.. what will be the waiting time you expect from any hotel? even from a bad hotel? Well, this is worst: 2 hours!!! Of course, I cancelled the order. Good luck if you stay here.

Our AAA guide told us that this was a good pick for a hotel because it focuses on local culture and has a lot of great activities. I would have preferred it if the focus left that and was put on improving the condition of the hotel! Our room was disgusting. The sheets had holes in them, there were weird bugs (scorpion looking) and the carpet needed replacing about 20 years ago. At the end of the day, all I want is to return to a room I can feel comfortable and safe in. I don't care about perks - I just want cleanliness!!!! On check in, the woman behind the desk offered us the option to pay extra for the in room safe. We declined but soon reconsidered after discovering that all the hotel doors from the outside were constantly propped open. There was also a large event going on that weekend which added a huge population of people at the hotel that weren't guests. Anyone could just walk in, no questions asked! My husband wouldn't let me go out alone into the stairways or corridors. It didn't give me a warm, fuzzy feeling.

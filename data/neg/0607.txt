We booked at the Inn because of a reveiw that claimed it was charming. "Charming" and "Rustic" can swiftly give way to "Dump" without great vigilance. The Inn is headed that way despite some renovations. Room stank until we ran air conditioning for six hours. Bar/restaurant excellent. Staff great. Will not return.

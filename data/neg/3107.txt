After reading all the reviews on AmazInn I was excited to book our rooms and cancel the rooms I had already booked with another hotel. When we got there, the front desk was very helpful and gave us some great information. So when we got to our room, I wasn't very happy. The smell in the room was TERRIBLE!! it smelt like bad body odor! We decided to stay and used some air freshener. The next morning we went to the free breakfast, nothing was left and it was only 8:30 am. There was a little ceral, no fresh fruit, the eggs didn't even look real some type of patty and one gallon jug of milk that was empty. The place was a mess! Needless to stay we went up the street every day that we were there to the IHOP. Money I didn't plan on spending. The next couple of days we would head back to the hotel from our day of activities and people would be sitting outside in the chairs out of their room smoking and make lots of noise. Made you feel a little unsafe and not very classy. Lastly, my husband found several bugs in our room. It was gross! We had had enough and was thankful that was our last night there. We went straight home and washed everything we owned that was in that room. Everyone has said that the beds are so comfortable, yes the are, but the rest of it isn't worth the comfy bed. We will not be goin back to this place again. I do not recommend it.

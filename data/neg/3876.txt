The hotel's location was the highlight of my stay. Copley Place has everything one could imagine and there is plenty to do in Boston. The hotel itself was not worth the money. My room was dark and had stains on the floor. The bed linen was not the cleanest and the bathroom was not clean effectively during my entire 5 night stay. I would not recommend this hotel. They nickel and dime you for everything and the rate is astronomical for what you get. The pictures online are decieving as well. I wouldn't return unless nothing else is available in town

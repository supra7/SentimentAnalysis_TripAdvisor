The hotel pretends to be 4 star, I would say it's 2! The service was just horrible-horrible! First of all the blow dryer was sparking, we asked to have it replaced or fixed and got the promise from the receptionist that it will be done next day. As we returned back to the room next day in the afternoon we found out the broken death-carrying blow dryer was still there. The receptionist told us angrily that it was Sunday and there was not much he could do. So why saying they would take care of it in the first place?! They ended up giving us a very old portable blow dryer. Next thing: the towel ring. It was broken as we moved in and never got fixed either so we had to keep hand towel on the sink. More: the cleaning lady was not cleaning but rearranging out private items in the way it seemed convenient to her, e.i. I found my flip flops in bedside table and our cosmetic items were all mixed as if she tried it! Very poor breakfast with undrinkable tea and coffee has to be mentioned as well. Last note - the room itself was a doll house size

For my first time in Chicago, I had chosen a hotel with a historic reputation and when I came in the Palmer House, I could have thought I was on the right way. The lobby decor is amazing. But, after a quick check-in, time was to discover my room... Terrible! On the 8th floor, just near the elevators. There must be 10 or 12 elevators and there is this "ding" thing each time they stop. From my room I could hear everything... And the 8th floor is the floor for the pool and the fitness room. So all the elevators can stop and a lot of guests too, talking etc... The room was so small and dark... I had a strange feeling... like sleeping in the corridor. .. Fortunately, the second day, I asked for another room and the hotel could give me one... still dark but not so noisy... So, my question is: why giving such room like the first one I've had. At the reception, the clerk knew perfectly the problem of this room. When I asked for change, they didn't even ask why... It seems that they play together, trying to sell it... I am sure the hotel was not full during my stay so why ? When you're in vacation like I was, travelling from far, you expect for more care. At the Palmer House, apparently they don't... care. I will never forget that.

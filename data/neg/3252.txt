My wife booked this for us to stay at while watching the drag races in Ennis. It is probably not somewhere we would stay again. It is in a little suburb of Dallas that isn't real nice. We witnessed on 2 occasions our first day there 2 hookers walking up and down the street in front fo the hotel. The second night we were walking into our room and witnessed a hooker coming out of another room and pulling down her skimpy dress. THe next morning we actually had a hooker knock on our door at about 9:30 in the morning. She was was trying to look sexy until my wife answered the door. She then realized she had the wrong room number to go to. The AC didn't work too well and the lock on the door didn't work right so management had to give us a master key to get into our room. There isn't anywhere decent to eat within close proximity. So, if you like hookers, this is the place for you.

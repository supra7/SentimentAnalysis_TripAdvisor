We stayed at the Radisson before an early morning flight. I chose it because of location and location to a decent parking lot for our car, MasterPark. But it was one of the worst hotel experiences we have ever experienced. Mind you this is just my opinion and I'm sure many people have stayed here and been quite happy. The main problem for us was the bed situation. We are larger people and the 2 double beds just didn't cut it. It was us and our 2 kids and there just wasn't enough room. Plus I have to say, the adjustable beds are not much of o selling point. The MOST uncomfortable bed I have EVER stayed on in my life, hands down. All they are, are air mattresses. If you want a firmer bed it pumps more air in and if you want a softer bed, you take air out. Well, if you take too much air out you can actually feel the wooden bed frame. We were off to Disneyland the next day, and I woke up with a stitch in my back that just wouldn't go away. Not good if you are planning on walking 8-10 hours a day. We ordered room service, and it wasn't bad. We had the steak sandwich, and it was quite tasty. And the service was good all around, from the front desk to the room service. The hotel itself it a little run down, but I have seen much worse. But if you can't get a good night's sleep, especially before an early morning flight, then everything else just doesn't matter.

What does it take to get a 4 star rating? Not much here. Staff was friendly, bell hop was rude. The door to the bathroom the paint was peeling. The room was very small and old looking. BUT,the view was AWESOME and was the only thing 4 stars. I've stayed at Comfort and Sleep Inns that were nicer. This isn't what I consider a 4 star hotel. If you park at the hotel, it will cost you $48.00 per day. We parked at O'Hare Airport in the $9.00 parking lot and took the L-train to the hotel. It was my first time riding the L-train and it was a great experience and tons of fun. It takes about and hour to go from the airport to the hotel on the train. We stayed on the 28 floor and you could hear every siren from every emergency vehicle that was going downtown. That was a shock. Don't expect to get a quiets night sleep. Too much money to stay here. No benefits.

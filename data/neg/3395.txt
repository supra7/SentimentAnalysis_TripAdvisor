We stay here on May 10, 2011 and I have to say I wouldnt want to stay again. When we got to our room it was a smoking room and I called the front desk and asked if we could be moved, they said they didnt have any available rooms. So we decided to stay anyway (trying not to notice the smell). They have out dated TVs and carpet and for the $71 per nighthell we should have had at least a flat screen. The bed was ok there were tons of pillows. There is not a caf or anything in the lobby and it sets on a service road not close in walking distance to much (we had a car). The lobby has a funny smell and the front desk ppl are ok not extra friendly or anything over all I dont think it was worth my money and will not stay there again unless someone else is paying for it!

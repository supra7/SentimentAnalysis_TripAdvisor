We booked on Priceline and I was quite shocked that they considered this hotel a 4-star. It just is not what we are used to!! The Good - 1. Nice crisp bed linens 2. Nice views of the water from some rooms, and the lobby and restaurant 3. the hotel shop had some nice things for sale The Bad - 1. The decor is too kitschy for words. Birchbark print wallpaper. Bears on lampshades. Every stick of furniture made from raw logs or antlers. 2. Weird musty smell 3. Valet parking is a total ripoff and unneccessary 4. Charging for wireless internet 5. Very pricey restaurant 6. Lasting impression of the Manager at the front desk was of bra straps and weird panty lines - not professional-looking! 7. Rough stone tile floor in bathroom - no way it could be kept clean - a haven for yucky stuff like maybe plantar wart viruses! 7. Way too expensive for what it is - a motor hotel trying to pretend it's a first-rate hotel Might be a problem for some... Tiny rooms Shower only in some rooms train noise might be bothersome location amongst the tourist trap area, quite a walk to downtown shops

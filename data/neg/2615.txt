As with all hotels its best to do some research before you book. This hotel is based in the middle of Chinatown. This is a bonus if you are Chinese but can prove difficult if you are not, I had trouble finding a foreign currency exchange in the immediate area and most people in the local shops stuggle with understand and speaking english. The hotel is fairly clean no complaints there. But the rooms were small and narrow. We had two rooms booked and neither had a safe to lock our passports/monmey away in. The hotel does offer a safe service but it is one big safe which is kept elsewhere in the building and everybody to opts into using it has access to it. The room also had minimal storage space for clothes. The biggest problem was the location of the Manhatton Bridge, from our bedroom window it must have been no more than 10meters away, this bridge services trains and a highway so the noise is constant. The break out areas and reception are fairly dull and boring too. For the price i would imagine there are several better hotels for your money.

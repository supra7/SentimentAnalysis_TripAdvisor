First thing i noticed when arriving in my room was the nice fresh smell of foul odor, after talking in the fresh air i did a walk around and saw how dirty the curtains were and how out dated the room was. I wasn't satisfied so I went downstairs and brought it to the attention of a miss louie and she informed me that all the rooms were booked and she couldn't do anything for me with a rude attitude and silly smirk. The only thing that is good about this hotel is the location but its location is also its downfall because its tough trying to sleep. If this place was cleaned up and sound proofed it would be very appealing, but you would also need to train your staff on customer service or hire new staff. So I gave Rodeway one star because they wouldn't let me give them a half star.

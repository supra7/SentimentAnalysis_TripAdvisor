I had stayed at this hotel before and had an OK experience. This time was different. At 5:00 a.m. there was one employee at the desk. The shuttle driver had gone to the airport. I am handicapped and needed assistance to make my early flight. I had explained this at the time I made my reservation. The "assistant manager" at the front desk was unbelievably rude. I tried approach him in a reasonable manner and he said, "Whatever," and turned his back on me. He also said, "This is a 3-star hotel. What do you expect?" I called the hotel's 24-hour 1-800 line and was told that there were no customer service reps on duty at that time. 1. I think it is dangerous to have only one staff member on duty at a hotel of this size. What if there were a fire or an earthquake? 2. I did not get a room accessible to the elevator as I had requested. 3. Daytime staff tends to be friendly and accomodating, but this was certainly not the case in the early morning. 4. The two times I stayed at the hotel--and I checked in around 3 p.m. each time--I never saw the manager of record. 5. The tub was not clean. 6. There is only one computer in the lobby and it can not be used to access foreign-language sites. 7. If I had not been traveling business class, I would have missed my flight because of one rude man at the desk and an inexperienced shuttle driver. Understaffed and overpriced. If you need to get to Seatac early in the morning, save the money and stay at a budget motel. I have had better, more understanding service at the Clarion.

I had a mixed feeling about this hotel. My parents stayed there for a day after their flight got cancelled due to hurricane irene. As far as the standard features go it was ok to say the most. its one of the old hotels of Boston but neither it gives an old world charm nor it is a contemporary hotel. and for the price we paid for the night it was definitely not worth it. But not that its all bad. The location is supreme. The rooms were clean. Staff was friendly. Though there was a confusion regarding the breakfast being included in the reservation itself.

I've been Platinum member with Marriot few years and Diamond with Hilton for a dozen years since i spend 150 nights/yr in hotels. during check in I asked for pool hrs: pool was closed for renovation. I pointed out there was no warning for that and wanted some compensation since i need to do laps for back problems. I was confronted by the personell about this and treated like a liar. than they tried to make a new reservation with my iphone and... surprise! no warning came up! thay gave me 15.000 points as compensation which is ok but i still didn't like the treatment and they didn't apologize. than i got an upgrade (as Platinum) but was accessible room which has a very unconfortable toilet. the room was very cold. rised the temperature from 65 to max and left the room. came back at midnight, it was freezing. I was tired and went to bed dressed up. the following morning was still freezing, wifi was not working... went down to reception mentioning all problems. i was supposed to stay 2 nights but i decided to change hotel and they really didn't care. I asked for a late check out... i was given 2pm!!! which is like standard check out... the lady said they were sold out.... well beside the fact that i was freeing my room so they had an extra room at that time... i went on the website and checked availability: they had more than 1 room like mine available! who is the liar????? than i called the manager to complain but i just got another bad treatment... wow, these people deserve a zero!

I've stayed at this location a few times before and was generally satisfied but on my third visit I discovered that the bed linens had not been changed. The bed appeared properly made up but I first spotted some stains on a pillow and then numerous body hairs scattered on the bottom sheet. The night manager who took my complaint listened passively and, without an apology, informed me that a bellhop would be sent over with a key to another room.

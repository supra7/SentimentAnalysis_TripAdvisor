Oh my gosh. What a disappointment... It's a bit baffling that such a huge, historic hotel could be right in the heart of lucrative downtown Chicago and offer so little.. The thing that I was most taken aback by is that this hotel does not offer free Wi-fi / Internet (or Wi-fi at all in the rooms for that matter)! You'd think that a hotel of this stature that must cater to thousands of businesss travelers would be better equipped, and just more sophisticated with regard to basic technology. You could plug in using the Ethernet cord for $12+ per day. I asked if there was at least free Internet in the lobby area, and was told no, that is $6+ per hour. TIP: I found out on my last day there that the Corner Bakery downstairs offers free Wi-fi to customers. This hotel is in the heart of Chicago's downtown / financial district so parking is h o r r i b l e. The hotel charges $35/day to self-park and $45/day to valet. And if you're driving by yourself, the doorpeople will not allow you to sit out front with your hazards on while you check in. TIP: There is a 15-minute flashing zone across the street (on the north side), closest to State street. If you just want to quickly check in and drive elsewhere, you can leave the car there while you do so. Check the posted signs though; parking there is prohibited during rush hour times. The hotel room itself, though large and spacious, was quite outdated. I was on the 18th floor and could hear sirens blaring, but the noise didn't bother me. There was also no screen on the window, so little flying bugs came and went as they pleased; and there was an odd smell in the room...possibly paint. Location is excellent for dining, shopping and sight-seeing / visiting Museums. I won this hotel on Priceline for $95/night for Memorial Day weekend, and would never pay full price to stay here. They nickel and dime you at every turn and are completely behind the times.

I would never ever stay at this hotel again...Inside the hotel is run down and the lobby is nothing spectacular.. I know it is an old hotel but they really could modernize it.. I stayed here with my boyfriend for a concert.. (and believe me we are not picky.. we are only in our early 20's) and hated it.. we got a suite and there was only the bed, desk, and two chairs in the room.. it was just tons of empty space with no seating area.. and a really tiny bathroom.. our smoke detector was hanging out of the ceiling and all of the paint in the room was chipped.. The location is fantastic and the places to eat connected to the hotel are very good.. but the location itself does not make up for how awful the hotel is.. I thought for a city like Boston it would have some charm.. but nope.. stick to the Back Bay Hotel or the TAJ

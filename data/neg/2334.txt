COME ON! MARRIOTT CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS. Someone is asleep at the wheel and Im sure they are collecting a nice paycheck in the process. Why upgrade? Why stay current? Why replace old towels? Why have better furniture? Why use nice materials in the bathroom and shower/? Why have the room smell nice when you walk into your room? Why have decent bed linens or curtains? Why have decent Internet connectivity speeds? Why have automatic doors as you enter/exit the hotel with all your stuff? Why have a mini-fridge or microwave? Why have decent modern office chairs? This 10 year old office chair is just fine. I mean the color is horrible, and there are no adjustments, but it still works as intended.

I can describe the room dcor in a single wordBlah. The room smelled like a cheap hotel. The TV was made in 1998 (not theres anything wrong with that). Who says you cant go back in time? Just step in the hotel room I received, and you will sent back in time by 12 years. There is a Ruby Tuesday within walking distance. The staff was friendly. I received a phone call checking to see if everything was okay. What am I supposed to say to this person? Where do I start? The last thing I want to do is switch rooms because of someone elses apathy. Just keep your expectations low and you will be fine.

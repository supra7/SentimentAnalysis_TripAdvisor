My wife and I stayed here for two nights after our wedding before heading out to our honeymoon. We requested a King Premier room but when we got to the room we saw it had two tiny little beds. Called the front desk and they said they didn't have a King room and we'd have to wait. The parking lot seemed empty and the hotel didn't seem all that busy so I wonder why they didn't have the proper room we had paid for. After a few hours we had to check back, the desk didn't call us and then they had a king bed available. The room was not very nice. Sheets and pillows were cheap materials and very worn. Definitely NOT what I would expect from an alleged 4 star hotel. The start of our stay actually ruined the mood for the rest of it. Screwing up our room followed by uninterested service from the front desk made us feel like we weren't wanted. Here's a tip to the hotel staff and management: When a married couple checks in, give them the King Bed Rooms, not your pathetic tiny bed rooms!!!!! And no Wifi in 2011??? That's stupid! Gosh! You'd think they'd have that much common sense! The room was also noisy -- elevators, construction, thin walls. We ordered room service several times. The food was decent and delivery was as expected. But sadly, that's the only positive comment I can make on this hotel. WAY TO RUIN THE MOOD INTERCONTINENTAL!!!!

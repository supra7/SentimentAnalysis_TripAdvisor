Me and my friends were traveling to memphis and decided to stay at Hampton Inn by Baptist East Hopsital thinking it would be ok. Boy were we wrong the whole night was horrible. The hotel is covered in roaches from the breakfast area to the rooms which we were in 326. The wall paper was peeling and they said the hotel had just been remodeled. umm I sure cant tell. The bathroom area smelled like urination. The only good thing about this hotel is that it is next to the hospital.

This hotel is located in a new alternative area... The Raval. Near the hotel you have friendly tascas and litle stores, but you have also some people with strange and some times dangerous look. The rooms are small but with cool ekea fourniture. The staff could be more helpfull, and they didn't give any try to understand your needs. The restaurante as very nice ambience, but food is poor. I assedio for a cow dish but they served a porky dish... It was a total desaster! Becarfull if you have some religious ishues.

I stay several times a year in the Seattle area, this was my first stay at this W. And as long it is under the current management and in the current condition, be assured this to be my last! The room was dirty. Stains of all sorts on the wall, shower was digusting, dust all over the place. The room itself has nothing W-styled. While the living room shows a moder atmosphere, the room I stayed in was worn out, a while ago. Most staff cared, but the person that worked the night of my check out prefered finishing his newspaper article over attending the front desk. This is so not "W"... I sent a mail to the management of this hotel, and being an SPG platunum member I had hoped to receive more than a standardised template-mail. Dissapointed in the W brand, as they can let this happen. Not even a formal apology, no compensation, so no repeat business. Thanks SPG has a Westin in Bellevue, that is well managed and maintained...

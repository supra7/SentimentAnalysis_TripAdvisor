Everything about the Boston Park Plaza is awful. Curbside luggage assistance was non existant. Check in was rude and dismissive. Self check (at $1 per bag) was the only service available in the lobby. Room was filthy, staff indifferent, acomodations valueless, and service a non entity. This is a place to avoid, AT ANY PRICE.

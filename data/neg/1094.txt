Fairly old hotel with some aspects renewed, but some important ones not. Old windows do little to keep out the very noisy vibrations from the huge HVAC on the building across the street. All noises can be heard from neighboring bathrooms (faucets turning on and off, razor being tapped on sink...). Not any surface big enough to put a toilet bag next to the sink. Absolutely not the quality I would expect on a business trip in Seattle.

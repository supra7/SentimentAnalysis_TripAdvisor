We normally stay at Marriott, it's the chain we accumulate points with but I can honestly say because of this hotel and the staff...that will probably be changing soon! The staff was rude and very unhelpful. The pillows were unbearable; we called to ask if there was anything they could do and they pretty much all but told my husband "we don't really care". The computers and printers in the business center weren't working, no one cared or offered to fix when we inquired at the desk. The ONLY nice person we met on this trip was the bartender and he gave us some great tips for eating at North End but other than that, the location was the only plus of this hotel. The worst part....it was incredibly expensive!! I'm very disappointed in Marriott and how they have allowed themselves to fall victim to the "we don't really care about our customers' routine that so many others have done. Good thing the hotel didn't ruin our stay in this beautiful city!

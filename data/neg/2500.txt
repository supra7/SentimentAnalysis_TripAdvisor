The room was a typical standard Travelodge room, however as soon as we entered the room we noticed a horrible overpowering damp smell. The floor next to the bathroom was soaking wet. When we complained we were told it was caused by leaking Aircon units. (The wet floor was no-where near the aircon unit). They had no spare rooms so had to endure the smell, however the very helpful manager did give us a full refund the next morning. Good customer service.

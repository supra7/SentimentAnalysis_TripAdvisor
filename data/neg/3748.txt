Worst hotel I have ever stayed in!!! The place was very dirty and extremely small, although we did pay 150 a night. The bathroom window, as well as one of the windows by the bed were both broken and stuck open...although we told staff about the issue right when we checked in, nothing was done. So the room was hot and bugs were able to get in as well. The staff was very rude and the lady manager clearly hates her life and was on a power trip the whole time. She was extremely direspectful and rude. We had to ask numerous times for extra towels and toilet paper! We had paid from fri-mon, yet we checked out sunday afternoon, and went and stayed with a friend, because we started worrying about getting bed bugs or something! Im shocked this hotel is 99 out of 104....it should be in dead last! Next time I will realize that something isnt right when there are only about 2 other rooms being used on Labor Day weekend!

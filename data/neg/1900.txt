Poor all round, apart from the initial receptionist when we arrived on Saturday afternoon. Other staff encountered were surly and offhand. No working lights in the tiny bathroom - a problem I believe has been mentioned on this site before - and no effort made to fix it or to offer us another room. The room smelt of cigarette smoke on entry, and was basic in the extreme. The shower looked dirty. No kettle, though tea, coffee, sugar and milk were there. Again, upon reporting this, no effort made to supply a kettle (apart from the first receptionist offering us his own!) The curtain in the room was filthy, and the whole place felt unclean. I would suggest it is being mis-sold as a hotel room. Where we were in the "annex", it was more of a migrant worker bedsit, to be honest. Obviously, the price was attractive, but we found we spent as little time as possible in there, and we don't consider ourselves overly picky! (We wouldn't go near the breakfast because we didn't want to take any chances health-wise by that stage.) There are many other hotels available for the price that was offered which I am certain would have been far better. Beware of this place!

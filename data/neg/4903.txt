I stayed here for one night to have a relaxing beach day before we took the kids to Disney World. The hotel went from bad to worse and kept getting worse. When we went to check in the hotel staff was not friendly, our room was not ready so they gave us a card and ask us to call in randomly and they would tell us when it was ready. It took forever for the room to be ready. When we got there the elevators are extremely slow and we only saw one set for the entire hotel. Our room was somewhat clean, but we had no washcloths, when we ask they said it would be awhile but someone would bring them up. It indeed took forever for us to get a total of 3 washcloths. I will say we did have a nice view and the price was ok as we reserved the room through priceline.com. Around 9:30 I heard a lot of screaming outside followed by sirens. I looked off the balcony and saw a fire truck getting their hoses and gear ready to fight a fire. Someone had set the hotel garbage area on fire. You would have thought we would have been warned or ask to leave the hotel but we never heard a word from the front desk. We were on the 9th floor so this was a little scary for us since we had no idea if we needed to evacuate or not. I do give some credit to the hotel management because they were working very hard with the fire department to get the fire out and clean up before the guest woke up to see the mess the next morning. We were never told anything when we checked out of the hotel or even given an explanation on what happen. This was not the worst hotel I have ever experienced but will not stay here again. Also parking was terrible!!!!!!

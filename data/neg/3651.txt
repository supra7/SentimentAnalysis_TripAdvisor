We thought we got a steal on the low price and boy were we wrong. It's a little dirty and run down but the main problem was the German Roaches crawling everywhere and the air was frozen. The view is great and the maintenance guy is super awesome. He went out of his way trying to fix the air. Run though, it ruined our vacation and we had to overpay to get in a hotel so it wasn't a total waste of trip. The laundry mat is a joke as well.

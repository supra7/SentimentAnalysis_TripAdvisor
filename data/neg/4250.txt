We needed to be in Back Bay for a week in July, and got a good deal at The Eliot Hotel. We managed to score a "suite", which was a bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette like thingy and a sitting room with pull-out couch. Flat TVs in both rooms, wireless internet (for a fee). The bathroom was tiny, no room for a toilet kit anywhere (let alone stuff for 3 people!). The fridge wasn't cold enough to chill a couple beers. On the other hand, Boston was suffering through a massive heat wave with temps above 100. Still, we really would have liked a cold brew after the afternoon walk! Speaking of the heat, the A/C was very very noisy. Perhaps it was just his particular room, but we had to have the fan on the lowest speed to make it manageable. In general, the standard was, well, old fashion. For example, there were very few electrical outlets, so charging a camera, a laptop and a couple cell phones was a logistical problem. Also, steer clear of the $30 per person breakfast buffet. Truly underwhelming. We demanded a refund after the first morning, and ate at a Greek diner around the corner on Newbury Street for the rest of the week.

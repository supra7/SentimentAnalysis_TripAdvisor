Hilton web site sold room to me as non-refundable Superior Room purchase with great view, bathtub, robe & slippers. Superior room that has a great view, but missing everything else. Poor room service, cant even get room service or a clean towel! Not to mention that there are no robes or slippers to be found in the room. Beds are so small it is very difficult to fit 2 people on them. Great location for Red Sox games, but everything else is not acceptable for a Hilton hotel. We are very disappointed with this hotel!

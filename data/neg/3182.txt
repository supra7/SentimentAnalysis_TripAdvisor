The gentlemen that run the place are really nice and helpful and for the price, I guess it is ok. However, the shower was broken in our first room, there were bugs in the bed, and the sheets seemed clean but had an overall damp feeling to them - poor ventilation? We switched rooms to find the new room with bugs as well and a dirty looking shower. The area was sketchy and the tube was a bit of a walk. Also, drunk strangers barged into our room on a Saturday morning. Our door was open whilst dealing with the bug issue and they just sauntered in - friendly, but all the same were not staying at the hotel and just were able to come up the stairs and inside. For 103 for a triple room for 2 nights, I guess you have to deal with these things?

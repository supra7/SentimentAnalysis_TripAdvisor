Buyer beware if your a Hotwire customer and this is the hotel you get. When I checked in I was informed that the only room available was a smoking room (frankly was surprised there were smoking rooms anymore) But... for $40 more I could upgrade to a nicer room. I declined out of principle. The rooms are fine but quite noisy. I would have given this an average rating but the whole "bait and switch" thing and smelly smoking room made this a terrible experience.

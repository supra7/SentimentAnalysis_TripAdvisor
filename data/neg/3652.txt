I know it's a little late to write a review, but I just need to warn people that the price IS too good to be true. My family and I have stayed here many times over the past 10 years, but the cleaning crew and maintenance have gone down hill ever since. They claim to have had a million $ renovation a few years ago, but it's in bad shape all over the patio/pool area, and we had a terrible roach problem the entire week we were there. They sprayed 2 times, but it didn't help, and we were not offered a new room until the last day of our stay.

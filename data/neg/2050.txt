$15 a day for valet parking, this is a joke. What other hotel in Vegas charges for parking? I think the $15 is a scam. If it really costs the hotel $15 for the services they claim to be providing, add it to the daily room rate. The valet service is horrible. We returned for an afternoon of shopping at the outlets and could not even pull in to the hotel entrance there were so many empty cars sitting on the drive. When I was finally able to pull in, I had to flag someone down to take my keys and give me a ticket. Going out Saturday night was worse. The cars were still backed up on the drive. It took 45 minutes for the valet to pull our car up, and he had a nerve to look at me for a tip. The service and attitude of the people at this hotel is horrible. I will never stay again. Oh wait, don't forget the train at 4 AM in the morning, or the horrible pillows. Stay away. The one positive, the bell captain was excellent. He went out of his way to answer questions and provide recommendations for places to go and eat in the areas we were going to be in around vegas.

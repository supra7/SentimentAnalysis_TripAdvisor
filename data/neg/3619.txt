I stayed here for a week for business. As soon as I opened my hotel door I knew this was bad. I had a non smoking room and it smelled like smoke. The popcorn ceiling and outdated decor was a nice touch. The last night of my trip I was awakened by a drip. I went into the bathroom and the ceiling fan had water dripping out. The bathroom floor was wet. I was checking out that day and I told the front desk person and he laughed and said "Yeah this place sucks". I agreed. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!

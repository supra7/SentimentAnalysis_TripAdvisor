The standard rules apply regarding the hotels location. Any hotel right near a central railway station will be surrounded by a slightly dodgy area with adult shops and the like. This is no exception. I am not sure what gives this hotel its stars, I think they must count the bouncer as a doorman (though there are 2 entries, you don't need to go through the bar). Star ratings are all about facilites, and apparently do not relate to quality. I thought this hotel would be a dive, however it was largely okay. It depends why you're there. I probably would rather pay $50 extra a night and stay somewhere like the Holiday Inn in Darling Harbour, which just feels sooo much cleaner. I was compelled to put lining under my belongings, as it just felt a tinsy bit seedy to me. The sheets were crisp, though there were white marks on the upper blankets - they could have been wear marks. I saw similar white marks at the Sofitel in Brisbane a few weeks before (though almost excusably... on the valance) The carpet was patterned. On closer inspection, particularly near the bathroom, you will find hair lightly matted across the carpet. I paid for a safety deposit box and hung a Do Not Disturb sign on the door which worked for a day or two, but the cleaner came in on the third day. There was a gigantic pubic hair in the door of the shower door after the cleaner left. The elevator trips had a combination of sweet elderly people and youthful sketchy types (one of which seemed to be on something). Service was straight forward with no frills.

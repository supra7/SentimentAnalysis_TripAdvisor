my husband and I stayed here for 1 night and we were just looking for a cheap place to sleep before we flew out of SeaTac the next day. well, "cheap" comes in every form here. from the creepy guy sitting at the computer all night long looking up naughty websites, to the arguing couple out front at 2am that led to the police showing up... the "free" breakfast is just cereal and coffee, the jacuzzi is smaller than a bathtub and we didn't go in it in fear of catching some kind of rash, and the gym facilites is just an exercise bike. this place smelled bad and was so dirty, i couldn't wait for morning to come. we vowed to each other that we will never ever stay at a place like this again. on the other hand, the guy at the front desk was very nice and helpful, and the rest of the staff was ok too. they probably feel really bad for the people that decide to stay there!

I stayed here in 2007, and like a lot of other reviewers, I absolutely hated my experience at this hotel. In fact, I despised it with a passion and intensity I didn't think I was capable of. The room I was assigned wasn't terribly bad, though it was far from exceptional. But the guys the reception desk were the rudest, unhelpful, most unncessarily stand-offish hotel staff I've ever dealt with in a long history of staying at hotels. Their dreadful demeanor towards me alone from the moment I checked in accounts for the terrible rating I'm giving this place. A special note: you're in for a lot of grief if you try to book this hotel through an online reservation service. If given the choice between staying in this hotel as the only available option or having to forego a stay in beautiful Seattle, I'd have no choice - but no hesitation, either - about choosing the latter.

Not as Bad-New management? After reading the horrible reviews on this site about this hotel I was considering just forfeiting my hotwire $70 bucks and staying elsewhere. My husband convinced me we could stand it for one night. This hotel definately had some problems but overall was fine for a one night stay. Problems first: 1. you have to call for the airport shuttle, it doesn't come and pick you up automatically. We had to wait for about 1/2 hour before the shuttle which can be tiring if you have been traveling all day. 2. The shuttle driver was pleasant but seemed mentally challenged and tried to shove six adults into a van made for four. It was interesting! 3. At the front desk the ladies looked tired and were openly frustrated; sighing and rolling their eyes regarding their hotel that was overbooked. 4. My biggest complaint about this hotel is that there was no elevator which means if you happen to be on the second floor you have to lug all of your luggage up stairs. Not pleasant after a long tiring journey! 5. The overall look of the hotel is shabby and run down; halls look scarey. Ok enough complaints. ON the positive note: the rooms were clean, good shower pressure, the front desk ladies warmed up, shuttle waited for us when we were running late in the morning, the bed was fairly comfortable, the hotel was quiet. I think the hotel is under new management and they are making an effort to make things better.

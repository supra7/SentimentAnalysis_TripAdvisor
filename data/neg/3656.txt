This hotel caters to the American businessmen and embassy staff due to its location. The hotel leaves a lot to be desired when compared to other hotels that are in the area. I tried this property out because of the points program but have decided that it is not worth it. Had several incidents where complaints were filed with the hotell staff and nothing was addressed the first time around. The hotel is basically a "cave" not having any windows and therefore feels dark and cold. Located next to the alternative lifestyle quarter (Zona Rosa has changed in nature over the last several years) it offers the visitor either weird entertainment or disgusting sights depending on the visitor's tolerance levels. There are definitely better options available for the same cost.

If you are looking for a wonderful stay at a relaxing hotel with great customer service THIS IS NOT THE PLACE!!!! I have never encountered such RUDE, UNHOSPITABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE in my life!!! I will never stay at this hotel and I will never visit Memphis again!!! There is a college course for hotel management and the title is HOSPITALITY!!!! Apparently, no managers at this hotel are educated enough in this course!!! Employees lead by example and if management can't be curteous, how can they expect their staff to be. Other than the staff, this hotel might have a fighting chance of being a wonderful hotel. I am the most laid back, understanding person there is; however, I must say in regards to the staff here: Good luck if you stay here, check your temper at the door because odds are, it will flare up!!!! Ruined my vacation and put a bad taste in my mouth regarding the entire city, sorry Memphis!!!

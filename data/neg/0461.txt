I've never stayed in such a small room before in my life and for the price you would think it would have been much larger. The bathroom amenities are nice, I just wished the bathroom would have been large enough for 2 people to stand in it at one time. The room is so small that 2 people can't walk between the beds and the tv at the same time. Did I mention the beds? For the price you pay you would think the beds would be much more comfortable, but they aren't! I just really don't have any positive reviews on the room, except nice bathroom amenties (if you like Crabtree and Evelyn). Even the towels weren' t that soft... Sure, the hotel is convenient to shopping and sure the bartender in the lobby (Bob) is one of the best by far, but to park in their garage you have to pay $26/night. I wasn't that impressed with the restaurant either, you will get much better drinks in the lobby bar (Bob is the bartender there). The drinks are expensive though, so you might want to drink elsewhere. The staff was nice enough, but they didn't even offer or ask if we wanted a mini-bar key. I had to go back down to get one and that was after a lady came by the room to check our mini bar. Did I mention that she "softly" knocked and then proceeded to walk in our room and we were not "prepared" for company at that moment! My husband was furious and wanted to tell the front desk about it, but I told him to just blow it off. For the money, I do NOT recommend this hotel. I think there must be much larger rooms in a hotel downtown somewhere and they surely must be nice rooms for that price. I know we will continue to search for that hotel and keep you informed when we find one.

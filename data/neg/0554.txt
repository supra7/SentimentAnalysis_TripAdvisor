The valets just stand around and stare at you instead of getting your keys or asking if you need help. The hotel charged 40 dollars of food to my room when i never got rom service and they charged 3 movies instead of 2. Since they said they couldnt do anything they said I had to call accounting.....Why do I need to call when it was not my mistake!!

We stayed here for our honeymoon and met 5 other couples at the pool who had the worst stay. The rooms are horribly outdated and all the furniture was worn. We were told we would be given our complimentary lei, champagne and phtoalbum and we had to ask for all three AND WE WERE ALSO SUPPOED TO GET A HONEYMOON RECEPTION WHICH WE FOUND OUT ABOUT AFTER WE LEFT!. Our First room had a view of a trash enclosure, then when we moved, we had the stage lights poiting diretcly into our room in the Lahiana Tower with no coean view. We even offered to pay FOR A BETTER ROOM AND THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO MOVE. The TV remote andiron were broken. There is no AC in the hallway and the AC never really worked in our room. Everything at this hotel is designed to sell you something so buyers beware! The breakfast that was include din our package was reconstituted eggs, frozen potatoes and fake hollandaise sauce and no pancakes or waffles or french toast. When they did offer these items, they were very poor in quality. The breakfast area at Sonz even had fake juice and the is no AC in the breakfast area that got incedible warm and was 85 degress by 8:00am each monring. We had dirty cups in our room and our sheets weren't even changed! We even had trach under the bed from someone else. The appetizers at the bar - Cascades were incredibly overpriced and it was awful! The bathrooms have no AC or fans so you can imagine after all the horrible food how the sounds of your loved one must be when you can hear everything - yes everything in the room. We even had holes in the curtain to block the sun as our room faced directly east! AND THE ELEVATORS KEPT BREAKING AND THERE WAS NO PARKING AT NIGHT... FROM THE PICTURES THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT, BUT DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STAY ELSEWHERE - IT IS A HORRIBLE VALUE FOR THE MONEY AND THE SERVICE WAS AWFUL! WE WERE REALLY AMAZED ON HOW MUCH THEY WANTED FOR THE ROOM AND HOW LITTLE WAS OFFERED FOR THE MONEY. Also Lahaina has become really bad and nearly dangerous with barkeeps calling from the street like Tijuana and tour busses rolling by every five minutes. Stay in Wailea.

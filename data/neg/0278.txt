This place is the worst hotel I ever stayed in. My wife and I got into town to catch a show in town we had tickets for. When we first arrived at the hotel and got into our room I sensed that this place was trouble but since it seemed quiet - 6pm at the time - and we drove all day to get to Seattle; we decided to try it out and get some rest. We went to bed at about 9pm because we were exhausted but did not get much sleep because we were awaken by the neighbor's blasting there music and drinking and yelling at about 9:30pm. The walls are paper thin so you can hear every word the people in the next room were saying - or should I say yelling. It sounded like there was 20 people in the room all talking at the same time and drunk and loud. The real insanity started at about 1am when a couple of men started arguing loudly and began threatening each other. They then began to fight in an obvious physical brawl that carried out into the hall, complete with screaming girlfriends and death threats the sounds of a bottles breaking in the room while the brawl continued out in the hall. The fight eventually de-escalated but now the drunks decided to 'talk about it' out in the hall in front of our door. The people who were still in the room decided to put on gangster rap music full blast until approx. 6 am before it stopped. My wife and I did not sleep a wink the whole night and the next morning when we approached the girl behind the desk and explain to her why we not be returning the next night - or ever for that matter - she said she is used to dealing with drunks in the halls and really enjoys yelling at them when that sort of thing happens there. The insinuation was obvious - this type of activity is not uncommon at this hotel. THIS PLACE IS A DUMP AND A DRUNKEN FLOPHOUSE!! Do yourself a favor and spend the few extra bucks and go to a real hotel.

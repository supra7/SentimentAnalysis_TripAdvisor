I have stayed at the Park Plaza three times. The first time we stayed in a corner suite. It was a fine, no-frills room, although the bathroom was very cramped and outdated. The second time, we stayed in a regular room with a king bed. Well, at 12:30 am we were awakened by drunk people hanging out in the hallway and it sounded like they were in our room!!! We heard every word of their conversation! After my husband finally got up out of bed to tell them to please quiet down (and I need to preface that we NEVER complain about ANYTHING) they moved to their room...........only to our dismay it was next to ours, so we continued to be a part of the party until they finally went to bed at 2:30 am! OK, given that, we gave the hotel one more chance. It was the other night. It sounded like there was running water in the pipes above our ceiling all night long, and even though we tried to drown out the noise with the TV, once the TV went off, we could still hear what sounded like running water through the pipes. Then, to top it off, we could hear the the moans and groans of the couple in the room next to us. Needless to say, sleep was at a premium. I always try to give a hotel a second chance, but this place has had their two chances! Overall, VERY thin walls, teeny tiny outdated bathrooms, and small rooms. It is unfortunate, because the staff here is very nice, the location is great, and the valet service is top notch. If you are looking for a luxurious hotel, or even a 4-star hotel, then this is not the hotel for you. One of these stays was for my husband's birthday, and I always try to spoil him with a nice hotel, and this one was just a bad choice!

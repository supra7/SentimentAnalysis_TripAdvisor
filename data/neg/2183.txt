Our experience at the Tresrios was a nightmare. We got suckered into looking into a timeshare. We were promised a nice breakfast and were told to have an open mind. We did have an open mind throughout the whole presentation which was suppose to be only 90 mins with absolutely no pressure. It turned out to be about 5 hours! 'Michael' was the guy we dealt with. He started off as being nice but quickly turned nasty. He said all the right things he was trained to say to get a sale. After we said we needed some time to think about the offer, we were hastily passed to some other guy and then the pressure was increased. After we politely said we 'just want to go home', a loudmouth French Canadian came into the room. It was so annoying. We just wanted to get out of there. After asking many times to leave, we were finally allowed. My wife was crying after this experience. I personally cannot believe this kind of place exists. The people that run this place are evil. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.

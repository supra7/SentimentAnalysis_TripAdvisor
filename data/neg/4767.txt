Five members of my staff and I stayed here for five nights this past week. By the third day, we had a litany of complaints, mostly focused on rooms in the Center Tower. In one room, TV didn't work or came on by itself, half of towels were dirty upon arrival; in another room, toilet was not secured to the bathroom floor, heating system never worked properly, sink gurgled loudly at times, sleep button on TV remote didn't work; in another room, water was either ice cold or sclading; heating system needed repair at 12:30 in the morning, but never worked properly. Those of us in the North Tower had few complaints, although there always seemed to be a small refrigerator and a microwave oven just left out in the hall for hours on end; very dangerous if the floor needed to be evacuated. When I complained, three of my staff members were given a 7,000 point bonus on their Starwood Preferred Guest accounts. It seems to me that the infrastructure in the central tower is aging and in need of major overhaul. It was not fair to my employees who were working a sales booth at a convention to have to endure these issues in their rooms, where they should have been able to relax and unwind. Strongly urge business travelers to avoid this hotel or, if you have to stay here, request a room in the north tower. Very disappointed.

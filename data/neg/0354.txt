For the pricing of this hotel you may very well expect to find a pool, spa, "nice" weight room and all of the goodies you would want. In this hotel almost nothing is provided for you. The rooms are cramped and honestly being a larger sized person not in girth but in height I wasn't sure if I could even fit. The shower was atrocious for me mainly because the shower-head was chest level for goodness sake and wasn't adjustable. The parking was terrible mainly because there was very little in the way of that. The hotel provided maybe 6 parking spots for 9 floors of guests. NOT WORTH IT. I was staying on the fifth floor and lemme tell you waiting for the elevator was terrible it must have been built in the 1960's or something but it ran....very slowly and I was always worried about the thing because it creaked when you went up or down in it. The weight room they provide isn't even a weight room....actually unless you are told where the heck it is you won't even be able to find it. I overheard the front desk person say it was on the second floor but i went to check where it was and all i found were hotel rooms. My uncle and I stayed there for I believe 3-4 days and on the very first night my card key STOPPED WORKING!!!! I went down to the lobby the next day which is probably the smallest lobby I have EVER seen in my life! and told the lady that my key had stopped working and asked if she could extend it for the rest of my stay. This girl was the one who had checked us in not 24 hours before and she couldn't remember me. Its a hard job I know but come on! My uncle was out walking around and I couldn't get him to VERIFY that i was in the room with him so she quizzed me about him, then I had to give her my ID, and finally got my key working again. The coffee shop attached to the hotel was nice and I really liked it. Other than that the hotel was mediocre at best and I probably will never stay there again.

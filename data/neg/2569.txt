First off let me say TINA at the Front Desk needs some classes in Customer Service. I have never met some one so RUDE!!! Second staying in this hotel is like being in a episode of COPS!! There were Drug dealers, and prostitutes hanging around outside. Its like The Hotel staff knew what was going on but they choose not to do anything about it!! Never again will I stay here or recommend it to anybody!!!!!

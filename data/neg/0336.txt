A friend and I stayed at this hotel for two nights and it was nothing like the photos online at the hotel's website-very deceiving. The carpeting in the main entryway of the hotel is filthy; the complimentary apples stale. We had to try three different rooms as each reeked of smoke, and the desk clerk did not care about the fact that my friend and I are both allergic to smoke. The room we stayed in was filthy-wallpaper dirty and peeling off in every corner, mildew, an air vent that was half out of the ceiling and caked with dirt and grime (has to be a code violation). Our power went out both mornings. When we asked the desk clerk to speak to a manager, or asst. manager, we were told both weren't available until after our stay was over. I have stayed in many hotels in Europe and even the Middle East and Thailand and have never had such a terrible experience! I felt like I needed a shower after staying there!

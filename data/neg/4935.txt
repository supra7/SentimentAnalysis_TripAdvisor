Never again Have stayed in several locations and hotels in Bali, all have been terific. But when we stayed at Melasti Beach 3 weeks ago were very dissapointed. It is an over crowded out of date pile of cement. The service was average, but the whole place had no Balinese feel to it. It was like an Australian getto.

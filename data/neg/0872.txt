We stayed for 1 day and a night the hotel itself is cheap and cheerful but if you like the sound of Air con units all day and all night this is the place for you. We where also woken at 10:30PM by the desk clerk knocking on the door because they said our water was running all day , though it was not. This could have been handled much better and much earlier . All in all i would not stay in this hotel again.

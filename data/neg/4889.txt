This was an awful experience for a hilton. The only plus that I can give this hotel was that it was right on the beach and the beach was clean. We came for a conference and tried to check in at three like stated. We had to wait an extra almost two hours to finish getting our rooms because they were not clean yet...we realized why later. The cleaning staff took forever to clean if they cleaned at all. We had a toilet that overflowed and it took three phone calls and three hours to get someone with a mop and some new towels, no kidding. The staff was rude almost the entire time. The beach view on one whole side is a horrible view because you can barely see the beach cause of some sling shot ride on the walk. PLEASE NOTE: read all of the fine print for all that they charge for. They charge for parking and unless you validate you have to walk a ways to get there. They charge for local phone calls, one dollar for the first minute and then 15 cents for tax on top of that. There were bottles of water that were 24 oz. that cost $3 but near the ice machine there is a pepsi machine with a 20 oz. for only $1.50. To park they charged us $50 a day for our bus, $8 a day for our van, and $20 a day for the trailer attached to the van! For six nights it cost us almost $500! I will never stay at this hotel again unless God himself audibly tells me to stay here or else!

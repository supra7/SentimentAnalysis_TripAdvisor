For the price, Barcelo Raval was a real let-down for us. The hotel claims to have parking "in the same building" but what they neglect to mention is that it is a public car park beneath their building that charges 34 euros a day. When we arrived and found this out the staff were not apologetic at all and blamed the Expedia listing (who we had booked through) for being wrong, saying parking is not mentioned on their website (sorry but it is on barcelo.com). But, "as it was a national holiday" (6th jan), they agreed to upgrade our room to a deluxe for free - which would have otherwise cost us 30euros. Hmm. So on to the room, the design of which uses modern styling to try and hide the fact that it is essentially very small. The shower was opposite the wardrobe so getting dressed often meant wet feet/socks, and the "desk" was just about big enough to put a laptop on, but certainly not comfortable enough to work at for any period of time. The heating system did not seem to work properly - you could set the thermostat temperature but turning the system on just led to blasts of cold air from the noisy fans. Worst still was that after removing the card key and leaving the room the system would turn on automatically so that whenever we came back our room was freezing (even if we set the thermostat to 30 degrees!). Great in summer I imagine, but not in winter. You also can't open any windows if you want any fresh air. The bed was a good size and comfortable, but we didn't sleep too well as there was a lot of noise from outside - typical of the area I guess. Pros: - Good location for getting around Barcelona - 360-degree panoramic views from the roof are amazing - Fast, free wi-fi Cons: - Dodgy temperature control system - Small rooms - Car park charges - Noisy area if you like to go to bed early

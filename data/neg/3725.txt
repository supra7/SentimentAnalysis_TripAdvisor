The location of this hotel is convenient and rates are affordable. However, you must be very careful of your personal belongings when you stay there. There are numerous cases of clients' personal properties which disappear like magic. If you happen to forget a personal belonging in your room when you check out, you will never see it again. The hotel reception or administration will tell you that they didn't see anything. Always.

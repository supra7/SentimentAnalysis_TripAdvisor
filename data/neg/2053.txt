Pro: Nice decor, pleasant staff, comfortable bed Cons: Not clean-coffee maker had leftover grounds; Mandatory $15 resort fee is a hidden charge and cannot be waived even if you don't intend to use the ridiculous extras that should be free (ie. parking, pool, newspaper, water) Can you imagine if your airlines charged you an extra mandatory fee because you need to use the seat and breathe their oxygen?. Ridiculous! When you arrive, there's no way you could refuse to pay after all your arrangements have been made. I make it a point to always avoid shady business practices of certain companies, and I've added Trump Hotel to my list. Also, the location is bad - it's a little bit off the strip and it's near a train station. The train whistle woke me up early in the morning.

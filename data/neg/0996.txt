I booked 3 nights thru their website. My request was a high floor & corner room. Upon check in, I was given the non-corner room on 16th floor. As soon as I took a elevator up to my room, I noticed that I had to swipe room key to activate the elevator. Also the wall is relatively thin, so you can hear the next door. There was also a road construction on 4th ave, so the noise level is very high and irritating. There was no coffee maker in the room and the bar serves coffee at $3.50. You can buy coffee at starbucks cross the street but they close at 6pm. The art hanging on hallway right next to my room displays dead person stuck in reservoir. What a wacky taste! The lighing is too dim too. I would never stay here again! The hotel stuff ( front desk ) is not friendly & there is NO welcoming mood here. I usually love W hotel but not in this particular one. The entrance on 4th avenue is always people waiting for thier bus and there's a steps it's not suitable to bring heavy luggage thru this door. however, if you go to Seneca St, you can go to front desk without go up the stairs.

We had booked one night in this hotel as a stopover on our way home from Iran via Istanbul. We were pretty tired when we turned up only to learn that the hotel had cancelled our booking the day before. Apparently they had tried to email us (while we were in transit) that they wanted the pincode to our credit card. As we hadn't sent it to them, they had automatically cancelled our reservation which had been made almost three months in advance. Asking for a confidentia pincode and cancelling a reservation the day before is not acceptable so we think something funny was going on. Possibly they had someone wanting to stay longer than just one night or maybe someone was planning to abuse our credit card. Luckily the receptionist helped us to find another hotel just two minutes away. However, we would like to warn other travellers of this procedure. Do NOT give out your pincode to anyone as your bank will not cover the damages if your card is abused.

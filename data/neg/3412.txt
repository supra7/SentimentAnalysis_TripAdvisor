This is the only place in Dallas that listed a smoking room, thats what got my eye. The 14 foot fence with razor wire on top really caught my eye but we still tried to get to place even tho Dildoe St was at the back of the Motel. The guy let me look at the room first before check in, after sister & I looked at the nasty, dirty & stained EVERYTHING,I took him back the key & was told it is too late to cancel,so I was charged $67 & went down the road & stayed at the Holiday Inn Express (non-smoking but great room for $94)

Got at great rate of $77 on hotwire, upon checking in the clerk says that we booked 2 double beds (we did not as with hotwire there is no choice) and that there were no regular king bed rooms available. But for $20 there is an upgraded king bed room. So the choices at check in were: 2 double beds or an extra $20 for a king bed. I found this a little dishonest and unsavory as the clerk could have gave us the king bed. I think the front desk staff saw the opportunity that we were a couple checking in on a cheap rate and made us choose to capitalize on making the extra $20. other than these check-in shenanigans, the hotel, the room and location were great for the price we paid. Parking was $33 plus parking tax = $41 but i was aware of this and was ok with it. I am a starwood gold and would have liked this stay if the check-in had gone a little better, it was not the $20 that i was concerned with but mainly the principle of the mater that ticked me off.

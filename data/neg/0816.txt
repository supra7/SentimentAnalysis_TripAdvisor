First, I want to say that this property is nothing like any Westin I have stayed at before. It's in need of major refurbishment. We were bumped, or as they like to say, "walked" to this hotel from the Seattle Sheraton due to the Sheraton staff overbooking many rooms. We were given a room that needed serious cleaning. The carpet was dirty and stained and there were some long black hairs on the bathroom counter. Unlike the Sheraton, where internet is free, the Wi-Fi cost almost $20 a day. The power strip, on the desk, was malfunctioning and I had to call for an "engineer" to come fix it so I could charge my computer. Even after the Sheraton promised they would cover our expenses for the inconvenience, the Westin still charged us for internet, two local phone calls and parking. I've since requested a refund.

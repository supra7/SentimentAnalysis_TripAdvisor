Who are you people who love this hotel? My trip to Seattle was perfect, except for having to stay at this perfectly horrid place. We had a corner "suite" which was actually a tiny room with hardly enough room to get around the incredibly hard and lumpy bed. The bathroom was so small that we had to take turns at the sink, as two people will not fit in there at the same time unless one person stands in the tub! It was cold the night we stayed, and the heat didn't work. Housekeeping walked into the room at 8 a.m without waiting for us to answer the door, just knocked once and came right in! As for location, it was probably once a charming hotel. It sits up on the hill right across the street from the public library. It's a good 8 or more blocks down to the waterfront, which isn't so bad going down, but it's quite a trek to walk back up--this is not a small hill, it's very steep, so look forward to getting in some cardio during your stay. And pack comfortable shoes, it's at least two miles to the space needle. Don't get roped into the "suite with deluxe breakfast" deal, either. The deluxe breakfast consists of a small drip coffee and a muffin at the coffee shop downstairs. All in all, including taxes, we paid almost $200 a night for a cup of coffee and a room that rates no better than a Motel 6. For the price, I've had much, much better accomodations. My best suggestion after seeing the area, stay at the Marriott on the waterfront. It's only a few dollars more, just steps from the Pike St. Market, and sits on the water. The rooms are gorgeous (and HUGE!) and it's central to everything. We also had dinner at a place called The Brooklyn. Highly recommend. Stellar service, and amazing food. I truly enjoyed my trip to Seattle, but next time we'll do one thing very differently. STAY AT A BETTER HOTEL!!!!

I am about to check out this hotel and will never return. When I checked in last night (19th April 2011) I found that the trash bin behind the computer table was full of dust from the previous guest...good start, isnt it? But the worse come when the noise of continuously taking off and landing aircrafts did not allow me to sleep a single minute. Rooms are isolated from the glass they have but not from the room door, thus, it seemed aircrafts where just in my room. When I complained today the Manager in charge said that it might happen the seals where not in proper condition. I do not recommend it at all.

I have just returned from my stay in Hilton Dayton Beach very upset even though it was only a 1-night stay at the hotel. My family of four checked into the hotel in the evening and immediately went out for our dinner returning only late in the night. When I was drying myself after my shower in the night, I noticed that the bath scale which was placed just below the basin next to the toilet bowl had a broken cover. On closer examination, I found to my horror that the broken plastic cover for the scale was very sharp. I was staying with my two young daughters and wife, and was at that point feeling very fortunate that neither of them have gone close to the scale and got injured. I quickly called the front desk and complained to the supervisor on duty of my findings. He asked me to place the broken scale outside my door and promised me that he will get someone to remove it immediately. I did as instructed, highlighting that he has to get someone to remove it as it is very dangerous for people walking pass my door, especially children. I was appalled and very angry the next morning, when I found the broken scale still laying outside my door when I was checking out. In fact, I almost trip on the scale as I was walking out of my room with my luggage!! Fortunately, I did not have my children running out of the room as we were getting out to check-out from our room!! I found this entire incident unacceptable, especially with the trust that I always have with Hilton's services and high standards.....First, to have a damaged bath scale with sharp cover left in the bathroom by homekeeping. Next, having an irresponsible staff who simply patronized the customer and did not follow up with the matter even though advised that it could pose a danger to other hotel guests.....sigh.

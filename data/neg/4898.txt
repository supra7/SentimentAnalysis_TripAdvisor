I actually checked in last night and so far I can complain about 2 of the slowest elevators ever, major leak in the bathroom sink, my friend's room had a safe with no door...I mean this is the worst hotel stay I've ever stayed in. The rooms need updating: chipped paint on wall, stains on bathroom floor, and the big obsolete TVs (this isn't major issue but it's 2012)!! The hallway on my floor has the worst smell, like cigarrette-smoke-infused wetness. I would never stay here again especially since I traveled from NY.

I hate to say it, but this hotel is just DIRTY. From the elevator, to the lounge tables to the rooms, it needs a good cleaning and, while they're at it, new carpets, drapes and curtains. The breakfast service comes with a snarl from the cook, the parrot in the atrium (who begins screaming at 5 a.m.) is not treated humanely and while signs in the lounge state that the hotel is undergoing renovations, no improvements are obvious. Only Rachel at the front desk was a plus for this tired, worn property. Hilton, send an inspector to check this place out. I will definitely stay elsewhere next time in Indy.

All the small details that make a vacation experience enjoyable were not there. I did not get a great price for the stay here. I payed for a luxury resort and got a less than average experience. The welcome started having to wear those horrible cheap plastic bracelets all the time (the web page says it's an all inclusive resort, so why make us wear this?). Followed by a terrible buffet lunch at the "Alebrijes" restaurant. The variety and quality of the food was terrible. Not to mention that half of the options were out. The quality of the drinks was no better either. We tried to forget this by going to the pool and beach area. The water in the outside jacuzzis was colder than the pool. The beach is not very nice and the covers of the sofas in this area had already been removed so we could not sit there. When we came back to the room, the shower was terrible, the water hit so hard I could not give my baby a bath. Then the safe box failed and had to be broken to remove our stuff. I requested a change of room and got a new one without the jacuzzi I had payed for. In general the food and drinks were average, nothing great. The service from the waiters and in the pool was very good though. It was very rude how they asked me to check out at 11:00 am the day we were leaving and threatening with extra charges for any delays. To be honest, I was very relieved to leave and never plan to return.

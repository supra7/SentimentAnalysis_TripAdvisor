A dump I think Radisson is on a major decline I stay in many of them (because the price is cheap and my company likes that) as I travel around the country on business: They are almost always run down and about half the time, service is terrible. I suspect the good deals on Priceline come along because few want to stay there.This hotel was run down, old and has a reputation with the SeaTac police force of taking in a lot of Rif Raf. The hotel is right next to the airport, so it is convenient time wise if you are taking a flight.If you are looking for a decent hotel, avoid Radisson in general. I am sure there are exceptions, but I haven seen them.

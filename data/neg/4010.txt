This hotel was awful. I only wish I had read other recent reviews before deciding to stay here. There were so many things wrong I don't even know where to begin. Better yet, when you read all the other low rated reviews rest assured that everything they say is simply too kind. old, delapitated, dirty, broken, unfriendly, hot, expensive, unresponsive, indifferent... Seems like they go out of their way to ensure such bad overall experience in every single area that matters.

The marqueen is listed as a three star hotel and I was really disappointed when we arrived. It is really old and outdated, I suppose some would find that quaint but it was loud and musty smelling. The carpets in the hallway were badly stained. The floors in the room were wood but pretty old. The bathroom was tiny and the flooring was this old, ratty linoleum. I was afraid to walk in the room with bare feet. I had seen where previous reviews mentioned how loud it was outside the hotel. It was awful. There are a couple of bars across the street and due to the pumping music and loud voices, it felt like the bar was in my room. Combined with the traffic on the street, the noise was unbearable. After the first night, I asked if we could switch rooms to the inside section of the hotel. The staff did not seem at all surprised by my request but said there were no other rooms to switch to. I get the feeling that it is a common request. I got stuck with this hotel by using Priceline. If you are using Priceline to find a hotel near dowtown Seattle, stay away from Queen Ann or you will get stuck with the Marqueen. Lake union is a much better bet. Nothing in this hotel is nice, new, comfortable, or clean

We arrived at this hotel for three nights in December. When we arrived there was a party in progress with loud music in a meeting room just off the lobby. We were assigned a room on the 2nd floor where we could hear all the loud music. We asked to change rooms. The staff was very pleasant and gave us a room in a quieter part of the hotel. We noticed some maintenance problems in our room. The smoke detector was missing. Only the base plate for the detector was present on the ceiling and there were electrical wires dangling down. Also, we noticed that the lock on the window was broken. A large piece of the latch was missing and the window could not be locked. I took photos of these items for documentation purposes. The room was clean but furnishings seemed rather spartan. There were no pictures on the wall. Also no small refrigerator. In our opinion, just sort of a bare bones room. We stayed the first night and checked out the next morning. We just didn't feel safe in this hotel with a missing smoke detector in our room and a broken window latch. We wondered: How many other rooms in the hotel are in this condition? Just how well is this hotel maintained? The staff was very friendly and helpful but we just did not have a good feeling about the hotel based on what appeared to us to be inadequate maintenance.

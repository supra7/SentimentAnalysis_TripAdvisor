Pros- The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is a beautiful historic hotel. It is in a good location. You can walk most places in the city, or take a short cab ride. Cons- When I checked in the representative did not slide my credit card correctly, so the payment never went through. He gave us our keys so I obviously assumed that everything was fine. On our second day there, our keys stopped working so we went to the front desk and they just made us new keys. They didn't mention anything about us paying. On the morning were were checking out at 8:30am a security guard showed up at our door saying we needed to go downstairs to the front desk. We called at first and discovered that they said we never paid and had to come down immediately and pay. We asked if we could just wait until we checked out (only a couple hours away) but they refused. So we went down to the lobby, obviously very irritated and upset. They said that my card was not swiped right when we checked in so it showed that we never paid. We found out that the reason what our keys did not work the day before was because they had locked our room but the person we talked to failed to inform us of that. The manager acted as though it was our fault that her employee didn't check us in right. She had the nerve to tell me that she was not putting us out at all by this. My response was that I was in her lobby at 8:30am in my pjs! I did end up getting a partial credit, but it was not worth the bad experience. I understand that computer issues happen, but the way they handled the situation was extremely poor. Sending a security guard to my room for their mistake is unacceptable and very poor customer service. I am sad to say I will not be staying here again, despite the hotel's beauty.

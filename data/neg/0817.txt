We booked through travelocity. When our flight was cancelled due to snow and ice and delayed a full day out, Westin refused to refund 1 of our 2 nights. For a 200+ per night hotel, that seems a bit greedy. Not to mention, the view wasn't that great, the air didn't work at all (barely slept that night). I expect at a minimum the air to work for a $$$ room. Still waiting to hear back from Travelocity whether or not they will refund us (they told us they would BEFORE we left town and then refused when we got back). We also happily ate the cost of the rental car for that extra day. We won't be dealing with either any time soon...

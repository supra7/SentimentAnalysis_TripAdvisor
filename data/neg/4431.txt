I checked in and after seeing the room and hearing sirens from the fire station next door, checked back out and found another hotel. The room was spacious, but was in serious need of renovation. The furniture was worn, chipped and stained. The ceiling had a large water stain. The bathroom was really shabby, peeling wall paper, stains on the countertop and mirror. The only things in the room that appeared new were the bed and flat screen t.v. The manager said they will be renovating soon - I would skip this hotel until that happens. Unfortunately they cannot do anything about the proximity to the fire station, so if you are a light sleeper, you might want to avoid this one completely.

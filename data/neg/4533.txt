This outdated hotel has significant problems with its elevator system and card readers. 3 days in a row I was denied access to my floor and the executive lounge. Hotel staff rekeyed and issue still continued. They said we know, you just have to deal with it. Unnaceptable. Stay at the Hyatt. Better property, cleaner, better lounge nicer staff. The Palmer House is old and they refuse to maintain it. Walpaper falling off the walls, mildew on the bathroom tiles, musty smell, and a mile walk to your room once you get to the floor your on. The lounge food is cheap and not worthy of the HILTON name. I will not be back until they fix he elevators. DOnt say I didnt warn you. THat why they have sofas in the elevator area.

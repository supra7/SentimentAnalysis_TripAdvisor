First, great location. We were there for 4 days on business trip. The trip was set up as direct bill with credit card needed by our company employees only for incidentals. Instead, the front desk billed some of our guests for entire stay taking funds from their debit or credit cards. It took a few days to have funds reversed. The rooms are small and out-dated, even on the executive floor. Finally, the management decided to do some plumbing work and shut off all water to rooms one night in a large section of the hotel at 10pm. They said the water would return by 4am. At 7:30am the water was not back on, so toilets could not be flushed, showers weren't available, etc. This lack of water on a business trip made the experience aggravating and uncomfortable. It reflected poor decision-making on the part of the hotel management as it affected many guests.

I stayed at Staybridge hotels before. So I preferred staybridge hotel. I had paid hotel price in advance 1 month ago. When I checked in this staybridge suite dallas near the galleria, on feb 19, they asked me my credit card for possible things.Same day, I noticed my credit card was charged with double price of the payment I had paid before. And my credit card was blocked. Then I asked why, they told me that it was a problem in their system and they apologized. They told me that they would release.(Still I am waiting for them) And moreover, I noticed that they charged me a daily video price which I didn't watch. Then they apologized again. Moreover there was a noisy in the hole during the night.

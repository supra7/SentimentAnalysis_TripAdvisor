My grandaughters and i stay at sheraton seattle every year for a few days after christmas- each year the service gets worse and the hotel is more shabby (altho they say it is mostly recently remodeled). For example, when i made reservation i requested refrig for prescriprion drugs- when arrived no refrig-requested again at front desk- still no refrig-when i called service they said it had not been requested and they would bring one to room- waited another hour before it came. also per central reservations there is not charge for a refrig for medicine but they charged me 35 dolars a day for the refrig.

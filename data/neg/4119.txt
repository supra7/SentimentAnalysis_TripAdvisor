If you come in the summer months prepare to die of heat. These clowns don't have AC in the hotel. They try to claim its because the hotel is so old- but its inexcusable. Many Boston AREA hotels do have AC. It might seem like hotels in cambridge , allston, summerville are farther away- but Boston is a small city. Trust me- if its the summer you will DIE of heat in this hotel. The windows don't open enough to let a decent breeze in. They open a crack- not enough to let the air in- but enough to let you hear the drunk college students leaving the whiskey park bar at 2am. If you expect good service and a good room- go to the Ritz or stay outside of Boston. This hotel screamed rip off as soon as the staff told me that the room cannot get colder than 5 degrees of the outside temperature. I stayed in the buisness floor and it was still unconfortable. If you stay in the buisness floor thinking it'll be great because of the nice bath rooms- don't bother. Marble lined tub MIGHT sound appealing- but it's actually just a normal tub that they've slaped some marble on the side of. Leave boston and stay in a normal hotel outside if you are coming here in teh summer. You will save alot of money and even if you take cabs everywhere you will still comeout ahead rather staying in this HOT HOT HOT hotel.

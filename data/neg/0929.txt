such a bad experience. we were put in a room where air conditioner did not work and the windows opened out to the highway so was soooooo noisy getting some air to try and sleep. Wireless WiFi only worked in the rooms closests to the lobby. The staff were unfriendly and slow. The free breakfast was not worth it. A bagel with cream cheese spend and coffee was not available for the 2 days. i recommend spending a extra $20.00 and going else where.

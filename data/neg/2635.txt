I've picked this hotel based on the tripadvisor reviews and reserved way ahead of my arrival. Upon arrival I found out that there is some major construction work around the hotel, making it imposibble to reach the hotel according to all GPS instructions. After spending too much time driving around and trying to find my way to the hotel, I eventually parked my car and went to find the hotel. The reception clerk said they were aware of this and told right away which address to load onto the GPS. He was extremley surprised with my dissatisfaction. He seemed not to understand why the hotel should have informed, at leasat its foreign guests. The hotel surroundings are not a place to take an evening stroll: full of abandodned and under-construction buildings and heavy sewage smell. After I had parked my car in the underground hotel parking, I was told that I would be charged for it 20 Euro per day, even though the hotel failed to mention this during the reservation or during the process of my arrival. Two days after I payed for the parking, they asked me to pay again - it took me a while to convince them that I had already payed. When I tried to order a taxi through the reception desk, one day in advance, I had to repeat my request three times, each time to another clerk - since, as every single one of them stated himself "It's good you've mentioned this, because the clerk who was here earlier forgot to write it down". The hotel itself is modern, clean, serves decent breakfast and offers spacious rooms, but the service is basic at-best, and what is more troubling: the staff is not aware of its malfunctions. They seem to think you shuld take care of yourself, repeating every request and demanding to know everything.

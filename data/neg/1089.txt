Location of this hotel is fantastic. It is very central to Downtown, and the market. Lots of dinning and shopping options are close buy. The rooms are very small. Basically our room had the king size bed and barely enough room to walk around it. The bathroom was fine however our shower head was broken. Once we let the front desk know that the shower head was broken they fixed it almost immediately which was great. The hotel room should have been bigger for what we paid. Competing hotels in the $200 per night price range have much larger rooms and are just as close to downtown. We also asked for directions to a laundromat as we had an extended stay and weren't about to pay the extreme rates all the hotels charge. We were given directions to a laudromat across Denny Way which was about 15 blocks away uphill. We later found two different ones within 8 blocks of the hotel on both on first and fifth avenues. Overall not a negative experience, however considering that the hotel industry is very much in the "impressing" business there was a lot of room for improvement.

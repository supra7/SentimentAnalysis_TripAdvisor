The hotel booked too many weddings that weekend which resulted in the hotel's inability to serve the guests. The bar and lounge area were closed to all guests so the family went to the Adolphus to visit, eat and drink. The valet was overwhelmed. It took 30 minutes to park your car and 1 1/2 hours to get your car. We had to hire taxi's to get where we needed to on time. I have stayed at this hotel before, never again.

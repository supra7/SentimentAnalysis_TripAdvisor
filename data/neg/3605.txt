We got a suite. It was across from the elevator. We asked for another room away from the elevator, and Steve said that they didn't have another suite, and since we booked through Hotels.com, he couldn't get us any different room. Understandable. Problem 1: The shower sets off the fire alarm. After an average-heat, average-length shower made ours go crazy. Problem is that it wouldn't go off. We called Steve downstairs, he came up (alarm still sounding), and took it to find a battery. A few minutes later, he returned, and the fire alarm was fine. Conclusion- You MUST shower with the door closed, or the steam sets off the alarm. Inconvenient at 11pm, for probably the whole floor of the hotel. That night: The hotel is near numerous gentleman's clubs. "The Men's Club" parking lot is diagonal from the rear of the hotel (also, a boarded up building), and was our suite view. Sometime after the shower incident, we heard what sounded like fireworks. Strangely similar to a single gunshot. Definately creepy, but not much we could do, except be thankful we were on the second floor. Next morning: Cockroach in toilet. Probably had fallen out of the air vent right above the toilet. Made the room feel GROSS, but we couldn't get another room. Not sure how this became the #2 hotel on TripAdvisor. The price wasn't special... Could have stayed downtown at the Omni or the Hyatt Regency for the same price. Steve was very nice, and did what he could to meet our needs. We won't be back.

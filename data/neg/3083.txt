When we visited we arrived late in the evening + were given the wrong room - a double instead or a twin. We were then told that this was what we had reserved despite me showing the reservation confirmation which clearly stated "twin". I spoke English initially as this is how they greated us + my friend does not speak Spanish. I speak Spanish fluently. One receptionist spoke quite rudely about us in Spanish and was surprised when I then responded in Spanish. We were upgraded for one night and then given the correct room the next day. However, this initial experience really soured the experience. The bathrooms have a transparent shower room + when staying with a friend this is awkward. I was told that this is the "concept" of the hotel. Be aware of this! This is a great hotel, really, but the treatment of us was so poor + I don't think the "concept" is great for friends travelling together. There are other great hotels in Barcelona + next time I will go for one of them.

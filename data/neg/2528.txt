We went to Miami in sep 2011 and stayed here. From the first look, i could say that i am not going to like staying here. The reception area was so not welcoming and rooms, i dont want to go into the details. Bathroom was so small... and no room cleaning service at all for 3 days.. overall never going to stay in this place ever.. definitely not recommended.

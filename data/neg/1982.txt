Looked up all the reviews before we left and did not believe the bad ones! BELIEVE THEM! Service is terrible. Had to call repeatedly to housekeeping for soap, hangers, wash cloths, shampoo,etc. Television broke and they never fixed it. Don't count on the shuttle service - ended up taking a cab most of the time. Friendly service? Not! Food in the restaurants was mediocre and pricey. Pool was awful. Try Caesar's or Bellagio or anywhere else for that matter. Glass of wine $13.00. I am from New York so that was bad compared even New York. My anniversary and asked for a room with a view - received one over the parking lot. Ruined my trip and would never go back to Vegas or another Trump for that matter. Thought with the "Trump" name it would be great. Think again.

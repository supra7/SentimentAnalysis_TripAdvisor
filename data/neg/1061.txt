We found the rooms to be small--not bad in and of itself, but the heater/airconditioner is overly loud, the noise from the street loud and the surfaces in the room for suitcases is very tight. However, the worst thing of all is the bathroom--no place to put your toiletries bag, no room to turn around in. I had to keep returning to the room from the bathroom to get makeup supplies as there was no place to put them. Staff were pleasant, almost cloying. We won't stay there again, even though the location is great for shopping at Nordstom.

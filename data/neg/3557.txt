I've stayed at a motel 6 before and really enjoyed it, so this trip I booked another motel 6. When I arrived I had to wait 2 hours to get room because the hotel was full. now once I got a room the place was nice until the next morning I saw a roach in the bathroom so I killed it. I told the manager and he did move me to another room and promised to refund me some of my room fee back. The new room was nice, but I saw another roach in light in the bathroom the next day. I did received my discount for the room, but I would not stay at that motel 6 again. 2380 W Northwest Hwy, Dallas, TX 75220. Don't stay at this motel 6 unless you like roaches.

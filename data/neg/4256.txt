While the accommodations are fine, the service is what one finds at a Ramada Inn. I encountered several problems, including a billing issue. To a person, the staff's approach was consistently "we're very sorry." PERIOD. No accountability, no solving the problem, no "we need to address this." The unspoken statement was, "So what do you want ME to do?" I stay in Boston 2 times/month and wanted to accommodate a client who suggested the Eliot. What a mistake. I typically stay at the Four Seasons (outstanding) or the Taj (old Ritz) or the Ritz. I knew all of them were good, but having now experienced the Eliot, I am freshly aware HOW good they are. Stay anywhere else. You'll be disappointed by the Eliot.

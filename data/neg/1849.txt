Very noisy at the night time cos of the indian punjabi pubs. they play music around 11pm to 5am or so. room was very small and didnt look so clean place at all. bathroom was very moldy and our shower was broke. didnt liked the place atmosphere. good thing was free wireless, good aircon and prize was not bad.

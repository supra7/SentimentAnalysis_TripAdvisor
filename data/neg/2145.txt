I am shocked that this resort receives good reviews. It seems to me that the owners ran out of money when developing this hotel or did not spend enough time looking at their competition. It is lacking a decent swimming pool and nice restaurants. There is only one decent Italian restaurant, a buffet, Chinese and a small outdoor grill. I was not impressed with the food at all except for the 7 course meal we had comped from all of our complaints. I have to say that Chef Oscar is amazing and Jose Luis is a real stand up guy. When we arrived we were told that we had a Jacuzzi room, but we ended up with a crappy studio. Once I told Jose Luis about the problem he actually made it right and upgraded us to a nice one bedroom. The best part about this resort is the quality of their rooms, but other than that I was very disappointed in the place. It lacked character and activities. When you read about the 300+ acres and the cenotes it seems like it has this wonderful jungle that you can explore and swim in the cenotes. Not at all, there are 300+ acres of unusable land. The small cenotes takes about 20 minutes to swim through and you will have about 50 mosquito bites by the time you get to the end. Other than that there is nothing to do in this resort. There are only two small pools with a very small bar that is overcrowded so it takes way too long to even get a drink. No swim-up bar like most resorts in that area and you can only see the water from one of the pools. The hotel is located about 1/2 mile back from the beach so there are NO ocean front rooms and the beach is unusable. The spa is extremely small and does not offer much, especially for the price. After Tres Rios, I spent a 2nd week at El Dorado Royal and this was an amazing resort. You have to stay in an ocean front Casita!! They have a private swimming pool and Jacuzzi, a butler, amazing staff and the grounds are stunning.

My husband and I stayed there 3 nights while visiting Seattle. I am a Choice Privileges Member and 2 of my nights I used my points and they were free. Awful smell, no elevator--my husband is a disabled vet. The girl at the front desk was nice enough but a little scatter-brained. She did give us a brochure about a tour. I called her from my room to ask her to book it. 20 minutes later my husband called to check (she said she would call us w/details). She had forgotten. Also, one morning we used the laundry services. We stepped across the hall to look at the fitness room. When we turned on the lights one of the male employees was sitting there watching TV in the dark. So, needless to say, I didn't go there the next morning to exercise. Best thing was that the bed was comfortable. The fat-free milk tasted almost spoiled.

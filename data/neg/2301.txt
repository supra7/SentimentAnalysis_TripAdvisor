I spent a week here for work and hope I never have to stay here again. I came in on a Sunday evening, took my shoes off and landed on wet carpet that had been recently shampooed. Since I could not fathom walking about in wet carpet or wearing my shoes all night, I asked to be switched to another room. The front desk said they had nothing available. So I went back to this room and tried to work with the situation hoping the carpet would be dry the next day. It was and the next few days were uneventful except for the dishwasher coming off the cabinet and almost landing on my feet as I unloaded it (Room 213). Then today I come back to my room after work to find a sign on my door announcing wet carpet, yet again. I tore the sign off and went to the front desk to ask what possesed them to shampoo the carpet twice in five days. The front desk said they could not answer for what housekeeping did. I again asked to be switched to no avail. Then one of my co-workers told me in front of the front desk that when her carpet was shampooed they apologized to her and gave her a pair of slippers to wear. So I asked the front desk for my own pair of slippers and they told me they were in some housekeeping closet which they had no access to in the evening. I ended up borrowing the slippers from my co-worker and wearing socks with them. In a nutshell, if I'm ever sent here for work again, I will decline.

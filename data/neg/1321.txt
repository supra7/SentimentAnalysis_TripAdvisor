The hotel staff was professional and friendly, and the beds were incredible. However, the food served at my conference was awful, and I was terribly displeased to be in Seattle, surrounded by many hotels, and needing to pay for internet access through the Hilton. I will stay at any of the other hotels with free access next time I need to fly/be at a conference. And, if you do end up paying for internet in hourly increments, you must use them contingously, which is not practical for conference goers.

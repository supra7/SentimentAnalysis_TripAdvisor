We had stayed at Sutton Place twice before and enjoyed its location and especially the view from the corner rooms. However, we always found the front desk staff cold and aloof. This visit we received no help from the Bell man coming or going. The staff response to complaints of noise, which included people talking loudly in the hallways till 4 AM was to turn their backs and make us feel unwelcome for remarking on the noise and our lack of sleep. I have never felt the hotel deserved a "choice" award, this time they don't even deserve a star. We have stayed at many hotels in Chicago downtown over the last 30 years. There are many excellent choices which provide gracious service whether low priced or high. I would suggest you pick somewhere else than the Sutton Place.

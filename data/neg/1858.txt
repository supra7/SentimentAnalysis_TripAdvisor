I was checked in to a room after a long flight and there was a water leak from the roof in the sitting area. Informed reception couple of times. A technician came and inspected and said it take time to fix. The hotel did want me to stay for more time till they fix the leak. i was so tired and it was 12 midnight. I told reception about my problem and with great difficulty i got my room changed. The guys at the reception do not know the customer survice and provide you with very poor service. They treat you as someone who has come to seek their help. No wifi in the hotel which is a mandatory requirment. I do not recommend this hotel to a anybody.

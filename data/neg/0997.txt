if you are allergic to pets, don't stay here. A four star hotel that allows pets??? Hmm. I didn't know that when I booked; I guess the dogs in the bar should have been my first clue. Location is great-better values for your $$. The hotel looks worn, service is extremely poor in the dining room and at the management level. the restaurant is terrible. What else do you need to know!! Oh, yes AND parking is $44 - yes a night.

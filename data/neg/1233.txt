Don't ever go there again My husband and I went there just one night,it's very terrible1. you can see some cigeratte burn on the carpet and the bath room.2. the room is very dirty, I got multiple insect bites on my face,neck ,the limbs,that made me see a doctor afterwards.3. we saw a cockroach(!!!!) in my room before we leave.so, we do not recommend this hotel at all !

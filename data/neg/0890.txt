Our son was touring the University of Washington. I selected this motel because I wanted to be close to the campus. I have to honestly say that if I could have found another place that night, I would have moved. The room was filthy and smelled. I was seriously concerned that the bed may have bugs since they were old and very uncomfortable. When my husband and I left to meet our son for dinner, we noticed that the door would not lock. When we advised the front desk about the door, they told us don''t worry, we'll fix it while your gone. Of course we were uncomfortable leaving with our belongings in the room. Although they claimed the door was fixed, the door never closed properly. Breakfast consisted of OJ, Coffee, cereal, small packaged little blueberry and banana muffins.This property is close to the campus, but the location is not great and it's in a VERY congested area. I was happy when the morning came and we were able to check out. I've always relied on trip advisor for reviews before staying at motels. This time I was fooled by some who reviewed this place as decent. This is NOT a good place to stay. There are many motels in Seattle. Be wise and avoid this place.

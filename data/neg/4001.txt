Recently returned from a 2 night stay at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel. We were in room 1411. The view from the room was nice and the location of the hotel is excellent within walking distance or subway to everything, but that is really the only thing I can say was nice about this place. The room was old and small. It stayed hot even with the a/c set on 64. The shower was really difficult to adjust and set. Water was either scalding or freezing. The hotel was in the dark ages as far as technology. No wifi, and you had to pay to use the internet in your room. You also had to pay to use the computers in the business center. Needless to say I did not use my laptop while here. Also found out on my second night that the floor was haunted. Someone said the floor used to be a hospital. Came back to my room several times to find the radio on and the interior closet door open so that the door to get in the room would hit the closet door and you could not get in. Really weird!!! Bed was hard as a brick. There was always a line at concierge and the lady was rude. Also the bellhop literally yanked a dollar bill out of my hand after I had to carry my own bag!!!! I was shocked! The room was way to expensive for this kind of service! With all that said I would not stay here again nor would I recommend it to anyone. I loved Boston and hope to return but I will stay somewhere else.

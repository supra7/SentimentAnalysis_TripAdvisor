My husband and I stayed at this hotel on April 2nd and my husbands debit card was charged in error. I called to rectify this situation (as well as sending an email), and it was taken care of, albeit about a week later. Last Saturday I noticed that we had been charged again. I called and spoke to someone named Ryan who was supposedly a manager. He told me that although he was not able to reverse the charge, that he would ensure that it was taken care of on Monday when their accounting department was open. He was not able to tell me why we had been charged a month after our stay, but did acknowledge that it was their error. Of course, it was not. I called back again and was made to hold twice, for 10-15 minutes each time. I was told that because I do not have the card # and expiration date of my husband (who I cannot reach because he is in another state and about to be deployed with the military) that nothing can be done without the card number. COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!! Not to mention untrue. Apparently this is how this hotel makes money - by taking money that does not belong to them, along with hiring sub-par help (leading to HORRENDOUS customer service), and charging outrageous prices. I would also like to mention that our room was uncomfortably hot, and smelled like smoke. Never again will I stay at one of your hotels, and I assure you that the military families in the area will also never patronize any of your hotels either. VERY disappointing.

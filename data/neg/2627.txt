A very basic hotel which is mainly used by business people. The reception staff were generally unhelpful with one exception, a young woman, whose name escapes us, but we made sure we saw her with any queries we had. The internet the hotel boasts is an utter joke, it takes forever to connect. The day before we left it took us over an hour to check in online!!! We found this hotel very expensive for it's quality of service & amenities provided, it also boasts an extensive fitness gym which consists of a ONE weight training station & a couple of bikes!! I think that sums up what this hotel is all about - BAD VALUE FOR MONEY!!

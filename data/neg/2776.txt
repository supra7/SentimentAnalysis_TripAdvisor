DO NOT STAY HERE!! We had the most horrific experience in our lives at this hotel!! As we drove up to the hotel, we knew we weren't in a safe part of town and could tell the place was going to be a dump. First off, our room was not cheap - we were paying over $100 per night there. Their site is full of false advertising. It states shuttle and limo - neither of which exist. Our room was supposed to be non smoking, but it reaked of smoke. Rather than make anything right with us upon our complaints, they offered to refund our money so we could go to another hotel. Unless you bring a gun, do NOT stay here!!!

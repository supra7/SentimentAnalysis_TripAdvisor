I stayed in this hotel on the Concierge level. The evening snacks were great, and the wait staff on that level were just lovely. Here's what I didnt like... I was there on a business trip with another colleague... She ended up with a far better room than mine, in spite of us paying the same price, and the rooms being 2 doors away from each other. My bathroom was old and dingy. The Air vents were dusty and loud. Had an awful view, and the "renovations" looked like they had been done by a 6 year old. I have travelled in Boston a lot over this past year, and have to say, of all the hotels I stayed at... this was by far the worst.. In the end. I did change rooms (a smaller one) which had an updated bathroom... which made it bearable....

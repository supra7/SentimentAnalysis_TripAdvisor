Of course the location is great, but the property has become dirty and run-down, and service is barely 2-star. Lots of disgruntled employees, constant errors in service. Just not what you expect for $500+ per night. Many years ago this was a great place but all of the cutbacks are obvious and they are nickel-and-diming the guests both on additional fees and costs and on reductions in service levels.

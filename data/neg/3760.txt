I would never use this hotel or the group again. Having reserved and paid two weeks in advance, when arriving at 9 pm on the 31st December, wishing to spend New Years Eve in the center of Barcelona with our family, we were told the room had been double booked. We were not the only people, we found out there were another 4 couples Whose contract had not been honored. We were offered alternative accommodation at the airport but we had just arrived from the airport. Clearly if We wish to stay in the area of the airport that is where we would have stayed. We eventually occupied one single room. No apologies, no regrets and we only received the difference in price between double and single room after 2 months.

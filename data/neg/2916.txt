Okay so I had a twin room on the top floor. It was unbelievable hot and the dirty windows hardly opened! So I slept horribly and the puke stain on the floor, dirty dirty walls, blood on the pillow case, pube on the bed and incredibly smelly 'bathroom' didn't help with my stay here whatsoever. Needless to say I didn't have breakfast, only stayed the one night out of two and would never ever go near this place again! Oh and the relentless groaning was just laughable but gross...

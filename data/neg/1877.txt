So trip advisor, you were not correct. Either that or I got the one room that is not a success out of the 6 room hotel. I get there and the owner was nowhere to be found. I waited and rang the bell (in the winter on the side of the road), called two numbers, nothing. 10 minutes later, I finally get buzzed in. When checking in the owner was so very rude and unapologetic. My stay was for 6 days for work, so I thought this place would suit all my needs, what with the kitchen and the homely looking rooms. Not true. There was no iPod dock, no alarm clock, the toilet didnt flush properly, the shower took literally 20 minutes to heat up and the sheets are maybe 100 thread count?? I was up scratching half the night for a week. I even asked if I could have new sheets, so the manager tells me he would have the sheets washed for me instead because he doesnt have any extra King size sheets. They only washed the top sheet, so the itch continued. Starch much? First day there, I obviously will need a cab. No one is to be found at the concierge desk... so I had to go and flag one. Not until my 4th day there did someone at the desk offer to call a cab for me. Also, the rooms that face the back alley are forced to listen to a very loud heating/cooling system so I hope you can sleep with noise! Because this is NOT a quiet hotel. Needless to say, I will not be going back. People I spoke to that live in Montreal all said that Lappartment is the place to stay, so next time, thats where I will be. I am only giving this hotel 1 star based on the location. Hotel Du Fort was a 1970s retro hotel, but this place takes the cake for places not to stay at. It reminded me of a crappy bachelor pad in college!

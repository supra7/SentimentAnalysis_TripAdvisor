Dont even bother with this hotel. The picture are acurate, but the little things dont show. The front desk staff was new and poorly trained. The sports bar and resturant attached were not impressive and priced too high for the bad quality of food. The room was decent, nothing to brag about. The bed was like sleeping on a rock. The parking lot was nice because it is gated but has the size to fit a couple of hot wheels cars. The thing that bothered me the most was the start and end of my stay. When i booked the room i booked the Shedd Package, which includes 2 VIP tickets (which were described as tickets that allow me to surpass lines anywhere, which is not the case, AT ALL) to the aquarium. Upon arrival i asked about the tickets and was told they are waiting at Will Call. I veririfed that as i walked away and was told "yes, theyll be waiting there for you". I woke up the next morning to go to the aquarium with my girlfriend and was told that i do not get to skip the line and that i had to wait in line for my tickets. We waited an hour to get to the will call desk and got to the desk and was told that there we not tickets waiting for us. I contacted the hotel and was hung up on by the front desk person, at which point i decided it wasnt worth it and we didnt get into the aquarium. When following up with the hotel the next morning, I spoke with a lady at the desk i wasn't familiar with and was given attitude when i asked for a manager.

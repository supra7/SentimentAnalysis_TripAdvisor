My friends and I stayed here on a Saturday night for a birthday party.. we checked in at around 5 and were told we had no room.. that we would need to wait. We got to our room and they gave us ONE bed for four people.. we called and told them, they said they were sorry that the hotel was over-sold. They sent up an air mattress.. we never got our things sent to us from the bell service.. we had to wait FORRRRRREVER for an elevator and go get our own things. NO ice makers on any of the floors except the very top! And trust me after you wait literally 15 minutes for each elevator at least.. you don't even want ice anymore. When we were checking out.. we called for Bell service.. nothing.. they kept saying they were coming.. never did. We carried everything to the Valet ourselves.. they never brought our car! FINALLY after waiting in the lobby forever, we asked again and they told us our car was parked on a meter across the street and we could go get it..!! TWENTY dollar Valet for that?? Its sad because its a nice hotel.. just horribly run, and the elevators do need help.

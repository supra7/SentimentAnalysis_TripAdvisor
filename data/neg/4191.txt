We booked a room at the Park Plaza from Priceline. We paid $185.oo (Plus $36.oo more for one night parking). We were so disappointed. This was an anniversary trip and we wish we had shopped around more. Our room (#1099) was the smallest, shabbiest room we have ever seen! The bathroom was dirty and creepy. The carpeting was dirty and the bed linens were very worn. The worst part was our location behind the elevators. There was a loud thumping and rumbing noise going on all night. Avoid the "elevator rooms" at all costs! The location was good. We walked everywhere. MJ O'Connor's Irish Pub was fun. I suppose there must be other rooms that are nice, but I never saw any. The beautiful lobby leads one to believe that the hotel is a luxury location, not so! I love Boston, but I will never stay at the Park Plaza again.

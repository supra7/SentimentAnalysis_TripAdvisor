Absolutely disgusting. Service was ok, location is great but it is ridiculously foul. Smelly, clogged drains, no outlets, no clean towels or sheets and that's just the beginning. Thank god we went out to buy our own! My girlfriend and i will never, ever stay here again. Absolutely miserable and would have rather slept on the boardwalk bench. Hope you take this into consideration, we are just trying to save you from a vacation from hell.

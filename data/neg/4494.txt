Ok, my husband and I stayed at the Chicago Hotel Monaco New Years Weekend. The man at the front desk was very cold, so were the women at concierge... when they were actually AT THEIR DESK. The location isnt that bad, but next time I think I will stay directly on Michigan Avenue. The walk isnt too bad the first time, but we couldnt move by the time we were finished shopping on the Magnificent Mile (and we had comfy shoes on) so we had to take a $5 cab back to the hotel and we continued taking cabs for the rest of our stay. The hotel restaurant, South Water Kitchen, was great for breakfast, a bit pricey but everything is pricey in that area. We ordered extra shampoo and towels... never received them. The mini fridge was stocked well, but the little goodies bin looked like the goodies have been there for years. Dusty with crumbled wrappers. The bed was comfortable and we loved the down comforter, the bathroom was a decent size. The window seat was a great touch, except for the stains on its pillow top. We paid $160 a night and I think that was decent for what we received (all the other hotels were $200++). We were out most of the time so it wasnt too bad. The lobby is small but nicely decorated, free starbucks coffee in the lobby was too strong, again, front desk was rude. Overall, if you pay $160 or less, you are more or less getting an OK deal. But I would suggest that you put a couple extra bucks into a nicer hotel on Michigan Avenue where everything is happening. Oh, and we tried the world famous popcorn... great popcorn but not worth the 45 minute wait in line. Navy Pier was nice!

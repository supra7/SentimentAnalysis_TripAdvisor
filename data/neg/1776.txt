I was a little leary of staying here after I read the reviews of the hotel on-line. I think you either love this hotel or you don't. We stayed in the Molokai wing (for non-smokers) which is a pretty old wing. Our room was fine, pretty clean overall. But because the hotel is old the bed is super firm and very uncomfortable. I did ask about softer beds and they promptly gave us an egg crate to put on it. We also found it very noisy. The nightly show could be heard easily from the inside of our room, normally I wouldn't mind but we brought our 2-year-old so we had to go to bed on her schedule. We could also hear the neighbors coming and goings, conversations, and their TV. The food at the buffet is okay for breakfast. I would use the voucher (if you have them) at the Tiki Terrace instead. The best part was the pool for our toddler. She loved swimming in the shallow end which is all the whale's tail. I was expecting the staff to be more friendly than they were, based on the website and other peoples reviews. I found them to be friendly with eachother rather than the hotel guests. This didn't really bother me but it was interesting to note. Many of the other guests we spoke with liked the hotel and come back year after year. I heard they upgrade your room but if you want non-smoking the rooms are all the same except for the views. I would rather stay at a place which is more comfortable than my own home. I really looked forward to my own bed and clean shower when I came home. Next time we will stay a different hotel/resort.

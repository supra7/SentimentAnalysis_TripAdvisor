This is a tired old hotel that is ruining the brand that Hyatt spends a fortune polishing. When we looked at our room, which I insisted we do after the previous two hotels booked by our travel agent, I immediately told them no. I asked for another hotel but all were booked up and the Ritz Carlton closed for renovation. So, give me the best room you have and they did for an addtional $350.00 a night. Corner suite not awful but with a 70's Holiday Inn bathroom and interminable noise from the hallways and the luau outside and down six floors. It is obvious that the owners here are just milking the place for everything it's worth. Turndown service every other day? Really do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. This is a terrible place in terms of value for money. You would be much better off with another less expensive place as you will not get any benefits from staying here. Never Again.

This hotel is quite nice except that the beds are among the worst I've ever had. Everything else about my four night stay was so nice I hate to give the hotel such a low rating, but really, beds are critical! Another reviewer mentioned that the beds are too soft - no, I disagree. The beds are not soft, they SAG. Two nights of this bed gave me my first ever back pain. Mine was apparently not the first complaint since there is a helpful list of back exercises included with the hotel information packet. I rearranged the room enough to pull one of the mattresses off the worse-than-useless box springs, put it on the floor and slept quite well after that. Other than that, the place is bright, cheerful, clean and friendly. The rooms are large for a city-center, the bathrooms are sensibly arranged and have all the necessities, and the breakfasts were wonderful. There are few restuarants within easy walking distance, but it's so close to a main subway line that this isn't much of a drawback. It would be a really good value if you didn't have to sleep there! Bottom line, I would not stay here again unless the beds were replaced.

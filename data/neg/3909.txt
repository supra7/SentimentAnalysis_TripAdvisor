Twice someone has booked me into the Marriott Long Wharf. Twice I've been badly stung by the price. This is a perfectly good hotel, good position for downtown, on seafront, but I just loathe their pricing policy which goes up alarmingly whenever there is demand in the city. OK it is just market forces you may say, but the difference between their low season and high season rates is so great you can't help but feel you are being ripped off when you have to pay USD 450.00 + a night for a standard room. Afterall the hotel facilities don't change week to week.....the rooms are the same....the service is the same. I will never stay at the Boston Marriott Long Wharf again on principle. You can get excellent B&B's in the much more charismatic Italian quarter a short distance away for a fraction of the price, and a much more individual and personal experience too. I know I am not alone in my sentiments about the pricing as I have come across other businessmen across the world who make a special case of telling how they were ripped off by Boston hotel pricing at the Marriott Long Wharf. We make a special case now of phoning ahead to say, "Don't book me in at the Boston Marriott Long Wharf!"

My husband and i booked a west coast road trip to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. We had 6 total stops and thus, stayed in 6 total hotels. This was by far our worst stay. We started out disappointed because they had put us in a double room (two full sized beds). 5 years ago, my husband had a full bed as a bachelor and being tall, his feet hung off the bed. Sharing a full after coming from a King at home was not a pleasant experience. HOWEVER, i do understand that room type is not guaranteed. Had it been a nice bed, i probably wouldn't have been complaining. Listen to the other reviews, the sheets/comforter/pillow cases feel like paper. They actually feel disposable....literally the worst bedding i have ever experienced. Not to mention the sink was cracked, and there was someone else's socks under the bed, so not properly cleaned. Location was good, but we would definitely book elsewhere for our next stay.

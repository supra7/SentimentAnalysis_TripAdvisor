We stayed over the long weekend (Melbourne cup weekend) in Sydney. Unfortunately we booked late and finally we ended up in the GSH. The positive fact first. We arrived at 10 am and the room was ready for us. But that it from the positive point of view. The rooms was extremely small (where to put the second luggage?), cockroaches on the floor and we had a wake up call by the neighbours shower every morning. No welcome information on the room, mold in the showers corners and finally a 2 AUD fee per bag for storing the luggage does not confirm a four star rating. We paid 380 AUD (yes, 380 $) for the first night and the other 3 nights 95 AUD, but we stayed in better hotels for that amount of money. The nearby Youth Hostels have probably a equal standard for that money and are also in the same central location as the GSH. The staff in the YH is probably more friendly and helpful compared to the GSH.

I am currently staying at Parrot key resort and offer the following opinion regarding the property: Pro: The grounds are absolutely beautiful and the rooms are clean and practically new. Con: Every downstairs room has a beautiful spacious porch from which to enjoy the lush environment - but no chairs to sit in! No reason was offered for this oversight. Con: Parrot Key bills itself as a "luxury" resort and even charges a daily "resort fee", yet many features were unavailable or off limits after sundown. The property has four beautiful lighted pool areas but close all but one after sundown. No reason was offered for this restriction. Con: The "luxury" room I stayed in did not come equipped with an iron and the laundry facility on site didn't either. Con: Don't be misled by their use of the term "waterfront" in the property description. There is no beach, per se, just some sandy areas within a fenced area without water access. The only real waterfront views are from a few second story rooms. Con: Ice buckets are furnished in the room but there are no ice machines. You must go to the pool bar for ice but it's not always open.

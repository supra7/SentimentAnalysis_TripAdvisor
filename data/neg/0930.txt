We all felt (3) our stay at Seattle Pacific Hotel was overpriced, the hotel needed renovations bad. The walls being re-painted would be a start. Our room was barely clean, lots of dust bunnies behind the night table and other furnature. There was even apples left in the night table drawer from (I hope) the last room renters. I compared notes with another hotel guest during our continental breakfast, as the owner seemed to be studying each persons plates as they came back from the breakfast supply table. The other hotel guest and I both had the same story that the price for the room seemed to vary depending on who answered the phone during renovations. Upon arrival we both found the hotel owner very aggressive when we had both questioned the price, asking for a breakdown. Yes this hotel is close to the Space Needle which may make you think the price should be higher. However other hotels were on par with price but better in quality. We/I have stayed at many hotels in USA, Mexico, Costa Rica, Europe, Canada and throughout Europe. Lots of them were lower in star value but alot better then the Seattle Pacific Hotel.

There are several reasons this is not a 4-star hotel. The rooms are dated (popcorn ceiling?), the carpet in mine was horribly stained and coming apart at the center seam. When I looked behind the night table for an electrical outlet, it was absolutely filthy. There were discarded items from previous guests and what looked like a year's worth of layers of dust, seriously. I'd be extremely upset if I'd paid full price but I got this on Priceline. That being the case, the check-in person made it a point of announcing this outloud to anyone within earshot (I've never had a hotel do this to me before), put me in a room with no view to speak of (unless you count HVAC units as something pleasant to see) on the lowest floor possible. I noticed the staff person next to him treating other customers with a LOT more personal care. The other thing that was disapponting was the fact there is no way to get any food in the hotel between 2 & 5 pm except for overpriced, unhealthy snacks in the gift shop. I had driven 5 hours and expected I'd be able to eat something when I arrived. I would have been better off paying full price at a lower star hotel.

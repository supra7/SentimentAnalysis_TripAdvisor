My partner booked us into this hotel at the last minute. A shocking place staffed by liars. Shabby and in dire need of refurbishment. On my return home I found out that when my visa was swiped they helped themselves to over 500 of my money!! They told me 100 was a hold, and another hold of 228!! Was obviosly not told this and the remainder they wont admit to so they are blaming my bank!!! Also full of drunks banging about till all hours. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!

Not even sure where to start...there were so many disappointing things. The description of the hotel read "boutique" and it is the farthest thing from that. I felt as though I was in Europe again staying in a hostel. The walls are paper thin!!!!! The bathroom was so small, that I could not set any of my toiletries even in the bathroom. Unable to close the toilet seat due to the handle being in the way....great engineering and planning! The biggest thing was the constant cigarette smoke that seeped into our room from the hallway and room next door. After putting up with this two nights in a row, we finally moved to a different room on another floor...only to have the door handle fall off right in our hands!!! I have to say I was disappointed in the way the hotel handled our disappointments. They didn't even comp us one night!!! Never again!!!!

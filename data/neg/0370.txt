I booked this hotel because of its location and the website advertised it as "newly renovated." However, when we got there it was anything but. The staff was very rude! The woman who checked us in didn't say a word to us. Then we got up to our room, and it just got worst. I requested a room away from the elevator, and we were right next to the elevator. The "newly renovated" rooms had dirty, dingy floors, the wall paper on the walls was pealing and scatched up, and there was a hole in the wall that had been covered up by a piece of wall paper... they didn't even bother to fill it! The room looked nothing like the picture on the website. Id hate to see what a room that isn't renovated looks like...

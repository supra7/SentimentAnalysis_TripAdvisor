Great prices, locations, amenities. Here's the thing, I'm not a negative person, and I stayed here once before and had one of the best expriences and ranted and raved about it.

Terrible customer service from tricking you to take "upgrades with bigger rooms and a better view " that are actually "downgrades" with broken toilets, no heat, and a view of the rockbeded roof. In addition, they have flashy Suburbans that they use in their shuttle system (free transportation around a certain radius of Downtown Dallas) but if it isn't "far enough", or they have other people waiting, they'll lie and tell you that "the shuttles are down" when in reality, there's one in the driveway, and another pulling in (literally as they speak those words) My first experience was a 4.5 out 5, and my last experience was a 1 out of 5, so I rounded out with a 2 (poor)

I had two issues when I stayed at this hotel: 1) I reserved a King Non-Smoking room, yet upon arrival I was told that they only have Smoking King rooms available. I informed the agent that I could not stay in a smoking room, so rather than offer an upgrade, they stuck me in a non-smoking room with two double beds. 2) The shower in the room was gross. Within seconds of entering the shower, the bathtub started to fill up. It took over 15 minutes to drain after I was out. When I called the front desk, their resolution was we'll let the management team know.

The hotel is not in the centre of Rome as they mislead. The air conditioning system was turned off so we could not control the temperature in the room. We were not allowed to take any guests up to the room. We had a barely courteous manner at reception and worst of all I accidentally left my travel speakers in the hotel after we left. I tried to contact the hotel by phone and email and they ignored all of my attempts to retrieve my speakers even though I offered to pay for postage. I was not surprised considering the lack of hospitality from the staff. I absolutely do not recommend this hotel.

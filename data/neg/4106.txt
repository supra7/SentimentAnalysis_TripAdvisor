I was feeling ambivalent after reading the various experiences of people who have stayed here, so I emailed reservations and never received a response. Sure to form - when I checked in on 5/4/07, I was placed in the smallest room - Room 999. This room was located behind the elevators, the bed was awful in quality, the shower was about 1.5 feet wide and 3 feet long, and it was SUPER SMALL for over $200/night. It was horrible! I came in around midnight and the night supervisor (name started with a "T") put me in this room. The following morning, I spoke with another front desk woman who subsequently booked me in the Imperial Suite (a bigger room on the 10th floor). If it wasn't for her - I would have definitely hated this hotel. The rooms are not well furnished and if you are a bed person - the quality of beds is terrible. Additionally, it's a hit or miss regarding hotel service. Most front desk staff are really awful - while some concierge are great. The only thing great about this hotel is it's location to Boston Commons and restaurants. Went to Finale (great dessert place) and a Northern Italian Restaurant concierge recommended (although $$$$$). Avoid this hotel if you can. You may not be so lucky to get a suite after they purposefully book you in a crappy room - depending on who you talk to and who is willing to give you the exceptional service you deserve considering you are paying about $200/night. I could get a nicer hotel room in Hawaii for that price - and Hawaii is very high re: room prices.

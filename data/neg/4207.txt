having booked months in advance and confirmed at least 5 times, including on the day of planned arrival, we found that our bookings had been bumped to the next day, and i had to bunk in with a friend who is severely allergic to the stuff i had in my hair!!!!! it was the last room in the hotel, 6th floor smelled bad, nothing worked.... even had doubts about the smoke alarm!!!! at least there were 2 beds.....many other guests had that problem on that night.....took almost 20 hours to sort out the problem, and only about half of the staff was helpful. the other half need to go!!!! 2nd room a little better, but the mould in the roof, and the peeling paint, and the room service trays inthe hallway for hours...... At least i'm not there anymore.

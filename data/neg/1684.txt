The hotel is nice to look at but..... The rooms were so tight we bumped into each other ALL the time. We were on the top floor conceige floor with free foods served for members of Hyatt. They had really nice stuff to eat and it of course helps with cost. It just had that made up feeling. I missed the natural lava flows of the Hilton, the boats, shops. It just didnt have the same feel. The room furniture was very nice stylish and comfortable. But too tight even on the balcony! Everyone was snotty especially the conciege staff. Absolutely rude. We just ignore everyone and left the hotel as much as possible. It's too built up and forget getting a place to sit at the pool or a drink brought to you. Maui has changed unbelievably for the worst.

We stayed at the El Dorado Maroma for our 10th anniversary and were sorely disappointed. Nearly everything in our room was broken when we arrived or during our stay, including the outdoor shower, in room DVD player, in room whirlpool bath, and outdoor infinity pool. Some of these issues were fixed while others were not. As the trip went on, we gave up asking for fixes. The sewage odor is overpowering at times and really ruins the atmosphere. The restaurants play cheesy elevator music that make you not want to eat there after hearing it for a few days in a row. There is a list of activities posted each day, with about 10% actually occurring. The service was inconsistent and was never top notch. The beach is man-made, which looks nice but feels artificial. If you walk down the beach towards other resorts, you get a chance to see the natural beach which is disgusting! There is trash everywhere. We didn't feel comfortable swimming in the ocean after seeing all that trash. The food overall was ok. The lunches at Sabores was our favorite. The Michael Jackson show is the best thing the resort offers. It's not advertised on the activity list, so remember to see it on Friday nights. We were really bummed about this resort given the rave reviews on TripAdvisor. If you are familiar with vacationing in Hawaii, this place will disappoint you for sure. We were also disappointed with Karisma. We had hoped to cut our vacation short, but they were not offer any kind of refund. Nor did they care why we were unhappy. They simply said "no" and hung up on us. While we can't get our 10 year anniversary back, we will be sure not to stay at this resort or other Karisma resorts in the future.

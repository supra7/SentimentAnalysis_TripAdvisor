I landed in this hotel via priceline and thought it was going to be great since it's a Sheraton. I checked the reviews here and knew about the bedbugs. Knowing that, I requested the center tower since it has the nicest and mostly recently renovated rooms per other reviews and still ran into them. After looking at the sheets when I got into the room and not seeing any, they appeared after I had been sitting on the bed for awhile and I got a bite. I asked for a new room and the staff didn't give me any trouble and gave me a new room . They confirmed they've been having a problem with bedbugs. The staff was very friendly, but they seem overstretched. Several of the elevators were also out of service. This wouldn't be a big deal in a small hotel, but when there are 29 floors, it's an inconvenience!

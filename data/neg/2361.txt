I stayed in this hotel on several occassions between June 2011 and October 2011. I was joined by a number of other delegates who also stayed at the hotel on the same dates. We were booked in by our company so had to endure it until the end. First things first, you don't want a room at the front of the hotel unless you normally sleep by a motorway. The main A41 dual carriageway runs within 5 metres of the front of the hotel. The best rooms are at the back of the hotel second floor, these are in high demand and those who give the hotel high scores probably stayed in those rooms !. The service is quite poor, requests generally get ignored they never passed on from one shift to another. The airconditioning might work - maybe it won't. The electrical boxes in each room "buzz" when powered up, this has something to do with the energy saver in the fusebox, it will drive you mad. You cannot open the windows - "handles removed for safety reasons". These problems reported by many colleagues, so not just the room I had. The hotel is very popular with school parties from UK and abroad, so be prepared for the adolescent to & fro-ing. The breakfast is passable , but dear or dear, don't try the dinner. It was consistently bad over several stays, soggy pastry, rubbery vegetables and about 7 things on the menu - thats it. Sweet was just as bad - lemon sponge, but any cream ?......ur "no", chef doesn't have any............Basil, Basil, Basil.........coming Sybil.......(BBC Fawlty Towers), stay here if you want to experience the worst Best Western Hotel, I gotta say they were consistent (just darn awful).

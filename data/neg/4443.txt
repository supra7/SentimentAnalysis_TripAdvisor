Checked in late at night, went to room with wife and baby in tow. Room was FREEZING, AC on coolest and fan on highest. Room had a strong deodorizer smell to it. I sat on the chair and moved the ottoman and found the end of a marijuana cigarette. Lucky my daughter didn't find that! I took it to the desk and they apologized and offered breakfast the next day, but we already had plans. He said "I will take care of you with points then" I said, thanks and never inquired to how many or any other details. I assumed that an industry professional would handle it with the appropriate amount in a timely manner. I appreciate it. He offered to move my room, but I had my daughter and we were all settled, just didn't want to do it. I never got the points. I spent until 3 months emailing the hotel and hilton customer care back and forth to get some compensation. It was more about principle than the points. I do not appreciate lack of follow thru. Things happen, the hotel was nice, the staff was friendly and the follow up emails were nice. Just such a long process. If they would have tailored compensation before I left (which is what I assumed by the way he said he'd take care of me with points), I would have rated all 5s here except cleanliness. The room wasn't dirty, they just missed the roach. Good location, lots to do nearby.

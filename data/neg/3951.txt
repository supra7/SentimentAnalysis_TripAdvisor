Hotel is deceiving on first blush! Large, opulent, historic lobby...tiny, less than well appointed rooms, paper thin walls, NO WiFi/internet w/out ridiculous fees (what century are we in?), difficult to find/reach plugs in the room (many did not work) and staff who are not uniformly knowledgeable or helpful. So many little things added up to one major (and expensive!) disappointment, and I would not recommend a stay here.

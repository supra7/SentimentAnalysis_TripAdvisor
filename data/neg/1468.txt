There are hundreds of hotels to chose from in Barcelona and I am afraid this one will not feature as one of my choices in the future . It is listed as 5 star and this is reflected in the price. Unfortunately, from the minute you walk into the hotel, it is a dissappointment. The lobby is dark and dinghy, the counters are dirty and the carpets in the passages are worn. The open plan room is dominated by a huge bath whose tap came off in my hand when I tried to use it. The shelf space in the bathroom are is tiny, the ammenties are cheap and inadequate, the breakfast was mediocre..the fresh fruit was abysmal quality..the only saving grace was the excellent service from the staff and the prime location of the hotel.

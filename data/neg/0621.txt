I was really looking forward to staying at the hotel Andra, We usually stay at the 4 seasons but they didn't have anything available to fit our family during our trip. So after extensive searches I came accross hotel andra. I was promised a "Suite" with accomadations enough for us and our 2 small children. Our room was not ready till after 6pm, then when we got settled into our room my 4 year old son found drug paraphanalia on the floor in front of the couch. When my partner went down to talk to the manager, they didn't really act like it was a big deal. My partner works for the department of justice and really tried to press the severity of a little kid coming accross drugs in our room. So after dinner we go back up to our room to set the kids up with a movie in the living room, and the TV doesn't work, so we all end up in the main bedroom with the kids watching a movie. Instead of having the tiny amount of space we were supposed to have. The next day they offered a free movie rental, which really doesn't make up for a ruined night. I was really bummed about the whole experience, I really was expecting more from the staff. One good thing I can say, is that the Valet guys were really really nice.

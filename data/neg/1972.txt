I ended up staying at the Trump Towers during the Christmas Holiday. I could not believe Donald Trump is managing this hotel in this fashion. I booked the rooms through bookit.com and was made to believe that I was getting two double beds. When I got there I found out there were no double beds in the bedroom but there is a pull out sofa. That said, the pull out bed was one of my most uncomfortable beds I have ever slept on. The bed and everything else in the room was immaculate. My biggest issues: 1) Pull out bed is exceptionally uncomfortable and is unusable. 2) The hotel shuttle to the strip runs ever 30 minutes or 60 minutes depending of the time of day. The shuttle is fairly small, and if you don't get there early enough you have to wait for the next one. They should have multiple shuttles running if its busy. 3) My room was never cleaned. I called multiple times for a cleaning and over two days it was never cleaned. I'm not talking about a turn down service. I'm talking about your average cleaning. I called multiple times. 4) The resort charge is ridiculous at 19.95 a night Rooms are really nice and decor is excellent. My main issue was that the hotel is pretty unresponsive, and for what I paid, I could have stayed at the Aria and it was a little less than the Bellagio. Not worth it in my mind.

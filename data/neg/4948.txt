We stayed hear on the last night of our 10 day family vacation. We had cable problems as soon as we checked in and it was obvious the hotel expected it. There was a laminated card on the desk telling us to contact the front desk if we had cable problems. We contacted them and some of the problems were fixed but they never followed up. That night, they had an event in the atrium area untilkafter midnight which made it extremely difficult for our children to sleep. Anyone who takes the time to laminate a card regarding a problem in the hotel rather than fix the problem doesn't understand the service business. Stay away from this beast!

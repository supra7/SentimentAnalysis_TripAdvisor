I'm convinced that the staff working here wrote the reviews on here. There is nothing positive about this place. I have only been here for 4 nights and can't wait to leave! I will be looking for a new place to stay this upcoming weekend. The rooms are small, smell like urine and dirty diapers, horrible bed, sheets and towels and lastly you can't sleep at night!! I'm writing this as I listen to a couple screaming at 2:30 am! This is worse than a college dorm, not to mention the most transient and drug infested street corner in Seattle.

This little hotel has a great location in downtown Seattle. Around the corner from the 5th Avenue Theater. The only entrance to the hotel from the street is on the corner of 6th Avenue and University. There is a place in front of the door to park the car while you unload your luggage, etc. Unfortunately, the theater was getting out at the same time we arrived and the cars from the parking garage, attached o the hotel, were using the 'unloading' spot as a turning lane. We then tried to get into the parking garage and had to carry all of our bags to an elevator that took us to the 12th floor to check in.... The room was very nice, great amenities but I doubt we will ever stay again. I would give this hotel a higher rating but still feel it's lacking in making it easier to access.

Stayed here 6/18/04. Filthy pool, totally overcrowded with hotel employees and their friends and families, not reserved for guests of hotel. Room was shabby, furniture stained and dirty, pillows flat and old, sheets torn, carpet dirty and wrinkled. Roaches visible in living room and bathroom. Upstairs guests over our room had a loud party until 3 a.m. and despite our two calls to management, nothing was done to stop it. Staff generally unresponsive and surly. Don't waste your money or your time here!

This hotel has the basic amenities for a long duration stay. However nothing is out of the ordinary. Room service is once in a week. The corridors smell of something....probably food. Cost is less compared to other hotels nearby....so is okay if you are looking only from a cost point of view. There is a bus stop right opposite the hotel...for bus to downtown. The train station is 10 minutes walk.

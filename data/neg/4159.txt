We booked the Park Plaza because we had stayed there in 2001 and had been very satisfied. It is in an excellent location, right in the center of Boston, ideal for all the sights and amenities. We had booked and paid through our local travel agent before we left. We stayed there at the beginning of our holiday and had to queue for ages to check in, then were told that there was a message for us which we had to collect from the concierge, where there was another enormous queue. The check in staff would not get it for us so we had to wait even longer! Our second stay was on our way home, they claimed to have no record of our reservation but gave us a room and we gave them our pre paid voucher confirmation of booking. The room was basic, the bathroom minute and the fixtures were hanging off the wall. Next morning we had a bill pushed under the door. We explained the situation at the desk and were told not to worry, they would sort it out and took no payment for the room. On arriving home a charge of $291 appeared on our credit card statement. We did not appreciate the extra hassle we had, to get our refund, not to mention being out of pocket temporarily. We will not be returning to the Park Plaza again!

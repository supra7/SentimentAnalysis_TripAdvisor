Stayed here for 6 nights on our first trip to Seattle. Picked this because of the location, price and free parking. Hotel is older, but apparently being renovated. They had a big air compressor in the parking lot and were working on the roof the whole time we were there. Rooms were small (about 10' x 12'), but clean. Ours was on the Aurora St. side and tended to be noisy during the day and early evening, because of the RT 99 traffic, but quieted down later in the evening. Our security lock was broken when we checked in and found that the tub didn't drain after the first night's shower. Told the desk, but it took them 2 days of repeated requests to make the repairs. Breakfast was good, but always crowded and most people ended up sharing tables. Parking was never a problem for us, even over a football weekend. Convenient location for Seattle Center, the Space Needle, EMP, Science Center, etc.

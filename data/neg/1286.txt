Stayed one night'. Wasn't expecting much, since it was so cheap. My surprise is that Quality Inn would allow their name to be associated with this place. Here's the good - free breakfast incl hot food - free parking and airport shuttle; it's an 8 min drive to the SEA airport - two computers in the lobby, no charge - coin washer and dryer - room included safe, fridge, coffeemaker, writing desk and separate 2 chair round table - heater in window, although no thermostat, did the job - TV worked well. Good size, although not flat panel - local and 1-800 calls are free - carpet in my Queen bed room was old but clean, furniture is old but okay The bad - parking lot doesn't feel safe at night - bathroom could really use a makeover - old small bed pillows - ugly open closet - floors in my room did not seem even - hallways are unappealing - you can hear your neighbours and planes The ugly - fitness room is gross. Has 3 pieces, all old: a Bowflex, a treadmill, and bike. There's a good size sauna, but from it's appearance, not clear it worked There are many chain hotels in this area. I would not return to this 'Quality Inn'.

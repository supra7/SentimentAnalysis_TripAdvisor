I choose to stay at this hotel during a weekend conference in Seattle. Based on the previous reviews posted, I knew that this hotel was not going to be fancy. The location is great. There is a McDonald's nearby as well as Walgreens. It is also very close to the Space Needle. You need to walk about 20-30 min to get to the City Centre. The building is fairly old. The registration counter and first floor has probably been renovated but the rooms are not. The room was pretty small and it was mostly clean. Our toilet bowl had a layer of grime so it could definitely use a scrubbing. There were a decent number of hand and bath towels available to us. The biggest complaint was the air conditioning. It is extremely noisy. I had to wear ear plugs during the night. We had to leave the AC on because it was so stuffy. The decent was decent. There were scrambled eggs, sausages and waffles. I have been to several Quality Inns before and there were no sausages. The hallways do smell a bit and feels rather dingy. The big plus of this hotel is the free parking. If you pay 2x the amount, you can stay at a fancier hotel. I chose to cheap out and knew what I was getting. It is just a matter of managing your expectations.

this is not the place you might think it is from the site. We were looking for a 4 star hotel and got a Motel 6 When we checked in the parking attendants seemed very pushy on selling us the $35 A day valet I iopted to walk across the street for $15 a day note on the room: VERY SMALL A key thing I took for granted was the ear plugs left on the bed not to think I would use them My mistake the room was next to a train crossing that yes had active trains all night yes 12 in total !!! so if your thinking of a good night sleep forget it!! this was my birthday present from my wife a romantice weekend overlooking the seattle inlet I would not reccomend this place for any one who is a light sleeper or who wants to have a quiet room for $210 a night I would save your money and got to a better 4 star the good room was clean the bathroom was newer the bad : the value the noise

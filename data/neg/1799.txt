We planned our vacation very carefully, and wanted to be on Kaanapali Beach at an affordable rate. When we arrived to check in, and after she ran my credit card for all 3 nights...we were told that they are overbooked and we don't have a room for you? WHAT !!! They wanted to send us off to some other place a mile up the road, and not on Kaanapali Beach. NO WAY !! We complained very strongly and they managed to find a room at the Westin Maui for us. They asked us to return the next night...um NO WAY !! You ruined our plans and put us through way too much hastle. I didn't come all this way to be treated with this stress! Just Beware...then book your trip at the Westin Maui...they were great to us!

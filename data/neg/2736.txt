Ok place, but, there was one MAJOR problem. There were ten vehicles broken into and items stolen on one of the nights I stayed at this Sleep Inn. My truck was one of the targets hit by these criminals, who were not caught. All of the vehicles sustained significant damage, plus many personal items were stolen. It would certainly appear that crime in the area of this hotel is a MAJOR problem. Be careful....

How difficult is it to outfit a 5 star hotel with a decent TV...the Sheraton has nice flat screen TV's...but not the Ritz? This hotel is old and showing its age...the furniture needs to be replaced, and the rooms need to be updated. Rumor is its for sale, so that may be the reason. I would stay at the Peninsula, which is the nicest hotel in Chicago at this time

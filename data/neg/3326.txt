you will be in questionable company once you check into the budget suites of dallas, tx at market center - be prepared for a ghetto-like atmosphere including junk-cars, drug-dealers and prostitutes. in the room they will not give you a blanket because they think you won't give it back - instead they ask you to use the bed-cover as substitute. that will be made of plastic and has never been cleaned. the on-duty manager will treat you like judge judy, not even close to accomodating any request at all. and they think they can do it because charges are non-refundable. the way around this is to check out early and dispute the charge with your credit-card-company. first and last time for me at this chain.

I stayed at the hotel from 4-8 January as part of a large business meeting. Overall, I am very disappointed. I fully expect one of the managers to write one of their disingenuous responses to this review. Which tells you that talk is very cheap. The problems were significant and impacted virtually every colleague I met. 1. The entire hotel was freezing cold. Even men were complaining. This was a systemic issue. Rooms had to be set to 78 degrees to get any warmth. 2. The carpets were not vacuumed. They renovated. There was lint everywhere. Huge lint balls formed on everyone's shoes. Disgusting. There is no excuse for this. It is just evidence of the way they do not take care of their hotel. 3. The housekeeping staff did a half-baked job. Shower gel was not replaced. Shaving cream was not replaced. It too multiple days for open bottles and coffee cups to be tossed out. Trash was left behind. Other colleagues had similar fates with food not being picked up. Clearly, this is a managerial issue. 4. Cocktails tasted good but were low on alcohol. Clearly, they are penny pinching here. 5. Multiple people had problems with the remote in the room working properly. 6. They overcharge for internet...as usual. There are a few strengths-- the hotel has been renovated. The bar staff are nice. The food service staff were friendly and attentive. The laundry was done correctly. Overall, please try to avoid this place.

Always go with what you know. The first time my husband and I traveled to Maui, we stayed at the Westin (a few hotels north of the Hyatt on Ka'anapali beach). We had no complaints, and we could have stayed there this time around, but, I decided it might be nice to try another hotel. Bad decision. While the Hyatt has a great location and a lot of beach front property, the amenities and the rooms left much to be desired. At over $400 a night, one expects to have a nicer bathroom than one finds at a Comfort Inn in upstate New York as well as some Charmin type toilet paper (the stuff we used was about 1/2 ply). Also, it would be nice to have bath towels that are a little (just a little, that is all I ask) on the plush side; I thought they were going to disintegrate during each pat dry). The pool was a good size, but there were too many chairs (which, by the way were the cheap plastic variety; shouldn't they have upgraded to nice chairs with cushions on them by now (the Westin has had them for over 4 years, at least) on top of eachother. Also, the cabanas on the beach were dirty and there was no bar service (what is the point then?). I may sound too critical or nitpicky, but, it is the little things that matter -- especially for the price you pay at the Hyatt. I guess they figure they can charge these rates for their location without needing to provide stellar service, etc. Wrong. Oh, and did I mention, no turn down service at night. I will definately be heading to the Westin for my next trip to Maui.

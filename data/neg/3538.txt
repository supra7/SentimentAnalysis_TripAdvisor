maintenance@Ramada Having to go to Dallas Texas,I went on the internet to fnd a hotel closest to the area I needed to be.The Ramada Ltd. was recommended by hotels.com. The second day of my visit which was a cold and wet and rainy day. That afternoon when the toilet was flushed it proceeded to overflow. There was a plunger already in the room.(how lucky and convient that was!!!!).Iplunged the toilet to stop it from running over.I called the front desk to inform them what had happened.The clerk informed me that i needed to use the towels to mop the water up. There was too much water on the floor.She informed me that i had a problem and she was the only one at the desk and that was the best that she could do for me.She did however take the time to bring me a bag of rags for me to mop with.Then she later was gracious enough to bring me a mop and bucket to mop with after I called the hotel managerr/owner who hung the phone up in my face.She eventually came and mopped the room and I don't think she liked it one bit.Stay away from the hotel will never visit again!!!!

After reading all of the reviews I was very excited about staying at the Magnolia. Unfortunately, it was not as nice as I had envisioned. We had a 650 sq ft room that seemed very outdated. Some of the furniture was heavily damaged. The shower was the best thing about the room. I tried to contact the concierage three times and each time was put on hold for up to fifteen minutes before I hung up. We had to get new keys twice because they did not work. We were on the 14th floor and every morning were awaken by the noise outside of the hotel (even at 5:00 AM). On our departure day we called down 15 minutes before we were leaving for our car and then still needed to wait 30 more minutes for it. We were told it was not in the right spot. With so many other options for hotels in the area I would not return to the Magnolia. We certainly did not get our moneys worth.

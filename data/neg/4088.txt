This place needs to be shut down and either renovated or torn down. Everything seems run down and outdated. The walls and windows are paper thin. Every noise from the street (non-stop in a city the size of Boston) seems like it's right in your room. I found the bed uncomfortable. On the plus side, there are very good restaurants in the neighborhood. This hotel is living on its historical past as an excuse to continue to charge high rates for quality that's unacceptable. Do yourself a favor. If you are intrigued by the property, stop by the lobby, take your picture, move on to a more updated hotel.

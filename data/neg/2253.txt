I felt like I was in a youth hostel. The hotel was not as pictured or described. It goes without saying that it was WAY overpriced. The room was dirty. TV did not work. There was an in-room coffee maker with two thin plastic solo cups I assume were supposed to somehow hold hot coffee?? The breakfast was sparse. I can say the staff was friendly and the hotel's location is excellent but that ends the compliments. Due to snow in Chicago I was forced to stay an extra night in Philly. I booked a wonderful room at the Omni for LESS than my stay at the Rodeway.

Filthy does not even discribe this hotel! There were hand prints above the headboard which should only leave to your imagination on what it could possibly be. There was mold and ants everywhere that we had to walk around and sleep with our shoes on. The balconies are not private. The ocean view is not even an ocean view, you have to stand on your toes just to see the ocean. The ripped plastic table cloth is tied using a hair tie! This hotel is straight out of a horror movie! I'd rather sleep in a public restroom on the floor! HOOKER HOTEL!

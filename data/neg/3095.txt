Having to travel a lot, I am not really picky about hotels getting into little details. Good sleep makes me happy in 99% of the cases. I was very unhappy after 2 nights of this hotel, because: - first of all, I am not really a fan of funky design. However, when the room is comfortable, it doesn't really matter. This room was very uncomfortable. Even though it looked spacious, it really wasn't. No space for luggage next to the wardrobe. The minute you walk in you bump into the bed. - i got my room on the second floor facing the rambla. gosh, till 3 am I felt like my bed was in the middle of the square - I could hear people on the other side of the street, cars, shouting. It was just aweful. It was a weekday, by the way. - The floor in the room is tiled and it is extremely cold. I literally had to step on my bathroom rag and move with it around the room. - The bed is the wost part of it. It is not really a double bed, but two single beds on the wheels without stoppers. I had to push the bed to a bedtime table, so it won't move. Of course, no moving around the bed was possible. - Soundproof was really bad. Maybe it wasn't just about the walls, but positioning of the bed right at the door. - Area. I love Barcelona, but Raval seems to be not the nicest place of the downtown. Hash smell is all around the square by 6 pm, people hanging around clearly can sell you anything you want, prostitutes on every corner. I'm fine with that stuff in general, but this is the not the place where I would stay with children. Good thing - free Wi-Fi which you rarely see nowadays in the 4 and 5 star hotels.

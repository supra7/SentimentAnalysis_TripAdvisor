This place is pretty gross. When you first walk into the hotel, things look ok, but don't look too close...it's a dirty little mess. There is no doorman, no security and nobody to welcome you when you come in. the front desk staff were not rude but they certaintly were not friendly! They were just ...'there' and at times seemed annoyed to be there. The neighborhood is not safe at all, which normally wouldn't be bad, but this hotel has no security and nobody who stands up front! The doors are left unlock in the front and sometimes the side so people can wander in and out from the streets if they wanted too. The rooms are ok but they just have that lipstick on a pig feel. Nothing high quality. there is no place to eat there either, no room service, and no resturant. There is a bar that has bad food but good service! The workers in the bar were the friendliness. In the hotels defense, they DO have a nice lobby! But if your not planning on sleeping in it.....I would skip this hotel .

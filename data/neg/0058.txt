We have always enjoyed the US, but sadly whilst this is a lovely Hotel, it was our worst choice on any tour of the States. We arrived late, and as a courtesy we readvised the hotel. Upon arrival we were just treated a 'nothings' off the street, and sent to a room. Literally. We had problems with the switches in the room, and were told that is the way it is. I could not recommend this hotel, even for a stopover.

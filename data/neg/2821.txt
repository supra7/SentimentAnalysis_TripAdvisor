Stayed here on a Saturday night for our anniversary and will not be returning! The clerk who checked us in could not care less if we were there. She wasn't even going to ask us or tell us what kind of room we were getting. She never smiled or told us to have a nice stay, no pleasantries at all! The elevators were old and small. One was broken when we stopped at the fitness floor to look around. It was all dark with the doors stuck open a little below the floor level. Kind of scared us to get back on another one!! Everything in this hotel is extra! They have a fridge in the room with snacks and drinks that are $4-$5 apiece but the kicker is that if you take one, it not only costs that price but also a $25 restocking fee!!! So that one Coke will cost $29!!!! Parking is still $48 but with unlimited in and outs. It did take the valet 20 minutes to get our car though so it's not real speedy. Better call down and alert them before you go down yourself! Internet is an extra charge, if you want your own fridge it's an extra charge (I was scared to use the lotion provided for us in the bathroom! I am still watching my credit card for a $20 charge for that one squirt of lotion!!) The welcome book in the room says there are vending machines in the building but we asked the comatose front desk attendant and she referred us to the Walgreens 2 blocks away. Convienent!! We came and went several times over our one night stay and we were NEVER greeted by any lobby staff. Once I was given the stink eye by a guard after I smiled and said HI to him!! We stayed at the Palmer the last anniversary and will be going back there from now on. They were like our family compared to how we were treated at this place!

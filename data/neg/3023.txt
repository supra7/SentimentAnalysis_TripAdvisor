This hotel is not conveniently located to anything... downtown, restaurant, shopping. There is absolutely nothing walking distance and I wouldn't even think about venturing outside in this neighborhood after dark. It's very remote and not in a travel friendly part of town. It's not worth the free parking they offer which is why I thought I would try them. The walls in the room were filthy which was not a good first impression. There is a bar and a bakery and we recieved very slow and poor service at both. Also when checking out it took absolutely forever and there was only one person in front of us. I was not impressed at all with the hotel room itself, the service or the location. I will never book at this hotel again.

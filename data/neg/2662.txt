I wish I could say as many nice things about this hotel as others but unfortunately I cannot. The best thing about the place is the location as it is a short walk to a metro stop and the Hollywood and Highland center. We stayed two nights and because the hotel was full we were given one of the smaller rooms (I guess you have to request a large room). So I didnt think that the rooms were spacious. They were just average. The wireless internet in the room rarely worked. They gave me a password to access the wireless, but it didnt work. Somehow I stumbled on another wireless site that worked sometimes. Our TV worked only some of the time and then when it was time to watch the football bowl games on New Years Day it didnt work at all! They sent a guy to the room to try to fix it, but even though he tried for more than 30 minutes, it didnt work. Not at all  no picture and no sound - no TV. They offered to move us the next day to another room but we were checking out. I cant say much good about management either. I had a problem with part of my iPod Touch case being thrown away but the manager wouldnt even give me the courtesy of talking with me about it. The people at the desk tried to help but because of the times we were actually in the hotel the housekeeping manager wasnt there so I had to call the hotel twice to have them check to see what happened to the case cover. I cant imagine why the housekeeper would have thrown it away. It wasnt in the trash can although Ill admit that it was left on the floor next to one of our suitcases. But so was the cup that was left from the last guest who had been in the room and that I found under the drapes when I was looking for the case cover. I suppose if you cant see the trash it doesnt count. The reason I had the case on the floor was because I had to put one suitcase on the floor as there was only one suitcase stand. I would not recommend the hotel for the way it treats its guests.

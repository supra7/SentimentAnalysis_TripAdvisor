Well, it's sad but true. This Super 8 really is one of the wost motels I've ever stayed in and I am on the road over 200 days a year. What's really disappointing is that I booked it thinking it was part of a chain (Super 8) which meant it couldn't be that bad...I mean Super 8s are never the Ritz but at least they are tolerable. Not this one. Besides being upset at the owners, I am more upset with Super 8 for having their name on the sign. We booked for 4 nights and are leaving right now after one. The shower looks like a horror movie, the lights are falling off the walls, there are strange dark and dirty stains on the walls and ceilings, the toilet flushes once and then takes an hour of finagaling to flush again. And I haven't even gotten to the linens...Thank god I brought my own pillow and blanket....

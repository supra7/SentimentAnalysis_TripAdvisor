Rarely ever speak poorly about a hotel, however I would recommend staying elsewhere if availability exists. The rooms was exceptionally small, as was the bathroom (where only one person could actually stand in). You could not fit a desk in the room even if you wanted to (let alone a chair) and I found myself using the old radiator as a 'desk' for my laptop. I received a charge on my credit card 2 months after my stay. After calling multiple times to the front desk, they were not able to identify the charge. I have since had to contact my credit card company to determine what it is for (still pending). All and all, you can find better in boston for the same or lower price.

I have found this hotel to be old and dirty. The chairs in the lobby are stained from where peoples' heads have rested against them. We upgraded to concierge level for $39.00 a night. Our room was small....very small. The doors were chipped. The bathroom door was dirty and old. The cleaning service did not really clean our room. We had to pay extra for internet service. The appetizers were decent but the breakfast was less than desirable. To complete this expereience I requested a late checkout. For an aditional $25.00 I could have stayed until 1:00 p.m. The only redeeming quality was that the staff was friendly and the lobby ceiling is beautiful.

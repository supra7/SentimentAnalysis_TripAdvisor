The management at the hotel was very rude. Upon arrival we were forced to pay a securtiy deposit when we were told there was none. I stayed in the hotel for one week and the cleaning staff entered our room several times without permission. The door was left unlocked each time. The cleaning staff also refused to clean the room because there was a small box of crackers that was accidentally spilled on the floor. They cleaned the room once the entire week. The walls are paper thin, and you are constantly being disturbed in the middle of the night by people walking and talking in the halls. You have absolutely no privacy, and nobody besides the paying attendants are allowed to enter the room at all times. This was the worst experience I have ever had involving a hotel. I would strongly not recommend anyone who wants to have a decent time at the beach to stay at this hotel.

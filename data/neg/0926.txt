They try to get moeny out of you any way they can. They charged my friend and I extra for an "extra guest" even though we booked through Travelocity which says room rate is for two people. The hotel is in a horrible location in a very bad neighborhood, but is close to the Space Needle and monorail which was nice. Customer service is horrible, the pool was completely dirty (not that we were planning on using it), and the entire hotel smelled like cigarettes.

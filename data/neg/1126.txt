This hotel is a very large complex - consisting of a 14 story tower and 7 interconnected, 4 story, wings. There are 850 rooms and 39000 square feet of meeting space. We were in one of the outermost wings, and the walk from our room to the front lobby was quite long, not what you expect in a convenient airport hotel. When we arrived, our toilet was clogged. I called the front desk to explain that we could not use the toilet, and they said they would send someone up. 30 minutes later I called back, waited for the front desk phone to ring for 5 minutes, and when they finally picked up they said they would look into it. About 20 minutes later someone finally came. 2 guys worked on it for the next 45 minutes, with this large "plumbers snake" to clear it. When they finally left my thought was I am sure the bathroom needs to be sanitized now. But I was surprised and disappointed to what I saw: brown water splashed all over the floor. I called the front desk, and our rooms were switched - at 10 PM now, about 2 hours after the initial call. Not to define my whole experience by this incident, but this hotel was just too big for what I hoped to be a "simple" stay, and it was clear this hotel did not have the management or staff to support this scale hotel. There were lots of other smaller hotels in the area, that I would check into next time. (and they could use airport shuttle vans, not buses packed to the rim!)

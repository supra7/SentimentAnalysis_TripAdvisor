My husband and I stayed here for one night in between flying from Australia to Malaysia and we were not impressed. We'd booked it on Agoda and paid quite a lot of money, but felt it would be more convenient for us to stay at the airport with a flight the next morning rather than make our way into the centre of Singapore. Not a wise move - because Singapore airport is so huge, we had to walk/skytrain it for about 20 minutes to get to the hotel - not ideal in the heat with heavy backpacks, we may as well have jumped into a taxi and gone to a better place in the centre of Singapore. Upon arrival, we weren't even acknowledged - and had to wait 20 minutes to check in at reception - and no one apologised. It felt like we were treated like second class citizens because we were backpackers - everyone else had their luggage taken upstairs or at least had someone help them, but we were totally ignored. The rooms themselves are nice enough, with ipod docks and nice bathrooms. The pool was also nice - but to me, this place wasn't worth the money,

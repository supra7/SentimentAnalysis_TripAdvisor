If you are unlucky enough to be in a room adjacent to another where anyone is talking or watching TV you will be sharing in their experience. The walls were so thin that for one person I could almost hear what they were saying. Overall the property seems fairly new but the door card locks are inexplicably corroded. The sink did not drain well, as the pull rod was not connected. Also at checkout, which was very early in the morning, the night clerk would not or could not comply with my request to remove the fee for the in room safe that I did not use. Dummy me, I guess when checking in (tired, after a long day) I should have read the fine print concerning initialing something I did not want. I don't think he understood English. In any event I called later and they called back to confirm they had taken it off. No I would not stay here again.

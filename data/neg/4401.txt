Just got back from Boston for a work trip. When we checked in they tried putting us on the first floor which was in the basment over looking a brick wall. Aftercomplaining and having to pay an extra $80 a night they moved us up to the 3rd floor over looking the some of the park. The view was ok but not realy worth the extra money. The staff there had a pretty pissy attitude from check in to check out. When ever you asked them for help it was if you where being a pain to them. Also dont bother using your alarm clock unless you are looking to wake up before 7 am. Every morning the cleaning crew would knock on our door to try to clean the room and would come back every 15 minutes to try again even after we put out the do not wake sign. Over all the hotel was average and would not recommed the place for the money, there is a good reason why they are ranked just average on this web site. If you are looking for a great hotel keep looking this is not the place!!!!!!!!!!!

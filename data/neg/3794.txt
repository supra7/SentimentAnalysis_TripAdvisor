If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive place to stay in London this is the hotel of choice. Not sure how safe neighborhood is. When you enter the hotel lobby there is a security gate between you and the receptionist. The room was dirty, smelt like cigarettes. This location is far from the center of London. The 12 minutes walk from hotel to tube requires walking through local neighborhood.

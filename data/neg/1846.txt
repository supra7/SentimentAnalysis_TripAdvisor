I stayed at the Fragrance Hotel in December 08 before heading to Malaysia. I arrived to be told that they only had a reservation for my first night. I had written before hand to extend the reservation to 3 nights but they insisted there was no extended reservation and told me I'd have to leave the next day. They said - there were no rooms anywhere in the hotel. The next day in the morning - as I arrived late the night before- and was quite upset about this- I went to the internet cafe- to print out the extended reservation confirmation email and had I not done that I would have been on the hunt for a new hotel after flying 23 hours the next morning after I arrived. They were insistent that there was no such booking but as soon as I gave them the paper - all of a sudden they had a room! Thankfully, I kept the email! The room was sparse and the you hear exactly what is going on in the rooms next to you! I dont even want to describe - what I overheard even with a pillow over my head and ear plugs. I cant comment too highly on this hotel or the location but will say- Singapore is expensive and to be in the better areas/better hotels you will pay! So if you dont mind the confusing bus to get to the downtown core of Singapore- or the less than nice rooms or a possible mix up, then it might be alright for you. The hawker stall next door is cheap and good- and you may need to hit the internet cafe accross the street- as in my case - for the extension letter that I needed to prove in writing that I had booked even though- they confirmed my first nights stay. Less than friendly staff at the hotel, but does that really matter when you are traveling and staying in budget accommodation? You will need to decide. If you can afford more- stay in the Orchard Rd area- much nicer!

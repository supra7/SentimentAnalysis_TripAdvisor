Yes it is beautiful and with a place that is Trump you expect nice and beautiful but if your looking for a good night sleep this is not the place. We are on the 42nd floor and facing the mountains. The room and view are nice but the noise from the cars never stops from the highway. The helicopter noise starts at 9am and goes all day long. The worst thing is the train noise which woke us up 2 times during the night. When we asked for a different room they told us there would be a $25 charge for a room on the other side of the hotel that you would not hear as much but no guarantee on the noise. When we went to cancel to move else ware they told us that since we made the reservation online that we would be responsible for the full amount for the pending 2 days. We could not speak to a manager unless we went down to the front desk. Now we are not cheap but when we arrived we were told there was going to be an additional $15/night to use the hotel on top of our reservation. We had not choice and agreed but why in the world would you build a beautiful hotel with the Trump name on it if no one on the highway side could ever get a good night sleep? Our view showed us dozens of construction projects abandoned including the second tower of the Trump hotel. I cant imagine the noise that we would have heard if they were being worked on. The entire town is hurting for business. You would think that if you had a customer at your hotel and your running at 20% occupancy you would make sure those that are here are provided for no matter where the reservation was made from. It is also at the end of the strip about a 5 minute walk to the strip. Not a great location unless you want to walk all day. If you make a reservation online then call the online company directly to cancel. We did and after 15 minutes on the phone we were set up someware else.

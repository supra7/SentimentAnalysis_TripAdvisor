The hotel location right on the water is what this place is all about. Regretably, renovation work to the waterside facia, meant the comfy lounge area with its open fire's and sofa's had it's windows sheeted off (stayed early November 07). Views could however be obtained from the less cosy, modern bar area. The hotel is in a lodge style, but has a modern trendy bar and restaurant; which despite being opposites, actually attract. On arrival, the expense of the valet parking is eased by a large fire pit. The service at the hotel was great, especially the concierge who knew his stuff. We had upgraded to a waterfront room, as that was the 'whole deal' of the hotel. The room was small, or maybe was so crammed with furniture such as big lounge chairs by the fire and a small desk and chair, that it just appeared that way. The theme was all about sitting by the cosy fireplace (gas fired log fire which was easily controlled). Great just to sit there in a robe with a glass of wine and enjoy the sea view, but not sure how the ambience would of been overlooking a car park and noisy main road, so glad we upgraded. The bathroom was large, with walk-in stoned-tiled shower and great toiletries. Fantastic shower with water pressure to refresh the dead. Room service was poor, food arrived over cooked and not very appetising. Additionally, the lobby areas were looking a little worn and tired, as was the room if viewed with an over critical eye. Very enjoyable however and not too far from the main city shops, albeit a $5cab ride was ideally necessary. Would recommend this hotel if you want a relaxing stay in a cosy room and make use of the hotel views.

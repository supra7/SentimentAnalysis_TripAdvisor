The location was very good, but the room we had was awful. We were assigned to a room on the fourth floor of the Kauai wing. I knew that it was an older property, but I expected it to be a clean comfortable place. Boy, was I wrong! The air conditioning filled the room with a musty smell, the closet reeked, and there was hair all over the bathtub. The worst part was that there were roaches, and lots of them! I called the front desk to see if we could change rooms, but they said that they were full and sent up a maintenance man with a can of bug spray. We checked out of the roach motel the next day and headed back to Wailea. It is too bad that such a great location is wasted on such a terrible hotel. Maybe other rooms are different, but I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It is not worth the small amount of savings. Do yourself a favor and stay away!

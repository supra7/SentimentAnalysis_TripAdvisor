We were very excited by the reviews and the website for the Hacienda Tres Rios but were disappointed by our actual experience there. It is true it is a reasonably made resort but we were expecting a lot more for our money. The biggest disappointment was the beach which was small, had ok sand but had water heavy with baobab debris so was not very nice to get in. No one swam in it. The vast amount of mosquitos also made sitting outside and touring uncomfortable. Unless you like the smell of OFF I would steer clear. No complaints about most of the staff and the accommodation was comfortable. Food was OK - not spectacular as the website suggests. We didn't have a horrible time, we just didn't have the fantastic time we had hoped for.

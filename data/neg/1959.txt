My husband and I are staying at the hotel at this moment for business and pleasure and I have to say this is the worst hotel in this star class in Las Vegas. We took along my daughter for the trip and decided to stay here being it is non smoking and no casino but we would have been better with the both then this! The room is worn! It has a funny odor, the couches need to be cleaned...it just is not in this star class. Obviously corners were cut in the building of this hotel/time share whatever the original intention of this property because the windows are HORRIBLE and why so few outlets. We have a one bedroom suite and my husband and I are fighting for outlets for 2 laptops and 2 cell phone chargers...ridiculous! Laying down last night I could hear clear as day the traffic and trains going by. Our room over looks the pool and at 8 am my room was filled with the music from the pool area.....seriously what star rating is this hotel. I called down to the front desk who should have said let me take of it but no she sends me to security who then sends me to engineering. I did go to the pool yesterday and I have to say that the girls assisting at the pool with chairs and the waitresses are great. However, again the pool is dirty! There were straws and crap on the bottom of the pool that were never cleaned up from the time I got there at 11 am until I left at 4:30. My husband comes every six weeks for business from Florida and I join him on this trip quite often and the star rating for this hotel is crazy! Do Not Waste Your Money On This Hotel, You WILL Be Disappoined!!

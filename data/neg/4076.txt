We decided to treat ourselves to a couple of nights in a good hotel to relax after the flight from England - what a mistake! The room was a small single, filled with a double bed over which you had to lift your cases to put them down. There was an empty condom packet on the floor and the lights didn't work. The restaurant staff spent our first breakfast arguing loudly in front of us and one of them tried to involve us in their dispute (we went out for breakfast on the second day!). We complained to reception at the time and left full details on their evaluation form but nobody seemed in the slightest bit interested - we didn't even get an apology, let alone an explanation or assurance our treatment had been unusual. AVOID THIS HOTEL LIKE THE PLAGUE.

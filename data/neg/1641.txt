Grounds, Pool and Tennis Courts were great but overall this place is badly overpriced. Rooms are in need of everything...primarily in need of DEEP cleaning. Also, rooms are outdated, have inferior bathrooms (with a mold problem), poor bedding, etc. The $15. per day service fee is a slap in the face after being nickeled and dimed literally to death. I reserved a room for 4 with 2 beds and was given a king with pullout sofa. The front desk rep appeared offended when I requested what I had reserved! This same guest rep, with his "Motel 6" attitude, did not have the courtesy to even say thank you at check out! The best thing about our 10 day stay was the breakfast and the personel handling it. I will not return and will not recommend this property.....NOT THE HYATT STANDARD I EXPECTED!!! (and it was not just us, there were many complaints heard throughout our stay). Other than that, we love Maui, and will return to enjoy the Island with accommodations more to our liking.

My husband and I were at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel in Spetember, 2003 for our anniversary. We spent the first half of our 10 day trip on the Big Island at the Waikoloa Beach Marriott and adored it. We were very excited to go to Maui and continue our relaxing, luxurious vacation. Wow, what a difference! This is such an old, rundown hotel. The package we booked was to have included a free upgrade from partial ocean to ocean view. We were told they were very full and could not do it. We were then given a smoking room in one of the newer wings and it smelled like an ashtray. When we told them we had booked a non-smoking room and could not stand the odor of the room they gave us, we were given a non-smoking room in one of the older wings. The room was a blast from the 1970's. Laughable, really. The shower curtain smelled very sour and the whole bathroom was dank and old. From our balcony I could see a speck of ocean between the trees. The pool was a sad little thing, very blah. The beach area was very nice and the grounds of the hotel were pretty and well-maintained. The Mixed Plate Restaurant was a dark, dingy little diner, also very dated in appearance. The Tiki Terrace Restaurant was very nice, great food. Also, the nightly entertainment was just lovely. All in all, I agree with some other reviewers in that this is a budget hotel- you get what you pay for. But even if you don't spend a whole lot of time in your room, you want it to be nice, comfortable, and not smell bad! We spent about the same amount of money per night on our hotel on the Big Island and it was worlds apart from this. There are much nicer places to stay then KBH!

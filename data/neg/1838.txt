Bedroom : very small, windowless, and thin walls, so I could hear people talking outside the room.. Bathroom : very small, the only thing that separate the toilet & the shower area was a filthy curtain, so when i took a bath the whole bathroom floor got wet, and the hot water didn't work.. If U're looking a nice hotel to stay & relax, this hotel isn't recommended..

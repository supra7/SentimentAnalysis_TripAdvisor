I stayed at this hotel 02/26/1/2011 for a 2 day event at the convention center. There is a deposit of $75.00 for any repairs that they don't tell you about when you book the room, just when you get there to check in. If you refuse, you don't get the room but they will charge you for the room. The lobby of the hotel smelled strongly of urine. The room was small and filthy. There was no comforter on the bed. The carpet was badly stained. The TV was at least 10 years old and didn't get any channels. The bathtub had hair in it , dirty shoe prints and the drain was rusted. There was a stain (red) running down the wall under the entrance way. When I asked in the lobby, they sent me to another room that was just as filthy so I went back to the original room. Went out and bought cleaning supplies and cleaned the bathroom myself. Upon returning home, I found two charges were made on my card. One for the room fee (with the deposit included) and another for $125.00. When I called the hotel and spoke with Mark, he said he cannot see that they charged me for anything but the room fee. I just filed fraudulent charges with my bank. DON'T STAY HERE!!!!

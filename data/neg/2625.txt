When i first arrived at Hotel 91, the first floor was full of empty store fronts that made me think the person that built the hotel didn't plan very well. During check-in, everything went pretty well, staff was very friendly and helpful until an old chinese woman rudely walked right in front of me while I was checking in. She asked the front desk clerkif they needed any change, so I figured it was either a manager or the owner. After she left, and I was able to finally finish my check in, I asked the front desk clerk about who the woman was and she confirmed that it was the owner. This wouldn't have been that abnormal at a business except for the fact that 1.)She cut in front of me and interrupted me as I was speaking 2.)The owner was dressed as though they were going fishing and not working at a hotel. This happened again when I was downstairs getting directions from the staff. The owner still in her fishing clothes, interrupted the conversation out of no where and tried to help but all she did was talk for 10 minutes straight giving directions that I couldn't even understand When I got up to the sixth floor to go to my room, there was an old piece of furniture that looks kinda like a tombstone that fell apart. Also the lobby looks like they went to a garage sale and just bought everything and threw it in one room. As far as the actual hotel is concerned, the rooms were fair size for new york, and the staff was excellent. If not for a nosy owner and shabby decor, the place was a great find.

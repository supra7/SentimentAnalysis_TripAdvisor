Just spent four nites at Trump for NBAA Convention. Beautiful rooms, beautiful lobby but what a NOISE from trains at 2.10am, 3.10am every morning - felt like they were coming into the room!!. Accepted rooms on 35th floor (with upgrade charges) but would probably have been better off taking basics. Very little "double glazing" - could hear every emergency vehicle passing. Be very wary of Resort Charge, USD95 - no way of getting out of it, even if you don't use pool etc. Overall, wouldn't stay here again and couldn''t reccommend to anyone.

You have to be there to witness how tiny this room actually is. Two people and you will be searching for floor space once the suitcases are put down. We had trouble opening the main door as the bags were in the way. It was hialrious.And the real fun started at night. There were so any people coming in and out using the corridor and the cleaning crews were busy changing sheets by the hour. Later did i realise couples and customers were using this place for extra curricular activities ! Location wise worked out for us as we had work with NUH. Other than that its far from anything. So if you are not a patient at NUH, or a sailor dont even think of coming here. Worst part is its expensive. Go figure. With that price you can get a pool, brekkie and legroom anywhere else in SIN.

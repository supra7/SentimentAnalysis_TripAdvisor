Read the other reviews. Many of them are spot on. This place is sub-par. Location is the only thing going for the Edgewater. The valet staff is good. There is a cost, per hour or per day, for internet use. Parking was $30 per night. The view from the restaurant is very good. Rooms are very small. People pay $200 or more per night to stay here?? Hard to fathom. I paid $80 on Priceline and I still feel as though I didn't get my money's worth. Stay elsewhere. Also...lots of train noise...all night long.

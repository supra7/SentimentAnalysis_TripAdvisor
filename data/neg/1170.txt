Our family spent one night here on an overnight shopping trip. It's very conveniently located to the highway, Southcenter mall and airport. The suites are spacious but I felt the couch and carpet in my suite were dirty and could use some updating. We were facing the back of the hotel and were awoken by the LOUD train going by. All the other nearby hotels had free WiFi but here at the Embassy they charged $10. Seriously, in this day when I can get free WiFi from a coffe shop Embassy should reconsider this charge. Also other nearby hotels had free parking but again, Embassy charged $10 for self parking. And when we stayed there it was pretty busy so we had to park in the far lot behind the hotel. I could have parked on the street for free and been closer to the front entrance. We never got to try the breakfast. Our teenaged kids slept in till 9am and unfortunately they shut the breakfast down at 9am sharp on weekdays (even though it was summer holidays). So overall I would rate this hotel below average and not a good value. There are many places to choose from in this area so look elsewhere.

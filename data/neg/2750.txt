My husband looked up reviews and thought, "Sure, sounds decent." Well, it was anything, but! First of all, the elevator squeaked, rattled, and felt like an old cardboard box hauling us up to our floor. It even shut on my husband as he was entering it just after the door had opened. There was urine outside of our door which I stepped in. As soon as we entered it smelled like a thousand car air fresheners, the floors had not been vacuumed, the toilet paper was an old roll, the toilet did not work, the side table was burned and stained, the TV cables were next to the TV (not child-safe), the bath tub had black spots in it, as did the shower curtain, the walls were so thin that the man coughing and hacking next door sounded like he was in the room with us, and I refused to touch the bed. Shall I go on? After laughing hysterically at our situation, we used our computer to find another hotel (Holiday Inn in West Memphis- OMG it's wonderful!), we left within the hour. My husband was so disgusted he didn't even want us to ask for our money back, he just wanted to leave lol I insisted and went to the front desk. The woman didn't even flinch when we requested our money back or apologize. This didn't come as a shock since she obviously feels comfortable enough to work at such a place, knowing what her guests are in for. It's seriously bizarre that they haven't been shut down! So, in short, if you want a great story to tell or ya just want to feel like a hooker in a sleezy hotel room, this is the place to go!

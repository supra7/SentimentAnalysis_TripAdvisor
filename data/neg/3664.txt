Management will disrespect your local guests and embarrass you should you wish to have them enter the hotel after 8pm. Although I am a Marriott Rewards Platinum Premier member, this hotel's management saw fit to mistreat my local guests on several evenings. Even an additional registered guest was denied a toiletry item (razor) that would be standard issue upon request at any other Marriott or hotel. Furthermore, after five consecutive days, one would think that they front desk staff would recognize their guests, though this wasn't the case. A 3rd visitor was denied entry unless a $45US supplemental fee was paid. There was clearly an attempt to drain more cash for the property at the expense of a descent experience of one of Marriott's best customers. I've never encountered such rules and additional fees, and disrespect of Marriott Rewards members and their guests at any other property with which the Marriott name is affiliated. Worse yet, the hotel General Manager couldn't see the benefit of a satisfied customer on his last night at the property. With a 4:30AM checkout to the airport, I was too exhausted to argue the many reasons why it would have been better to accommodate a consistently valuable and loyal Marriott Rewards member and guest at their property,

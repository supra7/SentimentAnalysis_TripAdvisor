We spent a full weekend in the hotel. It has pluses and minuses, but overall our impression was more on the negative side. On the positive side: - the location was very good - the bedding was nice - the bathroom was also reasonably nice On the negative side: - the doors have no insulation whatsoever. We could see the hallway lights under the door directly from the bed, and could hear everything - the tv did not work well, and repeated inquiries were useless - $7 for a bottle of water ? $15/day for internet access ? Most hotels include these amenities for free.

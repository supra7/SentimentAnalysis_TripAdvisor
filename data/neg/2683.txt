The hotel is run by foreigners. The manager stood around and watched his patrons eat up his profits. The elevators were slow and even broke on the day we arrived. The first mornings breakfast was 5 stars but each day after that only thing hot were the waffles and coffee. There were no eggs our second and third morning. Even the cheaper Quality Inns have a better breakfast than this Clarion. The manager should stay at the Quality Inn in Beaumont TX and take a lesson in what to serve for breakfast. We had stayed at a Drury Inn in San Antonio which has a 5 star breakfast every day. I was expecting the same at this Clarion. I also expected the hall floors to be carpeted and not tiled in a Clarion. Our room had been updated but the work in the bathroom should not past Choice Hotels inspections to give this hotel the Clarion name. This hotel is closer to being a Quality Inn. Because we were there on a weekend with a football game, we had to pay a premium rate plus the total cost of the three nights was charged to my charge card three weeks before we arrived.

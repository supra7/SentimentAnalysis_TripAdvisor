Great..., if you dont want to sleep The good things about this hotel are that the staff are really friendly and willing to help. The hotel is within walking distance of down town Sydney and just around the corner from the train station. Potts Point/Darlinghuurst also have a lot of good restaurants within walking distance.Bad things about the hotelThe location is a couple of streets too close to Kings Cross so it is really noisy on the weekend.The rooms are very small and expensive for Sydney.The hotel is poorly designed - we could hear the people in the rooms next door everytime they opened and closed their doors - all day and all night.The bathrooms are tiny and completely impracticle - they are frosted glass so if you use the bathroom in the middle of the night not only will your partner hear everything you do in the bathroom but the bedroom is illuminated by the bathroom lights.Stay here if you are going to Sydney by yourself mid week - or if you plan to be partying all weekend and dont need to sleep.

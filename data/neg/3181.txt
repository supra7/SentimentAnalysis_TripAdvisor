Not what I'd consider a hotel. This is a converted house offering a B&B type service. It's in the London suburb of Harlesden and nowhere near anything. It's a 10 minute walk to the train station which is London Overground and most services require you to change trains for Underground. And don't expect to find taxis at Harlesden station. Upon arriving at hotel and ringing the bell we were "greeted" by the receptionist; he opened the door and said nothing (not even hello). We were having serious doubts about the place at this stage, but had come off a long flight and were tired. After we explained that we had a reservation he let us in, and to his credit did let us check in early. There is no lift to the rooms but the receptionist did help us carry our cases up the stairs. Rooms are tiny and there is no fridge or telephone. Our television didn't work and some lamps didn't even have globes. Bathroom is also very small but modern. Bathroom mirror is better suited to a dollhouse. Breakfast consists of cereal and toast and juice, coffee and tea and is the best thing about the hotel. Final straw came when on our second last night, we asked receptionist to arrange a taxi for us for the following morning. When we checked out (different receptionist) I was told nothing had been arranged but he said he'd call one that moment. Instead of a taxi, we were taken by a private car without a meter, and we didn't agree on the price. We were travelling around Europe and were so unimpressed we cancelled our return stay there.

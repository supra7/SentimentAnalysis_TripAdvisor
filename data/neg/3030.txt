The one thing we enjoyed about this hotel was the Bellman Kevin...Wow! What a good worker! He was fast, efficient, and johhny -on- the- spot personality. So willing to help compared to any staff we encountered!! He took us to our room, got us cabs and was so very, very efficient. Thank you Kevin!! This hotel lacks ambience, rooms are cheaply done, no restaurant, only a coffee shop with horrid coffee and unfriendly workers!...oh, there is a bar there too, but that appears to be a dead beat place; basically: spend your money some place else!! It served our purposes for a wedding, but next time around we plan to find another place to stay.

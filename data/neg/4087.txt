I would not stay at this hotel again if it was free. I paid an exorbitant amount for two nights for a room that was not even big enough to accommodate a standard (double) bed. In fact, it was so small that the bedside table would not fit next to the bed and was at the foot of the bed. The TV remote control did not work, but that was not such a problem as the TV had no reception anyway. Lighting in the room was so poor that it was impossible to see the clothes in my suitcase. Which reminds me, there was not even a rack to hold suitcases, let alone a closet to hang anything in. The hotel staff were rude and arrogant, if you could get to talk to them. I waited more than 20 minutes on hold to speak to the Concierge before I gave up. Waiting at the counter did not provide any better service. For the price, I would expect a free shuttle service to the airport, as is common at other hotels. The best the hotel could offer was the phone number of a local service (not even booking the service). The only experience at the hotel that was good was dinner at Bonfire restaurant. The staff were friendly and very accommodating, and the food was terrific. Do yourself a favor and stay at another hotel, but if you like a good steak, check out Bonfire.

First, day 1, despite arriving after check in, room was not ready. 2nd Day 1 wedding until midnight at mind-blasting decibels. No food allowed at the pool chairs. Day 2: they ask me when i plan to check out--as if they cared about when I wanted to check in. Wedding # 2--EVEN LOUDER. not only that they were testing equipment all day from 2 pm. So if you like lounging at the pool...NOPE! TEST, TEST , TEST every few minutes. I tried to move to go to next door to the Ciragan Palace and recommend everyone do the same. The hotel must be losing money as they are do nothing but late night disco parties. outdoors and Metallica decibel levels.. That said, the hammam treatment was well worth doing. I'm not some bitter tourist who can't afford FS--i've stayed at FS, Aman, and One and Only worldwide. This place although beautiful is no longer working. Try next door

I was in this hotel for a work in Istanbul. You can read by comments below: 1) Room: Little, with noise, little bathroom, dirthy. In other words I never used a room like it!!! 2) Interntet connection: fast and free; 3) Very close to Taksim (center of Instanbul movida). 4) Breakfast: very poor. 5) 4 stars of this hotel are only a dream!!!

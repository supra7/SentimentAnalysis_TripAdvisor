Years ago, the Palmer House was THE place to stay in the Loop--centrally located and close to the El. The lobby is still one of the most wonderfully elegant settings in Chicago, although the famed Peacock Room is never open to guests and there are no in-hotel places to eat, save for the ordinary yet expensive Downtowner on the lower level. But the room floors? Yikes! The ickiness starts on the elevators, with their irritatingly loud Weather Channel reports. It continues to the dank hallways with their tattered, stained carpeting. The standard rooms are very standard and, after 10 minutes of running the shower, the water temperature reached its apex of cool to lukewarm. We've stayed at the Palmer House a number of times over the years. No more!

Customer Service Problems When we checked in, the power was out. Three hours later, when we left for the evening, it still had not come on. We did not want to return to the hotel after 10 pm if there was no power, and we asked at the desk about check out and refund policies. The woman at the desk assured us we could get a refund, and apologized for the inconvenience, and we checked out.However, a follow up phone call the next day was a different story. A very rude woman insisted the power had only been out for one hour and that no one had told us we would get a refund. It was not her problem we did not stay, and she refused to let us speak to a manager. Another follow up phone call got the same results - in fact, we were told the manager was too busy with important matters to speak with us, and if we gave a phone call, maybe someone would find time to call us back. This person was very rude and insisted she had documentation about the power outage. Needless to say, we expect a lot better customer service from a Days Inn. We understand the power outage, being nearly city wide, is not in their control, but we do expect them to understand it has an impact on their customers and they should honor what they say, not deny it and refuse us access to the manager.

My husband and I booked a junior suite for our honeymoon. The suite was quite large but sparsley furnished. It contained a desk, queen bed, dresser and small sofa, but no table for room service. When we did get room service, they placed our order on the desk. There were no luggage stands, the TV worked for 2 out of our 4 day stay, there was no hot water for showering one morning, and there was a smell of exhaust from the air conditioning unit. As bad as all that is, considering we paid top dollar, the worst was the mouse we saw running under the tables in the lounge. Yuck! The only good thing about this place is it's location.

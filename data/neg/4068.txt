The hotel was booked for the night of 15 May 2008 being our last night in Boston prior to our return to the UK. On presenting the confirmed reservation voucher provided by our travel agents, we were advised that no booking had been made, but they had recorded a booking for the previous day. No rooms were available as there was a convention in Boston that evening. After much deliberation we were found accommodation at another hotel but about 12 miles outside the City! There were inaccuracies in what we were told about the alledged earlier reservation. We subsequently learned that we had probably been 'bounced' and, i presume, the room let at a higher rate in view of the great demand that evening. The experience ruined our last 24 hours in Boston.

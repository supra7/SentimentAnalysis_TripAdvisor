We booked a Suite for a weekend stay in Chicago, but when we arrived at the hotel, we were told we had booked a room and that no suites were available. Our relatives, who also stayed at the Hampton Inn, had also booked a Suite but were also told they had not done so and could only have a room when they arrived. It did not matter they had a writen confirmation (which we did not have) that they had booked a Suite, they did not get it. So, BEWARE when you book with this otherwise OK hotel. GET IT IN WRITING. It may not get you the Suite you booked upon arrival, but at least , you can argue. And it will keep the staff from adding insult to injury by insinuating it's your problem, not theirs.

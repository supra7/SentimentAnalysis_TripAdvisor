The room is dirty and the sheets are very stained. After talking to the manager the sheets were changed with sheets that were stained worse than before. We left for the day and when we returned that evening we found that the sheets had been changed. This time they had blood on them and yellow stains. Very Gross! All the good reviews written on this place must be written by the manager.

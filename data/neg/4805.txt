Ever get into a hotel bed and get someone else's urine on your body? That's what happened to me at this hotel!!!!! Then once I switched rooms, the faucet in my second room would not turn to hot which I did not discover until I had just enough time to take a shower and get ready the next morning. In the end the manager took off all room and valet charges which was nice (and certainly expected) but to have two rooms that were unsatisfactory over a one night stay period leaves me absolutely un-impressed. Also, valet is $26 a day which I found to be outrageous. Most of the higher end hotels that we stay at for business have complimentary valet.

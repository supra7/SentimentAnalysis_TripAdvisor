My husband and I stayed at the Miami Hilton for a conference he was attending. Not a terrible place, but I have to say that I've stayed in nicer places that are less expensive. For me, it's the little details that make a hotel worth the money, and the Hilton just doesn't have the attention to detail that a hotel of its caliber should. First, the toilet paper holder is 2.5 ft. away from the toilet - I kid you not. You almost fall off of the toilet trying to get it. Second, my husband and I are both businesspeople, and to get wireless internet in our room, we were EACH charged $9.99 a day, even though their materials all say "wireless internet in your room for only $9.99 a day." What they should say is per computer. Maybe other hotels do this, too, but I haven't experienced it. I'm sleeping in the bed with my husband. Will I be charged extra for that? Third, the entire hotel is a little run down. I'd suggest Hilton put a few dollars into a rehab. Soon. Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is. Breakfast was cold, room service was OK. As I'm writing this review, we've been without water - the entire hotel - for more than 3 hours. Now, I don't expect Hilton to be able to control emergencies like this, but I mention it only as another point of frustration with this place. In a city like Miami, I'm sure there are better places to stay.

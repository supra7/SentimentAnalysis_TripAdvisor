Word to the General Manager: Folks have good things to say about this resort. But your reservations department sucks. Really the only bad complaints is overbooking. I am getting ready for a trip to Orlando, FL. My husband and I have to drive to Alabama (6 hrs drive) pick up father (wheelchair bound), Mother, and Grandmother (82 yrs of age) and drive to Orlando (8 hrs drive). If I got there and didn't have a room (like the family from Canada) I would be toooo put out. I love a nice, clean, quiet resort. But this one scares the hell out of me, no rooms after my reservations have been confirmed. I would definitely fire the reservations person.

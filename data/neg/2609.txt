This is not a boutique hotel. Cheap, loud and cheesy is what this hotel is. Very very loud you will feel like a highway running through your room. It's time they remodel it and at the minimum paint the hallways and the room. They only provide soap and shampoo in the room so plan on taking everything else. The rooms are very small. The hotel main entrance is on the second floor a little odd. I would not stay there again. The location is not good. Very very loud. We could not sleep at all it was impossible.

AWFUL Awful 'hotel'. We arrived to find a very sleazy italian man on the second floor of a building. He guided us to the 'reception' which consisted of a very small table in the middle of the corridor and proceeded to show us to our room. There is only 6rooms! Everyone can hear everything. When inside our room no further than 2metres from 'reception', we could hear EVERYTHING. We asked for the room furthest down the corridor approximately 10metres from 'reception'....although the room was clean we were asked to turn tv down, because the staff ~(one sleazy italian man) could hear it at reception... In addition our room had an adjoining paper thin door to another one of the 6rooms. truly awful!! Breakfast is served in room cause there is no-where else to sit or eat. Staff (only one on at any one stage) are very dodgy. There are NO facilities in this 'hotel' / 6 roomed second floor apartment that is under serious misadvertisement. Do NOT stay in this hotel. Also do NOT even think of staying in the luxury suite!! We had booked this but didnt even get to stay in the room. BAD BAD BAD HOTEL

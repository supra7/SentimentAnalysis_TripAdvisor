I stayed here for 3 nights due to the low online price from booking.com. There is a daily $15 resort fee added to your final bill, which covers car parking and use of their own pool (if it wasn't so cold!). Great food in the restaurant, and good value for the fixed-price $29 menu (before drinks, service, tax, etc). HOWEVER, the rooms, whilst well-furnished and comfortable, are INCREDIBLY NOISY. There is a train track about 100 yards from the hotel, with a crossing right next to the hotel. SO, every time a train comes past (night and day) the train horn is sounded long and hard! Great if you want to wake up at 7am, but awful if you want to get any sleep. The traffic noise from the adjacent freeways is very noticeable as well, even on the 35th floor. Also, each room has a shared lobby with the room next door, with an inner and outer door. Each of these closes very noisily and you will hear your neighbours when they get back at 5am after a good night out (we certainly did!). To sum up - Great prices, but for a reason. AVOID.

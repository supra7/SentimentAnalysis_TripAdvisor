I went to Boston to attend seminar in Nov. 2006. I thought the price kinda high but, I'm just a small time city gal, good thing I was not sharing the room, it would of gotten slightly cramped. The room was pleasant if a little small for the price. The bathroom was very tiny but clean and in good order. The carpet, walls and bedding were clean. After reading some of the reviews, I had my doubts.....but I was pleasantly surprised by my room. The heat didn't work right, but I'm hot natured and had my window open most every day anyway. The food was passable if a little high priced. The hotel was close to everything a tourist could hope for, the T, shops, restaurants and sight seeing. Even though I wasn't footing the bill, I did enjoy my stay and my room. But, one could tell the hotel was past it's 'hey day'. All in all, I enjoyed this spot (but, would have to admit, if it were my dollar, I'd stay elsewhere).

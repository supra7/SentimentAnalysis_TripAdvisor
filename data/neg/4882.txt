This hotel is right on the beach. Every room has a sliding glass door that's not quite a balcony, but which lets you listen open your room to the outside. I fell asleep listening to pounding waves. That is the good. The bad was that the parking really was a joke. I waited a long time for a valet and people were helped ahead of me who had arrived after me. On top of that, I was delayed from leaving by a half hour because the valet LOST MY CAR. And then the young man tried to blame it on me. How in the world could I be at fault for the valet losing my car? Reception was efficient, but also imperonal and unfriendly. They could not have cared less that I was a Diamond member- very shoddy service. The room itself was well worn and felt a little dirty. I probably wouldn't stay here again just because it is a Hilton- I'd probably take my business elsewhere.

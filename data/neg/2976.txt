ok So I Am Gonna Say It Loud And Clear....The Hotel Is Good Looking And Its Luxurious But The Service Sucks U See Most Of The Time There Isn't Any water in the hotel so u cant take a shower whenever u want and the breakfast is not that good its not bad but also not good ! And this is what they did to they charged us 50 euros extra....for a late check out...but we Didn't get it...and its not only us When u check in ur happy when u check out your sad cause every single person who checked out while i was staying had a fight with them some were charged for the Minibar when they didn't get it....some where in like my Position so in one sentence this hotel is not a good one and the rating should be 3 stars instead Of 5 ! thats it if u want my advice do not check in this hotel !!

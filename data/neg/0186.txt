I think that it is ironic that a hotel would try to emphasize the importance of a good sleep when they have such terribly thin walls. On our first night, our neighbors kept us up with their loud conversations and then woke us up early at 5:00. I asked for and received a different room, but it was no different. We could still hear the people next door, although they weren't as bad with their hours. The rest of the hotel is fine and we found the service to be good, but it can't really make up the difference for this poor experience.

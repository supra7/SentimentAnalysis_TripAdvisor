The weekend we stayed at the hotel a wedding party was staying there. This caused all other hotel guests to become second rate patrons. They had many common areas closed to non party members, such as second floor bar and resturant, valet and bell service, as well as some elevators. The hotrel is tiny and quaint, but way too small to accommodate such a large party. We have also stayed at the Omaha property and experienced the EXACT same treatment, due to a wedding party. The breakfast buffet was horrible and scarce, at best. However, The evening cookies were a nice treat. I would not recommend this hotel, but if you choose to stay, call and make sure they will not be busy with a larger party than they can handle.

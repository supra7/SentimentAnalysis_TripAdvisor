I rely so much on trip advisor reviews, I finally decided to write one. My family and I stayed at hotel Andra for three nights in mid-September. We will be back in Seattle in two weeks, and we will not be returning to this hotel. There are a few redeeming qualities: we liked the location, it is a close enough walk to Pikes Place market. We loved the bakery across the street for a convenient breakfast, and the rooms were ample size for the four of us. We loved that the room has Voss water, although $3.50 a bottle, I really like that water. Downsides were many. the bed was so bad, there was a huge dip in the middle where literally, you had to either hover on the edge of the bed or roll into the big hole in the middle. My husband and I had the worst sleep ever. We complained, no change, no reply. Ditto about the shower. It did not drain. About three minutes into your shower and you are standing in ankle deep water. That to me, is disgusting. We asked three times for a plumber to fix it. No luck. It remained that way for our entire stay. Room service only has Greek food on the menu. It was from Lola's. It tasted pretty good, but way too limited in variety. Overall, it wasn't the worst place ever, but we expect good service and response, and a comfortable bed and nice bathroom are important to us, plus we order a fair amount of room service. So, overall there were just too many negatives and with many other great choices in Seattle, this one just isn't worth it.

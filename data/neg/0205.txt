We booked our reservations 6 months in advance. 34th floor/view/2 double beds. When we arrived our room wasn't available so they put us on the 27th floor with no view. Also I had to request that I not be charged the 34th floor rate (as it was more). Also, didnt receive our packaged continental breakfast. Later that night we went down to the hotel lounge to check out the live music. After paying $35.00 for 4 drinks (and not so great drinks at that, and the service was less than expected) we were chased out and followed to the elevator- the waiter telling us we "stiffed" him on his tip. Guess he wanted more. Came right up to my face and said this in front of other guests. Not going back.... Because when on a vacation- I don't feel like being attacked over not giving enough tip. I guess I'll stick with the Westin!

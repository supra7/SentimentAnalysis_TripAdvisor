I made this reservation two month in advance. The room was not ready. Then the team manager put me in the room, which was not cleaned after the previous guest. Then somebody knock at the door about 2 am. Service was delivering the extra towels which I never ordered. Rooms are dusty and not cleaned properly. MY WORTH EXPERIENCE IN VEGAS! PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!

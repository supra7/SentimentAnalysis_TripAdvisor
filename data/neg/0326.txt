I chose this hotel because it was the cheapest price for downtown seattle. My inexperience as a hotel picker was quickly apparent when we finally arrived in our room after having to walk around the block from the parking garage to the hotel lobby because it doesnt lead into the hotel at all. Lucky for us we were just staying for one night so we packed lightly. We walked into the room and noticed it was recently remodled yet extremely small. There was no table like you see in most hotels. All of this I can deal with but the single worst thing about this place is that the walls are virtually non-existent. My neighbors were not being too loud however you can hear people talking at a normal level. You can hear every toilet flush in the rooms around you. This is not good for a light sleeper such as myself. I guess if your a partier and want to go stay out all night and need a bed to come pass out in then this place might work. I guess the one good thing to come out of this is that now I know that you get exactly what you pay for. And to do a little more research on a hotel before I make reservations.

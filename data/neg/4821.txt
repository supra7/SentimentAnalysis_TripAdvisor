I have stayed in Hilton's in New York, L.A., and most other major cities, and they have been more than accomodating. But I must say, the Hilton in Daytona Beach need to be updated. It smells of mildew, and when I complained about this, the staff said it was 'to be expected,' because they were on the ocean.... Seriously? The rooms were subpar and the valet 'couldn't find' my car to the point where he was thinking I was mistaken about where I parked and I was thinking it was stolen. For that I could've stayed in a $32 a night roach motel. Very disappointed, Hilton...

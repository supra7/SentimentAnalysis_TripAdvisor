My husband and I wanted a nice weekend away to relax without kids. We chose the Dana because of the location and the reviews but were very disappointed. It would be a great place to stay if you were interested in the night club on the roof, but we weren't and could hear the music and people talking until the club closed at 2am. The club is on the 26th floor and we were on the 21st. After 2 nights of this, we asked to be moved to a lower floor for the last night. They moved us to the 9th floor and we were able to sleep better that night, but there is a lot of noise from the streets too. I'm not sure what floor you would stay on that wouldn't have some sort of noise issue. The staff did move us, which we appreciated, but would have liked to be compensated in some way for the 2 nights of horrible sleep. It is not a cheap hotel and the only thing we really used it for was to sleep...which did not happen. We will not be staying here again!

My girl friend am I stayed here for her birthday weekend because it was so close to Seattle Center, BIG MISTAKE. First the website overcharged me then I tried to call and fix it and got hung up on because some jackass couuldent find my reservation because for some reason he dident know how to look for online reservations. When we got there the place looked terrible smelled terrible " Sure they say they are 95% smoke free dont believe it". Then the guy charged me again during the check out sayin the paypal online charge was only a credit card verification to hold the room so I ended up getting a charge for 387$ and one for 129$ which too forever to clear up with their incompatent rude staff. Dont stay there, it was a horrible experience for me and apperently the other reviewers on this site.

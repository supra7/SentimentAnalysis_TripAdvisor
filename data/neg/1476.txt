1) When you arrive at this hotel the staff dont even greet you. They are very rude. But fine, if that was the only negative thing I could live with that. 2) There are loads of cockroaches in the room (everywere). The staff told us that it is worse when its raining. 3) The location is far away from the metro. When its raining its impossible to get a taxi so you have to walk the 20 minutes and get soaked. 4) The location is in a bad area according to the locals, its in the red light district.

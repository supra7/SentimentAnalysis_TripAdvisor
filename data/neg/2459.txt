Travelled to this hotel on the 11th May from Manchesterbfor avcharity cycle. Arrived at 10:30pm, hotel had no rooms, even though we booked 5 weeks in advance. I was told that they allocate the bookings for check-in based on first comes first served. Left 4 of us waiting with bikes til 1am in the morning, shocking service and disgusting policy.

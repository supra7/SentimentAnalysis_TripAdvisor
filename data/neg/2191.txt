Just a warning to anyone staying at the Hacienda Tres Rios or invited to attend a 'timeshare' presentation by Sunset Beach Club at this location. Do not involve yourself with this company! We signed a contract with them and have fought them for four months to get our money back, they used all sorts of unethical tactics to try to scare us into keeping our contract (which we had legally cancelled). This is terrible company that knows exactly how to prey on the unwary traveller, please do not support them or their affiliates!

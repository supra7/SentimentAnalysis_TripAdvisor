At 11:30am on 5-18-10 while traveling from San Francisco to Seattle on a important business trip, I learned my Father was suddenly rushed to ICU in South Florida. I immediately e-mailed Warwick Hotel to let them know of my situation and that I would need my room ready ASAP once I arrive. Warwick Hotel assured me my room would be ready and even said Mr. James Harker, General Manager, would promptly inform all his staff. After 2pm I arrived at the Warwick & my room was Not Ready nor was any of the Warrick Staff informed. Mr. Harker was unavailable. I then told Mr. Robert Smartt, Reservations Manager, who was the most cold, uncaring, inhospitable hospitality worker I ever met of my situation. He never once expressed any concern for me while scrounging up a room. My father passed away on 5-20-10, my final day at Hotel Warwick. I let Robert Smart know that except for housekeeping, to give me some privacy. That early afternoon I went to an Internet Cafe to make flight reservations back to Florida as both Warrick Hotel computers were inoperable. I got back at 4pm & my room was still never made up. The entire Warwick Hotel Staff, with the exception of Dionne, never expressed any condolence or sympathy towards me.

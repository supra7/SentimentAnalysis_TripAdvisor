This hotel is rundown - plain and simple. Maybe my family's standards are too high, but old and grimy aren't what I expect for my money when staying at a hotel - and it wasn't cheap. Although the staff are pleasant, they don't necessarily bend over backwards to service their clients. We had to ask servers and front desk staff repeatedly for things to be done. For what we paid, I don't think that is reasonable. The pool is dinky for the hundreds of people staying there. The place is also over run with partiers. Not exactly the kind of place you want to stay at if you want a quiet, restful paradise vacation. Definitely NOT a good place to stay for a Hawaiian vacation.

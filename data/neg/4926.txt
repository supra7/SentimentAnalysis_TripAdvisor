After a late arrival from the airport, we were greeted by cockroaches and a dog barking in the next room. We were moved to a different room which had dingy carpeting, peeling moldy walls in the bathroom, rusty bathtub, old worn sheets and towels and pigeon droppings covered the balcony. There was the smell of cigarette smoke everywhere. There were water problems each day - broken pipes. The hotel staff did their best to deal with these problems, but the building is in very bad shape. This hotel needs a major renovation.

We booked through Hotwire to stay here during a convention taking place downtown in the convention center. We were walked to the Westin Park Central for the first three nights (along with six other people we personally know - they said seventy total were walked), which is 10 miles away from the Sheraton and an hour trip from downtown via public transportation, half hour by taxi - and they refused to reimburse us for travel costs (although they did refund the costs for one night's stay). We were told initially that we could return to the Sheraton for the final three nights when they did have room, but they canceled our reservation without authorization from us (they blamed Hotwire), and then claimed that only the Director of Revenue could address our issue. Even though she was informed (by email) on Saturday of our request, and we followed up with a call on Monday when she was supposed to be in the office, she did not return our call until Tuesday morning (by which time we had been to the hotel to try to resolve the issue to no end). If she had called twenty minutes later, we would have had to make an extra trip back to the Westin to get our luggage. All in all, they seemed to have little respect for our time and money, possibly because we booked through Hotwire. I should say that the hotel itself is nice enough, although overpriced. So if you're lucky, everything will be fine, but if you're unlucky, staying here could prove to be a giant hassle.

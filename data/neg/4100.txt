Warning - do not stay at this hotel unless you can afford a penthouse suite. Our room was the size of most normal hotel bathrooms. It was a tiny room with a tiny bed that my husband and I could both barely fit in. The airconditioner made aweful hissing noises. The AC was not broken it was just that the building is so old that the AC comes out of some old radiator looking thing. Now if you think the room was small, the bathroom was the size of a closet. The shower was not a typical shower. It was more like a foot bath. There is no way someone over 5'3" can fit in that "shower". There was no hairdryer or conditioner. Only soap and shampoo were provided. Don't let the deals persuade you. Cough up the extra $20 and stay at a real hotel with real hotel rooms. This hotel really put a black cloud over our time in Boston. Don"t make the same mistake we did.

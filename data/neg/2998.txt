When booking through lonelyplanet / Hotelworld webpage, you book on Hotel Domus Preatoria and when you print your booking it appears Hotel Dama (on the same address)! One is on the ground floor and the other is in the 5th floor. (but you only discover this when you arrive!) Both Hotels say they have nothing to do with this confusion, but they don`t do a thing to solve it. We refused to stay at Hotel Dama, which doesn't even have a proper reception place, and we were charged the night in our credit card, for not advising with 24 hours in advance. They mislead you, they book you where you didn't choose and they still charge you! Eyes open: I would definetly not stay in both hotels! If we do not denounce this attitudes, there is no way of stopping them, online customers need to be better protected!

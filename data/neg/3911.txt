We were very disappointed in our two night stay at the Marriott Long Wharf. Besides the fact that the room was small (certainly for two adults and one child), both nights we had to call the front desk because of the noise in adjoining rooms which made it impossible to go to sleep. Both nights the front desk sent up security. The experience of being this aggravated on our vacation made the view from the window and the convenience of the location pale in comparison.

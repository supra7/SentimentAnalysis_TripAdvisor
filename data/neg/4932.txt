Stayed here purely for the location, as it's right by the bus station and we needed to catch a bus out the next morning. And it was fine for that. Also can see it might be a decent option for travellers on a tight budget, it's cheap enough. Rooms are dated and small (shower was very cramped), but clean enough. Breakfast is basic bread to toast and jam and coffee, but again you're very much getting what you pay for. Staff were polite.

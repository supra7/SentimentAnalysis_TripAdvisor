It was a very nice place for the price (though next to a strip club). The staff was friendly and the place SEEMED clean, but there is an obvious insect problem. The first time I went into the bathroom there was a cockroach scurrying across the floor. That's not really a dealbreaker, but in the middle of the night both myself and my brother were bitten multiple times by bugs. I'm praying that they were just flees and not bedbugs (dear god please let them not be bedbugs), but I don't have any evidence that they've followed me home yet. Still, I'll be ripping apart the sheets and doing a thorough mattress inspection of every hotel I stay at from now on. This was so disturbing.

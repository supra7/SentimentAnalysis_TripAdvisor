The rooms and staff were all cute & friendly but the noise level was awful even with ear plugs that they provide. The breakfast was all Costco - nothing fresh - only the coffee was good; fruit so-so. I'd go to the hippie market to get awesome breakfast burritos to bring back. Someone was onsite making omelets but they weren't worth the price when again, you could go to the market & buy something better tasting for less. The smoothie was very expensive & watery. If you are young & into the hippie scene, this is the place for you but otherwise, you won't get much of the flavor of Hawaii. Plus, WiFi was next to non-existent & couldn't print from the computer provided for guests.

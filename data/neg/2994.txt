Hotel 81 Rochor is a decent budget hogged. However, it doesn't charge budget prices. We were very disappointed with what we got for $80 USD a night. We requested windows and got a room without windows. The other guests were extremely loud - slamming doors in the hallways at 1am and bizarre things like that. The hotel did nothing about it. The room lacked furniture, so we couldn't unpack. Housekeeping short-sheeted the beds several times and we had to ask for proper sheets. The ones they used barely fit the bed - which was uncomfortable. WiFi was good seed, but booted us out after three minutes of inactivity. Overall, not what we would expect for the money. At $40 less a night, it might have been a decent deal.

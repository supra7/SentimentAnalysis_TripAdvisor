How my relationship with this hotel was very disappointing; when we arrived we thought it was a gorgeous place with great spacious comfortable rooms and a great breakfast which was included in the price. The location isn't great as I think we'd have suited a hotel downtown more as we are two girls in our mid-20s but there was nothing physically wrong with downtown it just wasn't perfect. Saying all that, i still wouldn't stay there again if you (ironically....you'll see my point next) paid me. The hotel took over $1,100 from me "by mistake" on top of the final hotel bill. It took four phone calls to four different people to get the money back. It is now a week since I made the first complaint that they had taken all this money without authorisation and I am still waiting for the remaining $500 to be returned to me. As a tourist on holiday from England I have saved up this money and they have taken it from me and only after speaking to four different people has it been returned to me. It has never been fully explained to me why this money was taken or for what purpose. After the first complaint I gave my mobile number and was told that I would be contacted when the problem was sorted. I was never contacted and I had to check my balance myself to see if the money had been returned. Don't stay here if you cannot afford for them to steal over $1000 from you.

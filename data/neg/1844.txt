Fragrance Hotel did not have the right reservation details when I arrived, and it was such a hassle to fix it. The person at the reception area was unwilling to help; he did not allow me to access the wireless connection from the lobby (so that I can check the email from my laptop). Instead, I had to go to the internet cafe across the street and have the reservation details printed. It was not a good welcome to Singapore. I would not recommend Fragrance Hotel Oasis, or any other Fragrance Hotel outlets, to travelers. These hotels are where people just have two-hour quickies and leave. You would not want to spend time in this place. I would pay extra not to stay in this hotel.

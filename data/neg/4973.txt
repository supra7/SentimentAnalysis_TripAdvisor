I accidentally left cash in my room after checkout (I know that was my fault) but I realized it before the room was cleaned. When I called and explained to the front desk, they said I needed to speak with housekeeping. However, I was given the run around. By the time someone finally connected me with housekeeping (hours later), they claimed there was no money found. The person I initially spoke with should have sent someone (or gone themself) to the room immediately to retrieve the money. But, it seems like they saw this as an opportunity and they really didn't care that I had left it. Also, hotel's kind of old and decrepit and out of the way; didn't feel like a safe area.

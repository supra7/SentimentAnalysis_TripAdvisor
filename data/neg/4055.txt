I recently traveled for business to Boston, and the meeting was at the Park Plaza. It was a pleasant surprise to be at a hotel right in the center of town. The Park Plaza is perfectly located adjacent to the Boston Common, Newbury Street and Comm Ave at the top of Arlington Street with lots of shopping, restaurants, T (subway) stop, and points of interest nearby. The lobby is nice. The room was quite small, with a small bathroom as might be expected for a "vintage" hotel such as this. Everything was very clean. However, upon check in, the room was extremely cold. Someone came from engineering within 30 minutes and solved the problem by turning up the steam heater in the bathroom, which helped. They had tags to hang on the door to get a newspaper daily, and while they took the tag, the newspaper never appeared during my two night stay. Worst of all, was that I hung a tag out to order a room service breakfast-I also called room service to let them know the night before, and they assured me, that this would guarantee that the room service breakfast would arrive as requested. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and when I mentioned it, the person said "oh yes, unfortunately that happens" (though they did bring me breakfast, a bit late but I made it to my meeting). In summary, for the price and location, this is a perfectly alright place to stay, as long as you can roll with the punches when it comes to ironing out a few details.

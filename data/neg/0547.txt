We stayed for 4 nights. I used Priceline and bid on a 4 star in downtown for $89 a night and got the Sheraton. Great location. However, our room was stale and felt old. The Concierge was not very friendly. We have 3 kids and went touring and when we came back at 4 p.m., the room had not been cleaned yet. They were not very apologetic. I'm sure there are nicer sections of the hotel...perhpas we stayed in the older version, I'm not sure, but I'm glad I used priceline and didn't pay full price. One more complaint...the pool is on the 35th floo with beautiful views, but there were only 4 chairs. If you want to take your kids swimming, there's never a place to sit because people claim one of the 4 chairs. I mean, come on...nice pool, but 4 chairs? Oh, and to park it's $38 a night or you have to use a public garage 5 minute walk away.

Rooms looked like a Ramada....cheezy furniture and horrible musty smell. Tiny bathrooms and no bathtubs! We were in Hawaii for a week so we had several VERY heavy bags so being placed on the 2nd floor was not "fun" because they had no elevators. Pool was just "so-so". The Front Desk staff was very nice, however. Concierge was helpful once we flashed some cash - she was actually surprised that we were going to tip her! Probably indicative of the type of clientele they get there! Location was pretty good - convenient to shops and golf.

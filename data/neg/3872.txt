I was hoping that I would be able to enjoy my time at the Marriott however, after we attended our Women of Faith conference at the Garden we were looking forward to getting some rest after our long day and knowing that we had a long day on Saturday. When we came back to the hotel my sister got into her bed only to find a WOMEN'S THONG in her bed. We were both disgusted and then I climbed into my bed approaching cautiously after her discovery only to find what looked to be HAIR in my bed. At 1 AM we just need to get to sleep because we needed to get to our conference early in the morning. It was the most disgusting feeling knowing that the basic clean sheets are not being changed at an upscale hotel. I went down to the desk the next day and informed them of the problems and they assured me that they would have someone change the sheets. No one gave us any discount on this room When we went back to our room where we found dirty laundry remaining. I am appauled because we paid a lot of money for the "comfort" of a smoke free hotel and a feather free room. Only to find these things in our sheets. We were not comfortable at all. I will not stay at this hotel again. I will give my business to a hotel that cares.

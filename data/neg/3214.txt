Rooms are extremely small and bathroom very bad. Concierge people tried all the time to drive you to "suggested" shopping centres/shops 100% bad. Position is terrible and few taxi stay at the hotel (extra charge to get to the Hotel). Walking is very dangerous. Breakfast not included but restaurant looks very poor and food very cheap. Not reccomended!

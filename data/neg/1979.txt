I'd give it a solid 4 stars, don't know about 5. We stayed on the 24th floor on the downtown (north) side - the hotel wanted an additional $25 a night to stay on the south side overlooking the main part of the strip. We stayed 4 nights and as others have mentioned there are no good night's sleep at the Trump. We were awakened multiple times all 4 nights by trains and sirens. On the plus side the rooms are very nice - very nice bathrooms as big as a bed room. Rooms include stoves and small refrigerators. The only other plus is there is the hotel is entirely smoke free and there is no casino. It's nice to come in after a long day in Vegas to a quiet hotel. Minuses included no self parking. We are the type of people that are in and out a lot and it would just be nice to at least have the option to self park the car to not have to deal with waiting multiple times for the valet. Of course they had to be tipped each time as well. I actually ended up parking at the mall lot across the street several times when we knew we were coming in for an hour or so. The hotel charges a $20/day resort fee to cover parking (mostly free in Vegas anyway), a newspaper (never did see one of these), and internet access (not worth $20 a day).

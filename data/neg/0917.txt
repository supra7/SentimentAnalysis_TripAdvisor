My husband and I had to travel to Seattle for a doc appt and a procedure. We checked in on Dec 7th 2010 and had already paid for the room on hotels.com. When we arrived the lady at the desk said that they were going to charge us for parking $7 a day. Then we get to our room and the keys don't work so my husband had to go downstairs to get another key and when he came back up we were now in a diffrant room. We walked in and OMG. There were holes in the bathroom door. Stains on the carpet. The bed looked broke in half. The heater was hard to get goig because the knobs were broke off and you couldn't tell if it was on cool or heat. We had been up since 4am and said screw it we are tired, The traffic was just insance. The noise made is so hard to sleep and the volum on the tv was not great. You could barley hear what they were saying on TV. The staff was the only thing good about our stay there. The lady that checked us in was able to give us good directions to where we needed to go. The swimming pool and spa were not great to look at and that was our view...they both had green water in them filled with alge. We recommend not staying there. Motel 6 is much better.

The thermostat was at 75 degrees when we checked into the hotel. We lowered it to 60 degrees and an hour later noticed no changes. Maintenance was sent to the room and the gentleman replaced the air filter, checked the thermostat and told us the room should cool off within an hour. We left for about 2 1/2 hours, only to return to the thermostat reading 76 degrees. There were no other rooms available so we were told nothing else could be done. I am not sure how the other rooms felt, but even the lobby was not cool. There was problems with the toilet, but maintenance changed a part and managed to get that working okay.

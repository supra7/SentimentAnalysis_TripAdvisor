This hotel was just gross. For some reason, our windows were fogged up & remained that way the entire time. The area is kinda sketchy - we tried walking to a bar less than 1 mile away and were truly scared about getting stabbed. The shower had a window - to the bedroom. The owners don't want to call taxis for their clients, because they have their own van & charge much higher fees. Lots of weird things about this place. The only reason we stayed here is because it was the cheapest option in Seattle. WOULD NOT do it again.

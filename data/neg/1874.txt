I stayed her one night with a family of 4 (2 teenagers) on our last night in Italywe staged here before an early flight the next morning. The hotel had received fairly high marks on Trip Advisor and was mentioned in Rick Steves, but it didnt measure up. It is not in a charming part of townthere is no sign out front for the hotelwhich makes me wonder a bit. When we arrived, there was some issue with our intended room, so they upgraded us to their special room and then gave us the room next door for the kids. Space-wise, it was fine and the room looked fancybut like a faade built over an old structurethe fancy suite wasnt all that. The bathroom was in a grotto downstairs with a hot tub (it all briefs well and makes for a nice picture)but the hot tub was cold. The bathroom was extremely hotdriven by an overactive towel warmer. There was a fancy Jacuzzi showerbut none of the controls workedand the water wouldnt stay at a constant temperatureit tended to get dangerously hot. The entire suite reeked of chlorine. There was broken glass on the floorwhich my daughter found with her bare foot. My wife came away with some suspicious bug bites on her feetfortunately, we think they were fleas and not bed bugs. The breakfast was mediocre at bestthe worst we had had in Italy. There are too many hotels in Rome to waste your time and money at this one.

Poor customer service We booked our room in January of 2007 at a rate of $69 a night. We knew it was in an industrial area and close to the Museum of flight, which was our primary reason for staying there. We arrived just after 3:00PM. Check in is after 3:00PM. We waited 5 minutes before being helped, then we were told the room wasn't ready. We waited in the lobby, that was still under construction and 10 minutes later we were told it was ready. There is no breakfast, as the construction is still in progress. Tully's is in the lobby for coffee, or juice products. They do have an ice machine and Pepsi prodcuts in veding machine. We went down the dark hall, poor lighting, and approached our room, only to find it still being cleaned. We were told to come back in 15 minutes. We did, still not ready. We waited another 10 minutes and finally it was ready, so we weren't able to get in the room until 4:20PM, almost an hour from when we first arrived. I was afraid to go in the room, by the looks of the lobby and hallway leading to the room, however, it was clean and nice. The beds comfortable. We'd leave early each day and come and go, and the room was never cleaned until 4:00 or later every day. They have poor customer service and really need to improve greatly. Okay place if your not into fancy or good customer service. Good Bath  body products, coconut lime verbena.

We had always stayed at either Kea Lani or Grand Wailea, and wanted to see the other shore of Maui. So, based on Tripadvisor reviews we booked this hotel for two weeks in July 2004, but what a huge disappointment! I don't know who in their right mind would call this luxury (only those who have never been in a luxury hotel before) The hotel is worn, with old bacteria-fested wall-to-wall carpets, and it's best days are definitely way behind. And people were smoking everywhere, no matter where in the premises we went. Even if we were given a non-smoker room, the smoke from the balcony below or next to us ruined our attempts to enjoy the fresh Maui air. Yikes! I'm surprised Hyatt is able to charge such a high room fee and call it luxury; we were out of there after really trying, and changing rooms three times, always ending up next to a smoker. We cancelled the remaining trip and got Grand Wailea for the same price (they had 3 nights for the price of 2 specials) and regretted we had ever tried this shoddy hotel.

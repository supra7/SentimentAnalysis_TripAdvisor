My family and I recently stayed at a Marriott hotel. Although nice, I strongly urge that they furthur their budget in the security department. We stayed at Marriott Suites 2493 N. Stemmons Freeway Dallas,Tx 75207.Friday June 1 & 2, 2007. We had been at the hospital since Thursday evening with my brother in ICU. Exausted, with no sleep, and being constantly harrased by the homeless, and no where to go, and our home over an hour away, I reserved a room Friday night for 2 nights. Thinking this was a quality hotel, I was willing to pay for a more expensive hotel for the guality and safety that I thought they offered. But while we slept that Friday night, someone came into our room and stole mine and my mothers purses. Everything I practically owned was in that purse, drivers license, social security numbers and cards, bank cards, credit cards, medical cards...$200.00 worth of mp3 players. My mothers debit/credit card. My husband cancelled our bank card and credit cards that day. My dad cancelled theirs, but has continued to get reports of continued use of their card. They are now officailly, flat broke. We called the police,they made a report, but there are no leads. We filed a complaint to the claims department, in which we were told that the hotel had not filed a claim yet. The claims department sayed they would call us back , and they haven't. This should not have ever happened. We are extremly upset and highly disappointed in this hotel, and how this has been handled so far. We still have not been offered any compensation in any way. God forbid that this could have been someones child stolen out of the room, and they have to file it with the claims department. I pray this NEVER happens to anyone!!

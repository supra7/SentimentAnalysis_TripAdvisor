What I didn't like was the nightly entertainment. Because all rooms face the garden where the show takes place, you are force to listen every night to the same loud music. Since we stayed for 12 nights it is very difficult to enjoy hearing the same music for such a long time. I, personally, would have preferred to hear the ocean (this is why I spent do much money and traveled so far away), but of course other people might enjoy it. We had the ocean view room but it was not worth the price, since all you see is the hotel garden with some patches of ocean between the trees. We also had the breakfast included in the price. Unfortunately, the third day we chose to have dinner at the Mixed Plate Restaurant (the one where the breakfast is free), and I was unlucky enough to spot a huge cockroach near the food. The hotel is really average, not worth paying the price. I have not noticed any friendliness, or people trying to be helpful. I specified twice (when booking the vacation, and later when using their online check-in form) that I wanted a room with a king bed, but we received a room with two queen beds. The consequence was that my 4-year-old fell off the bed one night. Luckily, he was ok. The vacation was great, but next time we will go to another hotel.

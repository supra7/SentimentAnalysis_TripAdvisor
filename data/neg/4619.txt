I had literally to discuss two hours with the front desk, before I, HH Gold, got upgraded to Executive Level. It was a stinking smoking room. It was very small and after turning the water tap it came brown water for some minutes before it got clear !!! The telephone in the room did not work and the LAN cable (NO WIFI AVAILABLE !!!) was broken ! You can only order in-room breakfast for the next day till 11pm, and had to wait 15 minutes on the phone till my call at service was answered. Again regarding the quality and service this was by far the worst Hilton experience I ever made (maybe except Hilton at PHL-Airport) - avoid at every cost and spend your money elsewhere !

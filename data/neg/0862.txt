It's taken me this long to write a review because I tried to forget. The room I'd reserved had been given away. I'd stopped for groceries, having reserved a room with a kitchenette. The manager, whose name I knew from my phone call, claimed in person I'd not reserved this type of room. I'd spoken to him two days prior, and had the reservation printout. He denied everything, including what was in black and white. He said that instead, I should use the microwave in "the breakfast room" during limited hours. They'd described it as a nice, relaxed dining room. It was a tiny, fluorescent lit square. Like eating in a public restroom. A nice clerk quietly told me my room had indeed, been given away. The room they tried to give me stunk of vomit and harsh disinfectant. There was no bathtub. The new, flesh-coloured paint was applied sloppily over decades of old paint. Though I arrived an hour past check in, they were doing repairs in the room. The repairman yelled at me for coming in. They had claimed on both their website and on the phone, that they had renovated and were offering a "limited time" low price. I have luck with sales, so I went for it. The renovations were minimal. The basic dinginess was still there, just covered with new but extremely cheap furnishings. E.g. the lobby smelled of sweat and fried food, but they'd put out searingly bright plastic flowers and a rug. As I was at the desk trying to get my credit card reimbursed, the repairman stomped past with his ladder and glared at me. I still don't know why. The one desk clerk was a very nice young man. I arrived excited to be attending a festival for the weekend. I tried a couple of other hotels, but they were full. I missed the festival, because I drove back to Canada as fast as I could. Missing my events was better than sleeping at the Travelodge.

We spend 10 days in this hotel and all i can say is that i will not stay there again just because of the dirty rooms. The bed was good dispite of that the sheets were old, it's in a good location, wifi in our room was great but the rooms were incredible dirty. There were a lot of stains in the carpet, i had to clean the fridge and the table by myself before we use it because it was a mess, even the oven was dirty! There were dust in everything and mold in the shower.

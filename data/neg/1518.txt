The rooms resemble a 3rd world country hospital, everything is white, there's no decor whatsoever and the lighting is next to absent. The place is seriously baaaad. There is no place to put things in or on, toiletries consist of a small soap bar and lemon wet wipes (?!?). Breakfast is just a joke... The couch in the breakfast room is draped with a white bed sheet... Chairs are formerly white, but just filthy yellowish and stained now. The noise from the mobile a/c unit and the outside is unbearable. We didn't sleep the first night and had to sacrifice air the second as we were exhausted and needed sleep at any cost. Two nights cost us 240, which is outrageous for the quality, even for Rome. Credit card payment only thru Paypal, which equals problems for visitors from certain countries. On the bright side, the owners really try hard, and are helpful and friendly, but they should really consider some serious changes to their rooms. But unless that happens, stay elsewhere.

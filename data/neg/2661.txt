We booked through a corporate rate and they offered us 1 queen room which I didn't even see on the website. This should of been my first clue that it was a way smaller room. When we checked in the room was very damp, humid and musty. When I opened the curtains I saw a brick wall, nice view of LA!! So I went down to the front desk and they said it was full. We made the best of it and went to the walk of fame. Really close hotel to everything. I used the small pool and the internet. The breakfast was good but the room is quite small and people ran for tables. After returning I made a complaint to holiday inn and they sent me a voucher which was good. I just wished I asked about the room and the view when I booked.

We had reserved our room for five days, however we checked out after the first night. Let me first state the good things about this hotel. It has an incredible view of the city and the location can't be beat. These two things were not enough to make us stay in our room which had definitely seen better days. The bed actually sagged in the middle, not terribly, but enough to indicate that it was old and should be replaced. The carpets appeared worn as did everything else. There was a huge cigarette burn mark on the bathroom counter. Hopefully they will renovate when the new tower is finished.

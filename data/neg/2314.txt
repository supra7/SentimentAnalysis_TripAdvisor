From the outside the hotel looks great. Thats were it ends I was supiciuos when I got on the elevator because it had an ordor. The front desk did'nt look like your typical front desk. The staff was very cold and acted as if they didn't want to be bother. I arrived around 1:00pm hoping I could check in eary, Didn't happen. The rooms were neat but had a smell of stealness the bed was lumby and the TV was so old it had knobs. at night you can here rats or mices in the walls, I informed the front desk and they just blew my off. They billed me twice on my credit card and 3 months later it has not been resolve. I beg you don't stay there. YOU WERE WARNED...........

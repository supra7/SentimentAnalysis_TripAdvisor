Our room was oceanview. Paid a fortune for it...However, about a half mile from the beach. Trash and debris on the grounds. Check by the tennis courts. Awful dump! Shower water pressure went out every evening when everyone else was taking a shower too. Whole head of shampoo and a trickle of water. Food was 50% edible. 50% tasted really bad. The butter wasn't even good. Cups and garbage left around the outdoor hot tubs. 50% of the staff were really nice. 50% seemed disconnected and no speak english. GO TO THE IBEROSTAR GRAND INSTEAD. IF YOU WANT A CLASSY ADULT ATMOSPHERE. We unfortunately were there when Accutech corp was there. A bunch of screaming drunks who kept us up every night. Also I wanted to mention that the show performed by the staff called SECUCTIVITY was really in bad taste. Two guys acting like they wanted each other and girls and guys in a pink thong underwear. Really BAD TASTE. Talked with other couples staying at this resort and they all were not impressed. Liked the Grand Hotel better. REALLY disappointing for what I paid.

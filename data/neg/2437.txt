Don't bother booking a family room for early check-in for a 10 fee, as you will be sorely disappointed. The room was supposed to be ready at 12 noon. We arrived a few minutes after 12 only to be told we would have to wait 10 minutes as the room wasn't ready. When this was disputed, we were informed it was subject to availability, which is not what it says on the room booking confirmation. While we waited in reception for a further 10 minutes waiting for our room, several other people tried to access their family rooms, only to be told that the waiting time was now 30 minutes. We queried this again, tried to get a room elsewhere (almost impossible at lunchtime on a Saturday) and 35 minutes after it should have been ready, we were given our key. The rooms are basic, no question, but clean sheets would have been nice. We struggled to get any interest from anyone the staff, especially when we asked for more towels, bed linen, etc. The air conditioning didn't work. The room was like an oven. The window was locked, so we had to get the key from reception. They said they would send someone to look at it. When we returned, we were told it had been fixed, but it was no different. When we told the receptionist on check out it was the worse stay we'd ever had, he laughed. Won't be going here again. I'd rather sleep on Euston station.

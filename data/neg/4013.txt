We stayed here for the Boston Marathon and due to mismanagement of the room inventory, we, as well as many other runners, had our check-in time pushed back by two hours on the Sunday night we arrived. The desk clerk blamed the European volcanic ash (as in: travelers originally headed for Europe were overstaying their reservation at the hotel due to the grounding of flights); fine, but given that you've known ALL YEAR that the Boston Marathon was coming up, and that you would be fully booked for that event, I very much expected better handling of the overbooking. How about comping us for the meal you suggested we go out for while waiting for our room to open up? Or how about a complementary breakfast to make up for the fact that the 21 room hours we paid for in full were now reduced to 19 hours? Rooms are fair: worn out and not too clean; few amenities. Our room was sorely in need of a good dusting, and the little touches were off (room service menus were dirty; the desk light was burned out; cheap toiletries in the bathroom; no mini bar). Room was also not very soundproof - noise traveled easily from the hallway to the room. Finally, we were given a room with one queen-sized bed for two people - not sure if that's standard, or due to the overbooking, but I thought it was pretty standard to put two people into a king, not a queen. In positives, the location is great.

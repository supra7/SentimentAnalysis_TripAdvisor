We were not impressed at all with this hotel.We travel alot and this is one we will not come back too.The lady when we checked in had a poor attitude and gave a bad vibe.The man at the desk was very nice so we ignored her rudeness.The $21 a night parking was a big surprise.When we finally got to the room we thought it was a joke.My childrens bedrooms at home are bigger than the whole hotel room including tiny bathroom.It was very hot and stuffy as other visitors have noted.There was hair all over the bathroom but we were to tired to deal with the rude lady again.No fridge and no microwave,this room has absolutely nothing except a very stiff bed,tv and lots of hair.The one plus was location.Close to pike place market,maybe 15 mins and about 25 min walk to space needle.Forgot to mention the elevator that kept us awak all night with its screaming noise.

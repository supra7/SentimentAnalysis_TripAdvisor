I came here for a professional conference, which was held in the hotel. The lobby of the hotel is opulent, but the rooms leave much to be desired. The rooms are very small and the walls are thin -- I could hear the people talking in the next room at night. The bathroom is the smallest I've ever seen, without even a counter on which to set toiletries. While the hotel is old and quaint, the rooms and bathroom are so small that they are not comfortable. The hotel makes a poor choice for a conference venue. The meeting rooms are split between the Mezzanine level and the 4th floor. This was an awkward set-up to try to get between these floors. The elevators were extremely slow and crowded, to the point of being clostrophobic! My company is paying the bill my stay here, and it's a good thing, because I wouldn't waste my money on this hotel.

We arrived at the hotel only to find out that they had overbooked and had canceled our reservation. The front desk lady was impatient and rude. We were never informed of the cancellation until we showed up in person, but the lady didn't even offer to help us find another hotel. It was probably for the better because the place looked like a dump, and the construction made it even worse. The walls and floors were all torn up, there was no reception area left. The lady didn't care about our situation and was unwilling to help us find another hotel for the weekend. We had to call a dozen hotels on our own before we found one with availability. It caused a lot of unecessary stress, and we weren't able to get to the Mariner's game as early as we should have.

This hotel is beautiful and has lots of history. The rooms are pretty with classic beauty. (not incredibly fancy). In my personal experience the main problem with this hotel is the lack of motivation, dedication and customer focus from all the staff. The Ugly I had to open my own door and drag my luggage from the cab to registration while bellstaff and porter spent their time conversing. I had to drag my luggage to the executive level (The upgraded experience). I arrived into a room of medium size and average amenities only to find a toilet which had been used and not flushed. The fermentation caused for fetid gases to float all around me My room also had a desk with a white crust that I could scratch out with my nail. lots of it (food perhaps). On my closet door I noticed a few stains of what appeared to be dried blood. I notified my "special" concierge in my "special" floor of the problems and requested his help in addresing the issues while I went out for dinner. Upon my return I walked into the same nightmare. When I approached him again he offered an alternate room and gave me a key if I wanted to go take a look prior to relocating. This one had lovely long hairs in the room evidence of a prior guest with a lush mane... When I requested the opportunity to talk to a Manager on Duty I was told by my "special" concierge that they did not have one. Finally he located someone from the front desk who assisted with finding me a clean room. I am now in my clean room enjoying rather comfortable linens, I took a bath in my clean bathroom with a missing shower mat or rug. the water pressure was low but the water was sufficiently hot. To be continued... I still have 5 more days

My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 16th July to 18th July. We selected this hotel purely for the excellent location and for the cost. But frankly we were in for a shock when we arrived at the hotel directly after disembarking from a cruise. There was only one person at the front desk and he bluntly told us that check-in was only after 3pm. Since it was a long wait (we reached the hotel at 11am) we requested that we be allowed to leave our luggage. Luckily he agreed., So we left and returned only later in the evening. There was only one lift and that was so ancient just like everythinhg at the hotel. The room was smelling awful and looked very dull and unwelcoming. There was free wifi only in the lobby. The bathroom was only just adequate as the toilet seat was wobbly and almost broken. There was no kettle or microwave anywhere in the hotel. We just managed to survive for two nights only because it was conveniently located to the Pyke Marketplace ,space needle and the sea front. Luckily there were good restaurants and Starbucks close by . I will think twice before staying again at this hotel

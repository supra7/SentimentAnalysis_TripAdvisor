Myself, my sister and neice had booked to stay here from 6th November, we had read most of the reviews which all seemed favourable, so we took the chance. I have to be honest and say first impressions where not good, old and tatty came to mind. When we got to our room we were very concerned we had booked a pavillion room. This is over the car park, and it is like a 1960's massionette badly lit, the window looked out onto the walkway between rooms and the glass had wire imbedded into it, the room was also very small, even by british standards, and as 3 women we felt very vunrable and unsafe as this hotel is downtown and miles from the strip. We booked into circus circus that same night and left. When we went to check out, this was only one hour after checking in, not one question was asked as to why we where booking out, which i felt was very odd. Don't get me wrong i am not slagging the hotel or the staff off, I just felt that there were no reviews from the UK on the site, and maybe this is just not what we want from our visit to Vegas.

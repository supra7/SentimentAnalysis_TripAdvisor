Absolutely worst management I've ever had the misfortune to run across. Rude and appalling customer service. Great location but I would pay more to NOT stay here. Without going into particulars, this management and most everyone under them were mean, basically awful human beings who wouldn't know good customer service if they saw it. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I don't usually post bad reviews of places, but this is without a doubt the worst establishment I've ever dealt with and you would choose well to avoid it. Do not go unless you want your room to be barged into and get screamed at by security for a minor infraction. Checked out at 2 a.m. because these people were so completely inept and terrible.

This is a historic hotel with beautiful common areas, but at the time that the Palmer House was built, room sizes were much smaller than by today's standards. If you book through Priceline into this hotel or choose a standard room, you will find you have barely enough room to turn around (the only room I've seen smaller than this is the Paramount in NYC). I had friends books into larger rooms on higher floors, with eccentric features like TWO bathrooms for a one bed room, as for these larger rooms the hotel has simply knocked down a wall and combined two of these tiny cells into one. I could actually brush my teeth at the sink while sitting on the toilet in my bathroom. And the view was, because of the size and the age of the hotel combined with the lowest calibre room type, of an airshaft. Now that I know a little more about Chicago, I will be able to book a much larger and more comfortable room in almost every aspect elsewhere.

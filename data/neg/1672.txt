We have stayed at some of the top hotels in Hawaii - four seasons (big island) - awesome, Halekulani (Oahu) - the best, Grand Hyatt - (Kauai) amazing, Hyatt (Maui)  disappointing. We typically reserve three rooms on all of our trips 1 suite, 1 ocean front, 1 ocean view All three rooms at this hotel were comparable to a 2 star hotel, dirty showers, baseboards falling off, old wall paper coming loose, the list goes on and on. The breakfast was good but cost 25/pp the beach was nice and the grounds were well maintained. I understand they were going to be remodeling soon but unless its with bulldozers and dynamite I dont see it getting back to 5 star status.

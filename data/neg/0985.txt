Just finished my first stay at a W brand hotel and was very disapointed. The bathroom was dirty with visible mold/mildew on the grout on the tiled shower. We were stiffed on our bathroom toiletries. When I tried to call housekeeping to request the missing toiletries the phone in the room didn't work. The walls are thin (there must have been a party going on in the adjoining room). The bed was uncomfortable and there were no extra blankets (with a lighter weight than duvet) or pillows to use. Also $11 for a room service milkshake? Give me a break! If the hotel was fancy enough to warrant a milkshake that expensive that would be a wholly different story. Do yourself a favor and stay at the hyatt or Monaco for a much better experience. As an aside, I highly recommend the "Mod" pizza place around the corner, great pizza with great prices!

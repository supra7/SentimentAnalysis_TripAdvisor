This 'boutique' hotel is run by security guards...this was the most horrific hotel stay in my hundreds and hundreds of stays (obviously elsewhere). The hotel is run by security guards who will NOT let you in at 3 in the morning into the lobby mind you - when your key doesn't work for front door. If there is anything you need you have to deal with the front desk at the El Cortez main hotel...+ if you are checked in and need anything - like a working room key - there is no separate area for guest services - they make you stand in the regular check in line that can be very very long with one or 2 surley gals max at counter to help. The room: no drawers - apparently this is high style - have to live out of suitcase. no towel racks. no door on closet so you look at the ironing board et al always...reminiscent of motel 6. There is no one to help you. The maids are mean. room keys never work. Have to walk through + cross a really funky street and you are 'greeted' by a security guard outside and if lucky to get in a security guard inside...and these are rent-a- cops so no consistency like they would know you. Even when they do know you won't let you in building if key doesn't work. And lucky if the one elevator works. Oh and new policy - no blankets. They now add 2nd sheet for your warmth and comfort - hard to believe. No food. No anything but misery. Horrible. Worse than horrible. Oh and did I mention that I was escorted out by 3 security guards when checking out because my key didn't work after I popped down for a smoke while packing? What a story. And about smoking -- the only area designated is in the alley next to hotel without even a place to sit...except on an electrical box.

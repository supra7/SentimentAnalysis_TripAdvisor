Will never stay at this hotel again, sadly, as it had great potential as a brand new hotel right on the bay. Immediately felt nickel and dimed right from check-in. I was told I would be upgraded a room....but wasn't notified that it was more of an upsell rather than a nice touch. The bill included an extra charge for each night for the upgraded room. $13 a day for internet access that cycled not from day to day but rather 12 noon to 12 noon. So if you agreed to the fee at 11 am you'd have internet access for an hour, until noon, then you'd have to re-sign up again for another fee. They ended up waiving it but it was a complete pain to get in touch with someone to do so. Water? $3.50 just for the vending machine water-imagine what it is by room service! Need to print a document? 10 pages cost me upwards of $12. Want to get a drink by the pool? Good luck as the bar was never open even though they say it was. Finally, the map makes it look like the hotel is right across the street from the gaslamp, but it's deceiving as there's railroad tracks you have to cross-which requires a looooong walk to the crossing point. Want to use the fitness center? Be prepared to pay for that too. In fact-if you want to do anything other than open the door to your room it seems like there's a charge for it. Finally, I was double-charged for the stay on my credit card which took a huge undertaking to get corrected. They did correct it, but by this point I had spent so much time trying to correct and clarify things that I felt that I wasn't able to enjoy the hotel at all. A really disappointing stay in a hotel that could have otherwise great potential.

The Park Plaza is located at an excellent location in the heart of downtown Boston. Unfortunately from my room I could not see any of it. My 9th floor room was dark, small, and felt like I was stuck in a tiny, basement apartment. The view was facing towards an inside courtyard which features a full view of many rooms 20 feet across. The room received minimal light, even by mid-day. Also, the parking was $36 for the night which seemed outrageous. The week before I was in LA and they only charged $15 night for valet parking. If you stay here make sure they put in one of their decent rooms.

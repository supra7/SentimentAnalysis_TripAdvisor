This hotel really is in need of remodeling. Our experience staying there for our 30th anniversary made me cry. I was expecting a much cleaner and updated room. The staff always had a smile, but not always accommodating. They did not always let us know the truth about matters concerning the room. The first room was old and dirty. Second room was larger, but still old and stained. We loved the location and the service they provided. It was a real disappontment after booking our room 6 months in advance. I wish they would have been more accommodating.

My wife and I were two of the earliest to stay in this hotel. The hotel itself is pleasent and well situated, but I was extremely surprised to wake up with bite marks all over my legs! My wife's legs did not show any bites, but, as a doctor, I know the high dose Benadryl she was taking for allergies would diminish or wipe out her body's response to any bites. I took photos of the bite marks and sent them to their administration. I had initial conversation with their reps, but after that, I was essentially disregarded by them, not getting return phone calls despite repeated efforts. They showed little interest in the matter and didn't follow it up at all. My dermatologist friend confirmed that the bite marks are typical of bed bugs. I don't understand how a relatively new hotel could already have bed bugs. And if they did have bed bugs, how they could show such little concern about the matter. This place cannot be trusted when it comes to health matters. There was no show of consideration or compensation on any level, and this hotel isn't cheap, at least when it comes to them taking money from your wallet. I have had several other opportunities to chose hotels in LA since then, and have always avoided going back to this hotel given the horrible experience and their complete lack of acknowledgement of it. I can't stomach going back and they don't deserve the patronage. Be warned!

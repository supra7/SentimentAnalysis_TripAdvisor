Be sure NOT to stay at the Edgewater if you made reservations through Priceline. In fact, there are so many better hotels in Seattle. The front desk staff held an air of superiority, and seemed annoyed when tapped for information. The staff is very vocal about letting those around them know when Priceline customers arrive, and apparently, Priceline customers are not awarded rooms on the waterfront even if the hotel has plenty of rooms available. Instead, Priceline customers get the room with a garbage storage and parking lot view (see attached photos - I suppose you could consider this a water view!). It was very difficult to get 2 doubles, again, because we were Priceline customers. Parking is overpriced and inconsistent. For 8 hours, we paid $28 (visiting friends paid $5 for 13 hrs)- apparently, it makes a difference if you park during the day vs at night. If you have to stay at the Edgewater, park on the street for free at night, or in the parking garage across the street. Otherwise, the lobby decor is nice; their use of deconstructed trees as decor is unique. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, friendly waitors, but music is a bit loud and maybe too "modern." The rooms were well decorated, but very small and cramped- and very difficult to find plugs for electronics. The bathrooms are very nice- beautiful stone and glass walled showers- but inconvenient to have the closet in the bathroom when sharing with another person.

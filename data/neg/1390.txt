Beware if you you book this hotel as you will probably be eaten alive by Mosquitos as it is built next to mango swamps. The rooms are dark and disappointing for a five star hotel. The food is not as good as it should be and the premium drinks are completely watered down by the glass filled up with ice then mixed with pumped coke (very waterery) when asked for cans of coke most of the barmen refused at the lobby bar and was unavailable at the other bars. On the good side the beach is perfect and all the staff are very helpful and pleasant but after a time the contstant (it's my pleasure) when thanking members of staff for something they have done they repeat this and it starts to grate on you. If you wan't a five star hotel go somewhere else I have been to Mexico four times prior to this trip and all the other hotels have been of a much higher standard. Would I go back there NEVER.

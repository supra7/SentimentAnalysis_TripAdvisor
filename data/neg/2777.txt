the owners are upgrading with carpet, bedspreads, etc...But two lights had no bulbs, the other was broken, toilet paper holder was gone, concrete was crumbling, someone knocked on teh door at midnight and we feared for our safety, the bathroom area was just awful...it is just crumbling and frightening, but CHEAP! Still, do not stay here!!!

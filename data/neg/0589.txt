After last weekend I will think twice about staying at this hotel. Our reservation was made weeks ago,upon arrival we where informed that they had over booked the room a double queen. The hotel manager was accommodating and upgraded us to a suite for the second night. The desk clerk the second night at the time we checked out and checked in to the suite was rude,and tried to double our confirmed rate of 59.99 to 99.99 and charge us for the rollaway bed that the manager had,already said that there would not be any charge for. Will think twice about saying there again.

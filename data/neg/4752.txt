This hotel is in a tremendous location with restaurants, nightlife, beautiful neighborhoods and shopping all a short walk away. So, we were very optimistic about this hotel. Check in went well with very nice people assisting from the front door to the front desk. Unfortunately, when we got off the elevator and went to our room, we were hit by the smell of cigarette smoke. The smell was only slightly less prominent in our corner suite at the end of the hallway. We immediately called the front desk and asked if we had accidently been placed in a smoking room and could they move us. After several phone calls to the front desk we were told that the hotel was booked and the best they could do was refresh the room for us - which turned out to be a spray with Glade (which we held onto and frequently used over the weekend as the smoking continued in the rooms down the hall). Very disappointing. Fortunately, it was a beautiful weekend in Chicago and we minimized our time in the room. Other comments: stained carpets, old bathroom but very comfy bed.

There are times you just need a relatively inexpensive roof over your head in a convenient location. This fits that bill, but not much else. Feels very much like the old Days Inn it used to be. The lobby has certainly been cleaned up (isn't it always?), but the rest leaves a lot to be desired. Beat-up parking lot and stairs, gross pool area, generally dingy feeling from the moment you exit your car till you enter your room. Room was...a room. I don't say that in a hotel snob way, but I have seen plenty of budget places nowadays that do it much, much better. My room was cleanish and functional, with two key exceptions that you count on most: First, had a case of the classic motel A/C that's mounted under the front window and mainly blows behind the billowing curtain without actually cooling the room. I had to weight down the curtains with some shoes to avoid sweating all night. Second, the shower pulsed between hot and cold most of the time. Not ever scalding or freezing, but just enough to remind you that you wanted out as quickly as possible. I probably could have lived with all that, but the final nail in the coffin was the Buzzbrews 24-hour restaurant about 50 feet from the office. The restaurant itself is good, but be aware that it can draw the post-bar-closing crowd. My first of 3 nights (a MONDAY, not a weekend) was interrupted by a bunch of drunken "woo-hoo!"'s in our shared parking lot from 2:00 to 3:30 AM. If you value your sleep, that alone is reason enough to avoid this place and look elsewhere.

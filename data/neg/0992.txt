Not sure why so many people like this place. I was very disapointed, maybe that's because I'm used to the great service and great rooms at the Hotel 1000. Tried The W for wife's bday to find my room dirty (holiday Inn cleans their rooms better). The customer service was horrible. The front desk person was like a robott or on something. Kept asking me how I was doing

The Palmer House is a nice place to stay. Overall visit for 4 days was ok. Room service was pleasant and efficient. Maid service needed to be more thorough. Upon Check-in, we encountered blood spatters all over the wall and tiles in the bathroom. Maid came up and cleaned it right away. Upon taking a shower the next morning, we discovered more blood spatter all over the shower tiles. Upon notifying the hotel management, we were told there are no comment cards or formal complaints available at this time. We wrote the incident on a letterhead for the management. It is 4 days later and no apologies or responses from the management whatsoever. Upon being more attentive to the cleanliness of the room, we noticed minor oversites on the cleaning aspect - hair left in the shower, toothpaste marks on the mirror, a dirty towel re-folded and placed with the fresh towels...On the surface, everything looks wonderful and clean. Just be aware to check the cleanliness of your room if you plan to stay here.

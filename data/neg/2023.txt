I can't believe that such a nice smelling "5star" hotel didn't think about their acoustical insulation. A freight train that blows their whistle at 2am and continuus on blowing every 20-30 min kept me up all night. We stayed on the 29th floor thinking that we are too high up to hear it despise reading about the freight train problems from other reviewers. The front desk did nothing but to tell me that the trains don't give them their schedule but I don't understand why a schedule would help. They also said the engineer is "working on it".

I have stayed here before. It was OKAY, but I expected after the trumpeted 150 Milion renovation it would be better this time. Just the worst. My greatgrandparents used to stay here--maybe it was something then but it is nothing now. The Lobby is beautiful and the ceiling is not to be missed--but then run from this place. Phones don't work--for example, if you press the message button you get the director of food and beverage. The room service button didn't work either-you have to call the operator for everything and hope that they pick up. The rooms are TINY. I didn't need a remote control for the TV--I could use my toes! And the bathroom--well let's just say I have suits larger that that. I had a lovely view of a fireescape and could never tell if it was day or night. Yet it is packed with conventioneers. Maybe those are the folks that give it good reviews--I don't know-but I have been here twice in 6 months for about a week each time and it is awful.

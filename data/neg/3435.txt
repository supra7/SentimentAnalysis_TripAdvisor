This is not a four star hotel. The hotel was empty, deserted. Walking into the huge marble lobby there is what looks like an abandoned ballroom and an escalator that is NEVER working on the left side. The elevators - old and dirty and looks like spots on the floor. The room, again carpet and flooring old and dirty, with a olg, ugly, used and possibly never washed bedspread that I was afraid to get close to. There was one modern picture up on the wall- didn't help things, and dont call your hotel modern because you have one picture up. The alarm clock was from 1975, at best. The furniture which held the 1950's style TV had cubby holes for decor which had 3 misplaced items in them only over the whole thing. This place was just creepy and old. The only good thing is location - and these owners are milking that for all its got.

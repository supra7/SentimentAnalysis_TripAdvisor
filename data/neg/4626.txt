We arrived at 11 pm and after a long wait without explanation, there were no room available... And we had prepaid! Two "solutions": Have an upgrade but we had to pay or wait 1 hour to have a room cleaned. We chose the second one. We don't think they had to clean it but to absorb the water from the defective toilet of the room. Entering the bathroom during the night, we had our feet wet and saw the toilet the black tape that "repared" the toilet. No coffee machine, swimming pool closing at 8 or 9 pm. Long wait for the elevators. Don't park at the parking of the hotel but in the grant park parking! A little walk to spare 10$. Not the 4 stars worth!

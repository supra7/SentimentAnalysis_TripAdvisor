Stayed here and got our credit card information stolen by housekeeping. They do not take the cards anymore they scan your numbers and leave the cards so you don't know that they have gotten them.. Then after you leave they start to use the fake cards with your credit card numbers. Also housekeeping comes in your room with you in it that is when they do it your guard is down they come right in your room and you walk out and they are standing there. Also after day at Disney came back and found room door left open. Filed Police report and got no help also called property management group told them what happened and would never return calls. They make cards go to Home Depots, Lowes, and Best Buys and go through the self check out and buy loads of gift cards. If you look you will see that this is not the only bad review like this for this resort, they have a credit card theft issue at this resort.. DO NOT STAY HERE....They charged all together $15,000 on us....

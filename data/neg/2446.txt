We stayed here Bank Holiday Monday 29th Aug 2011 for one night and that was one night too much. I was travelling with a friend who has problems walking and uses walking sticks so we booked a disabled room with twin beds. We had also booked and paid the 10 for an early check to save us waiting around. We arrived at the travelodge at 1pm only to be told that our room was not ready and we would have to wait, i tried to explain that we had paid for an early check in only to be told that at this moment it wasnt possible (we were not offered our money back), i tried to explain that my friend could not stand for a long period of time due to diability but the very un helpful receptionist told us there was nothing she could do and we would have to wait. 2 hours later we finally got into our room, i told the receptionist that we would like a late check out the following day, she tried to charge me another 10 but i refused to pay saying that we had paid for an early check in which we did not receive so that money can pay for our check out. The room was larger than some previous travelodge we had stayed in but thwe carpet was wet by the bathroom and it hadnt been cleaned properly. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone, for the price we paid we would have expected better

I can say that the location on the beach was good, but the hotel is dated. The front desk was cordial;however, upon entering my room there was leftover bits of snacks on the floor (m&m, fritos, and paper). I decided to let that slide. I did see roaches the first day that I got there and I asked the front desk to please spray. This hotel may be fine for some;however, it was my first and last visit. Unless some significant changes are made, I would not go back, even if it was free.

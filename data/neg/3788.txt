Stayed here for 2 weeks (booked initially for 4). The location is still pretty much a building site across dubai internet city, next to street 611 in The Greens. The views are either onto the next block, the building site or Sheik Zayed Road - so not really appealing. We booked a 1 room apartment - the pictures of the hotel on their web site are for real: the rooms are soo dark, you have to have the lights on during the whole day. The airco was so noisy and windy, that we had to turn it off to prevent headaches. The room service was ok, they even cleaned the dirty dishes. If you have to stay on a budget (around 16,000AED per month) and don't mind looking on a building site/busy street, it might be ok

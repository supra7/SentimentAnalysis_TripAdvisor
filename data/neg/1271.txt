The place is hugely overpriced and mis-managed. Better places to stay are the Hilton or Radisson, both of which are in the same airport area. I arrived and had to walk down endless corridors before finding out my key did not work. Finally got another room, other people's hairs in the bathtub. Gross, small, old-school and pricey. Yuk!

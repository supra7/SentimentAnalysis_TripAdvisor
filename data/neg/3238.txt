Rooms are really small with hardly any space to walk through. If you put your big suitcase, its hard to walk in the room. Almirah is small enough to hold only 3 hangers and bathroom is also small. During my stay I was shifted to a bigger room upon my request and in this room, plus point was that the room size was bit bigger than previous, I could free walk but it doe snot have an almirah, so you have to hang your clothes on the wall hanger. In this room, bathroom gets even more smaller. Internet is paid for and very expensive. Room has got hair dryer, toiletries, tea/ coffee making machine. Only plus point is that it is walking distance to NUS and bus stop is at doorstep from where you get direct bus to Vivocity, Orchard. There are cheap restaurants and Javanese masaage parlours at walking distance (did I mention hotel does not have a restaurant?) Verdict: Very expensive compared to amenities. Try booking engines to book at cheaper rates

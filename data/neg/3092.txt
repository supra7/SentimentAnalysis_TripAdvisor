We have stayed in many Barcelo hotels but this one is very below par, cleaning of rooms not done untill 5pm had to wait to get back to room. Bar very poor service lots of dirty glasses no stock in bars. Area of Barcelona where you are surrounded by East block prositutes, hence the security man in entrance hall who is trying to keep them out. Very off hand staff, not helpfull at all. Advertises swimming pool on roof which is no bigger then a bath.

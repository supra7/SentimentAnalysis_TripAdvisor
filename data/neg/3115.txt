We stayed for 3 nights prior to a cruise. Because we arrived before 2.00pm our room was not ready - that was fine except, being made to pay for storage of our luggage until it was. I consider that a stay of 3 nights warrants free storage of luggage!! The breakfast has plenty of selection but as has been previously commented on, is lukewarm and soggy AND expensive. The room we had on floor 4 was not spacious but ok, was dark and gloomy looking onto a inner centrum of walls and windows. Very uninspiring and miserable. However it was spotlessly clean. As has also been said, the location is perfect for getting around. Trains and buses all within a stones throw. Would I stay again or recommend - no. You will find better and more exciting accommodation for the same money.

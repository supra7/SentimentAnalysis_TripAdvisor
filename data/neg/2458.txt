Booked this Hotel for my parents coming over form Germany beginning June for three nights. Had previously stayed at the Travelodge in Sydney, Australia and as my experience there was positive, assumed that we'd get good honest, inexpensive accomodation in London too. Hotel was much too basic though. Starts when one enters the premises, very small reception! (even portered appartment buildings seem to keep more space for their porter) - and only one receptionist. Waited in cue quite a while (I guess had we know they would not ask for passports we could have used the Automatic Check-in Kiosk) Room was not tiny, but small and fitted out VERY basic, at least clean and tidy. My mum was pretty shocked that there was NO soap at all in the bathroom, no dispenser, no small piece of hand soap (Travelodge argue on their website that most people bring their own toiletries, but I have not met anyone yet that carries their own handsoap?!?!). Room was booked as a double room and there was only one towle in the room. The duvet, was quite thin. To their credit when asked for another blanket and a 2nd towel they came through friendly and quickly - which still did not get rid of the intial stench of stingyness. Travelodge is advertised as a budget Hotel, but they did e.g. charge GBP 100.00 for the Saturday night my parents stayed there. Most unsettling my parents found the experience of checking out. They had a late flight and had assumed that they'd be able to leave their luggage for a bit with reception. They were confronted with the reply that reception was not allowed to take luggage, but were told there is a luggage hold at Euston Station next door (GBP 8.00 per bag btw). I interpret it the way that instead of usuing enough room for a fully functioning reception, they rather built three more rooms to maximise profits. They may get away with itas London is so busy and expensive, but me or my family will surely not stay there again.

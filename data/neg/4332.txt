I am really shocked at some of the treatment we received while staying at the hotel for a wedding. You'd think that hotel management would make sure it's staff treats everyone with respect, but especially when someone picked their hotel as the recommended place to stay for a wedding. Hotel staff was generally uninformed about event details even though the bride provided them with all the information and travel gifts for her guests (which weren't delivered in a timely fashion). Hotel security was lacking. Guests with the wedding had to actually leave the bar area one night and go somewhere else to avoid some rude random customer who eventually started a fight and was arrested. I can't say for a fact, but I don't think he was even a hotel guest. Regardless, is this a Hyatt Regency or Moe's Tavern? And the icing on the cake was when the bride's computer was stolen while in possession of hotel staff. As if that wasn't bad enough, hotel management has not offered to reimburse her for her stolen property or done anything more than offer an apology. Unfortunately service and value are everything in the hotel industry, especially in this economy. If all you care about is a comfortable bed then I guess this will do. For me I demand more for my money. The value is just not there for Hyatt Regency Boston.

We had booked and paid for our March vacation at the Eldorado back in Sept,and phoned the Eldorado directly two weeks before our arrival to confirm our reservation for this hotel. Upon arriving to check in we were told that they were sold out and had no room at the Eldorado. If we booked and paid 6 months in advance how could they have no room for us? They tried to move us to a hotel that was quite a drive from the main Kaanapali strip. The manager was not helpful to us and suggested they had made a "mistake". Well while we were in their lobby for about 20 minutes they seem to have made that same "mistake" to quite a few people as they were turning others as we were in their lobby. I was furious that they would ruin our vacation this way, which was also our 25 year anniversary celebration. We had also stayed here on our honeymoon so this was to be a very special stay for us. We had to find another hotel on our own, with no assistance from the staff...we even had to ask to use their phone to call other hotels. In spite of it being spring break we were very lucky to get the last room at another hotel....otherwise our trip would have certainly been ruined....at great expense. I also found a post on the Tripadvisor forum that someone else had flagged this as a bait and switch operation some time ago.

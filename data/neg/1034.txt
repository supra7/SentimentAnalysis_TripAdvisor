The motto of this hotel is "Whatever, Whenever". This claim of exceptional service is the reason that the W is very highly priced. Our family checked in late on a Sunday night, and asked for an extra blanket. After 4 phonecalls to the "Whatever, Whenever" line, and 80 minutes, the blanket arrived in our room. On our 2nd phone call which was 45 minutes after we requested the blanket, the assistant manager with whom we spoke said that she would follow up on the blanket and call us right back. She did not. In the middle of the night our message light started blinking (although we were not on the phone and did not receive any phone calls). In the morning my husband called to retrieve the message, and was told that we did not have one. The message light continued to blink. Later, at about 9am, I called to try to retrieve the message, but after 30 rings with no answer, I gave up. I called the manager on duty to express my dissatisfaction with the service. He was apologetic, but did not offer to compensate us in any way, for example by waiving the $31 parking fee. Since our return home, we received an automatic email asking for our comments on our stay. I replied with the information herein. I have received no response from either this hotel or the W chain. From this set of experiences, I would conclude that the W is not at all interested in traveller satisfaction. We will never stay at a W again!

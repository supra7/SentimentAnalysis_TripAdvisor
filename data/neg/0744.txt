Old property that is just worn out. Needs a major renovation, buildind has major creaking problems in the Seattle winds. Location is central. If you have to stay here get a top floor view so you can see the views. Best thing about the hotel is the concierge from Mauai. He is the best concierge I have ever seen. Can make it happen in a second! What an asset to that property.

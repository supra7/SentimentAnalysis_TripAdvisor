Just got back from a business trip and stayed at the Park Plaza. I travel often for business and have received better service from far less fancy places. Problems: - got to the hotel late after flying from the West Coast. No one at the front desk. Waited. Waited. Someone finally showed up. - Get up to my room, it's late and I'm starving. Call down to room service. Phone rings...and rings...and rings...and no one picks up. - Say OK, I'll wait till breakfast. Go into the bathroom -- about the size of a closet. - Lay down, turn on the TV -- can't get any channels (full of fuzz) -- mess with the wires in back to try to fix nothing helps. Then, after 5 mintues of barely watching the Olympics thru the fuzz, it cuts out completely. - Go down to the concierge desk in the morning to report the TV problem. Leave for the day on meetings. - Get back to my room at 8pm. Try the TV -- still doesn't work. I call the front desk...phone rings...and rings...and rings...and no one picks up. Never again. I paid over $280 for that room and will not be staying there again.

I checked in with myself and my 15 year old niece. I was told they were sold out and I got the last room. We were sent to our 5th floor room to find the elevator opened to an outside "motel like" area. The hallways were dark and noisy. Once we got to our room, we were frankly scared to leave and go back into the dark hallway. The room was creepy and very old, needed renovating. I immediately called a near casino that I knew would cost a bit more but I knew would be safe. I dont know how the El Cortez had received rave reviews in the past???? When I went to check out they finally offered me a different "safer" room. It was too late to save me as a guest as I had requested an upgraded room at check-in and was denied.

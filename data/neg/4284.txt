My husband and I enjoyed the location of the hotel, but encountered poor service, which we have never encountered at other Hilton Hotels, where we have stayed at in the U.S. Except for one young lady, who handled our check-in, the reception desk people were impolite and unfriendly. But the worst service came from the hotel's own concierge: She was condescending and downright rude to us, when we asked her information about the city tours. Naturally, we pledged never to return to this Hilton Hotel again.

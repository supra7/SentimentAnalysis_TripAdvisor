The Park Plaza is a beautiful hotel - we were in town for a conference for five days. Conference rooms were spacious and well groomed. Tech staff was outstanding, bell staff was great. That's the good - I tried for over a month to add a day to my reservation, finally the day before I traveled I was told I could get a room but it was on the Concierge Level and $400 a night - I had few choices so went forward. The room was tiny, hardly worth double what I paid for the regular room I had the remainder of my stay. In addition, the hotel appeared to have a number of empty rooms as many of my colleagues changed rooms at least once that day. I moved to my regular room on Day 2 - it was huge - much nicer than the $400 room. It had 2 bathrooms which was strange but great! The concierge staff wasn't helpful - regularly gave wrong or incorrect information to me or my friends. We asked the concierge for an Italian Restaurant that was casual, served stuff like brick oven pizza. They provided us a reservation which was nice was for a fancy Italian Restaurant - exactly what we didn't want. The service at the hotel cafe was wretchedly awful - we were ignored by the wait staff for nearly 30 minutes. We finally simply had the salad bar - never got a beverage, simply awful. When we asked one of the "waiters" a question he grunted and walked away. There was a scary fire alarm in the middle of the night which was worse than a "Chinese Fire Alarm" Very poorly run by the hotel staff who were heard saying, "This happens about once a month or so." For the $200 plus spent each night - spending an additional $11 on the internet makes me crazy! The maids knocked on the door each morning before 9am - I would have put a do not disturb sign out but didn't have one in the room. Temperature controls in the room were nice to have but they didn't work - Skip this hotel - not worth the $$$$$

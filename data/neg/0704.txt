This place was terrible just as many of the reviewers on Tripadvisor indicates. The last couple of reviews looks like it was written by hotel staff since they are the exact opposite of the real experience. From the low quality toiletries to the inconsistent house keeping this property should be rated a 3 star. Attempts are made to give the property a unique look but it only succeeds in making you gag from the incredibly poor taste in which everything is decorated. It almost seems like a big joke that everyone else is in on except for you. The hotel is noisy, the rooms tiny, the decor ugly, the staff is average, it is isolated from the rest of Seattle, the view is overrated, the nearby train is noisy, and the room stinky. The lounge had expensive $10 drinks and a good view but absolutely no character. After experiencing the boring lounge we decided not to bother with the restaurant and instead cabbed it into the city for food. I recommend using Tripadvisor and pick a 4 star hotel out of the top twenty instead of being foolish like we were and pay the consequences. In fact, you can probably pick a highly rated 3 star hotel and still fare ten times better than we did.

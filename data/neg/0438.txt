The Renaissance Seattle tries to pass itself off as a first-rate facility, but it is not. The hotel was renovated in the not-too-distant past, but it still has the atmosphere of a gloomy, 1970s-era concrete bunker. Desk staff were reasonably friendly, but totally unknowledgeable, even of facilities in their own hotel. The rooms were less than spotless, and the hallways were literally strewn with dishes, glasses, trays, etc. that went unretrieved by hotel staff for about 12-16 hours at a time during our stay. Although we were staying on a non-smoking floor, the hallways also reeked of cigarette smoke for some reason. I found my bed incredibly uncomfortable -- the mattress was hard as a rock. Even worse, when we checked in, desk staff did not inform us that one side of the hotel faces the I-5 highway and is **incredibly** noisy, even 20 stories up, even with the window shut, even in the middle of the night. Needless to say, we got very little sleep. Had I known this, I would have requested a room on the other side of the hotel -- but better staff would have automatically tried to be accommodating, where possible. Parking, not surprisingly, was excessively expensive. In short, our stay was little short of terrible. I would recommend this hotel to my worst enemy -- no one else. Mediocrity, thy name is Renaissance!!

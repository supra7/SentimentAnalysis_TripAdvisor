The room was very clean and comfortable. Aesthetically, it was extraordinarily pleasing. However, I was incredibly disappointed with all the technical problems. As soon as I checked in, the woman at the desk had trouble with the room key. She also assured me that I didn't need a credit card to check in, but did NOT tell me about that she would charge a deposit. According to the concierge, "some" rooms had free internet while others charged $13. Mine was the latter. I also failed to realize that they were charging $4 for a small bottle of water when I assumed it was complimentary. Although I obviously am willing to pay for convenience (as I paid for the $42 to park in their garage), I felt the entire time that I was being tricked into paying charges that I was unaware of. I have yet to get my deposit back so who knows what will be on there!

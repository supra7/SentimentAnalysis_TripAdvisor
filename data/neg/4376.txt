I booked this hotel on the basis of price and other good comments. I did not have a good experience. On arrival in spite of having paid up front a month in advance I was told there was no room avavilable for me so I was taken to a supposedly same standard hotel around the corner. It was not the same standard and i turned down all the three rooms I was offered. Returning to the Meddusa i was told to come back in an hour and spent an anxious time wondering where i was going to stay. On my return I was given room 101. This room had no view apart from the yard of the next door building. There was intermittent noise from some sort of ventilation system. There was no way of turning on the remote control. I asked and was eventually given a remote control. When you opened the door to the landing you were immediately hit by the smell of smoke from the lobby. On the plus side the location is excellent and the room clean. the view from the roof terrace was good., and the breakfast adequate. i did not find the staff friendly and in fact found them quite intimidating. I would not book this hotel again

Dont trust the people who run this hotel!! Booked a room through TravelStay.com just over 3 months in advance. On the morning of our arrival they telephoned my home address to see if I still wanted the booking. Yes i replied. On reaching the hotel I was told by the receptionist that my room was already taken and that because they didnt want to lose my custom, they had booked me into another hotel just around the corner. the receptionist led us there. She took us down into the basement where the room was located. It smelt of urine and body odour, the light fitting was hanging off the ceiling, the windows and mirrors hadnt ever seen a cloth, the bedding stank of body odour etc etc... To put the smell problem right, the receptionist went back to the LISA COURT HOTEL and returned with some air freshener which she promptly sprayed around the corridor, the room and then into the carpet!!! Unbelievable..Having read the reviews on TravelStay I was looking forward to a clean and pleasant stay, not to be led to a hovel round the corner.

I have tried a lot of different boutique hotels in New York, usually downtown, and have never been disappointed... until now. The East Houston hotel already looks dated, very loud (both from the traffic outside and the out-of-control ventilation system in the hotel which makes it feel like you're sleeping in a construction site). The "complimentary breakfast" is a joke, served in a soul-less basement with paper plates and cutlery, stale bagels and teacher's lounge coffee canisters. Basically, it feels like a downtrodden youth hostel for a price of a very nice hotel. The only points are for location.

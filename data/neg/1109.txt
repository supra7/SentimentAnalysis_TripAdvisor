Stayed here for a night on the way back from Hawaii on a very short layover with my family of five. Arrived around 9 and the shuttle service was the best part about the stay. Very convenient, friendly driver and quick ride from airport. Check-in took a while since everyone getting off the shuttle checks in at once. We reserved a "family room" that had a room with two double beds and a connecting room with a king bed, but only one bathroom. Room was a great size but this is an older property and our room was at the very end of a series of hallways and confusing walkways and elevators to reach; I'm guessing one of the older rooms. It had a stale smell and was in need of renovation both in the rooms and bathroom. Bed comforters looked old and dirty. Went down to the restaurant to eat, since we hadn't eaten dinner and kids were starving. Even though we arrived toward the end of their posted hours you could tell they didn't want to serve us and we were not welcomed warmly. Food was ok. Bar area hopping, but kids not allowed to eat in the bar area. Shuttle back to airport for early morning flight was again perfect. Would not stay at this hotel again unless it was needed for a very short overnight stay. I'm sure there are better properties in the area.

I recently stayed at this downtown hotel, over the labor day weekend. Upon arrival, we were quickly greeted and assigned a room, despite being early. This was great and we were thankful. However, after parking the car in the garage attached to the hotel and paying 38 dollars per night for the service, our car was broken into. Unfortunately, we did not find out about the break-in until Sunday afternoon. After speaking with someone from the garage, a police report was filled out. Nothing further could be done, due to the garage manager being off for the long weekend. I proceeded to speak to the hotel manager, Sean. He refused to do anything to help me or compensate me for my situation. Upon insistance, he did refund the price of the parking, but would do nothing else other than offer a beer. I assume the alcohol was to make me forget what had happened. I live 6 hours away from the hotel and know nothing about the area or possible places to have the window replaced. He would do nothing to help, but argue it was not the hotels responsibility and I parked there at my own risk. I later found out 3 other cars had been broken into that day. He knew nothing of this and insisted it was my problem to work out with the garage...that he says they dont own, but their name is all over and they charge guests to use. The following morning, I spoke to another staff, who did find an extremely kind custodian to clean out the broken glass from my car, but I drove home without a window. Luckily, it didnt rain. I would never stay at this hotel again, due to the poor service I received and lack of compassion by the management staff. Further, if crime is such an issue at that garage, they should warn guests prior to them checking in. The garage staff informed me that break-ins were very common and happened almost daily.

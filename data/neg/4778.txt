Was here for a conference. They had the gall to charge me $50 for access to wifi in the conference rooms for 2 days, and if I wanted access in my room, I'd have to pay another wifi charge. Talk about double dipping. Their tech support is horrible and they had me on hold more than 1/2 hour. Toilets didn't work. Room service for a simple snack took over an hour. The conference room didn't even have charges at the tables for laptops. The manager wouldn't waive the wifi charges not even given that my company is a big supporter of this chain. The decor in the hotel is very dated...something out of the late 80s and early 90s. Staff except tech support is eager to please, if not particularly helpful. The gym has modern equipment, but the pool is small. Might feel different if I was here on travel other than business, but do not recommend this hotel for business.

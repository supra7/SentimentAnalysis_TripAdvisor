Disappointing but not terrible WE stayed three nights in a Petite Studio at $140 a night, which was a reasonable price comparatively. The room was very small, which we expected, and stylishly furnished. We found the staff to be very efficient and friendly.On the down side, the worst thing about the hotel was the area. Not being from Sydney, we didn't realise Potts Point (or Kings Cross) is as bad as it really is. The hotel is smack in the middle of the red light district and, although we like some urban grunge, the drug activity is scary and right in your face. We didn't feel safe walking around after dark. The second major complaint we had was the shower. It's hard to believe a hotel could have such a poor hot water system. In the end, I only used the hot tap for showering and the temperature alternated between hot and freezing cold. My partner didn't have any luck either.There were a few other disappointments worth mentioning. 1) There was a black pillow on our bed which was filthy dirty. I put it aside so it could be changed with the other linen but the next day it appeared again on our bed- just as dirty.2) Our room was on the ground floor and quite noisy. We got woken up, not just by outside noise, but noise from the lobby and corridor (like people vacuuming outside our door early in the morning).All of that said, our stay was okay and not terrible. THe price was quite reasonable compared to others we looked at. We did look at moving hotel but there was no vacancy where we wanted, so in the end we decided it was easier to stay.

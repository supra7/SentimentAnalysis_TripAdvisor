We were sent there after being bumped from OCC Allegro Playacar....I don't know why this is becoming so common but it sucks.... As nice as this place is it isn't what we were looking for and how dare these resorts assume what we want to spend our money on. OK in saying all that..... this hotel was ok for, it certainly wasn't the beach at all we were looking for, and everyone is so right about the pool service...NONE EXISTENT ....It really didn't seem right to have to walk to far to get a drink or wait an hour for a warm beer. The staff tried very hard and seemed to be always trying to please. We were friends travelling together so we weren't asked to attend the time share meetings which made me very happy. Over all this place is not for us at all we did like the Fisherman's the sister resort....we were never picked up when were suppose to so we did pay for our own taxi's to and from once or twice....the last return taxi was at 5pm.... we really enjoyed the food at the Fisherman's so most nights we wanted to eat there we had to pay for our own ride back. The shop in the resort is not at all very nice by any means the lady that was working wouldn't let us put a charge to her room because she said it was too much work...so we went to the bank machine outside the store doors and got some money, and then she said she couldn't sell it to us because it would take all her change...we did tell her that this is all the money we had because we just took it out of the bank machine...so she very reluctantly gave us the change and kept complaining the entire time....UNREAL!!! There were a few of us that had a few experiences with this lady that ran the store.... If we didn't have the other hotel to go and visit I would have been really upset about this trip....not a place I would recommend.

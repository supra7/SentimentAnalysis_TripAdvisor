I stayed at The Chicago South Loop Hotel for a conference so most of the time was spent outside of our room. However the times that we were in the hotel we weren't necessarily greeted with the best customer service. At check in the attendant wasn't knowledgeable of basic check in procedures. During our stay, when we called for room service to clean the room or to replenish an item, we never received this service. And at check out, I had such a problem with the hotel worker that I missed my ride to the airport. It was absurd, appalling, and kind of sad because I hoped better for this new hotel. In all, if you don't expect much like working irons, mirrors, clean rooms or friendly customer service --- and just need a place to rest your head --- then this may be the hotel for you! Oh yeah, up and coming neighborhood means that the public housing project across the street is in the process of being torn down. It is not safe at all to be in this area at night, this is what we were told by a local campus security officer who gave us a ride to our destination after we thought it was safe to walk 5 blocks north.

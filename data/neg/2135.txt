I do not typically write reviews but my experience at Hacienda Tres Rios from 11/6 to 11/13 is worth a comment,,,TERRIBLE! I have been traveling to Mexico twice a year for the past 20 years and this was undoubtably the worst experience I have ever had. Upon landing in Cancun and being told transportation would be waiting for us at the airport to take us to the resort we waited 3 hours {with many phone calls to the resort). We ended up taking a taxi that was being shared with other travelers to other resorts. Our arrival at the resort was delayed an additional hour because of this. Upon arrival at the resort we were again delayed access to our rooms until we listened to a 30 minute presentation about the hotel. Though we paid for a 2 bedroom suite we were given two separate rooms with an adjoining door. When we questioned this we were told it was a computer glich, though we had our copy of the confirmation, and there was nothing they could do to help us. The service in the restaurants was very pleasant and there were a couple of real bright stars who seemed to really enjoy there job. The service at the pool was always questionable...and sometimes down right rude, like they were doing us a favor...Though management seemed to be around they did not seem to have a purpose except to walk by rapidly as though they were really busy. The front desk was unhelpful in all respects from answering the phone to providing any information about anything. All in all it was a very poorly run, expensive resort! Tough I will continue to travel to Mexico, as I love the country and the people, I will not be returing to Tres Rios nor will I ever recommend it to anyone.

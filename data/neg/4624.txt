We will NEVER stay at this hotel! The staff were rude! They gave us a queen bed and asked us if we wanted to update to king bed if we pay $40 extra. Unbelievable! The bathroom was a joke! Very small! Very inconvenient! Also, there were hairs on the bathroom floor :(. There is no closet, iron, or minibar in the room. This hotel cannot be compared to Hilton Hotel in Chicago, where we stayed previously and were very happy! It does not deserve these stars. Although it is closer to downtown compared to other Hilton, I would rather stay somewhere else!

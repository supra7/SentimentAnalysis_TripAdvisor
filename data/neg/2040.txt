Stayed one night on a personal trip with my wife and the hotel is immaculate which was great but to be expected from a 5 star hotel. Problem was the service. The morning we woke up we noticed there was no regular coffee, only decaf. We called the front desk and was on hold for over 5 minutes. When we finally spoke to someone and asked for someone to bring up the coffee it took 40 minutes!! I actually thought they forgot and since we were about ready to leave, I didn't bother to call back. They don't have parking so you need to valet and we waited nearly 25 minutes for our car to arrive. Some other shortcomings include the toilet paper being equivalent to sand paper, the $15 resort fee and a $7 charge to use the internet not including a charge to print! You would think the resort fee would cover that. 5 star, $350+ night room and you are nickel and diming me for 5 minutes on the web to print out my boarding pass?? Sorry, can't recommend this hotel with that level of service.

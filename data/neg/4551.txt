While the lobby of this hotel are beautiful, the rooms are TINY. Our tub was dripping all night, the bed was super uncomfortable and had a huge dip in the middle. The room was not very clean. There WiFI is $15 per day, and the fitness room is also an extra charge. I've stayed in Best Western hotels better than this. Don't be fooled by the outer appearance, the rooms are horrible.

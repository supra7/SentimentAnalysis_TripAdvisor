I stayed at this hotel one night in the summer. The rooms are dated and noisy. I think they had one of those bath-fitters bathrooms put in. No view, no charm; just really a in need of renovation. The location is pretty good near many eateries and bars. Spend your time out in the city, not in the room of this place.

I made the awful mistake of trusting a third party's rating of this hotel as a four-star property. I stay in four-star hotels regularly, and this hotel is not one of them. Sure, the lobby is spectacular and well-maintained, but once you exit this sanctum, beware! First of all, there was a line to check into the hotel even though were only a few guests waiting to do so. Why? Because this is a massive property and they only had 2 people at the front desk. For a hotel this size, there should have been several clerks. Second, the king-size beds were all taken, so I was forced to take a room with a queen-size bed. Fine, but the bed was not queen-sized. I measured it, and it was 54", which makes it only a full-sized bed. When I told the front desk person this, she argued with me, until she finally agreed to give me another room. The room I was given did in fact have a queen-sized bed, but the overall room was still quite small. I had to turn sideways to walk past the bed, and the bathroom was microscopic. Third, this place is dirty and in bad repair. The elevators are scratched and chipped, as is the signage pointing you to your room once you exit the elevator. The feeling is one of decaying grandeur, as if you are entering something advertised as a castle but which the royals abandoned a hundred years ago. Fourth, this place just has no class. When I checked in, I was told I had a package waiting for me. But in order to get it, I would have to hurry up to the business center on another floor. So I ran up there, and then was told to pay $5 to retain my package. And it was big and heavy, and I was just left to carry it all the way to my room, which was quite a distance in this huge hotel. Beware! This place has a five star lobby, but the stars start to fall from the sky as soon as you step beyond the gildred entrance to this hotel!

Marriott has been my favorite brand, but this one is not one that I will return to. Because of our Marriott Rewards status, we were upgraded to the Concierge Level. However, the Concierge Lounge is closed all day on Saturday, the day we arrived, and doesn't open on Sunday until 5:30 PM. Our room, meanwhile, was on the back of the hotel facing the air handlers and exhaust units that ran all night. This is how Marriott treats its highest reward point members? I think that we will start staying at Hilton properties instead. BTW, I was also turned off by the $13.95/day charge for Internet access. What part of "Concierge Level amenities" don't these people understand? Thanks, Marriott Seattle, for a most unforgettable Concierge room experience.

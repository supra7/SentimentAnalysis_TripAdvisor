Do not be disappointed, this is not 4 stars! While the other reviews are technically accurate regarding the pool, etc., they do not give you the feel that the chairs are packed in so tight you cannot get to the pool and will be sitting on top of other guests. There was slides but my 8 and 10 year old kids did not use them as they are weak. Do not plan on getting any benefits from your Hyatt Passport either. Do to the hotel being full we did not get the room type reserved, the restaurants were very slow and food was okay for a day or so. However, they do not really have an order off the menu breakfast other than in the buffet...makes no sense. The other buffet is down by the pool, but food is largely the same as the other buffet with less selection. While the hotel is on the water there is little beach. The beach is much better down by the Westin and you can catch catamaran sail tours by the nicer restaurants at Whalers Village. The beds in are terrible. Many in the reviews seem to love them? They are 6" off the floor mattress only on a wood platform with a foam topper! Cheap and uncomfortable if you are normal size. Managers not helpful either. I could go on but chalk this up to lesson learned. Pick the better brands and read between the lines of what is not said in the reviews.

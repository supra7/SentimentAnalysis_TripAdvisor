When I checked in, the hallway and room smelled of smoke. Perhaps I should have complained then as I received a call from manager of the hotel a couple hours later accusing me of smoking in the room. I explained the situation to him and thought it was settled. Unfortunately when I checked out several days later, the hotel added a smoking charge to the bill. I asked to speak to the manager who was very rude and said he would not remove the charge. I asked him to go up to the room with me to see himself if the inside of my room was smoke filled. He refused and started yelling at me. I have never been treated so rudely by management and I travel on business at minimum 4 days out of every week. I would recommend that no one stay here!

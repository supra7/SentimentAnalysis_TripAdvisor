Our travel agent booked 2 nights by mistake instead of one. We cancelled the one night within 24 hrs however to this date we have not received the refund even though the hotel manager assured us in Sept. 2009 it would be coming. Also, someone tried our door at 4:00 a.m., the construction stated at 7:00 am, so it was not a great night. It was a continental breakfast only, so not very good for the money spent. Our friends stayed at a cheaper hotel with much better results.

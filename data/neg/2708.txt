Hotel is undergoing major renovations but not to the rooms. They have not been updated in nearly 40 years. A wrecking ball has taken out most of the first floor of the property and you will need to enter the hotel through a scafolding stairwell. Good news the elevator is now working and the rooms are clean but just old. Ours was missing a curtain on one window and was on a very noisy main road. The photos on the website were very misleading and it was not what we expected. Checked out asap.

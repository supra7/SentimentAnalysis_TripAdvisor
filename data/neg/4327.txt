We recently spent a weekend at the Hyatt Regency with our 2 small children. We got a great deal on the room using Priceline, so price was not an issue. However, for a hotel listed as a 4-star property it was not what we were expecting. In general, the hotel needs updating. The lobby and elevators are very dark and tired looking. Location - while it is within walking distance to Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market and other attractions, the hotel is virtually in Chinatown and right on the edge of Downtown Crossing. We were not comfortable walking back to the hotel after dark with our small children. Inconvenient for parents traveling with kids - it is not easy to get in and out of the hotel, especially if you are using a stroller. You have to take a roundabout route and 2 separate elevators to get from the street level to your room. The rooms are not very big - we could barely maneuver around the 2 double beds and had to move furniture around in order to set up the Pack N Play for our youngest to sleep in. Also of concern: our room was on the 21st floor and when you get off the elevator there is an open walkway to the guest rooms that looks down to several floors below. The railing had gaps large enough for a child to squeeze through, very dangerous! Paperthin walls - this was our biggest complaint! All of the rooms are adjoining, and there is no soundproofing. We did not sleep a wink thanks to the foot stomping going on us above us, the gentleman next door blaring ESPN Sportcenter at midnight, and the drunken couple in the other room next to us having very loud intercourse at 3am! Maybe this hotel is sufficient for business travelers during the week, but we did not have a pleasant stay and will be staying somewhere else on our next visit to Boston.

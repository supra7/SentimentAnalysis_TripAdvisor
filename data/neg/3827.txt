June 26th-June 28th. We have stayed at this hotel every time we have come to Baltimore. It has always been a great getaway, and we always look forward to our stay there. Our last stay was awful. The Front Desk girl that was there was very hospitable. We arrived 5 hours before check in time, and she still found us a room right away. She was very kind, and always willing to help out with whatever we needed. She made us dinner reservations, and even brought our bottle of wine to our room. The housekeeping staff could not understand a word that we said... and we had left things on the dresser and in the bathroom when we went out for the day and everything was moved around when we came back. It took me a few minutes to find my lotion that I had left out. We did not have the room type that we wanted. It said we had a Harbor View room, and when we arrived, our reservation said Garden View. The Front Desk agent apologized profusely and she changed it back to what we originally reserved. Upon check out, I asked for the hotel managers card, so I could call him and explain my concerns. I left a message on his voice mail the next day, and I still have not heard back. I did not want to resort to putting this on here... but seeing as no one has contacted me, I feel it is my last resort. It is a shame that we had a bad experience. I hope to maybe return one day in the future, and have it be like it was every other stay besides the last.

We stayed here for one night instead of having the family do the 2am shuttle service thing. We had an early morning flight and thought we'd just overnight and hop over to the airport. This property is okay. Check-in was easy, as was check-out, but other than that - it was just okay. Our bed was super soft, which was awful. Our pillows were mushy - like sleeping with a cotton ball. My neck ached in the morning. I had some weird bug fall on my chest as I was getting ready for bed - I don't know where it came from, but my husband had to calm me down as I was freaking out. I think we're done staying at Radisson's. We're never impressed.

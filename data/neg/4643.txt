I am a Hilton Honors Gold VIP member, who has never had any problems at a Hilton brand hotel. In a recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton, my vehicle was damaged by the valet. After various contacts with InterPark (the valet subcontractor), they refused to take responsibility. I have also contacted Hilton (brand) and the Palmer House (directly to the General Manager Dean Lane via email and US Mail). Neither has taken responsibility (the GM wont even contact me back). I feel that it is unacceptable for a customer of the Palmer House (or any Hilton hotel) to be treated in this manner. I will NEVER valet my vehicle again and am considering never returning to any Hilton brand hotels in the future.

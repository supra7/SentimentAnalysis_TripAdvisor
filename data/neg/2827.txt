Outside of the hotel looked decent, lady at the front desk was nice and helpful (the pool was closed for cleaning but they notified us as soon as it opened so my 5 year old could go swimming). At first glance, room looked clean and was a nice size...2 queen beds, fridge, desk, couch etc. BUT....the couch, blankets on the beds, and carpet were wet, not soaking, but very very damp..the room was so humid and musty/sticky that I put my suitcase out in the trunk of my car so my clothes wouldnt get damp and smelly. Also, when we flushed the toilet (in the teeny tiny bathroom with no vent), the noise was so loud/long running that it woke up my son twice. The breakfast was okay except the hard boiled eggs...they tasted like they had been last weeks leftovers and they made my dad gag. This was my first trip to Memphis and I will NEVER go back. 80% of the city is run down, abandoned buildings and closed down businesses, high weeds/grass/grafiti everywhere. We stopped to see Elvis' house and felt unsafe walking down the street. Definately NOT what I had expected.

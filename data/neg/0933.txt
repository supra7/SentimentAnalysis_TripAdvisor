I booked my reservations online at myhotel.com. If it weren't for the fact that I was charged no matter what for 7 nights we would have found something else. I guess the saying goes "you get what you pay for!" Their webpage is all a lie. There was no continental breakfast, no internet/wifi services available. Our room was on the 3rd floor and our view consisted of another building. It was grand central station for the firetrucks and the ambulances that were stationed next door; which, is probably why there were no fire alarms in our room or a fire extingisher on the floor. Housekeeping came by other other day. I had to ask for our trash to be removed, linens weren't changed the whole 7 dyas of our stay. Keep in mind there are no restuarant near by or fuel stations so I hope you don't get a craving for a midnight snack, why? There are no vending machines on site. Rude service and Hospitality it not there speciality!

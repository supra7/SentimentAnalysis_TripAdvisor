Be on guard if you stay here. They try very hard to get you to buy time shares. Even though it was apparent that we did not have any interest, a salesman still ushered us into a sales room with about 30 other couples getting worked over. I was trying to stay polite and informed the salesman that we were not interested, and again 30 minutes later as he still kept going on. Then an older guy came to our table and tried scaring us that the Mexico was full of undesireables waiting to swoop down and steal our babies. Although I amnot hispanic, I was offended by such comments. He also made some derogatory comments about the kind of car we drive likening it to the level of a scooter. He bristled when I told him that we just want to get out of here. He then took us to the back room where a mafia style guy berated us for not buying and made a few more snide comments about our refusal before finally letting us go. We were then treated like less than 2nd class citizens thereafter for our stay. These resort is nothing more than a ruse to get you to buy time shares. STAY AWAY!!!! It is most certainly not worth the aggravation.

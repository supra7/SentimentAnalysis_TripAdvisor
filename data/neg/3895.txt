Decent amenities, but not a warm or romantic place two weeks before before Christmas. Lack of holiday decor, lack of ambiance - and a cold draft everywhere in the hotel, from the 3rd-floor guest room to the bar to the only restaurant. According to the desk clerk, the hotel was less than a third full for the weekend, and yet there were no water view rooms available without paying a significant "upgrade" fee. The staff was as helpful as one would expect from a decent hotel, but did not in any way go out of their way to be helpful. No concierge on duty - again, this was two weekends before Christmas. No recommendations for shopping, restaurants, a night on the town, etc. The value would have been very similar at the Courtyard, for much less money spent.

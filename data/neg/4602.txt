I had to come here to work and it was the only hotel that had rooms, now I know why. When I walked in the bed was unmade and checked the rest of the room and it was not clean. Then the chair I was sitting on had vomit on it. The water has been dripping in the tub and I must leave the tv on just to go to sleep. You have to pay $5 to use the gym worse, who does that? The staff is plentful but not helpful, for the price of this hotel it is the worse. I stay at the Reniassance and that is representative of the cost compared with amenities and sercices. I won't stay here, I am actually going to hotel by the airport it is bad

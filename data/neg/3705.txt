Booked at a great rate, several folks / rooms in my party. When I pulled into the hotel at 11P, I was informed that my reservation was canceled (a credit card on my travel profile had expired without my knowledge). Absolutely NO notice from the hotel to me, or to my travel agent over this matter. My agent maintains a 24x7 call center, if they would have called it would have been sorted out immediately. My agent (who books for many fortune 500 companies) has never seen this behavior. All of Orlando was sold out (daytona, holiday weekend, several major conferences...), and my only guess is that they used this as an opportunity to resell my room to someone else at a higher rate. Never again will we consider this location in Orlando.

Nice but not quite got it ! We stayed at the hotel for 7 nights. The staff were really friendly and very helpful. The pool areas were really disapointing, they were small and for a 4* hotel not that attractive. Next door a new hotel is being built (which I know the Alam Kul Kul cannot help) the grinding and banging noises when sat next to the pool were very annoying. The rooms were not as advertised on the internet and were dated although very clean. The location was good with the beach just over the road. We found the resturant and bar very overpriced, breakfast for 2 cost over $45!. Honestly if we were to go to Bali again we would stay at the Legian Beach hotel x

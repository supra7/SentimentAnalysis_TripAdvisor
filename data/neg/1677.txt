The Hyatt has beautiful facilities. They have done a great job decorating the lobby, pool and the rooms. However they decided that paying over $400 a night for a room is not enough profit for them. As you check in you will be informed of a $15 per night resort fee. This is so you can have 1 hour of tennis court time, free local calls and access to the gym. I am curious how they are going to give 806 rooms an hour of tennis everyday. Then if you would like to park your car they provide a parking lot with less then 50 parking spots. Again with 806 rooms you can imagine that a spot is hard to come by. They will park your car for around $10-$15 a day. The pool area is very nice with ample chairs. However you are not allowed to take the chairs to the beach. We ate at the resort a couple of nights. We expected the meals to be expensive but I also expected the quality to be very good. The first night we had salads that were very good. However the next night we had entire entres and were very disappointed. First with the service witch was not friendly and then the fish was overcooked. We left very disappointed in the overall experience. We had breakfast buffet included each morning. The food quality was average. And dont forget to tip for the buffet, which according to the bill they hand you would be $26 per person. I dont remember the last time I tipped someone when I got my own food. The boardwalk was very nice and useful as you need to walk quite a long ways to get to the best snorkeling spot, so bring good walking shoes. We had a great time but at the end of the vacation we ended up spending over $600 a day without airfare at the resort. This included 2 excursions and 2 meals. For that type of money I expect to have exceptional services and outstanding facilities. The Hyatt fell short on both counts. They seem to take pride in finding ways to suck every last dollar out of your stay.

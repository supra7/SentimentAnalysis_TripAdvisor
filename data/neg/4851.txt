The hotel appears nice from the outside, and lobby area. My husband and I checked into the hotel as a couple (no chldren) and were put on the 5th floor which is the kids zone. The walls may as well be made out of paper. It is LOUD. Everything you would expect to be a typical convenience is a pain. No onsight parking, other than valet which is $17 per day, plus tips. Alternate parking is more than a block away from the North tower, so plan on walking. Not to mention, it's costing you $10 per night to park in a fenced lot in an area you'd probably rather not leave the car overnight. The Room: The rooms were not clean. Bathroom tub and sink was rusted, dirty grout, clogged and would not drain. Called the front dext the next morning, by that afternoon they sent up an engineer who drained it but said it still needed to be unclogged. No fridge, no microwave. Old outdated, dirty furniture and carpet. Just not a pleasant room or experience. This hotel has missed the mark completely. Finally, we requested fresh towels and the maid did not understand what we were saying so the desk called up to see what we needed. I told the desk clerk we needed towels and hours later, no towels. We left the room around 3:00 pm and still no room service and no towels. and towels finally changed out, but the tub still had a ring around it from the standing water and the sheets were not changed on the bed.

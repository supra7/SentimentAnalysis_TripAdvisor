Granted, I was there the Thursday night before St Patrick's Day through the day after but still, with single-paned floor-to-celing, windows, I heard every whistle, horn beeping and voice. And the light blocking shades still let a fair amount of light in Got a great group rate of 129/night or so, staff was friendly and attentive and the restaurant was really good, but I was there for a multi-day nonprofit board meeting and was thoroughly exhausted from not being able to sleep.

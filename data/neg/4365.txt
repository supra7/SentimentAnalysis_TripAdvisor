Just returned from a weekend trip to see the Lion King. The hotel location is convenient to the theater district and the financial district as well as the fanuiel hall area. We stayed in a room that had not yet been upgraded. It was pretty small and the decor generally not what I would expect from a Hyatt. I assume this will probably change when the renovation is complete. It was clean however, and the maids did a good job. The parking situation is ridiculous. We pulled into the garage at 3:00pm on Friday and left at 5:00pm on Saturday and the charge was $36.00. There is no discount for people staying at the hotel. Fortunately, when we returned we were able to find a spot on the street about 3 blocks away but I suspect this was only because it was late saturday night. Good luck trying to find a spot on a weekday. The restaurant (Avenue One) was very good, both the food and the service. We had one service problem - we requested a corkscrew which they said would be sent right up to our room. It arrived an hour and a half later when we were on our way out. Feel free to email me if you have any questions.

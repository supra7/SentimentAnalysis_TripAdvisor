I was placed on an Executive Floor (being a Gold member) and it had carpeting that was dirty. It looked like it had not been cleaned in months. The TV cabinet had a broken door and when I asked they stated it was broken for over a week. Called room service for food at 19:15 and no one answered - got a voice mail. What hotel leaves no one to respond to room service at that time of night? I got a call back 15 minutes later and placed an order. The meal arrived 20 minutes later and was very good. Given that DT Seattle is an overpriced hotel market, the Hilton is over priced. My suggestion is stay somewhere else.

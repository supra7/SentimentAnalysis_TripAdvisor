I come to Chicago often and usually stay at the Chicago Hilton but they were having a Cubs convention and were booked solid so I opted for the Palmer House primarily due to the historic nature of the hotel. I was disappointed in my stay as it was not the same caliber of the Chicago Hilton in my opinion. The bathroom was really small and I have received better towels at a Hampton Inn. I wasn't provided enough towels so I called the customer service hotline three times and no one answered. I finally called housekeeping and requested 2 extra sets of towels that never arrived. I had to go to the front desk to request the towels and when I returned from dinner they were in my room. There was no coffee pot in the room as advertised on their website so I called the front desk and they said they were removed months ago but they have a Starbucks at the street level. The staff in the executive lounge were very friendly but I probably won't stay here again. The restaurant has no vegetarian options which is a shame for a hotel restaurant in Chicago.

We just returned from a week at the Hyatt in Kaanapali. We were told by others that it was a family friendly resort and the pools were supposed to be amazing. We were somewhat dissappointed with our original room in the Napili Tower which overlooked a construction site. We requested 2 beds and had only one. We upgraded to the Club level and a full oceanfront view. The room was on the small side and was older and came with cottage cheese ceilings. The closets were small and everyday the water pressure in the shower would get so low that the water would actually shut off for 10 seconds. The concierge in the club level was not too helpful in making reservations off site. Poolside service was below average and it took a long time to get someone's attention to order. There was a serious problem getting chairs at the pool. People would come down to the pool and "reserve" them with a towel, then leave for several hours to get breakfast. It is not fair to those who are at the pool and want a seat. The chairs were old with plastic backing and the towels were old and crunchy. Room service for a bowl of ice cream for my young daughters was estimated at 1 hour. when we finished the ice cream, the tray was placed outside our room. Later the next afternoon, the tray was still outside our room with crusty old ice cream, plates and a cup of chocolate sauce - totally unacceptable. We've been fortunate enough to travel to 5 star resorts, including the One and Only Palmilla. For the amount of money we spent for a family of 4, we would have been better off at the One and Only Palmilla where exceptional service is the norm.

Did you know that Huntington Avenue is a truck route? I sure didn't...till around 4 AM, when I started hearing loud traffic noises. Couldn't fall asleep after that. Eventually I got up to take a shower. To do this, I had to swing the bathroom door closed so I could get to the tub, but I could close the door only while standing sideways because the bathroom was so small!

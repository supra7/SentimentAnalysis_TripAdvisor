This hotel was booked with my husband in mind as he leaves for Iraq in a few weeks. It was suppose to be a time to relax, sleep in and spoil ourselves. Instead we got woken up at 5:15AM to a fire alarm going off. Had to be evacuated for 2 hours into the street and it was cold. NOT ONE of the staff from the HIlton asked if they could make it up to us in some form or even apologize for the inconvience after the event. Then on the morning we were suppose to check out- NOT UNTIL NOON the housekeeping kept knocking on our door every 30 MINS starting at 9:00 AM to see if we had left yet so they could clean the room. We finally just left at 11:00 after not getting to sleep in once and exhausted. We were very disappointed with the Hilton and won't be wasting our money on this hotel again. It was very expensive and not worth the cost.

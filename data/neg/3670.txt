We went to a concert in the Staples center for a nice concert and had our hotel next door. We expected the hotel to be part of treat we gave ourselves....it was not. Average room, no complementary wifi, pay an annoying extra dollar for each call when you use a phone card, you had to use valet parking, as they told at arrival that the self parking garage had very inconvenient closing times etc. It seems the hotel wants to irritate you. They really made an effort to make you feel bad. It's a shame. Of course they ask a high price for all that nonsense. Very disappointing hotel. They did not succeed!!!! The concert was perfect, so we had a very very good time after all!

This hotel is expensive. At $400+ a night you don't get what you get at a Courtyard. its old and it smells. There may be a newer area in this hotel but I don't even want to know how much it costs. The location is great but there are a lot of options in the vicinity to give them this amount of money. I was in a business trip and I don't do my own booking otherwise I would never stay here even if it is on the company expense account. This hotel is a tourist trap.

Rented two rooms for 3 days each. Verbally requested that the rooms be in proximity to each other when I reserved a month+ in advance. They put us 3 floors apart which broke up our family. Upon check in and a plea for rooms on the same floor, got the attitude that "we're full...it's the way it is, deal with it". Two of three days, we had no hot water in the morning and went to important events not looking or felling our best. Rooms were nice and quiet, though.

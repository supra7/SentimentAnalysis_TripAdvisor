Fridge didnt work Staff was rude and all spanish speaking. Staff lied that the bus system of Miami was very difficult to use when in fact it was more inexpensive and a lot easier than getting around w/ a taxi. Room was small and boring. Pool sucked Cooling system was messed up (we could not control it) We stayed there 5 days and really got tired of it!

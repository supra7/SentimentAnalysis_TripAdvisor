Tonight the Wife & I sat across the street from this Hotel and while raining witnessed a hotel employee moving cars around the lot. The first one was a White Honda Accord. He red lined the engine, then dumped it in reverse. Slid to a stop, then dropped it in forward and lurched forward spinning out. He went back & forth a few times before driving off. Then he went and got a Red Volkswagon Bug (new style) and proceeded to do the same exact thing. I called and the guy (with an obvious Indian accent) said his name was "John" and the Manager was on vacation. I was flabbergasted. We have used this lot for park & fly before numerous times, they have GREAT rates. Now we know why, never again.

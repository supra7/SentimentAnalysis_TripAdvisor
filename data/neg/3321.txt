Zane Silverthorn is probably one of the worst managers you'll ever meet. I stayed here due to unforeseen circumstances and financial issues, and if you're so much as half an hour late on the rent, he shows up to boot you, no warning, not even if you're dressed in proper attire or even have your purse on you (and how does he expect you to pay if he wants to lock you out without having a way to get the money?). With the suspicious people, drug dealers, cops outside every weekend, and shoddy security, it's a hellhole. Probably the worst place I've lived in yet! If you HAVE to stay and need to talk to someone, ask for William, he knows how to treat people like humans.

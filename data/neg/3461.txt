Rented two queen suites for a Saturday night. Hotel was full to capacity Friday night and hosting two holiday parties Saturday night. This is fine and good, but the Magnolia did not staff up properly to handle the busy-ness. Tried to check into my rooms at 3 PM and was denied. Finally got into one room at 4:30 and the other at 5:30. That simply is not acceptable when the published check-in time is 3 PM. The keys didn't work for one room. The suites were nice enough, but I must admit I was a bit disappointed with the stay. Oh, and checking out they tried to charge me a $25 parking free even though I didn't have a car. When I told the lady at the front desk, she didn't believe me and was reluctant to refund the charge. She called the valet and was surprised when he confirmed what I said, that I didn't have a car there.

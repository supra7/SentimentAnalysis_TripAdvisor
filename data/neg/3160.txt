I stayed for one night between flights to and from Singapore, but would choose elsewhere next time. The hotel is conveniently attached to the airport terminals - although you need to go through customs and immigration to reach it. The dark decor of the hotel is rather off-putting. The hotel corridors are exposed to the air - hot and humid. Some rooms are a long way from the lifts. The hotel is not fully insulated from aircraft noise, but rooms are modern, clean and well appointed. I didn't eat at the hotel, although guests seemed to be enjoying food and drinks in the public areas. However, the real disappointment was the front desk's charging of two of my credit cards, after pretending that the first one didn't work. I only found out after an international telephone call to my credit card provider. When I asked to speak to the hotel manager about this, unfortunately the staff on duty did not contact him. Later, I received an email from him - but not admitting that the double-up on credit card charging was a very serious error. He did (apparently) refund the cost of the night - but as this was paid on expenses, that makes little difference. I am still out of pocket for a long international call to my credit card provider - and with no guarantee that this double-up is not happening to other guests.

Usually i'm not one to complain however, HOLIDAY LODGE was a waste of my money. the owner was one of the rudest hotel owners i have ever met and i do a lot of travelling. Being a group of 4 we were very considerate for others around us by leaving at 8pm (which is a reasonable time for any noise that may have been made). The owner didn't give us a warning and gave us 30 mins to leave without telling us she we had actually been evicted. We arrived back at our motel at 11.00pm to find a note on our door with the door locked with all out gear inside saying we couldn't pick it up till 10.00am the next day. There was a phone number to call after hours so we did and she told us to leave and come back in the morning and wouldnt even come in so we could collect our bags and try to check into another motel. Being tourists and in the middle of Kings Cross Sydney we had no where to go or stay. when you finally got back into out motel we opened the door to see all our clothes and expensive belongings thrown into garbage bags. In my opinion for what we payed for and we got was ridiculous and i dont recommend it to anyone. I will not be staying there ever again.

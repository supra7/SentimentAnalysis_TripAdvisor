Well you are likely to get ripped off no matter what hotel you stay in downtown of any city, hotel max makes it an art. No free wifi (this really makes me mad, as every hostel and motel I've ever stayed in has FREE wifi... What a concept! No they want 12 bucks a day). Parking was 35 dollars per night. They bed was one of the most uncomfy I've ever slept on, the walls were paper thin and there was a screaming seagull's nest outside our window which made it hard to sleep and the shower was a super cramped cell (and I'm 5 ft 3 in) with a opaque shower curtain that made it almost pitch black in there. Save your money and get a private room in a hostel! The location was ok.

Location is good and I wouldn't have minded the small rooms and older style building but my biggest complaint was the very thin walls. I find it so frustrating when hotels insist on putting all their guests together on one floor side by side when it's clearly a non busy time. Here's a thought spread out your guests so we don't have to hear each other flushing toilets at 5:30 am (especially if you install industrial toilets that you would find in a public washroom). I probably wouldn't return but if you are reading this for advice - ask for a quiet room away from other guests.

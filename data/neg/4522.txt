A grand old building with a very impressive lobby area, unfortunately, this hotel lacked all the details. Where to start? As expected with an older hotel, rooms were sometimes of a funky layout with cramped bathrooms. That much I understand. But why would you put the only shelf in the bath above the toilet (don't drop anything!) or put the toilet paper holder at a position right where your knee would hit when "sitting on the throne" thus requiring one to sit at a 45 degree angle on the toilet? Water pressure stunk. Want to work in for dinner and order room service? The room service menu for dinner is ridiculous. A few sandwiches and pizzas. Hallway floors were seldom clean. I would see food that had fallen off of plates on the floor in the morning then would still be there in the late afternoon when I returned. Oh yeah -- they charge you $10 to use the gym (which is okay but no great shakes).

My daughter checked in, stayed the first night, the hotel was budget quality as expected and the state of the room was overlooked including the cockroaches. However, upon returning to their room the night of the 18th (second night of their prepaid booked room), exhausted and ready for rest, their room key didn't work. Upon inquiry at the front desk, they were told there was no record of their payment for the room and they would have to leave. This is hardly something that can be overlooked. They spent 30 minutes trying to explain they had already paid in full for the room for two nights via expedia.com, and had checked in under those records. After this half hour upsetting confrontation, they were finally allowed back in their rooms with a demand to be back at the front desk first thing in the morning.... and not try to sneak out... ?? There is no excuse for treating paying customers like common thieves. On top of their own experience, while cooling off on the balcony for a moment, they witnessed another couple pull into the parking lot, walk to their room happily talking, try to enter their room to find their key didn't work (same scenario) and they dissappeared inside. About 15 minutes later they were seen loading their belongings, obviously very upset and leaving the motel. This is completely unacceptable.The behavior and attitude of the hotel employee was rude and condescending. The entire scenario was uncalled for. It seriously makes me wonder if the clerk was harassing customers who booked at budget prices into leaving, so that rooms could be rented at the higher weekend rate. Stay away from Super 8 in downtown Memphis/Graceland.

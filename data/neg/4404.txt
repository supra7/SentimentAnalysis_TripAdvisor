A very disappointing hotel. The rooms are plain and unimaginitive and are totally blocked from natural light by the highest building in Boston which is positioned next to it. The age of the hotel is noticable. Acomplete lack of public rooms. Only one bar which is dark and miserable, nowhere else at all for guests to relax. Noise from weddings on the 3 nights we were there was unbelievable. A companion found a FLEA in her bed. Staff smiled politely but were toally ineffectual. They just didn't want to know, were smug, huffy, snappy and useless in dealing with the public, from the bellman to the manager. Take my advise and avoid this place like the plague. I don't give bad reviews, read my others, but don't stay here.

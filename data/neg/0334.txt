Pros - Price, given the central location - Nice iron compared to many hotels - Open Wifi - No bedbugs so far Cons: - The room is very small - There is no work area - The bathroom is uncomfortably small - The sheets are very worn, with numerous holes/slits in them Next time, I'll stay a little further away and take the bus (that is free in the downtown area)

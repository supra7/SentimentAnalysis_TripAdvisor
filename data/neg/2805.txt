I travel a lot on business and pleasure so this is based on having to live out of hotels often Rooms very modern and spacious.Bed comfortable. Lights annoying, several settings but have to turn off to switch settings. Can't find lights when entering room, the card slot is almost behind the door. Air con/heating good and very quiet. Bathroom Basin too small so soaks everything when I shave. Heated tiles when you find the controller. Shower would be great but no water pressure so too little water. Food - very poor! This is why it is not a 5 star hotel. Because of location there is not much else around. Room service menu very limited. Staff - the staff I met were pleasant and helpful. English not brilliant (except for the guy on reception who sounded dutch) but it is Spain and we should learn their language not expect them to speak ours. Internet very slow, seems to be limited to 756K per room. Prices in bar etc high, can of Guiness is 12 local beer 10. I think 10 for a Guiness is unacceptable. Location in northern business district not suitable for site seeing in Madrid. Taxi to Cuidad Financeria 30-40 30-45 mins. I got very reasonable prices c80 per night booked via internet which is very cheap but it was August which is cheaper is Madrid because everyone has left on holiday. Don't pay list price of 230. Overall a 3* hotel with nice rooms trying to be a 5* hotel

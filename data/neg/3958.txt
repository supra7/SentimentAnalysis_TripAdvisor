My husband and I went to Boston to celebrate out 2nd anniversary, and booked a room for two nights at the boston park plaza hotel. When we arrived they said the room was ready, but when my husban dropped off our luggage in the room it was filled with towels everywhere. We informed the front desk but received the brush off. So after returning to the room that night the towels had been removed so we didn't think anymore about it. Now the next day we started to feel poorly but went out any ways. After we returned we noticed the room was different from the day previous. But we were feeling too sick to make a complaint right away. The next morning we were scheduled to check out and I had developed several rashes and my husband was very sick with an infection in his lungs. So we went to the front desk to file a report. We were given the brush off, but we insisted to speak with somebody. So after about an hour of waiting the head of security came and we filed a report with him. They told us they would be intouch the same afternoon. But we didn't recieve a call for several days. We spoke to one person who told us that he would call back and we have yet to receive his call back. I have tried to call and each time I get a voicemail or brush off. So to say the least we are very upset with the whole experience. :( We do not recommend this hotel.

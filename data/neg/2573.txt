I really have no idea on from where I should start! Let's give it a try...: First of all the prime impact when you enter the lobby is horrible. A mixture of old degraded smell and an non-smiling personal will "welcome". A prelude of what's to come! Secondly a feeling of dirtiness and disappointment will make you realize what a bad choice I've made. But all this are nothing in front the shocking news that we cannot share the room -me and my fiancee- cause we are not married!!! They asked us for a marriage certificate!!! So to make it short, we ended up tired, with our suitcases looking for a new hotel! I really shocking experience that we will never-EVER forget!

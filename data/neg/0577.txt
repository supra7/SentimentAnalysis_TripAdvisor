I made my reservation based on the pictures and descriptions on the hotel website, it's proximity to Pike's Place Market, and the low price I got with a senior discount. Not only is the hotel in a seedy part of town, but the hotel itself is not clean or inviting at all.The first room we were given, after we hauled all our luggage up to it on a luggage cart, smelled like mold and mildew and decay. We changed rooms, hauling our luggage to the next room. It smelled a little better, but still had a view of a strip club and sketchy people walking. The sirens and motorcycles went most of the night, and the old style air conditioning unit was loud and cycled on and off all night. Do not stay at this hotel unless you go there and check it out first.

This hotel is bad need of an update. The room was as clean as it could be, but the carpet was extremely old, so was the bathroom, and it was silly that the only curtains we could close were sheers, and we could see through them to the hotel behind us (I'm guessing ditto for those guests looking in to our room!). The staff were very nice, though, there is free internet in rooms and there is also a decent free continental breakfast (fruit, cereal, toast, waffles, hard boiled eggs, sausages, coffee, juice, tea). The gym was also decent for the hotel. Parking is $10 a night. Location is perfect - a block from the space needle and monorail, walking distance to downtown, and most importantly, to Top Pot Donuts (you MUST go here). Also only a few blocks away from an Airport Bus pick up (we walked about 5 minutes to get to it). You get what you pay for - we got a deal online, and since we were only there to sleep, it wasn't a big deal, but even for a Travelodge, it was not the nicest place.

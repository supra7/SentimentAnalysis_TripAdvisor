....and it did, sort of - minus the cleanliness factor and services which were operational (phone, internet, TV). The crockery, glasses and utensils had a layer of grease/grme to them, the Master Bath sink had trouble draining, the Master Bath Loo barely flushed and even the pedal bin in the kitchen didn;t work. It was almost impossible to get a hold of someone to ask them to fix the problems we were having and even when we did, although she had a helpful attittude, nothing really changed. We were there from Monday to Saturday, and had Internet for 1 day, TV for 2 which were the most frustrating problems of all - the rest we could have lived, or made do with but the lack of Interner and TV was a real problem.

I stayed here for 3 nights a few weeks ago with my husband and 2 kids. we usually stay at the Sheraton but that was fully booked. The location is great and staff were very helpful and courteous and the lobby is very grand but i wasn't that impressed. The houskeeping service was very poor. we weren't given any replacement toilet rolls or shampoo etc.You dont expect this in an expensive deluxe hotel. This is the first hotel in the US that I've stayed in that didn't have a coffee maker in the room. There was a $10 rental charge for one. there was a basket of cookies/sweets etc on display as part of the mini bar that I was afraid my kids would try to eat in the middle of the night resulting in big charges to the bill!! However according to the information folder there was quite a large charge to get all this removed. Restaurant very expensive. we went up to the Marriott in copley place instead and had great buffet breakfasts from some of the most helpful restaurant staff that i have ever encountered. We visit Boston every year and will stick to the sheraton or marriott next time

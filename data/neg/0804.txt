We arrived at the Westin in time for checkin......from the instant we got there, we were told they only had a certain kind of rooms available for people who made their reservations using Priceline (which means the least desirable). Since most of us use a discount travel site nowadays, (especially with this ecomony) it seems they should be more welcoming to people who actually CHOSE this hotel to stay in. The receptionist was VERY snobby and refused to entertain any requests from us. That treatment continued thruout our 3 day stay. The room itself was doable and comfortable, but the way the staff treated us was unacceptable. The front desk offered to help us with our luggage, but when we refused that, they could no longer be bothered by us. We were basically on our own in a city we knew nothing about and had never visited. The morning restaurant downstairs was nice, but a bit pricey......opened very early for coffee and breakfast foods.......always busy......more of a cafeteria style........but coffee was good and plentiful. They offer Starbucks coffee inroom, but cups are small and only enough for 1 day and 1 cup each. If we ever return to Seattle, we will not be staying at the Westin, and can't advise u to, either.

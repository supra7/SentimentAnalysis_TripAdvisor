Terrible place to stay in the summer. There are large outdoor bars on both sides of the hotel that you can clearly hear from the guest rooms. We were on the top floor (7), and could hear the din of the crowd above the noise of our air conditioner. We're in our late 30s, and it still disrupted our sleep. The noise doesn't quiet down until about 12:30 or 1:00am. Big disappointment. I'd stay elsewhere if I were you

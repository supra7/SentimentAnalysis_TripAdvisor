My husband and I took a last minute trip to Seattle and found a low rate for the Warwick on Hotels.com. I had read mixed reviews before we left but being that it was noted as a 3 1/2 star hotel in a great location, we decided to check it out. We were uncomfortable from the first moment we walked in. The lobby, elevators, and room were a mix of mold, body odor, and smoke smells. The location was not as great as we expected - most other downtown hotels (Westin, Sheraton, Marriott) are closer to Pike Place Market, Aquarium, Pier 59, Pioneer Square, etc. The bathroom floor and shower tiles were cracked and the grout was covered in mold. The worst part was that there was not a mattress pad on the bed and the sheets were very thin, so you felt like you were sleeping directly on an old mattress. We asked for extra sheets each night to cover the bed and give it more padding just so we could sleep. This hotel is older, poorly maintained, and overall disappointing. My suggestion - get a 4-star hotel on Hotwire.com in the downtown/Pike Place area. It probably won't cost much more.

One heck of a business trip. Could not sleep most of last night. Spent a lot of time scratching. By morning I had marks/ swellings all over my body and went to talk to the receptionist. She seemed like she did not Know what to do and tried to blame me for the problem. Contacted the manager and they switched my room. They were very apologetic, will not charge me for the emtire stay of the trip annd offered for me to go to the hospital. Have pictures of black things all over on the matress. Needless to stay will never be back here again. Will have to inform the corprate booking agent of the incident

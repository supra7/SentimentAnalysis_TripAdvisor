This hotel was such a mixed bag, its not a in a great area, but has good free and secure parking area and is close to public transit. So many contradictions to my stay here, for every good thing of staying here there was one big bad thing. The service was great one day and then horrible the next day (Saturday), we had a great recommendation for a wonderful restaurant from the concierge with really good instructions and they checked us in hours before the check in time, which I thought was great! However, the next day we needed extra towels, I called three times to the front desk for more towels, no towels ever came, sucks to have to reuse a towel. Thats pretty bad if I have to call twice, I called three times and nothing came. Also the front desk staff was rude, particularly to foreigners and those of different heritage than the staff. The Staff treated people of different backgrounds VERY differently, I sat in the lobby for an hour waiting for my wifes hair appointment to finish, and it was pretty humorous to watch. Also, I was never asked about my stay or given a chance for follow up or feedback, which is disappointing. The Rooms are VERY large, but theres no furniture except a single chair, so why have the big TVs and the big room but no where to sit and watch it and relax, that was also very disappointing, get some couches in there. The bathroom was also large, but poorly outfitted and the shower was really really bad, like a dorm shower, the drain pulled out, and it wasn't supposed to. Also the elevators were a bit scary, the seems to lag and stall between floors and the carpets were old and stained, which is too bad because the lobby is lovely. Good hotel on a budget with free parking, but will probably not stay again.

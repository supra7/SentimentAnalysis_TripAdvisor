would never stay there again Waited approximately 20 minutes just to be checked in; stains on the carpet that closely resembled blood - didn't go barefooted while we were there; mirrored glass on closet door was cracked; pans under heating coils on oven were covered in aluminum foil; 2 adults in room yet they left only one wash cloth each day - when asked for more we were told they were out; light bulb burned out in one lamp - when asked for a new light bulb we were told they were out; check out took 35 minutes even though we had paid cash when we checked in.Horrible experience; would definitely not recommend this place to anyone that i know - even an enemy.

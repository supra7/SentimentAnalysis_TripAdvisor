"Where Hope Goes To Die" is what I said when I opened the door to our room at this hotel (hotel being a much too generous word for this place as I have stayed in youth hostels in Europe that were nicer). We immediately started counting the hours until our flight (which had been grounded in Dallas due to a mechanical problem). In hindsight, I would have rather slept on the floor of the airport. I literally felt my skin crawl when I climbed into the bed. The location was depressing with very little nearby except a couple of disgusting restaurants. The desk clerk said we could walk to the food or have pizza delivered to our room, but we opted to go hungry rather than jeopardize personal safety. Granted, we checked in late and left at 5 am, but all in all, my husband and I still cringe at the thought of having stayed in this place.

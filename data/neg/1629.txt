We have been visiting this hotel on Kaanapali beach for over 15 years. We love the ppol and the location. The last few visits have been increasingly disappointing. First they shut down the upper nice semi indoor lunch area. They don't have enough coverd chairs, so if you want shade you better reserve your spot by 7:30 am. What disappointed us the most however was the condition of the rooms. We had to change rooms each of the last 2 years. Last year it was ants and noisy plumbing. This year the sliding door wouldn't open and the condition of the room overall was poor. The faucet semi operational, one phone broken etc. This resort need to shut down and refurbish and redecorate all the rooms, its just been way too long. ( especially for these prices! )

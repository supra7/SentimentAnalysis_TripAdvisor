As other reviewers have stated, the location of this hotel make it ideal for a place to stay prior to early morning travel. For us, that's where it begins and ends. The rooms are dated, poorly maintained and uncomfortable. The room smelled bad and seemed dusty and stale as neither of us could sleep all night. There is clearly very little budget for maintaining and modernizing rooms at this property. The worst part was that none of the drains in the bathroom worked at all. There's nothing worse than standing in water while taking a shower or brushing your teeth in a sink that does not drain. The people running this hotel were nice enough and I have no real issues with service. I also admit that the room rate was very low, and this is a case of getting what you pay for.

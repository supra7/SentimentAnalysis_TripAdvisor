This hotel probably was grand once but not so much now. The location is good however. The room was small, the bathroom even smaller. There was no space around the sink for toiletries (one of my pet peeves). The staff overall wasn't the friendliest, except the concierge was great. There was a "Model UN" event going on so there were high school kids everywhere. Including up and down the halls at night. Expect to wait a while for an elevator too, especially if there is a big conference going on. We stayed here only because it was the place the job was paying for. I wouldn't stay here on my own, there are so many nicer hotels in Boston.

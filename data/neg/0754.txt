After staying @ a lovely Westin in Portland, I was looking forward to a similar experience in Seattle. Sadly that was not to be- from check-in to check-out and everything in between the experience paled in comparison. My hotel room was musty and smelly, someone previously must have smoked in the room and it hadn't been aired out. To be fair, there was a huge convention in town, but that doesn't mean that I should experience any less level of customer service! Asked for some take-out menus from the front desk- assured that they would be sent up, had to call twice and then finally go down to get them myself. Someone did eventually bring them up while I was going down to the front desk- talk about wires crossed. The room it self was truly the main disappointment- it was shabby without the chic. Everything seemed tired or old- don't even get me started on how filthy the carpeting was or how dingy the couch. There was one redeeming factor, the waitstaff in the hotel restaurant- extremely helpful and very customer service oriented. I would give them kudos.

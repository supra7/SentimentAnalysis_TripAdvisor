The rooms in the Best Western were excellent. Clean and well appointed with an excellent walk-in shower. However the service in the restaurant in the evening was truly appalling. We were given menus and expected to order instantly with the waitress looking surprised when we asked for some time. The starters were ok. My main course and one of my colleagues were pleasant enough but my other colleague had to wait another 20 minutes before he risotto arrived and when it did it looked like slop and tasted little better. It was also warm on one side but cold on the other. The waitress also took away the two ended plates whilst my other colleague was still eating. We then had to wait 45 minutes for desserts. However we got off lightly as other people in the restaurant at the same time had to wait upwards of 2 hours for burgers and chips! Some got so fed up that they gave up and went to bed whilst another stormed into the kitchen to cancel their order. There was little attempt to apologise or rectify the situation by the serving staff and the whole matter was treated with indifference bordering upon contempt. The only apolgy received was from the reception staff upon complaining when checking out in the morning. I'd recommend that anyone staying at the Best Western Palm Hotel makes arrangements to eat elsewhere.

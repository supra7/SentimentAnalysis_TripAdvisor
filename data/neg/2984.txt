I was bookend in at this hotel due to it's proximity to RAI which was a 5-10 min walk. It is also convenient for the train from Schipol. Sadly check-in was really slow. Despite counting 9 staff on the desks (they seem to insist on having two people for each checkin desk!) there were only 2 desks open causing a 10 minute wait. I had a room on the top floor which was clean and comfortable. Sadly only the ground floor seemed to be airconditioned with the controls in the room making no difference. You can open the window slightly which helps but then you have the noise of the busy road nearby and also hotel guests drinking and smoking outside the front entrance until early in the morning. For these reasons I had poor sleep for both nights I was staying and therefore I would recommend that you avoid the hotel.

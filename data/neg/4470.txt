Management kindly placed me in a third floor room directly over a roadworks project which utilizes jackhammers nonstop between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. The building has15 floors and three sides that don't face the roadworks, but no attempt was made to improve my situation. I'm in town for a four day conference and not sleeping is hardly an option -- but neither is sleeping, in these circumstances. Remember, if you're going to Chicago, for the discounted rate of $828, you too could go four nights without sleep at this hotel.

This place was ok, as it was within walking distance to Space Needle and that area, but most everything else had to be reached by car. Parking was insufficient for Memorial Day weekend, as several underground parking garage spaces were taken by mattresses and other hotel furniture. Suite was ok but not as nice as it was depicted on website. Breakfast was ok most times, though too crowded on some days.

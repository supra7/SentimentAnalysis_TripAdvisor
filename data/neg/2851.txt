Apparently HIE CIty 22 has a very different view as to when air conditioning is needed. I would like to think that air conditioning is for when it is hot (which includes April). However, I was told that air conditioning is only for summer, and they told me I could open a window instead. Thanks for nothing HIE City 22! And why is your front desk staff so surly and indifferent too??? Also, the free breakfast is horrible. The coffee was the worst and the food was low quality.

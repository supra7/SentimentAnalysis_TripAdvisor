I recently stayed at the Hyatt Place - Wolfchase Galleria location in Memphis and upon going to my first room location the air conditioner once turned on, sounded like a semi truck was in the room, which says to me the maintenance on the hotel was not up to par. Well, they switched me to a different room on the 6th floor and as I went in the restroom to take my nightly shower, I closed the door and so my surprise the soiled/dirty towels from the previous guest were still on the floor behind the door. This let me know that the room probably was not cleaned well from the last guest. When I alerted hotel staff, she looked at me dumb founded & had a blank stare. No I did not get a I am sorry, would you like a refund, nothing. Very disappointed, disgusted and all of the above. I took pictures just in case hotel management wanted to dispute with time and date stamps. Just nasty!

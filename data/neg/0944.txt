All rooms were filthy, we had to clean them ourselves. Very old and not updated, gross bathroom...french fries and parmesan cheese packets spilled on carpet, cracked and broken windows. Noisy construction right outside windows with no screens.Don't you dare ask for an extra towel! Not worth it at all. Extremely rude management.

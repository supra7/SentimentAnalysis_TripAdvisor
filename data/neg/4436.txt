This was a decent hotel for a one night stay to see the Oprah show. I love Hampton Inns but the $275 price for 4 adults in one room surprised me. Maybe this is a normal rate for Chicago but this was the most expensive Hampton Inn I've stayed at, and yet the most dated. The breakfast was good as usual and the hotel is well-located near the Mag Mile. The elevators are ridiculously slow! However, the room was reasonably clean and the staff very friendly. It seems like a lot of Oprah audience members stay at this hotel. The restaurant downstairs, Bollo, was excellent.

These people nickle and dime you. Over $50 in hidden fees. $30 parking, $1.00 to make a local phone call, Seattle tax, hotel tax, tourist fee??? $10 continental breakfeast ( which is just a dried out muffin, terrible coffee, and a 1/2 cup of juice.) Then to top it off, the "hostess" was nothing but attitude. The couch in our room had a big hole in it, the floor was all stained, and we will never stay here again.

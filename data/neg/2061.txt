My wife and I stayed at the Trump Tower, Las Vegas for a week long work conference at nearby Wynn. Although the rooms were rather exquisite, the extra charges for average amenities were outrageous! A daily charge for Wi-fi usage, a daily charge for gym equipment usage, etc., (standard inclusions provided at much simpler hotels) kept us from thoroughly enjoying our surroundings and relaxing (also, not noted as requiring an additional surcharge on their website). After visiting many of the other casinos/hotels within a one block radius, we noticed the lack of atmosphere at the Trump and could only summarize it to be just "another expensive hotel". A side note - our camera was held for us at the bell desk overnight and found to have additional photographs upon check out the following morning.

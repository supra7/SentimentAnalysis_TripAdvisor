We missed a connecting flight and Air Canada put us up in the hotel for a night. What a terrible hotel. NOTHING Quality about it! The hotel was dark, dirty and smelly. The lady at the front desk was nice but that's about as good as it got. We were almost afraid to sleep between the sheets. The bed was terrible and the bathroom was old and dirty. We could not wait to get out of there. Stay somewhere else!

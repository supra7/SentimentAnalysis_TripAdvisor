I have a great love for Kipton Inns, this one does not even come close to the type of service I expect. It's 3:00 I have just returned to my room, and it is still not cleaned, despite the fact that the service hanger has been sitting on my door all day. I called to the front desk but they said "there is no guarantee when they will get to my room" Also my minibar was not stocked proper on arrival, (Only 2 beers) I called the front desk to notify them and the next day the fridge had one beer! I went to the front desk about this, the next morning and they said "it would be cheaper to just get supplies across the street." If I cared about cheaper, do you think I would being paying $450/night to stay in this hotel? Also, their was no room service menu in my room, when I called to get one, they gave me attitude and argued with me. This place is not worth the money, despite the nice decor and great views of Chicago.

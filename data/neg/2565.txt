I would like to start by saying this was the worst hotel experience I have ever endured, let alone paid for. From the beginning, we ate in the buffet and were misinformed of the price, then charged an 18% gratuity, when it took my "waitress" 15 minutes to bring me a cup of coffee...which was her ONLY trip to my table. The food was ridiculous and we found ants on the muffins, which was disgusting, but forgiveable, at this point. We then went to the front desk to check in and asked for suggestions for pizza delivery because we weren't from around there. The front desk agent simply replied, "Oh, there's Dominoes and stuff", and that was the end of it. We checked in to our room and settled in. At about 11pm, a man, who I am assuming was a maintenance man, attempted to ENTER OUR ROOM. Luckily, we had the latch on, but he actually put in the key, unlocked it, and tried to come in, without so much as a knock. As I wake from my sleep and go in to the bathroom, I notice DRIED BLOOD on the toilet. I had had it with the place at that point. Be assured, I have already contacted the Miami Health Services Department with that one. Moving on: the air conditioner in our room was clearly malfunctioning, it went on and off every 15 minutes with an EXTREMELY loud screeching and grinding noise, probably why the man tried to enter our room. To top it all off, when I took a shower the next morning, there was ABSOLUTELY NO HOT WATER. I'm not an idiot, I know how to work a faucet, there was simply no hot water. I will never stay at a Hilton again. I have been a longtime Starwood member and rightly so. We made a reservation last-minute or I would have never stayed there in the first place, but believe me, I have learned my lesson! I only paid $111 for the room, not including the ridiculous $48 for breakfast, but I wouldn't stay at Hilton Miami Downtown again.

The Hyatt Regency Maui certainly has a good deal going for it: beautiful grounds, a great location at Ka'anapali within easy walk of the other resorts and Whaler's Village, reasonably well-kept facilities, etc. But unlike most of the competing properties in this price range that we've stayed in previously on Maui, Kauai'i, and the Big Island, I wouldn't return here. There were just too many irritations caused mostly by inadequate attention to detail by management, such as a long wait to check in (no priority for Gold Passport members, although there were few other people checking in when we arrived, just a shortage of front desk staff), long waits every morning for breakfast at the Swan Court, and the postage stamp-sized self-parking lot that's always full. And this was low season -- one hesitates to imagine what the hotel must be like at busier times of the year. Our "de luxe" ocean view room was comfortable but not remarkable in any way, and the bathroom was cramped and unvented.

My husband and I stayed here for five nights during our honeymoon after staying a few nights at another resort. After walking around for a while looking for an elevator, we finally realized there wasn't one in our building. So after our exhausting trip, we had to drag all of our luggage up three flights of stairs. We were excited for our "free" breakfast the next morning only to realize that we had eaten the "wrong breakfast" and our meal wasn't the right one for the coupon. Luckily, after we spoke with staff, the front desk, and management, we got our free breakfasts. Why would we pay for a breakfast when we have a voucher for a free one?? Their motto is that they are "the most hawaiian experience" which would be true if Hawaiian people are just pissed-off, Mexican, workers that give you a dirty look when you smile at them. Nobody there was really friendly at all, and the atmosphere was really really old and boring. All in all, it just required us to be outside of the hotel and do more activities, which I guess was a plus in the end.

I haven't even stayed at this hotel. I tried to, for 4 days, writing them an email, from their own web site, in both English and Spanish and and having to re-send the email 3 times. Four days later, I still haven't heard from them. Considering another gentleman's comments about the lack of courtesy and poor demeanor at this hotel, I'm going to take our 30 room nights in Barcelona to a different hotel.

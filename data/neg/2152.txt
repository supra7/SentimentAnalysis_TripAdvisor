Took a time share sales tour of this facility on my last stay in Playa and though I did not buy here, the manager personally came over and offered us the opportunity to purchase a certificate to come back and stay at this resort. Knowing how these sales people are, I specifically asked if it was to stay at this resort (Hacienda Tres Rios) and if there would be any additional charges upon making the reservaction. The Manager said it was for His resort (Hacienda Tres Rios) and there would be no additional charges incurred at time of reservation or checkout. Finding the facilities very nice, we purchased the 5 day four night package, however upon trying to use it, I was informed that the certificate will only allow us to stay at a property of CancunTravelNow in Cancun and if we want to stay at Tres Rios, an additional cost of hundreds of dollars would be incurred. They LIE to you here and try to cheat you. I would never recommend this place to anybody! If they treat prospective guests like this, just think how they must treat you when they already have your money and you are staying there. DO NOT STAY HERE!

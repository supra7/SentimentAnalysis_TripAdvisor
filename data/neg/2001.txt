A group of 12 girls traveled to Vegas in March for a bachelorette party. The hotel price was very reasonable- we paid $240 per night for a suite. The room had a kitchen with a full size refrigerator, dinning area, living room with fold-out sectional, large bedroom, large full bathroom & small full bathroom. We had 4 girls per room so having two bathrooms was very convenient. The room dcor was nice, nothing too fancy. For the price we paid the value was great! I also liked the Fashion Show Mall being across the street from the hotel- Go to the Nordstroms Caf for lunch. On the not so great side, the hotel is off the strip- they offer a free shuttle to the strip that runs on a regular basis. The hotel doesnt have a casino!!!!! REALLY- I guess the tower was supposed to be condos, but with the real estate market crash it was converted to hotel. So, if you want to gamble you need to go elsewhere. It was very windy the weekend we were there, and the rooms did not muffle the noise or wind. I felt like I was in a wind tunnel while walking the hotels hallways. The train noise was also annoying!!! The windows are very thin and the noise goes through them like paper. The gym was OK, nothing to brag about! It had free weights, cardio machines and some nautilus machines. An adequate gym is very important to me, and this one did not cut it. I didnt eat at the hotel restaurant, but I did order a fruit plate at the caf next to the gym- not worth my money. And for some reason, the staff was not pleasant at the caf. The hotel was not crowded; check in & out was smooth. There was no bar scene, or party atmosphere- the hotel was pretty mellow. The pool was not exciting or worth mentioning. Overall it was a good value for the money we paid. Would I stay in the property again? NO!

Stayed here on business with a corporate rate of $170/night which seems very reasonable for a big city like Boston. Hotel is generally filled with business travelers. It is located across the street from the train station and has direct access to a large shopping center. The room was large with a nice city view of Boston. The bathrooms are small and awkardly configured. The toilet is too close to the door. They need to be remodeled completely! Also, housecleaning needs to do a better job. My bathroom had significant amounts of hair in the sink and some in the tub. Currently, they are doing construction in the lobby area, so its dusty and messy. Also, they were checking the elevators and they were not functioning at certain times of the day for fire alarm inspections. All of it was very annoying. Took a taxi to eat near the sights and every cab ride was on average about $12-15/one way

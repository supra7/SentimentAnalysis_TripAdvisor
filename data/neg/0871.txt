When we planned our trip to Seattle, we booked a room online with 2 queens beds, and confirmed our reservation over the phone. All was okay. Upon arrival, we discovered that there were no queen rooms available. We were offered a room with 2 double beds, and the beds ended up being way too small. The front counter staff(who were the only good part of our experience) offered us a room with a king bed and a hide-a-bed. Unfortunately, the room in question was beside the elevator shaft, and was extremely noisy. On top of that, with the hide-a-bed open, you couldn't access the bathroom????? We ended up back in a double bed room(after an hour of mucking around) and the management only knocked $10 off of our bill. The hotel is extremely run-down. The bathrooms in both rooms we were in were severely dated. The hotel is in the middle of a reno, but from what I saw, the work being done is a bandaid at best. The only positive thing I can say about my stay(other than the cheerful and helpful front desk staff) is that the hotel is very close to all the action. They also offer free parking, IF you can find a spot in their VERY small lot. I rate the Space Needle Travelodge a 3 out of 10.

Very shady place! I cannot recommend this hotel at all. My room door did not lock properly, the bathroom was absolutely disgusting and dirty upon my arrival, the elevator got stuck several times during my stay (and of course had no inspection sticker whatsoever) and when I asked them to call me a taxi cab to the airport, a car arrived that was not labeled as a taxi, had no meter in it, the driver had no id, taxi license, or permit but still tried to charge me $5 more for a trip to the airport than the local yellow cabs. I booked the room to avoid the high costs of the conference hotels nearby, but I will never make this mistake again. Even their cheap rates were overpriced for the rooms and service they offer.

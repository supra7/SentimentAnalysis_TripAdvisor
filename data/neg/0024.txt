I emailed ahead asking for early check in because I was arriving in town by 9:00 AM. They said they could not promise me a room, which is to be expected. I arrived at the hotel, asked if a room was available as we had our luggage and heavy bags with us. I was then told by a lady at the front desk that our type of room was not available but if we wanted to upgrade there would be a room available. I asked how much and was told $50/ night. Totally not worth it so decided to pass. She then tried to put us in a different room. She made a comment about it being for a king bed when we reserved two double beds. I corrected her and she was then arguing with me about it saying that the rate I paid was not enough for the double bed room. I pulled out my confirmation showing my reservation and she still didn't want to put me in a double bed room. The concierge said he would lock our bags in a closet, which we appreciated. I had returned to retrieve something out of my suitcase and one, the room they were stored in smelled horribly of natural gas, two the concierge came in the room with me and proceeded to hit on me and tried to get me to go out with him that night. Not the end of the world by any means, but very uncomfortable in a closed up small storage closet. The window of our room faced a cement wall. We did not receive any daylight at all, as ithe cement wall blocked out all the light. The room smelled terribly of smoke whenever someone in a room around us was smoking. The smell was so overwhelming that it smelled like someone in our room as smoking. Aside from the dark and smoke smell the room was decent and comfortable. The hotel was in a good location with a short walk to each Pike's Market and the Space Needle. There was a (although quite expensive) grocery/wine store right across the street. Checkout went quick and easy.

- Went with my inlaws to Chicago and stayed at the Palmer house. I had seen it on Great Hotels and was interested in seeing it in person, sadly, a lot of renovations were occuring at the time. + The location of the Hotel was very convenient to the Art Institute, subway/L, buses, Millenium Park, etc. Views from our window was nice, over looking parts of the city. - Staff was nice and fairly quick, though there were some language problems at the desk. I woould suggest that the hotel keep a native english speaker at the front desk to handle possible language problems. The same problem also appeared at the concierge desk on the executive level. - The room had a nice comfortable desk but the lack of easy clothing storage made unpacking problematic. If you are only spending a night or two, the drawers provided (little more than desk drawers) would be sufficent but wee stayed there 5 nights. - Food on the concierge level was ok to mediocre but relatively plentiful. Coffee was basically an embarassment, they should at least have fresh brewed on the concierge level and instead they had a liquid reconstitution device used. Go to the Cornor Cafe instead.

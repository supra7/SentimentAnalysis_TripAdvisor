We thought we hit the mother load, until we arrived. There it started out with discrepencies at check in and finding out we are paying additional 16.80 per day for the pool and a 4oz. bottle of water per day. That included days that the pool was closed due to "wind". It was scary walking past a old parking toll booth on the sidewalk converted to a sleeping box filled with belongings of a homeless person, the sidewalk filled with broken glass, trash and old clothes and tire littering the sidewalk. Real trashing area after dark, not to forget the extra distance off the strip to only this hotel. We called housekeeping every day to ask for linens and water. Seems they can't get it all done unless you drive the completion. Trump really missed the most important piece that people expect at a five star, the bed. They told me the sofa was just like regular bed. They lied. I have owned a good sofa bed and slept on comfortably, but this was not even close. It even looked trashy covered in lint. The first night we asked for the bed to be made because they didn't provide the linens to make it up. We gave them 1 1/2 hours and they still needed another prompt to show up late. A sheet was placed on the mattress, yes no pad and no protection between you and the mattress. Yikes that was the worst quality day bed, mostly like a hammock except directly on the springs. The bed was so soft it also sagged, also no bed pad. The worst hotel quality you may yet to have experienced. They will tell you up on the 54th floor you won't hear the train every night and morning, but trust me you will hear it loud and clear unless you are deaf. Also this is a non smoking hotel but you can't get in or out of the hotel without going through the cloud of smokers positioned at the doors having a smoke fest. I would not for these reasons ever consider Trump a second time. They still have issues with the water temp. don't plan on a hot shower and you will be fine.

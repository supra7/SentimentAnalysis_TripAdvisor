Overall not a good stay at the Palmer House Hilton. First room looked old and faded. The bathroom was so small that one person in the bathroom could barely close the door by leaning off to the side and then slowly closing the door. We asked to be moved. The next room also was old and faded and quite a lot smaller than the first room. But the bathroom was about twice the size. Now, twice the size means it was still a very small bathroom but at least one person could easily utilize the sink, shower and the toilet. There was still no place to put toiletries. When first checking in, I asked if there was a possible upgrade for me (I was with my wife and daughter). I am HiltonHHonors Diamond and usually get upgraded to executive level or to a suite at a Hilton Hotel. She responded in a rude tone that I would surely like the room I was in. It turned out to be the miniature bathroom room. The room did not have enough towels for three people. Called down and they brought up extra towels. Next day room was again not supplied with enough towels. Called down and they were brought up. Next day was the same. It does not seem like a big deal but how many times do you have to ask for enough towels. The hotel provides in and out self parking with a garage next door. They validate a ticket for the in and out after we paid $30 per day for parking. Twice the validation did not work and I either had to pay an extra $29 or get another ticket at the garage and then get it validated again at the front desk. Both times the front desk staff acted if if it was my fault as if I had not validated the ticket. Hotel is under construction and there are a few inconveniences involved with that but construction is a temporary issue and I cannot fault that. Over all, there was just not a feeling that the hotel staff or the hotel cared that we were guests or that we were regular Hilton customers. I do not think we will stay here again. There are many other choices in Chicago.

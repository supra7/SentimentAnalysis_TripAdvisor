No elevator, which is ok if you are staying on the 2nd floor, but not so good if you're staying on the 3rd or 4th. This hotel is on the boardwalk, but the outdoor bar and grill actually sits on the boardwalk so the actual rooms do not have a view of anything except the next building. Entrance in the rear, where the "kitchen crew" hangs out the back door, and that's feels a bit uncomfortable.

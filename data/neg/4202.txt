Don't find a lot of these reviews comforting??? You shouldn't! This place is Nasty with a capital N! The location is nice and the outside is very pretty, but step inside and welcome to mildew-ville. There was a wad of chewing gum stuck to our door that had clearly been there for years and the few bathroom tiles that were affixed to the floor and walls were only done so by a layer of crud. The rugs are stained as were the linens and everything is baby pink!! We paid $75 in the Priceline scam and got hosed (especially after seeing some got it for $29). If you don't mind filth and want a roof over your head for minimal $$$, go for it - otherwise, cough up the money for a decent hotel.

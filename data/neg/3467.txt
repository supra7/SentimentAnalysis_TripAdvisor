My husband and I were very excited to celebrate our first wedding anniversary at this hotel as this was the first time for either of us to stay in a luxury hotel. I will say that the hotel itself was very nice and well kept, however, the service we received and our room were below our expectations. Several days in advance, I requested that upon arrival for there to be sparkling cider in our room. Once we arrived, it wasn't in our room and I had to call guest services to get room service to deliver it. We were charged the full amount and not even issued an apology. Additionally, there was a giant crack in our tub that was causing water damage below and around the tub itself and made us unable to take a bath, which is very aggravating when you are spending a romantic weekend away (especially since one of the main reasons we selected this hotel was for the garden sized tub). Furthermore, the breakfast was decent, but not what I expected from a luxury boutique hotel, as it was a very limited in selection. Lastly, the valet service was so backed up on Sunday morning when we checked out that we had to wait 20 minutes to get our car to leave and were unable to call in advance (they weren't accepting phone calls). Overall, I anticipated a smoother, worry-free experience and instead was unimpressed with the overall "value" of this hotel.

I stayed in this hotel for four nights and I couldn't wait to get out of it. There was no atmosphere or buzz around the place. The rooms were dark and painted in dull dreary colours and the furnishings had no hint of colour either. I was on a very high floor and you would never see any other guests around the corridors. To be honest it was really creepy and eerie. I also found the receptionists unhelpful. When I asked how to get to the big shopping centre I was told I would have to get a taxi which would be expensive, when in fact two streets over I could get the train for a few dollars that would take me there. I only found out this by accident while chatting to a chauffeur outside the hotel. There isn't much to do in Dallas unless you have a car. On my experience I would not recommend it to anyone the photos are very deceiving.

I stayed there four nights in December. I phoned and wrote to them a week before I arrived to say that I had surgery on a leg and needed a room near the elevator. I told this to the clerk when I arriuved and she confirmed it and said they had a room that would meet my needs. The room they gave me was the furthest room from the elevator on the floor ---at the very end of the hall. I objected and they said they were sorry for the inconvenience but would do nothing about it. The accomodations were quite old, with old furnishings and poorly maintained. Stay there at your own risk because the staff is completely uncaring. The lobby, which is your first impressiom , is great but it ends there.

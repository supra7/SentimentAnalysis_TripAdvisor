I did a lot of reading prior to booking this stay and I should have listened to the negative reviews. I'm very suspicious of the reviews that are stellar for this place, since I think that the best case stay could only get a three star at best. I booked us at the hotel 6 months in advance after looking at the pictures on their website and reading reviews. I decided to go with their best room. Upon arriving, we found ourselves at a place that is falling apart and had been kept in such poor condition over many years, that doubt that there is any way for them repair the place, other than just taking a wrecking ball to it. Book anywhere else and you'll get a better place. When we arrived, we found the hallways dark, dirty and the walls stained. The rooms were no better. The carpets were disgusting, furniture falling apart and the bathroom was dirty. I was not about to spend our hard earned vacation time and money in that room. I told the front of the situation and they were non responsive, they just didn't care. I promptly called another hotel and made arrangements, even though I would have to pay full price there. I would have saved myself a lot of money had I booked with the other hotel instead 6 months ago. I paid the price for taking a chance with the KBH. We went to the front, told them of the problem and the manager told me that they would not refund the required advance payment when I first booked this place. The assistant manager's response was that if they refunded the deposit to every unhappy customer, then they would go out of business. So in other words, they have our money and tough luck to us. Don't risk losing your hard earned money on them, book anywhere else on the beach.

I booked this hotel because of the Select Comfort beds. The price seemed competitive with others nearby. This hotel appears to have been built in the '50's or 60's' and remodeled several times. The room with the tub and commode is so tiny that it is not possible to close the door while using the toilet. The room consistently smelled of something like toilet bowl cleaner. I complained of a bathtub that drained extremely slowly and nothing was done to correct the issue. Each time I used the shower, water leaked out onto the floor. The select comfort bed controls did not work properly. The very old TV had no inputs for a DVD player. The desk in the room was spacious and the chair was very nice. There is no complimentary breakfast. The hotel restaurant required that one wait to be seated, but there was no host to do so. A waiter showed up after about 5 minutes to do the task. The fresh melon that was served was not edible because it was unripe. There was a great assortment of cereal available, but no milk. The pastry was the type that comes in cellophane bags. The bacon was excellent! What a breakfast for only $13!!! I would expect these conditions in a $40/night motel, not a $150/night Radisson!

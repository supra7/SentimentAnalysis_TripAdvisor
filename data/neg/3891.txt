I stayed at this hotel for three nights in March 2011. I travel to Boston several times a year, and decided to give this place a try. But other than the location, there is not much I can recommend about this place. This hotel is not inexpensive, and you should expect to pay for everything, including internet and parking. The location is OK if you want to be by the water. The hotel is undergoing a renovation, and there is no lobby to speak of. Unfortunately, they did not mention that on their website. Seems a bit deceptive to me. My room was in the rear of the hotel. The door of my room faced inward to a large open atrium. A couple of floors below was a dining area. The first night I was there, the dining area was hosting a banquet. With a large group of people, and a large open area with solid walls, and with the usual conversation level and clanging of dishes and silverware, it was quite noisy at night. Furthermore, the door to my room had a gap between the bottom of the door and the floor, which made for a lot noise at night when I was trying to get to sleep. Finally, I called the front desk about this situation, and was treated rudely and aggressively. Excuse me, but I was just trying to get some sleep, which I think is reasonable request and shouldn't cause such an unpleasant reaction on their part. Eventually I got up and rolled up a towel and put this in the crack of the door, which helped reduce the noise somewhat. The noise from the dining area was there in the morning during breakfast and again in the evening for dinner, but fortunately it wasn't as loud as it was that first night. Nevertheless, the abysmal attitude of their employees was something I won't forget. I'll be back in Boston a couple of weeks, but I won't be staying at the Marriott Long Wharf again.

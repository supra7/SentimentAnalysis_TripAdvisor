Just not what I expected after reading reviews on this site. Average room,fair view, hotel and pool areas definitely need some updating. I think for Hawaii, it must be okay, but I was not impressed. Food fair, butI did go to a restaurant that was absolutely to die for and I cannot remember the name of it! My husband will and I shall post back in the forum. We stayed 6 nights and I never even put my bathing suit on!!! It was extremely windy and the oceaan was FREEZING!!!!!!! Hotel employees do not bend over backward to help you (not rude, just not friendly). I wouldn't pay aagain to go to this resort or to be honest. anywhere in Hawaii....tooo many nice places in the Caribbean!

Don't do it... Strike 1). Cable tv does not work. Strike 2). If you book with an online service you get 2nd class treatment. Strike 3). Get to listen to an electric scrapper so they can replace the carpet. Strike 4). It's obvious they're running the joint with a Skelton staff- you cannot get help. Strike 5). Booked it with breakfast, but somehow they won't honor it. Strike 6). It's not clean... Again short staff would be my guess. If you want to stay at a nice place- my advise is take you money elsewhere!

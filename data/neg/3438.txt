One of the hottest days in Dallas yet no air conditioning in my guest room or the wedding ceremony and reception room. Upon arrival there was nobody at the front desk to check me in, the wedding planner helped me with my luggage up to my room, the wedding planner also helped me get to the rehearsal dinner and to a golf course the next day as there weren't any staff at the concierge desk either. There did not appear to be too much staff, probably all died from heat stroke, even the weding planner was looking a little hot.

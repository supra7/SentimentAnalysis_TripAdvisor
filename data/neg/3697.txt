This is absolutely not a four star hotel, it could pass for three stars. The breakfast is poor, the badroom worked only partly, the showercurtain had fungus and so did the silicone seem around the bad. Room and the whole hotel are constructed with cheap materials and service is poor. Beside this the locatation of the hotel is in one of this hyperclean finex nabourhoods very far out of Rome centre. We paid 107 euro for one night which is a ripoff. the hotel is not near the airport so you should ad 40 euros for the taxi because public transport is very difficult from this area. The website is mentioning a future gym and swimmingpool which are both not available and not in the planning soon.

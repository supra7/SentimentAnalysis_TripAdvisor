This hotel needs to be remodeled and cleaned up. We always go by trip advisor for recommendations for hotels when we travel. We were very disappointed after we checked in to this hotel. The reviews seemed pretty good but I don't know what they were thinking. My desk chair had blood stains on it and the bed skirt was all ripped. The whole place needs to be painted and remodeled. I would not stay here again and would not tell anyone else to.

Hotel Monaco is in a great location, rooms are large, decor is sophisticated and it has a lot of boutique hotel touches, e.g., wine reception in late afternoon. But the service is as uneven as a cobblestone street. One example: I wandered down to the lobby on a Saturday morning at 9:15 a.m. looking for coffee. The desk clerk told me that coffee service ended at 9 a.m. but she would see if there was anything in the kitchen. While I waited, another guest came by looking for coffee. This time another desk clerk brusquely told him "coffee service ends at 9 a.m. You can buy a cup in the restaurant." Same hotel, same day, different definitions of hospitality. The day before when I checked in at 10 a.m., the desk clerk told me "check in is at 3 p.m. You're room's not ready." Asked when it might be ready, she said "At 3 p.m." I asked if I could leave my bags so they could be brought to my room when it was ready. "You can check your bags, but you'll have to retrieve them yourself," she said less than helpfully. I left my cell phone number and asked to be called when the room was ready, Guess what? No call. My bags? The bellman was out when I returned at 5 p.m. My bags didn't get there for another half hour.

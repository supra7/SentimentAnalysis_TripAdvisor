we checked in around 8pm. There was blood on the door jam into the bathroom, mold on the ceiling, an abandoned building in the back, and rat traps on the balcony. The response from the front desk, when we told them about the smeared blood in the room: "housekeeping has gone home for the day." W etried a different room-this room had a hole cut into the wall, the baseboards were missing, mold on the ceiling. We checked out. we were afraid to leave our car in the parking lot, and our luggage in the room during the day. We found a Days Inn for the same price on the east side of Memphis that was totally fine.

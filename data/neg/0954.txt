My stay at this hotel was not all together terrible. But not pleasant, especially considering it is pricey for a what amounts to a Red Roof Inn. It feels like you are in half-way house with the amount of rules and regulations posted everywhere, it is very loud with a major highway just feet (literally) away and the hotel was torn apart due to renovation. I knew I had mande a mistake the minute I arrived. i had stayed at other inexpensive Seattle hotels before and had very good luck. Anyway, the real problem i encontered was a misc $50 charge on my card. i called the hotel and the owner/ manager told me he would look into it and call me back. An hour went by. Now, i don't know about you but when there is a $50 charge that was not authorized on my bill, i want to know what it is right away. I called back and he told me that he was busy and would get back to me the next morning. NO CALL. I called back. He became very agitated and told me that it would be... the following week until he could look it up. Now how ridiculous is that? He then hung up on me. i called back immediately very upset and told him i wanted answers now. He responded to that by saying, "I will do nothing. The charge stands." You go ahead and give him your credit card. GOOD LUCK!

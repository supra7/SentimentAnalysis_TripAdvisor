Easy to find, not so easy to sleep Budget hostel very close (approximately 10 minute walk with backpacks) to the Frankfurt HbF. We stayed for 1 night in a 4 person room with no bathroom. Small, sweltering room with a severe lack of ventilation and facing onto an extremely noisy street in frankfurts redlight district. For a few dollars more next time i think we will stay in a hotel (e.g. hotel apollo) rather than this place again.Pros:-------- Very close to frankfurt HbF and lots of facilities at hand (pub, fast food, cash points, supermarkets, sex shops)- Clean, bright rooms- Clean Shared bathrooms- Cheap  Secure with 24hr receptionCons:--------- Hordes of homeless people, drug addicts and general low-lifes making one hell of a racket in the street front (at the flop-house across the road from the hostel) 24hrs a day. Its a hilarious street-show out your window at 3pm but at 3am its pretty annoying = no sleep!- Sex-show nightclub on groundfloor right next door to hostel entrace playing horrible techno music til 4am = no sleep!- No airconditioning or climate control whatsoever in the teeny tiny room means that you have to open the windows to stop from sweltering in the humid german summer conditions. Closed window = sweltering room = no sleep! Open Window = noisy street activity = no sleep!- Unenthusiastic, indifferent front desk staff you need a shoehorn to prise a smile out of let alone any useful information about the surrounding area!

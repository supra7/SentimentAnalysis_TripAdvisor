I stayed here a while back on a solo trip. The walls in my room were paper thin and I could hear all the things my neighbors were doing. One night I had quiet neighbors. One night they seemed to be sports fans and were loud for a little while after coming back from a game or something pretty late at night. The other night they were probably college age kids watching tv part of the time, went out and came back multiple times with slamming doors and were up making a lot of noise until at least 2 or 3 am talking loudly, watching tv, squealing, "dissing" each other etc. I didn't mind the small rooms. I mean how much room do I really need for my bag and I'm out most of the day anyway? The decor was fun and interesting. But if you happen to get noisy or inconsiderate neighbors you're in trouble here since the sound insulation is completely terrible. They really shouldn't even have TVs in the rooms since you can hear your neighbors tvs even at what is probably moderate volume. I survived it, but probably wouldn't stay here again after my sleep loss here. It's central and a good location, but yeah, I really would like to sleep in my hotel room not be kept up by strangers in the next room.

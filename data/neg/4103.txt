1 - Paid upgrade for a room through Travelocity and was denied the upgrade upon check-in. Explanation was "we do not guarantee upgrades when you book online, our customers have priority". We then asked to be refunded for the upgrade we paid for and were told to contact Travelocity, that they were not responsible. 2 - Internet service @ $12.95 per day!!! ---> Hidden charge. 3 - Parking @ $38.00 per day!!! ---> Hidden charge. I strongly recommend you avoid this hotel. However, Boston is a fantastic city, you should go visit, we will go back.

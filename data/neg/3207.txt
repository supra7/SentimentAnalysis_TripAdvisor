Stayed here for a week to attended a course program. No welcome drinks, small room, no swimming pool, bad foods (have same menu for breakfast, lunch, dinner for a week stayed), bad coffee break snacks. You need to walk about 10 minutes to get the MRT station. The only thing I like from this hotel was the fresh air outside the hotel.

I stayed at the Hotel for one night on a Sunday night. I did not have reservations. The Hotel looked nice from the outside and the interior looked nice (new). I checked in past midnight. The clerk was not very attentive. She acted like she really didn't want me there. While I was unloading my car, a drunk male was wondering the parking lot. I told the desk clerk and she acted like she could have cared less. I parked in front of the Hotel in view of the front desk windows. The next morning I went out to my car about 9:30am to find that my passenger side window had been smashed and the trunk had been opened. Thank goodness I had taken everything out of my car except some drapery ($300) that I had bought. They stole the drapes, and even my cell phone charger. Come to find out 3 other cars had been broken into as well that night. I spoke to one of the other victims and she said the Hotel was bad and they were checking out. She said thier room had also been burglarized. I filled out an incident report with the hotel. They said someone would get in touch. They finally called me at 3:45pm to tell me that they were sorry the incident had happened and that they were not responsible. The Hotel should have provided secruity!

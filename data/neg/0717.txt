We stayed here right before Christmas to attend a Seahawks game. We thought we would be out of the downtown fray, which was true but there were some issues. The good: Restaurant 6-7 is fantastic for dinner with great service. The atmosphere is very modern and chic and the view is beautiful. Most hotel staff were friendly and helpful. A fairly long walk to Qwest field. Rooms were clean but fairly small. The bad: Cityside rooms are 100 yards from the train (which goes by approx. 3 times per hour) you can actually feel the vibrations. The cityside rooms are also above the entryway and valet parking which make things pretty loud. Definitely need a waterview room unless you are a very sound sleeper. The ventilation in the room sounds like tennis shoes in a dryer. The beds were slab-like. Cleaning service entered our room even though we had a do not disturb sign out. The surreal: Breakfast a 6-7 at 6 am with blaring trance rave music, (literally no staff), a great continental buffet with no serving utensils. Then the music morphs into 50s holiday music and ramps up to house bar music. Hmmmm.

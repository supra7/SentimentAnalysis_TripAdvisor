Helpful travel hint: the Clarion hotel on Canal street in NOLA has a lobby that smells like a mix of dead mice and manure, and the abandoned store next to it has an alcove entrance that is apparently the official outdoor urinal for street people. Our bathroom, Room 508, was disgusting. The shower was filthy and appeared to have mold on the walls. If you are seeking such ambiance, the Clarion is the place to be!If you are seeking such ambiance, the Clarion is the place to be! I paid 125.00 for THIS? I will NEVER stay in one of the Choice hotels again. I'm shredding my Choice Privileges card. La Quinta--or practically anywhere else-- here I come!

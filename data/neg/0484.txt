the directions to the inn were bad enough. Then, the employees still can't give decent directions to their own parking garage- and I know that we weren't alone because other visitors were driving around looking for it also. Finally, "simple" directions to the Zoo "10 minutes away" turned into a 45minute wild goose hunt. THANKS A LOT... :P

I was given specific quotes over the phone, verified them twice before arrival. Upon arrival, the manager raised the price and would not give me two reciepts for two separate transactions because he wanted to save a buck (.50) . He raised the room price by 10.00 for each night. He was loud, rude and very unfriendly. I heard him even yelling at other customers. They stated they had another company to run the bus/van to airport/downtown, when in fact it is their own van, own employees, who rasied the price again. He again, wanted to squeeze in too many people, busting our bags, in order to save a trip that 5 of us were told we would have a van to ourselves. (Phone conversations should be taped). Not only did the rooms smell but they were dirty. Sheets had stains all over them, towels had blood stains. The manager argued with me to the point where he was yelling and not allowing me to talk. Refrigerator smelled like something died. The other staff were friendly and even verified the conversation, but the manager was totally disrespectful. Always get the name of the person you speak with as this helped me verify. I will never stay here again, unless they get rid of the manager. His name is Parnit. the address is 13910 International Blvd. Seattle. WA

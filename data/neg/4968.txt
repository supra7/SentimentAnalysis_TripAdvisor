The first thing that hits you when you enter the hotel is the overpowering smell of cigarette smoke. Even in my no-smoking room the smell of smoke is strong enough to make your eyes water! The staff are unfriendly and inefficient. The room is small but cosy and at first glance, clean. It is when you start to look closely that you see the small stains on the towels and bedding, the corners in the bathroom that have been missed.... The biggest problem was the shower that did not work! A point to remember is that this hotel is very far from the strip, though there is some local entertainment. However, as I paid next to nothing for the room it was suffiecient for an overnight stay.

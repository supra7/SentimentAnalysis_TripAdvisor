This is a very ill-kept place. The carpet in the room was so dirty that it painted my socks and feet black as I walked around. The bathroom was barely ok, I dared not sit on the chair, and the bed was suspicious. And it's certainly not in the price range where this is the norm. The breakfast is a joke, even if you get a chance to sit in the "dining room" that can only seat about four people, I suggest going to the mall on the other side of the road for a quick bite. During my stay the "menu" was lukewarm coffee, orange juice, and individually packaged magdalenas. As for the location, UW is very close, but not much else in Seattle is.

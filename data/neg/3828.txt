My husband and I travel to Baltimore several times a year. This time we decided to splurge and try Henderson's Wharf Inn. The price of the room with tax was over $300 for a "cobblestone view" (think street) but it had gotten good reviews so we decided to go for it. The room was nice but you had to keep the blinds shut to keep passersby from looking in. This made it seem rather cave like. Our next surprise came when we returned from a late dinner to find that the TV control did not work. After a long wait--the sign said the desk clerk was away helping other customers who I guess were having problems as well--the clerk returned. She came to the room but couldn't fix the problem so we were stuck with CNBC all night. The next morning we awoke to discover there was only one bath robe in the closet, not enough bath towels for the both of us and a coffee maker but only decaf coffee. In desperation, I got dressed and trooped down to the continental breakfast area to get some coffee. It turned out to be barely warm. We complained to the desk clerk when we checked out but she said there was nothing she could do. Only the manager could help us and he was out of town for two days. I asked to have the manager call. That was almost a week ago. I am not holding my breath.

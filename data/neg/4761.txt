Booked this trip through Priceline, Paid right at $90 for King Room. First, Be aware you will pay $21-29 for overnight parking. Second, the room was TINY, I have actually never seen a room that small. Third, in the bathroom, the Tub was dirty, drain was broken and shower head dirty and corroded to the point that the water streams go all over the place. Toiulet looked like it was wiped with a dirty rag. They were nice enough to have 2 bottles of Auquafina water in room for the low price of $4.00. Internet is $14 a day. There was a small yapping dog visiting in a room across the hall for your protection, He listened for any suspicious sounds to warn you of, and was very alert thru-out the night. Be aware they have a very nice gift shop, which only charges $4.47 for Auquafina water every price was like 20% more than Airport prices!. Room service is available for a $3.50 delivery charge 13% Tax and 22% surcharge, 19% gratuity automatically added for your convenience so you won't have to calculate based on them knowing in advance the superb service you will have. Very disappointed.

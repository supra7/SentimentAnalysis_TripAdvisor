As a Fairmont President's Club Premier Member, we were upgraded to a 950 square feet Park Suite. Space is nice, but age of the hotel showed. Dings, dents and the only internet access was at the desk in the bedroom with none in the living room meaning that I would awaken my wife early in the morning to get any work done. Bathroom has no forced air heat or a/c outlet and, with 20 degree weather outside, it was pretty darned cold. Housekeeping great, however, and empty fridge in pantry was nice. Service personnel, other than the "Oak" rooms (see below), are outstanding, but the resident Labrador Retriever, Catie, has a bit of an attitude (strange for a Lab!) The Oak Room and Oak Bar are another story. Waiting 15 to 20 minutes for a drink in the Oak Bar most nights was such a hassle that we bypassed it. Dinner in the Oak Room was ok, but not spectacular and the table was too small for all the plates. Gave up on breakfast Sunday morning as it took 10 minutes for someone to take our names and to inform us of at least a 20 minute wait. Decamped to the Westin Copley Place and were seated at once. Monday morning breakfast was outstanding in quality, but non-existant in service. Muslim "Steve Martin" in a busboy named Mohammed, who informed us 10 minutes later, that he "forgot" our request for cream and did not replace the cold coffee with hot. Waiter was "slower than molasses in January" and about as enthusiastic as a dead fish. Bottom line is that if you want a "Grand Dame" with a long history and a "name", go over to the northwest corner of Arlington and Newbury Street and check into the renovated and refreshed Ritz-Carlton where you can have a heated bathroom, a drink on demand and breakfast that can be served in under two hours. The Fairmont (former C.P. Hotels) properties in Canada are better managed than most of them in the U.S. Chicago being the outstanding exception. No more, no way, never again and sorry to say it.

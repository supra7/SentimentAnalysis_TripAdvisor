When we arrived the ceiling in the lobby was falling down, mold and mildew everywhere, including the hallway and room. The pool was rough on the bottom and my 8 year old daughter cut her toe while in pool. Does not look like picture!! We had four day reservations, we stayed one night. Left grossed out the next day. We did get our money back from reservation easily. There were drugged out low lifes everywhere. Don't stay here!!!

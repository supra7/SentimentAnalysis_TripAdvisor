My husband's truck was broken into in the parking lot. They did major damage to the door and demolished the dashboard to get to the radio. The hotel told us they had a security guard and a video camera on the parking lot, but I when I called the hotel manager, Sandra E. McGregor, and left her a message asking if we could see the video, she never called back! They obviously lie, and I suspect one of their own employees is involved in the thefts as I read on this site that someone had their car broken into there last October. And this hotel simply doesn't care as they can't be held legally responible...the front desk people practically snickered at us when we told them what happened. My husband has been staying there a lot for work, a loyal customer, but they didn't care. We left immediately to a safer hotel. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL IF YOU VALUE YOUR CAR AND BELONGINGS.

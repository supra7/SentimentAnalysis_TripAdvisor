We stayed there and it was MILES from EVERYTHING! When we had called to reserve the room he told us that the building was over 50 years old but had been COMPLETELY re-modeled. NOT TRUE. Some stuff had been but not most. They had a young daughter working at the counter who knew nothing and couldn't even give me $2.00 in change for the dang pop machine that cost i believe $1.00 per canned pop. There was toilet paper in our microwave. The room was a mess. We got there 2 hours after the check in time and both rooms WERE NOT READY! The male that ran the motel was RUDE. The motel sits in the ghetto. BAD part of town. There was always a big gang outside under the trees. SCARY. There was litter all in parking lot and all around. The motel sits next to an OLD crematorium and OLD hospital (which was kind of neat but run down). I honestly WOULD NOT recommend this motel to ANYONE. There was stuff on the sheets and pillows. Hair in sink and tub. Rust in tub. Toilet was dirty. It was just all around nasty. BUT OTHER THAN OUR MOTEL... Memphis was AWESOME!

Just stayed at this hotel this past Saturday... The service was awful! We had a bachelorette party and rented 4 rooms and a Suite. So needless to say we were spending a lot of money here. We all met in the Suite before going out. The hotel came to our room at 9:30 pm with a noise complaint. Everyone immediately left the room and went back to there own room. We decided we could meet out front. I was very nice to the hotel staff that came up to give the complaint. I apologized for this and let them know this would not happen again. We got ready and went out. When we came back we saw that they had come into our room and took the alcohol we had. That's stealing. We are all in our 30's not 12 years old. Then when checking out they charged us to comp the room next to us.. We only got one complaint and then left. There were not multiple complaints.. We were guests also. If there had been multiple complaints I totally would understand! Besides all of this the people working here were extremely rude all over. There are way to many hotels to stay at in the city to be treated like this. NOT WORTH STAYING HERE!

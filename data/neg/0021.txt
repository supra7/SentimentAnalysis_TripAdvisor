The Warwick Seattle is generally shabbier than I expect from a 3.5-star hotel: the carpets on the stairs leading to the second floor are dingy and worn, the lobby is tiny, the furniture in my room looked dated, the hotel exterior looked dated, the coffeemaker in my room had some rust on the heating element. All of these things added up to a hotel that seemed as though it peaked in 1988 and has been in a state of decline since. I was also given a terrible room: on the second floor (207), with banquet staff passing by my door constantly, the neon lights of the Cinerama just outside of my window, and listening to buses drive by all day and night. It felt like I was sleeping in a bus terminal. When I asked for another room, I was told that I would have to pay more for anything better (though the hotel hardly seemed busy). Perhaps those who stay in the executive suites have better luck, but this really felt to me like a 2-star experience.

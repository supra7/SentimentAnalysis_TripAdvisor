I won't be staying here again. Next time I'll pay a little more for a better hotel. First, the positive: The location is really great. A block to Boston Common. Arlington T stop right out the front door. Decent breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. The facility itself is old and charming. And the bad: Our room was very, very small, particularly the bathroom. No pay-per-view. Very noisy. We could hear very clearly the toilet in the next room when flushed. Lots of street noise. The maid service was the worst. The first day, I read the sports page in the bathroom. The newspaper was never picked up. The trash can in the bathroom was never emptied. We returned from out first day of sightseeing. The bed had been made, but that's the only way we could tell the maid had been there. The towels and wash cloths had not been replaced (even the ones on the floor). Same thing the next day. Used up the shampoo, not replaced. We got a very good deal on the room on another website. But in hindsight I wish I had paid more and gotten a better hotel.

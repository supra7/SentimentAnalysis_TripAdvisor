The Sheraton is downtown Dallas is probably fine for some business travel, but it was certainly dissappointing to us. The self parking is poorly located and you must awkardly pull your luggage up some stairs to the outside street. The rooms are dated and small. The TV did not work well when we got to the room either...however, the hotel staff did respond quickly to address it. For the same money, there are many other better options nearby.

stayed for a conference this past weekend, and other reviews are correct. rude staff, roaches, food left in the hallways,uncovered and not picked up. A rat spotted in the kitchen. Inept staff demanding us to bring our dirty towels down to the desk in exchange for clean towels (never ever had to do this in any hotel I've ever stayed in!) Stayed a total of 5 days and housekeeping staff only came by ONCE to take our trash and replenish supplies. My girlfriend stayed 4 days here and she never saw housekeeping once. Once these issues were brought to staff management, we were told we were making it up. Tried to get some paper plates to put our ordered pizza on one night and the bartender said we would have to pay per plate because, her quote, "well it costs US money to get these plates".

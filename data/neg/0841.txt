I have been a frequent guest at this hotel, but no more. Its service and amenities no longer justify the rates they charge. The rooms are worn, and the dining selection is abysmal. I was particularly disturbed that the lobby is no longer a place where you can relax and enjoy the scenery. One afternoon during my recent stay I took some work down to the lobby, to esacpe the monotomy of my room. After a time, two security guards came and surrounded my chair and asked me what I was doing there. Aside from wasting $250 a night, I couldn't really tell them. I fully understand that hotels have security issues, but this was ridiculous. I have been a guest at this hotel many times over the years, and am always well-dressed and well-groomed, but a single man is evidentially suspect in their view. Their bullying tactics are more suited to a lower grade hotel, which is why I will take my business to the Olympic from now on.

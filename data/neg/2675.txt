We scheduled this trip at the last minute and this hotel was available. I had always had positive experiences with Clarion Hotels in the past, so I booked a room in this one. Our plan was to eat in the French Quarter, sleep there that night and head to the coast. We never left the hotel. Parking was two blocks away and we HAD to pay $22 for valet service. There was no way that we were going to walk anywhere in that neighborhood, especially at night. I asked other people in the lobby, if they planned to walk anywhere that night. One of them stated, "No, it was scary enough in the daytime."

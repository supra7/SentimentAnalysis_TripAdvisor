This hotel is reasonably quiet with nearly all the rooms well off the main road. Tea and coffee are provided in the rooms and the en suite is adequate but the single pillow resembled granite. However, it is the breakfast that is truly memorable and redefines the word 'Continental'. You'll come down to the vilest coffee you ever tasted and sadly, there is little to repair your damaged taste buds. Why not start with the vast array of cereals - corn flakes or rice krispies? Follow it up with the indifferent 3 for a pound yogurts. Round off your breakfast experience with the cheapest and least appetising white bread money can buy, together with the meanest choice of accompaniments you'll ever clap eyes on - apricot jam, processed cheese and processed meat (one type only). This was the worst breakfast I've ever had anywhere and I cringed at the thought of what all the foreign guests must be left thinking of British cuisine.

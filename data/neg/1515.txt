Travelled with collegaues and stayed at this location, hotel would be the incorrect description. Whilst I found the staff friendly, my room was depressing, yellow woodchip wallpaper, sheets and blankets, crittal windows with secondary double glazing, it was like stepping back in time, it was all rather horrible really. Breakfast was continental!! the choice was stale white bread with either jam or marmalade, cornflakes, orange juice, stewed tea or coffee which was ok. there was also Mr Kipling Apple Pies for breakfast and lemon cake which I mistook for a bread and put in the toaster, didn't realise until i was offered it one evening with my coffee. Could be a really nice hotel if only they would spend some money on it, excellent location for exhibitions - real shame really but it is their loss at the end of the day.

We stayed here from 8:30 pm till 6:am because it was next to the airport & we had a layover. We ordered the over priced room service food & it was terrible. Then to top things off the toilet was pre-clogged & overflowed when flushed. After about an hour after calling the front desk & speaking to a rude woman, an asian janitor arrived to help. He was nice enough but did not speak english, & as it turned out he didn't know what he was doing because the toilet didn't flush in the morning either. What a great layover thanks to Hilton for a room we paid $190 for. At least they did have comfortable beds & nice sheets. When we checked out & complained when asked how our stay was, we were offered a $50 discount on our next stay. Did not accept & never stayed at a Hiton since.

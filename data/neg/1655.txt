My Husband and I stayed at this hotel whilst we were on our honeymoon in Aug 2007 and were so disappointed that we moved back to the Hyatt in Waikiki (which is amazing). I cannot believe that these two hotels are part of the same chain! The hotel itself was dark and outdated and the staff not very friendly or helpful. Our Room was small with a partial ocean view! (if you could call it that!). The room was really outdated and the communal areas and hallways were a disgrace. Wallpaper hanging off the walls. Dirty marks etc. We only stayed 3 nights and felt that was too many. The way this hotel is described in brochures is a complete lie!! Take our advise and don't stay here!

unprofessional front desk in fact, it is a good place to stay, just in the middle of everything, there is just one thing. Do not ask the front desk anything because they do not know anything. I was surprised about there ignorance. I used the wifi in the lobby, so I caught some conversations with people with question or remarks, and sometimes they were just rude to people. I stayed for four night and finally, indeed I got my share as well so, you can go to this hotel, but skip the front desk.

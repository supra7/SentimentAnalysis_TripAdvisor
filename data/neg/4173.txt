We used the Priceline and I called to make sure we got a king size bed non smoking. They were extremely nice and accomodating to confirm my wishes without any problems. The room was nice big the double head showers were a plus. the only problem is there was no ac. They gave us a fan to hold us over. Other then that the staff was great and we had a nice time. The Bar is pricey. A coors light and corona was 10.00 but we went to Fenway and Paid 6.00 each so I guess it Boston. But I would stay again.

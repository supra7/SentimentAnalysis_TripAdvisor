I just stayed at the W Hotel in Seattle and was completely underwhelmed with the whole experience. Right from the beginning, I was shocked at the service. There were at least six valets but they couldn't seem to manage traffic and they didn't even bother to help us with our luggage. The guy at the door seemed distracted by his secret-service head piece and didn't even open the front door for us as we struggled with our bags. At the front desk, the woman who checked us in was really unfriendly, the lobby was a total mess (pillows everyone, empty glasses, an empty water pitcher and no sign of anyone replacing the water). I thought at least the rooms would be great, but we walked in and it looked like a Holiday Inn had been refaced with a plasma TV and some black and white photography. It was tiny, incredibly loud, the carpets weren't very clean, there were blinds instead of blackout shades, and the bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on in a "4 star" hotel in my life. Long story short, I was REALLY disappointed and will not stay at a W again.

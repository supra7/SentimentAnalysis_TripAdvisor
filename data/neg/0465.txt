We recently stayed in the Hilton and as the name and reputation would suggest we treated ourselves. Unfortunately we should not have bothered, the foyer was very impressive and the staff friendly but the room was a real let down. I found the hotel overpriced and the accomodation was no better than your average $100 hotel, the bathroom needed replacing, the water came out yellow at first and really smelt! We left early in the morning as we had to catch a train to Vancouver B.C so did not have time to complain, but thought this would be a good way of letting people know not to stay here.

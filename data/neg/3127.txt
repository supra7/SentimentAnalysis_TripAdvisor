Before I start I left my comments with the management on departure so they already know..but I might add have not responded. Room not clean...cupboard had heaps of dust around the built in safe also behind and under bed dusty and well as rubbish left from other stayers. Small cockroaches running around floor at night and in bedside drawer. One night I woke to find two small ones run over my hand near my pillow. Could heard toilet flushing all night from other rooms and also conversations in other room. The only good thing about the place is that it is handy to Paddy's Market..just outside the back door....Chinatown and Powerhouse Museum and walking distance to Darling Harbour. In fact not far to most things but I would not attempt to walk to circular quay from there. We moved to another hotel after 5 days (Rydes) which was soooo much better and more central.

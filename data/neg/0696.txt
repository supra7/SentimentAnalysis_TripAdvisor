Albeit the room looks nice and has a nice bed. The furniture made out of fake animal parts is not to my personal taste, but some people like it. The Internet makes it look way nicer and larger. The room was tiny by my standards. This room cost us $393.00 CDN. Plus we were charged $30 US plus taxes for parking, and they charged us $1 US for each toll free call. I've stayed at fancier hotels than this but at least I felt I was getting value for the $. It was 30 degrees C outside and the air conditioner wouldn't work. The housekeeping staff had their bins out in the hall way into the evening and back at 5 a.m. with so much commotion they woke us up. Also this hotel is away from it all so if you are disabled or older, you'll need to use transportation to get to Pike St. Market. We also had a lot of hullabaloo in the morning on the pier next to us, a cruise ship coming in at all. That I didn't mind at all, it was part of the experience of staying at a hotel on a pier. We really enjoyed our late afternoon happy hour in the lounge. Out on the deck in the sun with the breeze in our hair; great friendly server and good food and drinks.

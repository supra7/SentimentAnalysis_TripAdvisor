Just recently, we went on our first Disney World vacation in three years. We were really excited and for the first three days, my husband, our son, and me all stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge (which, by the way, was awesome)! Then, my mom and sister flew in and we decided to stay at a different resort. We read reviews and saw that it was listed as one of "Expedia's Insider Selects" so we decided to book it. I guess the first thing that should have "tipped me off" that we were in for an awful stay was that it took over an hour to get into our hotel room. Although it was spacious and clean when we first got there, that was about the only time that it was cleaned. Maid service did not come in clean for over half of the time that we were there despite several phone calls to management. Then, on our last night there, maid service finally came in and cleaned sufficiently. They even gave us a rug for the master bathroom. I'm not sure why it wasn't there the entire time we were in the room, but whatever. I know that staying at this place put a damper on our stay. I am so upset about this stay and I would definitely not recommend anyone else to stay there. I still do not feel relaxed due to this stay and I am still furious. So, save yourself and your family the trouble and stay somewhere else. As my husband said, a lower end hotel would have been better than this place.

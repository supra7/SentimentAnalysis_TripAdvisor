The Westin Seattle tarnishes the Westin brand and reputation. This hotel is in dire need of a complete remodel. It lacks character in the rooms and halls and feels like a high rise college dorm that was built in the 70's. The carpet, bathroom, and baseboards in my room showed considerable wear and tear. The ventilation system needs to be cleaned. When I turned it on, the room had a stale odor and I woke up with a horrible headache. As a Starwood Gold member, I expected a nicer room. Instead of the king I reserved I was given two double beds in a room that was not on an SPG member floor. Service at the front desk was indifferent. I felt that the staff was not friendly and did not appreciate guests. The service in the restaurant (Coldwater Bar and Grill) was just awful. The food was even worse. The server rushed me even though the restaurant was empty at 7 pm. He gave me my check while I was only halfway through my entree and never checked in with me about my meal. Given this experience, I guess other guests were clued in not to eat there. The lobby bar experience was so so. The area was cold with an air conditioner blasting even though it was 45 degrees and raining outside. The sofas and chairs were very worn with springs that gave way. The by the glass wine list was very limited - a disappointment given that there are so many wonderful wineries near Seattle. Needless to say, I will not stay at the Westin Seattle again and have canceled the reservation I made for my next trip to Seattle. I will stay at another Starwood Seattle property because of my loyalty to the brand.

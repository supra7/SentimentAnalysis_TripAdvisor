There were plumbing problems in my room. Also dirty floors and walls. Staff was rude, and no free breakfast, not even cereal or bagels. They sell "brown bag" breakfasts for six bucks each. What a joke! It's both cheaper and better to dine at the Jack In The Box across the street. I'm a frequent visitor to Dallas, there's much better places to stay than this.

Where to start! The rooms are tiny for a hotel asking $S265 a night. The bed is terrible, paper thin sheets, a plastic mattress and one tiny blanket. We froze, even with the AC turned up. The washbasin was blocked, and the shower floods the bathroom floor. We had a DVD player but no remote. The pool area was still locked 45 minutes after advertised opening time. Wifi cost a staggering $18 for 24 hours (I bought a Singtel card giving phone calls and 1Gb of data for the same amount). Even the terminals in the lobby cost the same amount. Wear ear plugs in the breakfast cafe because the noise is truly deafening. The front staff never smile and are very unhelpful. The cleaning staff are helpful and friendly. Smell of cigarettes despite smoking ban. I will never stay at this hotel again.

During a tour of the Pacific North West, we had pre-booked a junior suite at a rate of c.$470 per night. Upon arrival at the 21st floor, the musty smell of neglect and tobacco (in spite of its smoke-free claims) hit us. The suite turned out to be 2 adjacent (not adjoining) rooms which were dark, unclean, uncared for and just plain shabby. The bed base was stained, the bathroom was tiny and had no separate shower and the general facilities (incl. an ancient t.v.) were more befitting a cheap motel. We immediately compained and asked for a more modern suite, only to be told that none was available, with an added confession that the hotel was "overdue for renovation". To their credit, the manager and desk clerk dealt with us in a courteous and professional manner, and called the Pan Pacific for us, which it turned out, was far superior, more spacous, clean and beautiful and due to its recent opening, much cheaper ($291). As a result of this experience, we immediately cancelled our booking for the Westin in Vancouver (later on our tour) and changed to the Pan Pacific, which was yet again superb. Sadly, i think Westin are sliding downhill and resting on laurels of former glory....simply not good enough in today's market!

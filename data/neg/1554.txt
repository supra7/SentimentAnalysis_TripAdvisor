This is a new hotel and I cam here for a conferece. When I went in the the shower curtains had blood stains on them(GROSSE) and then the second room had Mildew stains on the tub. Then the third room the bed sheets were dirty. For a 4 star hotel the cleaniness was disgusting. I dont know why anyone would want to stay there. I would not stay there again. I will tell you that....BLOOD STAINS.

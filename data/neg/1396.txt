We booked our trip moths in advance and called to make sure that our room was set up for our 20th anniversary. We had missed our flight and lost a days stay which the hotel charged us and we were ok with it due to us missing our flight. When we arrived there at 5 o'clock, they kept inisisting that we take a tour of the ocean front room and swim out rooms while we wait for our room. We looked at the rooms and they offered it to us at an additional $150 a night. We passed on it and proceeded to our room, much to our dismay, even though we brought our marriage certificate, the anniversary room was not even ready. We didn't put up a fuss, we figured that they would set it up the next day and they still didn't, my husband had to call the front desk and demand it. Our problem was this, we wanted to stay an extra day at the resort since we lost it and the hotel wanted to charge us $630 for our last nights stay! We needed that extra day because we extended our stay by a day because we lost a day. We ended up having to go to another resort for the one day because Secrets could only come down on the price of the room for $430 a night. We were disappointed because the resort was only at 50% capacity and they really didn't care about our satisfaction. I have Emailed the corporate site and no response. The resort was beautiful and the workers are very hospitable but when it comes to the front desk, they just don't want to or care to accomodate travelers as well as other hotels we have stayed at!

The foyer was fabulous but it ended there. The rooms were average, there was never an adequate internet signal despite advertising this as a free service. Booked twin beds and given a king and told that since this was how it was booked( through a travel service), it could not be changed?! Finally, we returned to our room to find the door propped open by housekeeping with no one in sight anywhere on the entire floor, no one returning after ten minutes, the room half cleaned and despite a call downstairs, a manager never appeared nor called to address our security concern. To add insult , the room was never cleaned nor were supplies replenished!

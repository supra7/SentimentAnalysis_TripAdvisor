Would have written a review for this hotel if we had actually been able to stay here. Booked this hotel through the web but were told we were double booked on arrival and that they would not offer an alternative. The staff were abrupt and unhelpful and insisted on passing the blame onto the agent. We were unable to contact the hotel, to confirm the booking prior to arrival, using either of the telephone numbers supplied by their websites. Instead we stayed at the Ramada on the north side of town which was a bit of a treck into town but the ran a courtesy bus and were courteous and helpful.

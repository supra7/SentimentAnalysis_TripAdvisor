Stayed here Monday 22/11. Paid 102 and as the rooms look okay it seemed a bargain. We arrived and the room seemed fine. But: the mattress was very cheap and soft and very uncomfortable. the air conditioning made a very load high pitched squeak all night and the walls creaked. the window had an ill fitting blind that didn't keep the light out. we had an inner room but the road noise was loud and wasn't helped by the poor quality window that didn't insulate noise (It was very difficult to sleep in this room.) the floor seemed damp hairdryer had to be signed for at reception I wished I'd paid a bit more and gone to Premier Inn.

We went for a wedding and when we checked in on Saturday around 4 pm we did not notice anything. We quickly got dressed and went to the wedding. When we arrived at 3 am we noticed hundreds of bugs on the bed!!!! HUNDREDS!! We asked to be switched and they were very slow to respond. THey expected us to stay the night there and deal with it in the morning!! After 30 minutes, our room was switched. Bad experience and no apology.

We found this motel on a website but we called to confirm the amenities before booking. we were assured there was a pool so I booked a room for 2 adults, 2 beds. When we checked in we were told the pool had not been working for months. Further the elevator did not work, and we were given a room with a double bed, not even a queen sized bed, for myself and my adult daughter. The shower was simply filthy-- there was mould in the door tracks and the grout. My daughter is a junior in college and we stay in hotels at the beginning and end of every quarter. So far we have never been disappointed but this place was the kind that you rent by the week on spokane's mean streetsThis was the worst two nights i have ever had in seattle.

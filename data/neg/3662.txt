I arrived at the Marriott Reforma hotel with my wife and 4-year old son at around 10PM. I identified myself as a Marriott Rewards Platinum member and presented my identification and confirmed reservation number. The front desk employees proceeded to let me know that they didnt have any reservations under my name. After a few minutes, another employee showed up to say that my confirmation number did show up in the system, but that I or my travel company had canceled the reservation and that there were no rooms available. I tried to explain that I had no reason to cancel my reservation specially when traveling with my family to a dangerous city, but the manager proceeded to confirm The hotel is overbooked and there is nothing we can do to help you. My family and I had to go find a new hotel at 11:30PM. I have traveled all over the world for 14+ years and I have never encountered a situation quite like this. Its frustrating to know that being a Marriott Rewards Platinum member with a confirmed reservation doesnt make a difference at this hotel. There are many professionally managed hotels in the Reforma area, don't take the risk!

I went to this hotel after reading some reviews and unfortunately the only one that i did not read was the only real one. For starting i can say that the adress is not correcty and i had trouble finding it because is not in the oposite side of the maktoum hospital. The staff at the lobby is very slow and not pleasant with costumers and about the hotel itself i can only say that i only stayed there for 3h and i left!! Rooms smell bad, the bathroom is a joke, air condicioner is very noisy and puts the air directly in your face and the worst of it is that there is a disco club rigth bellow so its impossible to sleep with the noise of the music and people on the street, with taxis pushing the horn untill 4am......i guess this was the baddest experience in my life and even some 8 hotels that i stayed in thailand were a lot better them this place. Even for a low budget i do not recommend this hotel to anyone.

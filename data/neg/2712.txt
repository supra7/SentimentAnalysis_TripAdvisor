The website where I booked did not tell me about the extensive renovations going on at the hotel. The entrance is reached via scaffolding steps up to the first floor, entering through a temporary doorway that must once have been a window. The only compensation for entering at this level is that there is one less floor to climb to your room since the lift is out of action. Stairs are narrow and winding, making it difficult, and potentially unsafe, for people with luggage. My single room was very small, about 6m x 2m. The furnishings were old and the shower room smelled badly. Workmen were noisily working in the room opposite me and the corridor was cluttered with building materials. While the renovated rooms looked fresher and more modern, they were still small. Once renovations are finished the hotel might deserve a higher rating but I would certainly not recommend this hotel while it is undergoing such extensive work - indeed, I feel that it should have been closed down during this work. Despite the hotel undergoing extensive work to the inconvenience of guests, there appeared to be no discount on the normal book price.

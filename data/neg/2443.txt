This is by far the worst travelodge I have stayed at - dirty, very noisy, and pretty basic. My first room was ground floor with a broken window that would not close, the second room super noisy. If you get a room relatively well located, serviceable and at one of the very low prices this place may be ok, but at 150 per night it most definitely is not.

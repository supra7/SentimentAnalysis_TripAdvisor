Hotel Rooms/service/location etc are all Good , but i will never choose that hotel again, why?!! Hi All, i got a room in the 4th floor of that building , but in the 3rd floor they have a dance/karaoke bar, that creating a heavy metallic sound the whole night , untill 3AM . i felt like my ears are blowing it out, ( as i am from india, these western music was making me more annoyed on top of losing sleep, may be westerners like these music/sound!). when i contacted their desk service , the reply was i can change the room to some other floor in the next day !!).

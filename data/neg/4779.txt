We were excited about the great price we got at hot wire, but we did not realize until arrival that there was a $30.00 parking fee per day. Our son in law went to the gift shop to buy candy. but when he opened the Reeses candy bar he discovered it was old. He asked for a refund and the sales lady said they had a no refund policy so he picked out another candy bar, of course it was rotten as well. Our grandchildren wanted to swim but the pool ws cloudy and had things floating in it. Our 6 year old granddaughter got in and said " Nanny, there is fur floating in this pool. It was clumps of hair. When you got out of the pool your skin ws slimy from the sun screen floating in the pool. Our 10 year old grandson was not about to get in and sat on the cabanna with us. He said be careful where you put your hands, there is pidgeon poop all over this cabanna. It was very nasty! On our second day we were all in our car and the valet said there was a problem with the account, and took the keys in with him while our entire family sat out in a hot car. Of course it was their mistake on a 108 degree day. The rooms were fine, but after every thing else that happened, you couldn't pay us enough to stay at this place again!

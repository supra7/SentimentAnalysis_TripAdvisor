When I arrived at around 10 am on a Monday morning, the not so friendly receptionist/checkin attendant told us they were fully booked and we would have to return after 3pm. After getting up at 4 am and leaving for a flight of 6 am, we were more than dismayed and in need of a shower, but what else were our options. After returning 5 hours later we got a room, but not the " Superior Double" we paid for [in advance btw] as they were over booked. We received a room with the view of a shaftway! and the bathroom was basically a part of the room that was separated by frosted glass. For here on in we had a negative view of this hotel. We complained and got another room, at least this room had a defined bathroom and sunlight. The next day we got the "superior double" *these words used to describe the room means NOTHING, so pls don't be fooled by their terms* it was bigger but still not what would be considered a 5 STAR hotel room. This room was larger and had a balcony over passeg de garcia but should not be considered a 5 star room. Other little annoyances, no printer for the "business center" how can i print my airline boarding passes No conditioner, no robes or slippers. ALso the gym (the term is used loosely( is subpar and the air conditioning did not work well so i used the elliptical in a warm 7 by 7 room!! don't be foole dby this so called 5 star hotel. OK so the few positives (hate to be so mean( the location is great as it's on the so called 5th avenue of barcelona and its a relatively short walk to las ramblas.. and the luggage boys were definately nice.

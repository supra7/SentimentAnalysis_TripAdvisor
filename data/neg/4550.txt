The best part about this hotel was the lobby. Beautifuly decorated and the ceiling was a sight to see, but it all stopped there. Though the service was impecable the room seemed like it hasn't been "updated since the 30's. If the TV would have been a flat screen and little bigger with more channels it may have occupied out time in the room a little better. The room was clean and housekeeping did a good job on the upkeep. I guess if we were 30 years older (we are in our 20's) it may have been fine. Our hallway also and on "off" odor. We also experienced Potters lounge. The atmosphere was great but the music didn't match the decor. The decor says 1940-1950 but the music was 2011. Chairs were comfortable and it seemed really nice inside. The drinks were very palatable and reasonably priced for the area. The food however was disapointing. The sliders were dry and flavorless, no point in using Wagyu beef if you are going to overcook and under season 80/20 would have been better, the peppercorn sauce was....???? Also, there really wasn't a proper bun to meat ratio way too much bun. We also tried the flatbread, it was a good flavor "profile" but very poorly executed. The crust was soft and a bit chewy and the lemon zest was clumped on top. If the line cook in back took the time to bake it properly and grate the fresh lemon zest evenly on the pizza we would have been in buisness. I don't expect much out of room service but we did order the parmesan fries and a bottle of champagne. The fries were old and not fresh and withought the company of the parmesan cheese. After the disapointment from Potters we should have known better but we were still hungry! I hope this helps whoever reads this and you might want to choose a different hotel.

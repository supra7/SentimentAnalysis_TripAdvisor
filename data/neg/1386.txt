This isn't the ritziest joint we've ever stayed in by any means, but at $44 a night it was a decent choice. The hallways had a funny smell, but the room itself didn't have any odours. The air conditioner was pretty loud and the shower stall wasn't as clean as we would have liked. The king size bed had only two small uncomfortable pillows. The breakfast buffet was pretty basic. My husband tried the waffles, pastries, and cereal and said they were all pretty lousy. There was a strange $3.39 "service charge" when we checked in, but we were too tired to argue about it. I think the worst part about the hotel is a tie between the shower stall and the bedside alarm that went off at 5 in the morning. That was really annoying. For the price we paid, it was worth a one night stay, but I was glad to check out and I probably wouldn't stay there again.

I arrived early Sat morning 11/08/07 and was informed check in was an noon. Since the early check in free was 10 euro and hour, I decided to leave my bags. The front desk said I could leave my bags in a room down the hall. I waited by the desk in front of that locked room for 15 mins, but nobody every came. Went back to the front desk and checked in since I was so exhausted. They made 40 euros or about $60 on the transaction. You pay an extra 10 euro a day for the health club. The restaurant food was poor quality. But if you walk across the street to the Holiday Inn their restaurant was far superior. The train station is a block away. Take the #4 light rail to city center (outside of the station/not on platform). Room was great' well designed for a small space and modern, but the add on charges and poor quality food really bring the experience down to an unacceptable level.

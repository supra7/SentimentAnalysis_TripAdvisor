I stayed one night and unfortunately I left something at in my room.I called as soon as I realized (about 5 hours after I checked out) and they did not find it. I know it is my responsibility to pack my own belongings but in the case where you may forget something, a guest should feel secure that hotel staff will do their job and submit the lost items to lost & found. Not so at this hotel. The item was left on the bathroom counter, an obvious place so there is no reason for it not to have been passed in. I cannot trust this place anymore, will never stay again.

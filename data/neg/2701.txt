I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and the Robert Ramon is the most overpriced I have ever been in. I went to Amsterdam with 2 friends. We reserved a triple room for 180 euros a night. The first thing that struck me was the sign outside the hotel with the official 3 star rating. The website clearly says it is a 4 star hotel. The lobby was very bland and plain. The elevator was not working. The room was the real kicker though. Their idea of a triple room is a single with 3 small beds. The third bed awkwardly placed without even a lamp on the bedside. The flat screen tv mentioned on the website is in fact a very small and cheap tv (Im including a picture). There were no cupboards or dressers to fit the clothes of 3 people. I complained to the receptionist and wanted to cancel my stay. Conveniently, the Robert Ramon charges for your full stay as soon as you check in. No wonder... they probably have to deal with a lot of clients who want their money back. I was told that I would not be able to get a refund for the first day as there is a 48 hour cancellation policy. I asked for a better rate for the second night and was told that when I booked I knew what the rooms looked like from the website. The rooms look nothing like in the website, never mind the false advertisement claiming it is a 4 star hotel. I go to Amsterdam often, I know the price of hotel rooms there; 180 euros goes a long way. I was ripped off. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Piet Hein, just 2 blocks away from the Robert Ramon.

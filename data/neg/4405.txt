The hotel location is excellent and the entrance, lobby etc are really nice. However the standard room we had was small, plain and very disappointing and did not live upto the impression created by the rest of the hotel. Hardly any space and no seats and no in room tea and coffee. We travelled for 3 weeks across North America and this was the most disappointing hotel. Our first night, after a long day travelling, was a nightmare. Between the band in the ball room which went onto 12.30, then the sound of the noisy airconditioning in the room. When we complaint, we got short shift and it was suggested outright that we were looking for an upgrade! After making it clear that we were after a good night sleep not an upgrade we eventually got moved. At least the air conditioning was silent in the new room.

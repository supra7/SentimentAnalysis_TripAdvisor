I was treated like a criminal at this hotel! It was the WORSt experience that I have had with hotel management. I paid in cash for my room at the beginning of the stay because I like to get the room paid for first. The hotel representative did not know what to do with cash and gave me a hand written receipt. He acted like a new employee. Upon check out, The hotel staff did not want to accept the receipt. I explained what happened. They made me wait 1 hour while they went through their camera tapes and it showed that I indeed had paid in cash and had been written on a receipt by their employee. I missed an appointment while waiting on them for an hour. I told them I was upset to be treated so rudely. The manager simply said , " You may go now." No sorry, No , I am sorry for your wait. No, I am sorry that we were wrong. Nothing. IN fact, he was very rude. He was wrong and he was rude! He was SO RUDE! This hotel was owned by Adam's Mark previously as service was superb! I wrote the hotel corporate office management and they said that they could not do anything and to simply check with the hotel management at the hotel where I stayed? Really? WORST CUSTOMER HOTEL SERVICE !!!!!!!!!!! Now I simply pay with a credit card and no hassles. I guess that is what they were trying to do. I guess that they wanted me to pay with my card so they treated me like trash because I did not follow their system. However, nothing was said about not paying with cash previously. It is so sad that RUDE customer service is becoming the norm now a days. It is sad that the hotel corporate office did not care or did not try to make amends. This just shows that they DO NOT CARE about their customers. The hotel furnishings were nice. The service was and is the worst ever! Customers BEWARE!

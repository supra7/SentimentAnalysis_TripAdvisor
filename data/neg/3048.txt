Me and sisters choose this hotel/apartment told that it was a 4* by ebookers. My word did we get a shock. We entered the building which was in a secluded area, the greeted with staff that looked and smelt disgusting!! Taken up to our room which was in an outbuilding to be greeted with two cockroaches, scurrying under the double bed. The bedding was clean but very worn out. The security men looked dody, the whole place just didn't feel right. Anyway at 11 o'clock, after a days flight we searched the main road for a hotel and came to the Four Points by Sheraton-and well we did enjoy Dubai after all. We all like to search for bargains-but i advise anyone, pay that bit extra for comfort and ease.

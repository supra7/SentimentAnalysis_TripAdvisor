Hotel was old, and we booked through Priceline.com so were happy what we recieved for the price we paid. However we have booked through priceline before and this is by far the worse hotel we have stayed at. The room was very small, lucky to fit a double bed in so if it was a queen the room would of been full, so now you know how big the room is. The staff at the hotel where fairly friendly and we didn't seem to have any problems. Our toilet was blogged and the staff where there within 5 minutes. The location of the hotel is great right in the center of Boston and you can walk easily to anywhere. Would we stay there again, No if I had to pay full price, if I book through Priceline, sure, it was a great deal for the price.

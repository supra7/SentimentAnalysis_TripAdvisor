Stayed here in January 2007 and booked sea view room. Have to say overall I was disappointed given the price of the room. The room itself was large but dated. Overall it gave me the impression that it was need of a major refurbishment. The bathroom was particularly dated although functional. The door came off its hinges when first opened, it was repaired promptly. The room lighting was not fantastic and one of the lights in room broke but was not repaired just removed. The actual view from the room was OK although nothing to write home about. Window is just a relatively small sliding window but directly onto the sea. Artificial effect log fires in room with large plasma TV. I did hear that some of the rooms on other floors had been refurbished so if you are staying then ask for one of these rooms. A friend of mine stayed on the other side of the hotel facing the road and was awakened most nights by the freight trains blowing their horns. On the positive side I thought the bar and the restaurant were OK with good views and attentive staff. Would find somewhere else next time.

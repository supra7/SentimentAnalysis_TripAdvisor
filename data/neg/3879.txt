My son and I stayed here for a weekend Oct. 27th - Oct. 29th. The first night I woke up at about 2am itching severely - cause - lots of bedbugs - and I mean lots - riddled with them. We called management who offered a $100 discount - pathetic. We were moved to another room - we were not even upgraded - I stay in Boston 2 weeks a month for business and was not impressed. I was not pleased with the way the management handled the problem and will therefore not ever recommend this hotel to any of my staff or anyone else. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!

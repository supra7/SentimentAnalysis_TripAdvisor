If you are choosing this hotel because of its amenities, please be aware that its shuttle DOES NOT run 24 hours per day. It begins at 5AM and runs every 45 minutes thereafter. Also, its restaurant is only open on weekdays. I chose this hotel via the internet for these 2 amenities and was sorely disappointed. I arrived on a Saturday night. All I wanted was to grab something to eat, soak in the hottub, get a good nights rest, then make it back to the airport for my early morning flight. Upon arrival I learned the restaurant was closed on weekends and the shuttle began at 5AM. I specifically asked how often it ran and was told "All day". I walked to a restaurant for dinner, then changed for a soak in the hottub...it was broken. Now if the broken hottub was the only thing that was wrong with this hotel, it would have been fine, but with everything else it just added to my disappointment. The next morning I arrived in the lobby at 5:10AM and was told the shuttle had just left. "No problem" I thought, "I'll just catch it when it gets back, right?"...WRONG! I was then informed that it ran every 45 minutes. Why the staff didn't tell me that when I asked the night before I'll never know. So, overall the hotel was average. The room was OK, and if their website and staff would have been more forthcoming with shuttle times and restaurant hours, I would have given them a better rating.

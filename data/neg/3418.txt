One of the worst hotel experiences I have had in a long time! The rooms were cold and the service was slow to non-existent! If I have to pay for a 4-Star Hotel, it would be nice to get 4-Star quality rather than 1-2 Star quality. I was there for a conference and we had to wear jackets and coats as the conference rooms as well as individual rooms were far to cold. If anyone is looking for an ideal conference facility, please look elsewhere!!!

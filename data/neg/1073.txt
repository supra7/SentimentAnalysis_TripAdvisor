I was stunned to walk into the hotel and see the nude photo right in front of me, and then a semi-phallic wallhanging to the left. The staff was pleasant, however. The elevator was barely big enough for 2 people with suitcases, and my heart sank when the door opened on the 3rd floor...8-foot ceilings, NARROW corridor, dark walls, and bizarre photo prints of some of Seattle's oddest citizens adorning each of the room doors. Our corner room with 2 double beds was extremely small, and faced the Federal Courthouse. I was dismayed to see a window air-conditioning unit instead of a more modern central air system. In order to sleep at night, we had to turn the unit on to block the street noises, but the airconditioner was so loud, even on the lowest setting, that my daughter had trouble sleeping. The bathroom had the tiniest sink I have ever seen - even smaller than the bar sink in my home! I had to contort myself to get down low enough to splash my face. The bathtub was clogged, and I had to get tell the hotel staff to fix it . They did so promptly. I was tempted to switch hotels, but the hassle factor was too great, so my daughter and I spent 2 nights at the Hotel Max, which is really a glorified flophouse despite the high price of rooms. The only good thing about this hotel is the location...6 blocks to Pike Place Market, 1 block to Nordstrom, plenty of coffee shops, etc. I would not stay here again unless the room prices were reduced to $150 a night.

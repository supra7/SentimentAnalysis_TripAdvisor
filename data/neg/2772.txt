!!!OMG!!! I had to go to Memphis (downtown) because I had to go to Lebonheur Hospital and this was the closest motel. I read the reviews, not good, but I took the chance anyway. The area is bad, there is a policeman parked at the hotel most of the time. I had a non smoking room (yeah right) the smell was horrible. The rugs dirty. And there were bugs (big bugs). We were scared every time we came in at night. The clerks were o.k. I guess (not to friendly). Breakfast (cereal and muffin, coffee and juice) nothing else. Next time I go to Memphis I will not stay here that is for sure.

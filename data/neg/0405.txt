The staff is really cordial and polite. If you stay here ask for a room that does not face te highway, because the windows are a single glass and it might be very noisy, specially during week mornings. The rooms are ok, but nothing extraordinary. If you have breakfast, maybe choose of the menu. The buffet has a lack of options and not as well prepared. Maybe choose somewhere else for the same rate.

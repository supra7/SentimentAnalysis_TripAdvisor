WE checked into the Edgewater and immediately was asked if you wanted an upgrade as they had booked up next to the street and the railroad tracks. We upgraded for $50 per night and was promised a large room but had to wait several hours. Went shopping and came back to a very small room on the water side. Had a balcony but the railing was so wobbley that was afraid to touch it, dangerous. Hotel is old with onlky a band-aid of an update. Staff was not friendly when asking directions. Altogether a BAD experience. Stay Away!!!!!

Had a bad experience - would not stay here again. The staff at the reception desk were cold and rude, room was unbelievably small, hairdryer did not work in room, and walls were paper thin. In addition, we received apathetic and rude treatment from a staff member at the luggage room when dropping our bags off for the day after checkout. To top it off, a charge for the hotel bar mysteriously appeared on my checkout bill when neither me or my traveling companion went there. In the end, the charge was taken off but it took about 30 minutes to do so. There are many, many hotels in downtown Chicago which are much better than the Palmer House. Stay elsewhere.

We arrived for 1 night stay before flying home. We were on the 26th floor with a pretty good view..Upon entering the room there was a huge iron burn in the middle of the floor. The room was spacious with plenty of nice floor to ceiling windows for the view. We dined in the restaurant where the service was wonderful and the food was decent. We returned up to our room to find us fighting with the Tv all night. I would not turn on/off change channels etc...We went to sleep. In the morning the Tv would not even turn on. I called down and they sent someone up...3 hours later they finished the Tv issue, our broken coffee pot, and a shower head spraying the entire bathroom were just the finishing touches. We had someone in our room from 7am unitl nearly 10am trying to fix all of the problems. It was time now for us to check out! Why no one thought to move us is beyond me...Relaxation, no not there. Updating, really needed. We got a free breakfast from the express captain but when we told the front desk of our disappointment and problems of the morning all we got was a "Oh I am sorry, would you like your receipt in an envelope??" I emailed the hotel upon returning home with our experience, no response to date. So I resent another saying there has been no response...Still none... Customer service/management really needs improvement. Beware if you encounter problems with your stay because their problems become yours.

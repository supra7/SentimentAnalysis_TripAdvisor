Though the location was OK, I would definitely not recommend this hotel. We had booked a non smoking room 4 weeks before arival, and when we arrived we have been told that the only room left was a smoking room, with an obscur explanation of problem with the booking agency. The desk services were poor, and we had to pay extra charge to be in a non smoking room. The rooms were supposed to be recently renewed, the bathroom was not. It was not very clean either. Don't go there !

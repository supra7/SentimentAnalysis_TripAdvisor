This is my second time staying at the hotel, didnt have any problems during my first stay. Thought that it was at a great location and the staff were very helpful. However, upon returning from my holiday i recieived an email from hotel management accusing me off under-paying for my stay and that I had been put on a 'black list'.. I had made a booking online and agreed to the price that I was notified of. However, when i got to the hotel, the receptionist charged me from a much lower price for the same room (I had not asked for any discounts). The hotel management did not bother to speak to me while I was still at the hotel, rather decided to email me with false accusations. I dont have any negative comments on the location nor services that are provided with the hotel. But I dont think I deserved these accusations when all I did was pay the amount that the receptionist had said to me...

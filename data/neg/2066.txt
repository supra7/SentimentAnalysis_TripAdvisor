My husband and I travel extensively on business throughout the US. We are in Vegas 2-3 times per year for various retail trade shows. We are not smokers or gamblers and thought that Trump Int'l would be perfect for us. Well the room is quite comfortable, however be prepared for the hidden costs. There is no self-parking only Valet thus be prepared to tip constantly. Although the in room kitchen is lovely, complimentary coffee is given to you only once. If you want more coffee, it will cost $6.00 per package which makes 2 cups. Toiletries are only replaced once. Please bring your own shampoo etc. For a five star hotel they are being very cheap. Why give me a sub zero refrigerator and charge me to brew coffee in the room? It doesn't make sense. We have stayed at various hotels on the strip and will not return here. I think the Venetian has better rooms, pool and amenities for the price. Sorry Donald.

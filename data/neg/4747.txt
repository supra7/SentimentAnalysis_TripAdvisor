We checked in and noticed a huge part of the carpet was soaking wet. When we called the front desk to report the problem, they basically accused us of making it happen by flooding the bathroom (granted we wouldn't have even had time to take a shower). They moved us to room #2 which smelled like an ashtray -- unacceptable. Again it seemed as this was OUR problem and not theirs. The Bellman was trying to be accommodating, however without the management's support it was not working. Room #3 was dry, didn't smell, but the TV wasn't working... Engineering came up to try and fix, still no apologies from management! We would have expected an upgrade or something at this point, but did not receive so much as an apology!!!! I would NEVER stay here again and recommend you don't either!!!!!!!

The facility was fine, but it is managed by folks which seem to think they are inn keepers in Pirates of the Caribbean. All of the exterior doors were locked and not even able to be opened from the inside in case of a fire. The north stairway was obstructed with furniture and storage items like breakfast boxes, microwaves, and small efficiency refrigerators, like a closet. Hello!? Ever heard of emergency exits for fires? I spoke to the manager, and he told me in his broken English that they locked the doors to keep out prostitutes and other criminals. Nice! EVEN THE LOBBY DOOR WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE DURING THE LATE HOURS, WHEN I VENTURED OUT TO MY VEHICLE! Once I raised holy Cain about this to get out, I saw why. There were prostitutes working the parking lot and they were of the most dreadful variety. I say this as a truck driver who has seem my share of true "Lot Lizards." The sleep was fine, the shower was pleasant. In the morning, I went to iron a shirt and it was ruined with the rust that poured out of the iron. The manager did not care when I explained the concerns. The Memphis Fire Department, however, sent an inspector IMMEDIATELY when I called. Look out for the hidden $1.50 charge for insurance and safe use, if you do not use it. This is a B.S. charge and I have to dispute it at check out at most hotels any more... If you'd like to die in a fire so your family can legitimately receive your life insurance and maybe some wrongful death suit income, stay here for a few days and hope for the best!

I can't understand why the high rating for this show. We bought preferred seats, which was close to $400 for the two adults and two kids. In return, we only had to line up for 30 minutes (as opposed to 1.5 hours for the regular ticket holders). Everybody is sitting at cheap looking tables (more like a roadside diner, rather than Hyatt Regency!!!). There is plenty of food and anyone can go for second or third. Selection was one of each: fish, pork and chicken, with vegetable, rice etc. I found everything boring and lacking flavour (although my husband liked the chicken). The show was on a small stage with a 5-member band and 10 dancers. The theme was South Pacific Islands - some part interesting, but I didn't find any of the dancers to be exceptional. Whatever little fun we had watching the dancers was completely robbed by the host and his cheesy Las Vegas style. bad-bad-bad! No authenticity and no focus. We saw the Old Lahaina Luau last year, and that was waaaaay better than the Hyatt Regency in every aspect. (Although their food was also a bit of a disappointment). Should have listened to the locals trying to convince us to chose a less marketed show for much less. The only positive is the open bar (if that's important for you), otherwise, either go to Old Lahaina or save money and go to a cheaper show.

The hotel is very impressive especially in the lobby area. Staff was very nice and efficient when we checked-in. We only stayed there for one night and we would not wish to stay longer. It was the last minute decision to stay there using Hotwire.com. We didn't want to pay $200-$300 per night in Chicago Downtown area for just one night. It was about $120 with tax. Pros: Centrally located in Downtown Chicago area. Cons: Business people oriented, very old hotel. Prepare traveling back to 1980s in the room. Don't expect anything. It had very thin walls. I woke up at 6AM because of a businesswoman talking on her cell phone.

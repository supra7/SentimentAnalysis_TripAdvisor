We had to go to Children's Hospital for our son and had 3 other children with us (4 in total). Booked both rooms MONTHS in advance. They didn't have the other room reservations, the showers were filthy, barely any towels, channels on the tvs were few. It was clearly seen that the cleaning service did the bare min. We had do not disturb signs on the doors and yet they felt the need to knock and try to get in. Next time we get a room at the Ronald Mc Donald house, there you have to help with some of the work but its much nicer to stay at and the people are nice to you!

I found out bit by bit that the room hadnt been cleaned properly. First I noticed the bathtub wasnt clean, then the closet, then the coffee maker. At night the room was really cold. The manager or owner phoned me 25 minutes before check-out time and tried to berate me, implying that I wouldnt leave on time without his harangue. The other staff are okay, but this guy has some weird ideas about customer relations. I wont be back.

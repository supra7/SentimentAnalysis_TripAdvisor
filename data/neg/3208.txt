This is what i experienced, Checked in late to the hotel, at the counter while the recept was attending to me, phone rang , she answered n made me wait for her for like 5 mins. Got into the so called executive suite, the room was really small for a suite. Wall papers starting to peel off from the wall. The room was super humid... Tv controller nowhere to be found. Called for help, they send up the tv controller n an engineer came to fix the aircon which later cause the false ceiling to have a huge crack. Told him to clean it up before he leaves. In his words " Tmrrow can? , housekeeping go home already n i got no broom". The next day, front desk called n confirmed with me a time at Re!fresh , their so called spa. only to get a call an hour later saying that they have to postpone my time due to them overlooking the appointment time. Got to the spa, only to have me wait for like 10 minutes more due to them have only 1 female therapist for my gf and that therapist was attending to someone.To summarise everything if u are thinking of hotel RE! for your future holiday or escape, forget it you'll have more fun at home.

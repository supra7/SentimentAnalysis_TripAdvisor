the only good thing was location. the staff was rude, unhelpful, and didn't have knowledge of the area. the tub had black foot prints upon arrival, the towels were old and ratty with holes in them, and the room had a musty smell. the TV only got a clear picture half the time on one channel. the bathroom sink was "movable" and the toilet was very small, had exposed pipes. no AC so had to sleep with the windows open and downtown Seattle is extremely noisy at night. only one attendant in the entire hotel at night. would not stay here again!!!!!!!!!!!
